review/text: I don't even like cinnamon but these chips are awesome!! These pita chips are super crunchy with just the right amount of sweetness. I have tried other cinnamon sugar pita chips but these are by far the BEST!! I'll agree that there isn't a large amount of chips in the bag but it's just enough to keep you from overdoing it. I absolutely recommend these!!

review/summary: Stacy's Pita Chips
review/text: Stacy's pita chips are a great snack food.  The cinnamon sugar is my favorite, but it must be a popular flavor because whenever I visit the stores from where I normally purchase the chips, they have every flavor but the cinnamon sugar. I can always count on Amazon as my source!  The chips are baked and all natural.  Very nice!

review/text: The Cinnamon & Sugar pita chips are the best in the whole "stacy's chips" family- they are so delicious! The only bad thing is that the bag is normal sized but when you open it up, there are only like 6 big chips in it. I guess that makes you eat less (hehe) but its also so annoying cuz i always want more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so so good buy them now :)

review/summary: Decent. Nothing more.
review/text: I try to eat healthy and shop around for tempting treats; well, in this case I stumbled upon Stacy's Pita Chips, Cinnamon Sugar and because of the reviews and my partiality to anything Cinnamon and Sugar I bit. The outcome was less than spectacular. I short, I ended up paying paying $22.00 + for a case of chips (24 bags in all) in which I really don't care for. Man, I always kick myself when this happens! Health food is so expensive and I'm stuck with something you'd only eat if you were at a vending machine and it was the only thing left there to buy. Honestly, it's not that Stacy's  Cinnamon & Sugar Pita Chips are nasty, it's just that they are to bland for my palate. Imagine dry Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal only on a baked Pita Chip and with much less of a Cinnamon and Sugar taste. Some people may like the more bland taste. I do not.

I have waited to review this until drinking it for a month. And after 4 weeks of of daily brewing...it still takes great, seems like very low acidity, and a very unique flavor that does not lend itself to the normal categories of cherries or chocolate etc. The price point did not bother me but the 30 dollar delivery charge seems out of range.

review/summary: Great high-value training treat
review/text: Use this instead of string cheese as it is a high-value treat, but does not get your fingers or pocket goooey (like regular cheese). Like the fact that there are no "extra" (read fake) ingredients. Some of the larger chunks are hard to break up, but generally can break each piece into 2 or 3 smaller pieces. Pieces are about 1" long and 1/2" wide. Also good for situations where you are throwing the treat into the grass (i.e. when training agility weaves) as the bright yellow color makes it easy for the dog to see.

review/text: My dog has long displayed a preference for cheese above nearly any other substance, so I was delighted when a friend gave him one of these as a Christmas gift.  He loved it!  This is a healthy treat (in moderation, of course) and allows you to give your dog cheese without treading in "human food" territory, which many of us try to avoid.  You can fulfill the craving while still maintaining some semblance of order....  This is a fantastic treat, definitely the best cheese-related dog snack I've come across yet.  Great job!

There are quite a few ingredients to be called a clear broth soup! Why add wheat and wheat gluten??? and  monosodium glutamate? Now I have to look up succinic acid, sodium citrate, disodium inosinate, and disodium guanylate. Looks like alot of sugar and salt. You can do better than this Kikkoman.  hmmm. Guess I will wait until I get home to have my home made veggie broth soup.

review/summary: Nice Mild & Sweet Cinnamon
review/text: This is a good mild and sweet ceylon cinnamon.<br />Anyways, i'm using it to lower blood sugar, i'm not diabetic but i'm trying to loose weight and by lowering blood sugar it helps regulate the insulin levels. A teaspoon of cinnamon a day lowered my blood sugar levels after eating a meal, i simply sprinkle it on my food or mix it in, it's mild enough that i sometimes don't even notice it's on my toast etc.<br />Higher insulin levels lead to less use of excess blood sugar (and sugar is stored in the body as fat), so a reduction in insulin after a meal is significant. If cinnamon can help control the level of blood sugar and, by offshoot, fat levels, then that is corroboration of what some have said regarding its weight loss potential.

review/text: I adore cinnamon and try different types and sources. Sadly, this cinnamon is tasteless. It is extremely dry [which I assume means it has very little actual "oil" in it]. Moreover, its texture is actually unpleasant. It feels as through the cinnamon bark has been "cut" with some tasteless, dry filler. Oddly, there is a mild clove aftertaste to this brand. That is not unpleasant but I prefer the spicy flavor of Saigon cinnamon, but that is a personal choice. I can't recommend this particular Ceylon cinnamon. Sorry.

review/text: I bought a pound of this a year and a half ago to use for baking and to sprinkle on my morning oatmeal.  It arrived quite fresh, unlike bottled spices, but the flavor is inherently less hot than the grocery store cinnamon I've always used.  I can use a lot more cinnamon at a time, but to get enough flavor I need to use at least a little more. My one-pound purchase is almost gone. I've decided that I like buying bulk cinnamon but next time, I'll get the hotter kind.

review/text: If you've been purchasing this product for awhile now, you've probably noticed that they've added quite a bit more gravy to the product and less meat.  So does the cat!  Mine used to eat this and actually liked it quite a bit but since there's less meat now, they must have done something else too because he will hardly even look at it.  Maybe once a month he'll choke it down but more than that, forget it.  These are pretty pricey but if you have an ocean fish fanatic in your house, then by all means try it.  If not, you might try Friskies ocean fish in the shredded variety.  Mine LOVES that one.  Recommend because of the quality but again, it's up to your cat regarding the taste.

review/text: This deal was no deal. I ended up paying twice what it would have cost me at the store. The ad said pack of 4. I took that to mean 4 boxes. I recieved one box and it cost me with shipping more than double than it would have cost me to go to the store to get it. I like the food and so do my cats, but i can't afford the cost they charge for this item.

review/summary: I love these chips!
review/text: Crunchy and delicious. Not too salty. Not too much rye. Not too much garlic. A perfect blend and a great little snacking size. The chips stay fresh and crispy for a long time. These are better than the rye crisps you dig out of the Gardettos mix. You will LOVE these! I grew up in Wisconsin, where these are made, and these are the best. Not just an adult taste. Kids will love them too! Try them, you'll like them.

review/summary: Tamarind balls are great but this product, from Importfood, are HORRIBLE!!!
review/text: I LOVE tamarind balls, sweet and tart like other's have described. HOWEVER DO NOT GET THESE FROM IMPORTFOODS. I wouldn't get these type at all no matter what company. Importfoods is bad because they did not bother to return my emails until I was forced to leave them a bad review on Amazon. And even then they ignored my request for a partial refund. I had FOOLISHLY decided to order this product in bulk and had paid them a lot of money.<br /><br />I did this because I had tried so many brands of tamarind balls and loved them all. Some more than others but all that I tried were good.<br /><br />These were the sad exception. They tasted EXTREMELY stale and salty, YUCK! The ones that Importfoods sent were covered in dust. So I'm sure they were stale. But the seller is only part of the problem. This BRAND really is inferior. It's full of stale sugar and salt and quite gritty. Barely any tamarind at all. So no wonder it tasted gritty, stale, with barely any fruit.<br /><br />It also had a weird burnt/molasses- like aftertaste. More just burnt than molasses.<br /><br />I'm leaving this review because there were no negative reviews,to warn me when I purchased these. Buyer Beware!!!

review/summary: Really low quality product
review/text: Tamarined Candy is amazing. No doubt about it. However,the quality of Tamarind candy sold by Ur Asian Store is deplorable. I ordered 1 3.5 oz box and 2 4 oz boxes of Tamarind candy and instead received 3 boxes of 4 oz Tamarind candy. No problem there. Unfortunately, the candies themselves were old, stale, and worthy of my condemnation. There was no date label on any of the three boxes so I don't know how old they were, but I felt like I was consuming Candies that were years past their "best by" date. After tasting 2-3 from each box I had to throw all three boxes away. My only hope now is that I will not get sick from eating these expired Tamarind Candies.<br /><br />I strongly recommend anyone interested in buying Tamarind Candy to get it from any retailer other than Ur Asian Store here on Amazon.

review/summary: Salsa of the Month was Great!
review/text: I just received The Salsa of the Month Club package and everything was great!  I was excited to try two new salsas from different specialty companies that I would've never been able to try.  They arrived in a sturdy box with foam packing peanuts.  I admit that I was a little nervous that they wouldn't arrive safely, but the glass jars were completely fine.  They were even accompanied by a newsletter giving some background about the salsas and the companies who made them.  They both looked so good, it was hard to decide which one to open first!  My wife and I decided to open the Pink's Mild Salsa from Pennsylvania to accompany our fajitas that we were making for dinner.  It was bold, fresh and made with minimal ingredients and also contained no allergens.  Medically, my wife has to follow a Gluten Free diet, so we are always concerned with allergens and trying to eat foods closer to nature.  A few days later we opened the second salsa (after scraping the first jar dry) and were equally impressed!  The second jar was a Picante Salsa from Hillside Orchard farms in Georgia and was very flavorful and had some visibly large cilantro pieces (my favorite), but was not as chunky as the other one.  This one was great to pour over tacos, as it had more of a sauce consistency, but it was a little harder to pick up with a chip.  Overall, I was very satisfied and I'm looking forward to next month's salsas!  This was the perfect gift for us and would highly recommend the Salsa of the Month Club!

review/summary: Whiskas needs to  offer more one-flavor box -packs
review/text: My cat is a Whiskas seafood cat, preferring this brand over anything else, excepts Iams crunchies.<br /><br />However, she is a normal cat (or kid in a cat-suit?) - she likes what she likes, and she won't eat what she doesn't like.<br /><br />Her favorites by far are the salmon - she could eat this "forever", then the shrimp.<br />She tolerates the tuna, or tuna and white fish on a good day.<br /><br />Sardine and Mackerel - - quality seems to very. Some days she is excited to get it, but lately she tries to bury it!<br /><br />Snapper - whatever Whiskas is doing to this - - this has been a consistent - "don't even think of serving me 'that'!" - flavor.<br /><br />After raising two other cats til their late senior years, who were happy on another brand, I've learned from my three that they either seem to like seafood, or the chicken-turkey types, or the beef types. None of my three liked beef. The other two - one liked seafood selections, and the other liked the poultry ones.<br /><br />Maybe it has to do with where the breed originated???? My Tiger-Savannah loved the poultry but the Persian-Siamese, and now my Russian Blue like seafood.<br /><br />TO DICE, CUT UP, MINCE OR NOT? The other thing that has been "consistent" with all three - they prefer something that looks like a slab of "meat" vs. diced up, gravied, or minced. They all want and wanted their food to look real and not cut up for them.<br /><br />I've called Whiskas and they recommended Amazon for the individual flavors. I just didn't see salmon as an option. May just switch and start making my own cat food vs. wasting more food....

review/summary: Best for my cat - and no cans to deal with!
review/text: My calico cat loves the Whiskas Choice Cuts in gravy.  She's not a fan of ground food.  The Whiskas envelopes bought in the Poultry and Seafood variety packs give her a varied selection that keeps her interested.  The only problem now is availability.  The past 4 months I've had to buy elsewhere or get some other brand because amazon has stopped stocking them regularly.  I was buying the 48 pack of each at a time, but they've been out of stock on one or the other, I'm wondering why.  They have the seafood now, but only 1 left.  I signed up for Amazon prime because of ordering the catfood every 6 weeks here.  I don't understand why Amazon is dropping it.

This is the base note for proper tempura dipping sauce (also known as tentsuyu).

review/text: Bentley's Unflavored White Tea used to be the best white tea ever. Subtle delicious flavor. They used to have the green labels back then. When they moved to the black labels, the quality went down. Now they have a third version with a new black label, which is even worse. It takes two bags to make a cup and the taste is no where near the original. I've tried writing to Bentley and have had no response from them. I'm cancelling my subscription.

If you're looking for good tea and don't care about the containers, go ahead and order, but if you are hoping to use the tins to store and serve the tea bags, pick it up in a store, unless/until Amazon learns how to ship these tins with more protection for shipping.

review/text: I bought Bentley's Oriental Treasure White Tea a couple of years ago and was amazed at the delicious flavor and subtle aroma.  I coveted my tin and only used a bag on occasion to make it last.  Then I found Bentley's tea here on Amazon.  I enthusiastically ordered two tins!  I wish I hadn't.  This is NOT the same tea I had previously.  I have to agree with the reviewer who noticed a terrible change in the tea's quality along with a change in the label color.  This second batch of tea smelled like weeds, not tea.  The flavor is so aweful that it even ruins other teas if you blend them together.  Shame on you Bentley's for allowing such a load of crap to leave your company disguised as tea in your pretty little tins.  I won't buy Bentley's tea again.

review/summary: Tasty 110 Calories. Melt in the Summer. Fairly inexpensive.
review/text: Having lost 15 lbs in the past 2 months on a low-carb diet, I have tried a number of brands of low carb meal-replacement bars and snacks. These Special K Protein Snack Bars taste pretty good to me, along the lines of a candy bar with peanut buttery flavor.<br /><br />At 110 calories and fully vitamin fortified, these are a little higher in in sugars than I would like. Each has 4g of protein and 3.5g fat. During the weight-loss phase of my diet, I eat 1/2 of these bars for a morning and afternoon snack. In the summer, these are prone to melting in my bag.<br /><br />The South Beach Whipped Chocolate Almond bar is a similar low-carb snack bar (less peanut-buttery) that tastes better, but it is not vitamin fortified (so they don't have to cover over the taste of all of those ingredients).<br /><br />I recommend trying any new product in a small size to make sure you like it and are not sensitive to any of the ingredients before going hog-wild on a larger quantity...<br /><br />These tend to be a little cheaper than the other low-carb, chocolate-based snacks and meal-replacement bars that I have purchased at big-box stores. (See my other reviews.)

review/text: This is the original blend from Starbucks and it's not sold in all areas. For those of us who can't get to a Costco or find a store that carries this, this is a perfect find. This is a purchase from the Costco stores, you get two tins in each order and each tin is 2.5 lbs.<br /><br />Though a bit pricey this is a much better mix than you can find in the average grocery aisle amd it makes great mocha's and cocoas.

review/text: I received this item in a shipment of other items ordered from this store. I order black fungus or tree ear mushroom quite often. I know how they are suppose to look. This product looked like it had been ran over by a steam roller and reduced to crumbs and powder. I will be returning this for a refund. The package was shipped in a good protective box. so i know it was shipped in this condition. I would have never fulfilled an order that looked like this.

review/text: I found this "dried black fungus" on an "oddest items available through Amazon list"  and ordered a package as a gag gift for a friend. Unfortunately, the bag which arrived is not the same as the photo in the listing, and doesn't say "Dried Black Fungus." I can't say whether the dried mushroom strips (?) the bag contains are any good, but I would suggest only ordering this product if you intend to eat it- not because of the humorous packaging.

review/summary: Chicken of the Sea Sardines
review/text: I used to buy the 3.5oz Chicken of the Sea Sardines that cost around $!. When I saw this 15oz for about $2 a can I decided to try it because of the savings. The sardines inside were bigger and did not taste the same as the 3.5oz. The 3.5oz sardines were a lot smaller and you just open the can and eat it with bread or crackers. The 15oz I tried eating as is but the sardines had a fishy taste. I then sauteed it in garlic and onions and came out tasting very good.

review/summary: yuck!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Adagio teas and of their Rooibos tea and this was DISGUSTING. I was so disappointed. I was expecting a smooth, sweet, creamy treat and - well, yuck!<br /><br />It literally tastes like something your doctor gives you to drink before a colonoscopy or some sort of medical procedure involving a radioactive scan. I couldn't drink more than two sips of it and it turned me off from tea for a few days.<br /><br />Unless you are a hardcore fan of chocolate tea and Rooibos tea, skip it. I love tea and I love chocolate (I love both in an obsessive way- can't get enough of either) but they just don't go well. It sounds like they would, but unless you *know* you enjoy chocolate teas, skip this one.<br /><br />Blech!

review/text: This is excellent oregano and the only kind I like to use for my Italian dishes as well as Mexican, Spanish, Portuguese etc. 'Mediterranean' dishes. The thing that sets Mediterranean oregano apart from other varieties of oregano is the intense oregano flavor and aroma without the bitterness.<br /><br />Bulk purchases like this will last a very long time if you vacuum seal your product and keep it in a dark place away from light sources.<br /><br />Definitely worth the investment if you cook a lot and love oregano (plus, it's good for you too)! :)

review/summary: Intoxicating Oregano.
review/text: If you love oregano, you L-O-V-E oregano. You use it more and more in everything. It becomes a counter top necessity, at least to me. I rehydrate a couple teaspoons and toss it in salad, and everything else I can. So when I was offered  a pound of the stuff I balked, because I thought I'd never use a full pound. Well, it arrived in a shiny sealed bag. I opened it and it smelled wonderful. I filled two quart jars for storage and still have a half bag. So, I'm bagging pint size portions and distributing it among my friends, and cat, who loves rolling in a handful of it.

review/text: I often eat these as a snack before or after dinner. The pistachios are nice and meaty, not dry, lightly salted (just the right amount) and most are easy to open. For those that are "closed", which is not the majority, I just use a nut cracker. These are the most delicious and best quality pistachio nuts that I have eaten.<br /><br />Kirkland is the Costco brand name. I currently buy these at my local Costco for about sixteen dollars, which is much less than the current price on Amazon with shipping.

review/summary: Great snack for a low carb diet - only 80 Cal.
review/text: I am fat, but I'm currently trying to change that. Not being a body builder I wondered if this product was for me, and I was very happy with the results. I keep these with me on days that I can't prepare a meal or when I am tired of my diet food and want something that has a little more hearty flavor. Caveat is: just like turkey-jerky, if you didn't know you were eating ostrich you might think that it tastes a bit different. Keep in mind that ostrich tastes more like chicken than beef.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Compact (will fit in cargo pocket)<br />Tasty<br />Fairly low salt<br />Semi-Moist (good or bad depending on your taste)<br />80 calories<br />Great for diets<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Hard to open sometimes<br />A bit large to fit in pocket (won't fit in standard pants pocket)<br />Co-workers think you are weird to eat Ostrich<br />A little expensive<br /><br />So, with all that said, I keep a box of these in my cupboard at all times just in case I need a snack and I don't want to go off-diet. Buy a box and see what you think.
