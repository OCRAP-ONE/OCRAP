review/text: Hi. I absolutely LOVE my Badia Complete. I've been trying to find it for 3 years. Anyway, my diet has changed since then, so I was a little sad to see that it contained MSG. (Monosodium Glutamate) Not a good thing. :( But it does have a wonderful flavor.

review/text: I love wasabi peas, but they are a bit strong.  The World Peas Hungarian Garlic (though I like all of the flavors) are tasty with a great real garlic taste and so much better than your regular wasabi pea.  I have found that a lot of wasabi peas are made with all kinds of artificial ingredients and are full of MSG, these are all natural.  As a side note, after eating a few handfuls I discovered they are actually good for you, so no guilt.

I like that they are healthy and when you get to the bottom of the bag there is not any messy seasoning that gets all over your hands like with peanuts.  A portion of the profits go to a great cause and the bag can be recycled.  Great new innovation!

review/summary: Somebody please stop me
review/text: I cannot stop eating these things. At first I was a bit underwhelmed by the amount of seasoning on almost all flavors. Probably because my point of reference is chili peas that I get locally from Big Lots which are pretty spicy. I couldn't stop eating these though and they got better with each tasting. I would be ashamed to say how many peas I have eaten in the last 24 hours. I expected to like these, so i ordered all of the flavors and the unexpected standout was Bombay Curry. It's just so true to the actual flavor. Also, there are a LOT of peas in these bags. It's a great product. UPS screwed up but I'm not going to factor that in to this review.

review/text: I was already a fan of the BBQ, and then I bought the bacon and the curry - so good!  They are such an easy, guilt free snack, and I put bowls of each out at a party - next to appetizers I had been cooking all day - and they were the first things to go - why did I cook?  The flavors are interesting and complex and actually made for party talk.  The next weekend, I threw bags into the car for a road trip with a few friends - again a hit.  HUGE fan of the peas in general and loving these new flavors!

review/summary: An Awesome Twist on a Thanksgiving Favorite!
review/text: I ... like so many others who observe Thanksgiving, think that the holiday simply isn't complete without a slice of pumpkin pie.  And while it is one of the healthier desserts out there (well, I like to think it is, anyway, because of the pumpkin), it is still not at all what I'd consider healthy or low fat or low calorie.<br /><br />But ... this is the perfect alternative to those who feel guilty after indulging in a slice of pumpkin pie.  THIS is pumpkin pie without the guilt!  It has the flavor of Matcha in it (of course), but also the sweet, delicious, rich and savory taste of pumpkin, a touch of cinnamon, and the buttery taste of pastry in there.  So yummy!<br /><br />I recommend trying this one as a latte.  I used a 1:1 ratio here, using 1 part hot water to 1 part warmed milk.  This helped bring out the creaminess of the pumpkin pie, and also brought out the pastry notes as I had a hard time tasting them without the milk.<br /><br />Scrumptious!

review/summary: Best as a Latte
review/text: When I opened the pouch and sniffed I was very pleased because it smelled spicy, but also richly creamy-pumpkin. But you often can't tell what something is going to taste like from its dry smell, and that seems to be the case here. For this first tasting I prepared the matcha with just hot water (then added a little sugar later). I got almost no froth when whisking this one, which has to be an effect of the flavoring somehow. It smelled very clovey when prepared, that really is the dominant aroma.<br /><br />The flavor of the matcha when prepared straight is pretty subtle, but improved when sugar is added. When is really shines, however, is in latte form.  The thing about pumpkin pie is that it's creamy and sweet, so adding more creamy and sweet elements really brings out the pumpkin pie flavor. I will definitely really enjoy drinking it this way this fall.

review/text: So frothed up on its own (no additions) it was quite spicy. Well, not spicy hot but tasted a lot like spices! The pumpkin was definitely in the smell though, so I knew it was a pumpkin tea and not just a spice tea!<br /><br />Of course, what's a pumpkin pie matcha without a latte? This is where the tea did SHINE! I frothed up the matcha with a bit of brown sugar then added about � cup warm water. I then heated up the rest of my Vanilla Almond milk, added it and topped the cup with a healthy helping of whipped cream - oh mama! The brown sugar brought out the sweet pumpkin flavour - I could even taste a bit of crust! I love when that happens.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this tea as a hot latte on a crisp fall day in your cutest flannel and plaid scarf. You can add in some friends to share, or be like me and keep it all to yourself.

review/summary: Okay, better than "eh."
review/text: Maybe I don't have as rich a pallet as the others that have reviewed this tea, but it did nothing for me. It was very bland on the pumpkin side. Just matcha to me. I added some cream and sugar, and ended up having to add a lot for me to get it down. For me, if I'm adding more than three spoonfuls of sweetener, the tea is just too bland for me.<br /><br />I was actually really excited for this tea. I expected something really rich and decadent and a "kick in the mouth" kind of flavor. I had high expectations when I opened it, it smelled really delicious and I was excited, but I ended up just pouring my cup out and setting my packet up on the self. Maybe I was making it wrong? Maybe I added two much water...<br /><br />Well, I'll be trying again until it runs out, but I wouldn't buy it again. I wish they had a smaller trial size that wasn't twenty dollars...<br /><br />EDIT: I gave it two stars at first, but I'm raising it to four. Four and a half if I could. I was making it wrong and with a good shifting of the powder and a good shifting of the tea it's self, plus some sugar and cream, the tea is quite, dare I say it, "delicious." Even decadent. Now that I know how to make it correctly, I'd certainly buy another, larger portion. So just be careful of the directions, unlike yours truly.

review/summary: Smooth pumpkin pie without the calories!
review/text: Ok, I have to start by saying that I love Thanksgiving!  That is because I love that you can get so many pumpkin things at this time of year.  For one month I get to indulge on pumpkin flavored everything!  Then I have 11 long months of waiting for companies to bring out the pumpkin again!  And let me tell you, I overload myself so much on pumpkin that I'm ready for it to end.  That only lasts about a month before I'm craving pumpkin things again.  SO, that is why I just HAD To order the Pumpkin Pie Matcha from Red Leaf.  I'm hoping that they'll keep this flavor around and not just have it available in the fall.<br />I really wasn't quite sure how I wanted to prepare this the first time.  I opened this matcha and got a cloud full of heavenly pumpkin spices.  I put it into a tin to keep it fresh but I doubt that it'll stay there for very long.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I decided to prepare this matcha as a latte with warm milk.  I heated up 10oz of milk on the stove and then used my frother to create foam.  I then added the matcha and whisked the latte....finishing off with another round with the frother.  This matcha was very smooth.  I think the milk really complimented it well and made it taste just like a pumpkin pie!  This was so good that I don't think I want to prepare it any other way.  I think it needs the milk to take it to the next level.  To get your own tasty Pumpkin Pie Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]

review/summary: Warm and rich and pumpkin-y
review/text: It's pumpkin. It has to be good. Alone, sort of shot-style, it's spicy, not like hot-spicy but like pumpkin spice spice-y. I stir it into hot milk and then it's creamy and pumpkin-y. Overall it's hella better than green tea and hella healthier if what they're telling me is true. Absolutely rivals the pumpkin spice latte in my opinion due to the fact that it is creamier, lower calorie, and much healthier. I've tried two of the other matchas (the berry and the caramel) and this one is better than both to me, however I am a sucker for pumpkin and just finished a big container of roasted salted pepitas from Lowes Foods in three days. When I make it, I pour about a quarter cup of milk into a mug and heat it in the microwave for about twenty seconds, and then whisk a half teaspoon of the matcha powder into it with a fork. Then I fill the mug the rest of the way up with milk and add about a half teaspoon of sugar (naughty, I know, considering plain green adds no calories or sugar to my diet) and then heat it up. It's very warm and cozy but different from a cocoa and healthier than cocoa, which is a good switch for me because I really go for my cocoa in the wintertime.<br /><br />Here's the stuff. It's worth a shot. At the worst you get some hot rich anti-oxidants. But it's really good. It's pumpkin, how could it be bad.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: A Fabulous Frothy Dessert-Pumpkin Pie Matcha
review/text: I had some excitement at my mailbox yesterday when I found my package from Red Leaf tea and I knew my  Pumpkin Pie matcha had arrived. There was a bit of fall in the air and I love pumpkin pie, so I had high expectations.  I opened the packet and immediately knew I was going to like it, since the scent was delicious. I decided to make a chilled latte, so I mixed a teaspoon of the matcha with 2 oz hot water and whisked it until it had some froth. I then put it in a shaker with 15 oz unsweetened almond milk, a splash of cream, and some sweetener. Added a few ice cubes, and Wow, fantastic!! Pumpkin pie without so many calories. I am amazed at how well it captures the real thing. A fabulous frothy dessert.

review/summary: A delicious pumpkin treat!
review/text: It's fall, and you know what that means .. TRY ALL THE PUMPKIN THINGS! In all serious, I'm not a pumpkin fanatic, but I do enjoy indulging in the various pumpkin related offerings this season, especially pumpkin pie.<br /><br />When I first opened the package the smell was AMAZING! It didn't taste artificial at all and instantly evoked memories of Thanksgiving dinner for me.<br /><br />I knew this had to be enjoyed hot, so I brought out the gear. I whisked it up, added some milk, and took a sip. And man oh man, is this delicious. The pumpkin pie flavors really pop, especially the cinnamon. I think the spices are a little more pronounced than the actual pumpkin flavor, but it's a delicious and yummy treat.  I even added sweetener to kick it up a notch and it certainly did.<br /><br />All in all, a fantastic desert  and a lot less guilt after having this than a regular pumpkin pie.

review/summary: Spicy tasty pumpkin pie tea!
review/text: Out of the package, this matcha smells strongly like spicy whole cloves with a bit of sweetness.<br /><br />Prepared as a traditional hot matcha, (1/2tsp of matcha powder whisked with 175f water) the spices are very present over top a pumpkiny mellowness. Slightly sweet in flavor as well. I'd call this more of a "Spicy Pumpkin Matcha" than pumpkin pie. I did not detect any bitterness in this matcha. Overall not bad if you are in the mood for spicy fall flavors.<br /><br />Now, this is where Red Leaf's matchas shine - in latte form! I'm doing a iced latte as it is too hot in SoCal right now. I used soymilk, ice, pumpkin pie matcha and a bit of sweetener shaked up in a blender bottle. The result: very amazing flavoring! I can taste the pumpkin pie spice more as a whole, with a bite of spicy cloves and ginger that linger in my mouth after drinking. The pumpkin is present and my brain is making me almost sense the smushy texture of the pie as a I drink this latte. The green tea is in the background and tasty.

review/summary: My oh my, pumpkin pie!
review/text: My first hot matcha in God knows how long. Summer just doesn't lend itself to hot drinks, I'm more likely to just my matcha with cold water and blend vigoriously. But this one was just crying out to be made hot...so I'm taking it to work with me today (all I ever do anymore is work). Well after a day straight from hell, this tea was sorely needed. After yet another patient called in to yell at whoever was unfortunate enough to answer the phone (aka me), I decided to take a break. I found a quiet corner and curled up with Hunger Games and this beauty of tea.<br /><br />It tastes exactly as advertised! I really did feel like I was drinking a hot cup of pumpkin pie...yum. So much yum. I'm not the biggest pumpkin pie fan, but it's grown on me in recent years. But I am a huge fan of pumpkin lattes, at least I was, so this is definitely going to be mixed with soy milk next time. And cheesecake matcha. And french vanilla matcha. The possibilities are endless! This has made me eager for Thanksgiving and my signature pumpkin pound cake. I wonder how that would taste with a matcha icing...

review/text: Nothing makes me love fall more then pumpkin pie. When I saw this I ordered it right away. Its great it tastes just like your eating a piece of pumpkin pie. This is a bit heavier on the cloves but you can still taste the pie sweetness, its still tastes amazing. And the matcha isn't put on the back burner while the pumpkin shines. You taste the pie but also the matcha which is perfect!<br /><br />I think everyone should try this for a lovely fall drink. Made this into a hot latte delicious!

Don't buy the small tin, because you are going to want to drink this all the time this fall and winter!

review/summary: Fall in a Cup!
review/text: This is the 4th Red Leaf matcha I've tried, and my favorite so far! The flavors are perfectly pie-y: clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and of course pumpkin! It is JUST like a warm slice of pumpkin pie. Of course, the flavoring doesn't overshadow the nice, grassy matcha at all. They compliment each other perfectly, heavy dense pumpkin and light summery frothy matcha. This is best as a hot latte with a bit of sugar, such a nice treat.

review/summary: My new Fall beverage staple!
review/text: With the start of September I have been craving autumnal flavors, especially pumpkin.  Upon opening the package, pumpkin pie flavoring filled my nose.  It was AMAZING!  It smelled exactly like a spiced pumpkin pie was sitting in my kitchen.<br /><br />I immediately made this into a cold latte based on the delicious smell alone.  Two ounces of warmed water blended with the pumpkin pie matcha, a smidge of sugar and a healthy 6 ounces of icy-cold milk later, I found myself speechless!  After downing the entire cup in record time, I must admit I really want another one!  This is Fall in a cup!<br /><br />In this particular flavor - pumpkin pie - the spices are rich!  Cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg - they all mingle with the pumpkin without overpowering it.  It sort of reminds me of the Starbucks Pumpkin Pie coffee lattes I used to look forward to around this time of year.  I loved them so much I'd try recreating them at home.  Well now, I don't have to!  There's a much healthier version right here without the added sugar.<br /><br />This will not last me very long.

review/summary: NOT SPICY JUST FLAT
review/text: I was disappointed with this product because I have had David Rio's Chai Tea Mix before with sugar and expected the same great taste. This was a little flat and did not have the strong spice flavor I expected. I love the Spicy Chai tea and was looking forward to one that was sugar free and this did not come up to my standard. I had to put more mix into the glass than was recommended to get any real taste out of it, thus making it more expensive. If you want a spicy Chai tea like they serve in coffee and tea shops this one is not one you would want to buy.

review/text: There's a cafe in Midtown NY I go to that uses this brand of Chai mix. Really happy that I was able to go this as it'll save me money in the long run!<br /><br />In terms of taste, I really like the fact that this kind of Chai has more flavor - due to it being 'spiced'. As well, I recommend using whole milk with it as it'll give the chai more of a body. Water works just as well, but the taste underneath is slightly different. If you're one to not care much about that then just use what you like. (As an aside, I like the taste of this more than the Starbucks Chai latte if you need a comparison.)

There are about 18 snakes per package, each snake is two-tone in clear, bright colors and about 4.5 inches long.  They have two little eyes and a squiggly line up the back.  I expected them to be softer, but found them a little tough and chewy.  They taste great, though and my 8 year old enjoyed them so I suppose that is the truest test!

review/text: I was so disappointed with the flavor of La Truffiere truffle oil. Just does not have a quality taste in my opinion. The olive oil was just too heavy, took over the truffle taste and it seemed to coat the inside of my mouth, and stayed that way for a very long time.  I feel like I wasted my money. I have had La Tourangelle infused white truffle oil and really loved it. The base of it was organic sunflower oil and it was very lite. I decided to try a different brand just to see the difference, I will not do that again, I will go back to La Tourangelle infused white truffle oil, as it had such a lovely taste.

I was worried my software dvd would be broken, but it wasn't..<br /><br />fortunately none of the cans burst, though some definitely look close to it, paint is shaved off the cans in spots...<br /><br />Long story short i somehow got all my stuff and its "okay" - i don't mind, to much the blunder, certainty not enough to really contact anyone for.<br /><br />I just wanted to make other consumers aware that if you purchase this here on amazon, you like me, very well might get without pulp instead of with pulp...  And the shipping might be hazardous i definitely wouldn't order anything fragile with it again...<br /><br />the without pulp tastes okay-good, i'm a little new to coconut water, but this stuff seems just right...  sweet but not like a can of soda sweet, and watery not thick. It has some flavor but maybe not as much as a real, fresh, from the store coconut - or maybe I'm just missing the pulp -_-;<br /><br />i really am stunned at the condition of the box - this is the first order from amazon that has been... bad...  Generally my stuff is packaged well with some level of care and thought put into it...  This was just throw order into box/ship.

review/text: This is the best coconut water I have tasted. It's actually better in the glass bottle but for canned, this is the best I know. I have tried about 8 different brands. I was inspired to search out a good brand after having a fresh coconut water in Hawaii at a Thai restaurant. I love this beverage. Great for before and after running. Better than a diet coke, coke, gatorade, beer, wine, etc., for you. So don't nail bite about the sugar like the other reviewer. It's all relative. Instead, cut out the unatural processed sugary crap you're eating. This has so many nutritional benefits. Potassium per serving is out of this world. This is great for women around their "lady time" when potassium levels go low causing cramps. Ralph's and Mother's sells single bottles. Try it there and see what you think.

review/text: These delicious little nuggets are so yummy- everyone in my house fights over them, humans and chinchillas alike (they were bought for the chins until the humans realized that they were so good). I love dried fruit, especially pineapple, but it doesn't satisfy the need for crunchy snacks the way this does, and it is hard to find dried pineapple without sugar added to it. Usually freeze dried fruit has a powdery texture/taste, but this is different tasting - similar to those 'dried' banana chips that are actually fried and worse for you than potato chips. Crunchy-n-Yummy has a taste that makes you sure that they are lying about it being sugar free and simply dried-but it really is just dried pineapple, and one of the best snacks I have tried in a long time.

At only 100 calories per 1 ounce serving, you get the great taste and nutrition of a full serving of fruit in packs that you can have on the go!<br /><br />This snack is all natural - just 100% sun ripened and freeze dried pineapple. The pineapples are certified USDA organic.  All Crunchy N Yummy fruits are produced under the most eco friendly conditions.  Even the water that is removed from the fruits during drying is returned to the farms for growing new crops!<br /><br />Crunchy N Yummy products contain no preservatives and no artificial whatchamacallits!

"Crunchy N Yummy" is imported from Bolivia and is kosher and gluten-free.  It has a very good taste mixing both sweet and tart.  It also has a great satisfying crunch.  It contains 100 calories per one-ounce package.  I highly recommend this freeze-dried pineapple snack.

Everyone in the house found it nasty tasting.  Yuck, $31.00 down the drain.  Gave it one star, because it was the lowest I could give.

I hardly noticed the flavor because the texture was so awful.<br /><br />There is another dried pineapple product brand called Made in Nature that is excellent, so I suggest you buy that instead. Their product is moist and chewy and delicious.

Either it didn't lend itself well to iced, or it's not strong enough.  Of course, we just added more coffee, we brewed it strong, and that took care of it. Even brewing for your normal morning brew, it needs just a hair more (about a scoop more) to make it come alive.<br /> Another pretty decent deal, under $20 for 3lbs, within reason for quality flavored coffees.<br />Oh, and those iced coffee's on the deck in the evening....are relaxingly wonderful.

Solidification happens to even the most delicious of peanut butters... but with Earth Balance (that has the extra boost of healthy flax seed), it stays shelf stable. It doesn't become nastily chunky, nor is there the usual layer of oil.<br /><br />Earth Balance is EXCELLENT in Thai peanut dressings (like the one in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/097221643X">Easy Cooking The Costco Way: Favorite Recipes using Costco Products</a>),in stir fries, or even straight from the jar!

review/summary: Best Peanut Butter!
review/text: This is the first natural peanut butter I found that doesn't need to be refrigerated. I bought different PB brand each time, as long it's organic/natural, for my super picky eater son. Turned out this product also containing good stuff such as flax seed and agave syrup. I personally never like any kind of peanut, but this peanut butter is so tasty I don't mind eating it too. Besides, the flax seed helps to lower bad cholesterol and I suppose agave syrup is better than other sweetener. I don't think if it's really beneficial for health but it is said to be 3 times as sweet as table sugar, meaning it takes less to sweeten, meaning less calorie.<br /><br />All pros, no cons for me, and my son does not complain. This is going to be my last search of the perfect peanut butter. I have found Earth Balance natural creamy peanut butter to be it.

review/summary: Very Nice Tahini
review/text: I use tahini primarily to make hummus dip for fresh vegetables and pita bread.  This is a fresh tahini paste (vs roasted) with a fresh nutty-sesame flavor.  This tahini is more liquid than other tahini that I have purchased.  You may need to adjust your hummus ingredients to use less liquid to get the consistency you prefer.  The current price point of $5.00/lb ($30 for 6 pounds) is OK (previously very reasonably priced from $3.00 to $3.79 per pound.) In addition, 6 pounds is a huge quantity for me despite my liking for hummus.<br /><br />Hummus can be prepared in 5 minutes in a food processor if you start with canned or cooked chick peas. You may need to stir the tahini before using as it tends to separate. Start with 1 clove garlic; chop and then mince in the food processor; add a 15 oz can (drained,reserve liquid) chick peas, 1/3 cup tahini, 1/3 cup olive oil. Mix and process at high speed until smooth; adjust thickness with reserved liquid as needed.  Add seasonings such as salt, pepper, cummin or lemon juice to taste.<br /><br />Whether you call it tahini or tahina, this sesame seed paste is also used to make halvah, a  candy and debis which is the Middle East  version of peanut butter and jelly.<br /><br />This product: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2CW">Al Wadi Tahina, 100% Ground Sesame, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: The best raw tahini I've ever had
review/text: This is the best raw tahini I've ever had -- and I've tried many brands. It does have a very strong "raw tahini" flavor however, which some people may not like. But this strong flavor was exactly what I was looking for. Unlike one reviewer, I found little bitterness in this tahini -- I'd say it is far less bitter than the average raw tahini. If you want a mild tahini, go with a roasted one, not a raw one. But if you want a traditional tahini for traditional Middle Eastern dishes, I strongly recommend this one.<br /><br />I've used this tahini in hummus, baba ghannouj, sauce for falafel, and sesame noodles. The results have been fantastic with the tahini flavor coming through in the final product, whereas other tahinis you can barely taste.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, this tahini is more liquidy than other tahinis, no doubt due to a higher oil content, so you may have to cut back on the other liquids or oils in the recipe.

All my jars arrived okay, although the plastic wrapping around the jars was a little greasy to the touch (I just washed it away with a little warm water and soap). Unopened, I believe these jars can be stored unrefrigerated, but I refrigerate mine anyway just to be safe. I use this tahini mainly in hummus, and it works well for that, but you can also make an awesome spread for falafel by putting some tahini in a food processor with lemon juice, a couple of garlic cloves, some cold water and mint leaves.

review/summary: IT THICKENS WITH LEMON!
review/text: I normally get my Tahina from a local lebanese shop near my home. Their tahina is excellent and great on their falafel sandwhiches they make to go. You can buy tubs of their tahina to go as well, which is what I've been doing up until now. While their Tahina has added to it a little salt, lemon and garlic, it is a more, white creamy texture than this Al Wadi brand offered on Amazon.com, but there is no milk in it, the owner told me, that accounts for its white creamy texture. Al Wadi, offered on Amazon, is on the liquid side at room temperature I noticed upon opening my first jar, that is until you add the juice of a small lemon, for each 1/3 cup of tahina into the mix. It also gets less liquidy, if you keep it in the frig for a few days. Anway, when you add the juice of a small lemon, like I indicated, the whole thing thickens up dramatically. So don't let the liquid texture fool you. I had to add more sesame seed oil to it, after adding in the lemon, just to thin it out: Interesting reaction. I love to dip fresh cooked falafels into a Tahina dressing. Yum! If the Tahina is really well prepared, like where I get it locally, its good for pouring onto salads as well. However, this Al Widi preparations would have to be really thinned out more with Sesame seed oil to make that possible, especially after you add lemon juice to it.<br /><br />I have to keep an all vegetarian diet these days to help my blood pressure and follow a program designed for breaking down myofacia tumors in the body, all naturally, given the tumors are inoperable. So I can't get out and get to my local Lebanese store to get my tahina like I use to, which is why I thought I'd try this brand offered from Amazon.com. I do thank God for the Internet when you are shut in like I am.<br /><br />I think this preparations has a good solid nutty flavor to it and is also great to spread on whole wheat bread with some honey. I'm not disappointed, especially since I bought 6 jars to take advantage of the Free Super Saver shipping offer.<br /><br />Hope this helps cover some points not mentioned in the other reviews? I gave it four stars because its just not quite up there with what I buy locally at the commercial level, but it is a good tasting product regarless and I would buy it again.

review/summary: Nutty, rich flavor--perfect for hummus
review/text: My family and I went to a Greek restaurant every week, mainly for the pita and hummus.  We realized it was an expensive habit and decided to try to make it at home.  I easily found good-quality pita bread at the grocery store, but I could not find tahini.  (My large grocery store offers pre-made hummus, but I wanted to make it fresh.) One weekend, we drove into downtown Houston to a Mediterranean market, where I picked up a jar of Al Wadi Tahina.  My first attempt to make hummus with it was a success, and since then we have never purchased pre-made hummus.  It's very quick and easy (not to mention cheap) to make yourself, and you have the option to personalize it to your tastes.  (We add a bit of red pepper flake to ours.)<br /><br />A few observations to make your experience with Al Wadi Tahina a success: 1. It's more a liquid than a paste.  Keep this in mind when making your  hummus.  I did not need to add much liquid to mine at all because of this.  2. All tahini has a bitter flavor.  Some recipes call for a lot of tahini, but you may want to add a few tablespoons and taste before adding more.  It has a great, smokey flavor, but it can be too bitter if you use a large amount.  3. Always stir well before adding tahini to the blender or food processor, and scoop from the bottom to get more of the paste.<br /><br />There are more expensive tahini options available, but this brand offers a decent price point and authentic flavor.  I was able to make hummus that tastes exactly like the hummus at our favorite Greek restaurant for less than $3 a bowl versus $6 at the restaurant.

review/text: When I saw these for the first time, on a shelf in a gas station mini-mart, it was one of those moments where time seems to suddenly stand still, and (like a scene from a movie, & if moments in life had their own accompanying soundtracks) would have been 'justified' in having a choir singing some sort of crescendo -based bit of non-verbal hallelujah, thereby triggering goosebumps, & a sudden involuntary 'gulp', as one then regains one's composure... my first thought (when I was finally able to think, after initially staring in stunned silence [nay, reverence]), when coming face-to-bag with this ridiculously delicious bit of heaven, was something along the lines of, ~'omg... this is genius...'.<br /><br />This is like some sort of food-based 'designer drug' -- because, trust me, if you like almonds, & you like (or, rather, love) the marriage of sea salt with that somethin'-somethin' oil-based bit of extravagance otherwise encountered in whoa-that's-good -tasting potato chips, then this, my friend, is your new difficult-to-resist temptation, addiction, & 'frenemy'... ;)<br /><br />On any drive back from a relative's place, when I stop to get gas, prior to beginning the drive home, I intentionally go to the gas station that I know carries this item -- & when I get back in the car, & open that first bag (I let myself enjoy 2 of the 1.5-ounce bags as I 'head off into the sunset'), you'd think I was about to bite into the world's best chocolate cake, or the greatest pie, or a mind-blowing cheesecake -- yes, this stuff is 'right up there' with the rest of my hallowed favorites when it comes to savoring every single tastebud interaction -- but, whereas the confectionary treats are otherwise enjoyed on relatively rare occasions, & largely restricted to celebratory events, my partaking of these delectable skinless almonds, & their Goldilocks-like, 'just right' mix of sea salt & oil, is more on a 'whenever/any/every time I can' basis, & renders whatever moment I can have them dance across my tastebuds its own celebratory event, & 'tastebud holiday', if you will...<br /><br />Yeah, it's safe to say that I love these little bits of almond nirvana...  Be warned, however -- these things are 'addictive'... & if you should make the 'mistake' of placing a bowl of these out at a party or family gathering, you'd better make sure you've arranged for refills (or risk the frustrated wrath of those who suddenly find themselves craving more [& who might be 'driven' to suddenly leave the premises, in search of more, albeit with one parting inquiry -- 'hey, where did you get these?'])...<br /><br />To whoever dreamed up, let alone greenlit, the manufacture of this product -- oh, the power of what you have unleashed... even if we end up being a 'cult following', know that this 'cult of the sea salt & oil -ized skinless almond' enjoy the dickens out of this wondrous almond delight...<br /><br />These taste SO good... & what a nice little dance of 'textures', with the slick oil on a surface that's smooth & gets moderately crunched, & then the wonderful taste of sea salt & oil getting introduced to the previously unexposed interior aspects of almond that have been newly released due to chewing... I know I sound ridiculous, but, oh, this is yummy... what a delightful series of minutes for one's sense of taste...

review/summary: Buying them in store is better
review/text: These are a tad stale... they don't taste bad but the ones from the supermarket are much more fresh and have a CRUNCH to them that these do not.  The expiration date on this is 8 months away so that shouldn't be the issue.  Maybe they are kept in a hot warehouse or something, but I won't be buying these from here again.

review/summary: Never ate almonds before
review/text: I was not an almond fan untill I was introduced to this product. The olive oil and sea salt add up to a wonderful taste; they are skinless but not greasy. I keep a bag at work and one in my car to provide instant protein and energy. They are difficult to find in local stores, (and I don't live in Spooner, Wi, by the way, I am in a large suburban area) which is why I resorted to ordering a whole case on line!

review/summary: Skinless Almonds
review/text: Purchased a small package in a store and loved them.  They have a slightly differnt taste and I love the sea salt and olive oil flavoring. I was pleased I could find them on line because I checked everywhere and could not find a store again that carries them.  I will be sure to buy more.

review/summary: Great. . . . .
review/text: I have had a hard time finding these nuts since Planter took them out of ALL the grocery stores in my area. These are the only type of Almonds I will eat. They are GREAT. My Dr. had suggested that I eat these for health reasons.

review/summary: Delicious -- The olive oli makes all the difference
review/text: If you are an almond lover, you owe it to yourself to give these a try.  Sure, you should probably buy a single pack somewhere first, but these are amazingly delicious, addictive and, unfortunately, pretty fattening.<br /><br />Make sure to have napkins at hand, as your hands will be finger-licking-good greasy when you are done!

review/summary: More like Qdoba's Tortilla Soup than NM Green Chile Stew
review/text: I adore the Green Chile Stew I used to get from the Frontier Restaurant in Albuquerque, NM (but now I'm in Indiana).  I also really like the Tortilla soup from Qdoba's (this product is rather similar in basic flavor, though not in all ingredients).  I had a hard time identifying the green chile in the cooked product.<br /><br />It is very hard to find a good GREEN chile flavor outside of New Mexico; most everything 'Mexican' tastes for more Tex-Mex and RED chile.  This soup is very flavorful and mildly hot, but very far from what I think of as 'Green Chile Stew'.  The canned Hatch is much closer.  However, I still give the product high marks for being (as far as I can tell from reading the ingredients) all natural, and also for being quite tasty.  I tried it plain the day I got it, and then added canned Chili Beans and Tomatoes with Green Chiles and El Yucateco Green Habanero sauce and some potatoes... this made a very satisfying stew, but not what *I* was looking for in a 'Green Chile Stew'.  Leonard Mountain is based in Oklahoma - nice but not NM.  Very fine product, but not with this name...  I will use the other 4 boxes over time, but I don't think I'll keep the subscription.

review/summary: NOt for the home cook
review/text: This product may well be a backpacker's delight, but it probably will be a disappointment to a home cook.The product no doubt will hold its own in comparison with other dried, light-weight products for the hiker's food bag. But the package directions (which are very small print and hard to read)can tip off a home cook that the manufacturer makes enough suggestions about to improve the mouth feel and taste of the product that the home cook realizes that for roughly the same amount of work and roughly the same expense of materials and utilities, one can make a much more tasty green chili stew at home.  Understand, please, that this is not a bad product if you want backpack trail food.  But if you have a stove and refrigerator and the usual household commodities potatoes, onions, chilis, spices) on hand, your family almost certainly will prefer chili stew made from scratch, and it will take about the same time and effort.

review/summary: Love Leonard Mountain Soup!
review/text: I have high blood pressure and have to watch my sodium intake.  I discovered Leonard Mountain soup products at a craft fair.  Seeing that they were somewhat low in sodium, I bought several, cooked them up, and loved them!  I tend to add my own veggies such as tomatoes, an extra can of green chilies, diced potatoes and onion to this mix and I end up with a wonderful, low sodium, tasty, very hearty stew!  I use the soup mixes as a base as the spices are wonderful and very flavorful.  Add your own veggies and meat to make a lovely stew for your family.  Add corn tortilla slices for an extra special touch!

review/summary: Easy, delicious meal!
review/text: We received this as a gift and I tried this a couple of days ago when we needed a quick dinner and I wasn't feeling well. The spices were perfect- and the ingredients all by themselves worked great for us. We prepared according to the simple directions- no creativity at all on our part. Can't wait to make it again and try a little of our own flare to it! Also plan to purchase more for gifts...

review/summary: RIP OFF PRICE .. only$ 2.29 in store for the large container
review/text: I would never buy these from this distributor at this price. I wanted to ship some to my girlfriend in Florida because we have not found it here yet and I live in Ohio. The price in our stores is only about $2.29 for a large can. This price is half more..... Unless they lower there price I would not ever buy it from them. Not only is this not discounted for quantity.. it is no bargain to begin with and then shipping will make it even more. I would report them for ruining the awesome Chips brands reputation.... find em.. buy em.. eat em up.. they are the best... I even lost a lot of weigh eating them to curve hunger believe it or not. My cholesterol is just fine too btw.  Love PIK NIK the best.. reminds me of being a kid again.

review/summary: Great Yummy Product, Insane Price!
review/text: I have been eating the Pik-Nik Shoestring Potatoes ever since I was a kid. I always liked them better then potato chips. I can buy these in the store but since my family eats a lot of these I was hoping to get a good deal thru Amazon. NOT!!! The price for these when shipping is added does not make for a good deal! Matter of fact, I'd consider these at $40.16 for a case of 12, from the distributor that is carrying them, to be a huge RIP_OFF! That makes each 9 oz. can cost $4.16 each!!! I can buy the same size can at my local market for 2.49 each. So don't get ripped off with this one folks! Remember, the product is great, the price is NOT!
