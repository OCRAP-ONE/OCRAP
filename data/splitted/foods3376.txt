review/summary: Tasty Stuff
review/text: Really a tasty flavor that you don't see in the store locally.  I love these noodles, several of the flavors are really good but hard to find.  There is a Creamy Chicken that I love and just can't find locally or on Amazon where as an Amazon Prime member I get two day shipping for free.  If you can get your hands on the Creamy Chicken give it a try.  Around here the Roast Beef, Pork, and Beef flavors go faster than other flavors, but any flavor on hand seems to get eaten almost as much.<br /><br />Our favorite way to fix them is to boil two packages of the noodles in plain water for three minutes, drain and put back in empty pot it was boiled in, add real butter to taste 1 to 2 Tablespoons, and add one packet of the flavor mix, stir thoroughly and serve.  Many may prefer them more as a soup but in this household we are a bunch of noodle freaks, quick, cheap, easy what more can you ask of a food.

review/summary: Had to try
review/text: Ramen is a quick and easy meal, you can doctor it up to be fancier and more filling.. or eat it plain if in a hurry.<br /><br />It's a great staple to have in the pantry for quick meals, or emergency situations. All you need is hot water.<br /><br />But... with only a couple of flavors available locally, it got boring. I don't even remember exactly how I ended up on the page with all the Ramen soup flavors but I did.. and I'm glad.<br /><br />I ordered four new flavors that day, and found them all to be very good.<br /><br />I was soooo excited to see this flavor, I LOVE mushrooms. Sadly the first taste that hit me wasn't what I expected. I can't really say that it has a mushroom taste.. but it is good. And it does allow me a bit more variety. Ramen is such a handy food to have on hand for those times when you can't cook, be it shortage of time, or an emergency situation.  This will be one that I'll get again.

review/text: Now that Senseo has dramatically reduced the types of pods you can purchase, this has become my favorite. Pods are quite full and you have to massage the pods to level the grinds out before putting in the machine but in return the large amount of grinds gives a very strong dark roast coffee. I would call it a French roast. I like the individual packaging so the pods stay fresh. Probably not environmentally friendly with all the extra packaging but it is nice to get a strong coffee aroma every time I open a pod.

review/summary: Disappointing. Weak Flavor and Too Much Water.
review/text: I've been trying to increase the seafoods part of my diet and I've been trying a lot of canned items because of their ready availability and ease of storage. One of my recent items is Crown Prince Crab Meat (fancy white) in a 6-0z. can. I'm disappointed with this product. First, rather strangely, it's the only canned item I've ever had where the contents came wrapped inside the can. Second, the finely shredded crab meat therein was way overly waterly. Third, the crab meat had very little taste. I guess I could have guessed the latter when I opened the can and could detect virtually no odor. I got by with it using it as a spread on some simply delicious crispbread crackers and with a little seafood sauce to add to the flavor. Unfortunately, then all the flavor was coming from the sauce and the crispbreads, and very little from the crab meat. Did I miss something here? Was this just a bad can sample or are all cans of this product this way. My inclination would be not to buy another can.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: My wife and I purchased a 15 oz bag of Amport Foods pine nuts at our local Sam's Club and about one day after eating a small handful we developed a bitter taste in our mouths that made all other foods taste bitter/metallic.  The symptoms have been ongoing for three days now.  We contacted the Poison Control Center and it turns out that there have been several similar reports.  It seems to be some kind of product contamination and the symptoms may last for weeks.

review/text: I bought the 15 oz bag of Amport Foods Pine Nuts at Sams Club.  Although they taste good when you eat them, everything else taste like you have a mouthful of coins for about 3 days after you eat these nuts.  I ate just a handful of them and three days later I still had metal mouth. I returned these to Sams and told them they should drop this brand until they stop sourcing them from China/Asia.<br />The European, American, and Mexican pine nuts don't have this problem. Although these pine nuts are cheaper, they are not of value since they have this awful side effect.

review/summary: Korean Pine Nuts, NOT Italian Stone Pine Type
review/text: These are not the same as the Italian pine nuts, nor do they taste the same. You can tell the difference by the shape- the 'real' pine nuts are elongated, while the Korean stone pine nuts have a wider base. These taste oddly metallic, and are packaged in China, which gives one doubts about the quality and safety of the product. While these may be much cheaper, they are not worth it. Look for pine nuts from Italy, Turkey or the US and be sure they come from the correct tree species!

So I asked a search engine about them and it answered my question and refered me to Amazon, where I could purchace the bars under the name "Curly Wurley". I was very pleased to see that although the "Marathon Bar" had not been produced here in the United States in almost 30 years, I was still able to purchase them under a different name from the good folks at Amazon, and they are delicious, just as I remember from my childhood...YUMMY!!

review/text: First, just want to say these are tasty, no issues there.<br /><br />However, based on the reviews, I was shocked when they arrived.  I could tell just by looking at them that they weren't the Marathon bars that we had as kids, where I grew up, anyway (Southern California).  Those Marathon bars were much, much larger.<br /><br />These Curly Whirly bars are better than the Marathon bars that I remember.  I like the almost delicate configuration of these, and the slightly more sophisticated flavors.<br /><br />P.S.:  I came back to update my review, because I learned that we did indeed have a larger Marathon bar in Southern California - so I'm not crazy!  :)  For some reason unknown to me, a 15" Marathon bar was marketed in Southern California during the 1970s.

review/text: I've already said great things about this company and the Curly Wurly bars when I rated this transaction (excellent), but I wanted to give a thumbs up in the regular section as well.  I grew up watching movies with a Marathon bar melting in my mouth until the bar was discontinued in the early 80s.  I've missed it ever since.  Then I discovered that they were kind of available as the Curly Wurly bar.  I decided to go for it.  I waited to eat my first one at a special screening of Superman 2 (when I most likely ate a Marathon while watching it originally in 1980).  Not only does the Curly Wurly look like Marathon, it tastes like Marathon.  A little chocolate/caramel miracle.  These bars really taste like no other and, a plus, are only 115 calories per bar.  I don't metabolize like I did in 1980, so that's good.  I highly recommend this movie-time treat.

review/summary: Curly Wurly's are Wurly (ahem- I meant "really") Great!
review/text: As so many have said here- hands down, I agree. Yes, these Cadbury Curly Wurly bars are reminiscent of the Marathon Bars which were sold here, in the US, at least over 30yrs ago (Wow. What a downer to be reminded I am that old! SMILE)!  Very similarly great tasting! But, of course- with all due respect to Cadbury (the makers of the Curly Wurly bar) the Curly Wurly did come first but it IS a Marathon reminder! And, of course- that's coincidental since the Curly Wurly was a predecessor! (and, I can only guess that Cadbury is PRAYING that we stop with the Marathon thing- I know they are thinking, "Marathon WHO??  WE CAME FIRST!".<br /><br />  However, yes, Curly Wurly's inevitably IS a pleasantly missed reminder of that old missed Marathon Bar!  Which, by the way- should be good for Curly Wurly sales here in the US.  That's how I found the candy bar on here (someone told me to find it-'cause it tasted close to the Marathon bar)!<br />  But, alas, take heed: this is NOT a Marathon bar review.<br /><br />  Ok. One more thing (smile)! The Curly Wurly taste did remind me of this Marathon memory:  My first bite of the Curly Wurly was mouthwatering, it melts in your mouth! But it did bring back flashbacks of that old Marathon Bar commercial that had the young, handsome, Marathon Man always competing/winning to see how long something lasts vs. The Marathon Candy Bar: THEN, the commercial would always end with the Marathon Man smiling, flashing his pearly white teeth, and stating in his deep voice while biting into the Marathon Candy Bar:  "Nothing beats a Marathon Bar. Lasts a long, long, loooooong time!".<br />  I appreciate your patience: OK, now, BACK to the Curly Wurly which I'm reviewing!<br /><br />  The Curly Wurly Bar (size: each one is 8inches long, 1in wide.  But, they do seem a bit thin).  Rec'd extra early and very fresh from the seller Premier Life! Actually, delicious! Caramelly (I'm guessing that's a word, sorry!) braided, covered in chocolate courtesy of Cadbury. And, I didn't know it was so lowfat and low in calories...what a pleasant surprise! Here's the Nutritional Info from the package.<br /><br />Per Bar<br /><br />Calories  115<br />Carbs  18g<br />Sugars  12.4g<br />Fat  4g<br /><br />So, as you can see you can eat these without too much guilt as well! Not even a whole lot of sugar (for a candy bar)! Nary a single complaint! Recommended! I just wish they were on 'Subscribe and Save'. As, for me, reordering is inevitable!

They are best after freezing or refrigerating them. Then you can snap pieces off and savor each piece. A bar lasts me all evening!

review/summary: My childhood days relived!
review/text: The marathon bar used to be my favorite candy bar.  But, alas, it is gone.  For years I despaired over the loss of my candy but I discovered that England produces the curlywurly bar which, ,for all intents and purposes, is a marathon bar.  So I gave it a whirl.  After an anxious wait my bars arrived from England.  One bite into this bar and I was transferred  back to the 1970's... the caramel was the buttery chewy delight that I  remembered.  The bar itself isn't as big, but the flavor is perfect.  If you liked the Marathon bar, you're going to love this.

review/text: "Marathon" bars use to be my FAVORITE back in the 70's when I could buy them anywhere other candy bars were sold in the U.S. But I can't find the TRUE "Marathon" bar anymore. I thought I'd try these. The Curly Wurly's have the same lacy look but the size is Not the same! And size does batter. The "Marathon" bar was MUCH BIGGER! Although the Curly Wurly had the same FANTASTIC taste! AWESOME candy bar! Also Great Fast service!!!

review/text: I'd been searching for the longest time for my favorite childhood candy: Marathon. I found the Curly Wurly, but no one to ship it at a reasonable price to Puerto Rico. I had my doubts about freshness and everything, but I took the chance here and ordered a dozen. The price was very fair (shipping included), they arrived very fast, and they were intact (not melted or white spotted)...aaaaaand my kids got to enjoy my favorite candy. It was a blast, I got to tell them how much I liked it as a kid, and they are eager to eat some more. So I'll have to order a big box pronto. Thanks!!!

review/summary: A very poor copy of the original
review/text: While I am well aware that Cadbury does make some excellent products, the Curly Wurly's are not one of them. These candy bars are NOTHING like the original Marathon Bar's from the 1970's, except in appearance. The chocolate coating is much to thin on the Curly Wurly's compared to the original Marathon Bar's and the caramel has a distinct buttery taste which the Marathon Bar did not. The Curly Wurly's  are ok if your just looking for a chocolate candy bar with a different taste, but I personally will not ever buy them again.

review/summary: Dog Gone Good!!!
review/text: I adopted a 15 month old male dog in August from a shelter who was in extremely poor condition; dermatitis from flea bites; two types of worms (not heart); ears that felt like rice krispies; dirty, smelly, dry, blan coat, thin and weak.  My niece, who has worked as a Vet Tech for years and years, suggested Puring ProPlan; Salmon & Brown Rice.  Of course, I took her advice.  Dexter looks like a totally different dog!!!  Yes, he was on meds for 3 weeks, but within a week ater feeding him ProPlan, he's stronger overall, his poops were healthy and firm, his coat was soft and shiny and he continues to improve.  He enjoys the taste very much!  We recently adopted a one-year old dog from a local sheltter (Dexter wanted a brother).  Buddy enjoys ProPlan immensely and immediately his poops are healthy, his coat is softer and shinier and he's doing great!  There are different flavors of ProPlan if your pooch doesn't enjoy Salmon.  I am very very happy with this food and will continue my babies on it.  Thanks!

review/text: These gummy bears are amazing! Everyone in my family loves them. They taste exactly like pineapples. They're better than the snack bags you find at the grocery store. They are slightly yellow, but its more of a clear light  yellow. For sure they aren't crystal clear. But that doesn't matter much when you're just munching on them. The only downside I see in this, is the quantity. You have to share it to finish it.

I guess I can understand what people say by them being a bit yellow compared to the picture.  But that pic is probably taken with some bright lighting.  They look exactly the way they should be. Any other brand of gummy bears, when you get to the white/pineapple one..it looks just like this.  Will def order again...but not sure what other flavor I want to try

review/text: Many people that tried these did not like them at all. I kept them in a clean oversized container, and when I opened them up to hand out, there was a smell which smelled like something was rotten. After the first 3 seconds or so, it smells like a nice artificial pineapple smell. Not one of my favorites made byAlbanese, and many others that tried the other flavors agreed. They do have a distinct pineapple taste though.

These are so soft and delicious. Even my friends loved them. They could really taste the delicious pineapple! The best way to say it is they are the best gummi bears I have ever had."<br /><br />Mission Accomplished. :)

review/summary: Maille Originale Squeeze bottles tastes different than glass jars.
review/text: I ordered the 12 pack of the Maille squeeze bottle mustard.  But was pretty ticked to find that the flavor in the squeeze bottles is different, not as hot as the glass jars.  I assume this is because they need to be thinner in consistency.  Before writing this review I went and bought a jar of the Originale mustard and compared it to one of the many squeeze bottles I have left.  There is a clear difference in taste.  The jars have a hotter mustard flavor, and better in my opinion.  Now, even the squeeze bottles taste better than any processed mustard out there, but this review is to let everyone clearly know, what the seller of the cases of squeeze bottles should have kindly told their buyers:<br /><br />Maille Originale MUSTARD in the SQUEEZE BOTTLES TASTE LIGHTER THAN THE MAILLE ORIGINALE in the JARS.<br /><br />The sellers need to do a little better on the disclosure.

Iced tea flavors come down to personal taste, and contrary to what the other reviewers have said, I have found this tea to be a great afternoon treat, not super high in calories, a great alternate to coffee or soda, and am loving the mix of wildflower honey and black tea. I've actually subbed it out in place of my daily Starbucks Chai. I agree, however, on the Mojito flavored one being terrible! The bulk pricing on Amazon is not very competitive though; I'm sticking to my $2.50/bottle price at Whole Foods until a better option is available.

review/summary: Not as bad as the Mojitea
review/text: I have never been so motivated to jump online and review a product.  There is nothing delicious or refreshing about this tea, and the only reason I gave it two stars is so that I can save the one star rating for the Mojitea.  I'm not sure how they combined basically yummy ingredients to create a gross beverage, but I wonder if anyone taste-tested this before it was put on the market.  The flavor is overwhelmingly honey with a hint of black tea, but not sweet pure honey flavor, more like the stuff you might lick off the dirty floor of the room where the honey is removed from the comb.  Yuck!

review/summary: Great Tea, Poorly packaged!!! Arrives with Broken glass
review/text: I had this tea at a nearby whole foods and I really liked the flavor.  It does come in the clunky glass bottle, but it kind of added to the charm.  I liked it so much that I went online to find it.  I ordered a case and it arrived soaked in tea and broken glass.  Not recommended!  Will stick to whole foods.

review/summary: Better than their Mojitea
review/text: Again...who's doing the taste testing for these Argo Tea folks?  Folks coming back from a camping trip in the Sahara?<br /><br />Have to say it's better than their "Mojitea", but not by much.  The taste here is just overpowering as well.  It's...thick.  Too thick.  Tea should be refreshing.  I shouldn't have to brush my teeth afterwards.<br /><br />That said, I drank the whole bottle (after the initial, first sip, WTF is in my mouth reaction), which is more that can be said for the Mojitea, sitting in front of me about to find it's way to the trash can.<br /><br />Seriously.  Sun Tea.  Back Yard.  Go.

review/summary: Best added to dry food
review/text: My Golden Retriever has a tendency to pile on the pounds, so we watch her diet carefully.  She gets two cups of Canidae dry food each day and is usually happy with that.  But this winter she was sick and stopped eating, so the vet suggested adding a very small amount of canned food to the dry.  That worked, but it meant having to store a can of dogfood in my refrigerator between feedings, and heating it up for about 6 seconds so that I could mix it into the dry food.  Most canned dog food turns into a cold chunk when it is refrigerated.  When heated it gives off a nasty odor that I don't like.  Spot's Stew looks and smells like human stew, even when it is heated.  It has enough "gravy" that it mixes easily with the dry food.  I like that because I don't have to add very many extra calories.  It only takes a few tablespoons to send my Goldon into doggy heaven.  Spot's Stew is not readily available, however.  My local "natural food" store used to carry it, but no more, so I have begun purchasing from Amazon.

These suited fine. I got them and honestly expected bland, crunchy cardboard. WRONG! They are just the right amount of crisp, with a wonderful onion flavor. They're about the size of shoestring french fries and 34 of them is about 120 calories. All this and whole grain, too. Seriously, If I didn't know these were healthy, I would just think they were an ordinary junk food snack. I will be buying more. In fact, I've already ordered a bag of the cheese flavor. Good stuff!

review/text: OMG what a pleasant surprise, these truly have awesome flavor, light & crunchy!  Should have listened to the other reviewers & ordered more.  Mailman delivered, opened door & door knocked them down the front steps.  Broke my foot, so the only way for me to get them was to crawl backwards, my pants were soaking wet from the ground, & had to change, etc.... Still well worth crawling out the door for a mouthful of this flavor. Says they're good for you with whole grains, lower in calories, etc,  Granted I should be watching that, truly ordered because they popped up on my screen & the reviewers mentioned how good they are. THEY ARE!!! Taste like a great junk food snack to me but doesn't make you feel like you ate one afterward, + not an overpowering onion flavor, or dragon breath. Will definitely be ordering more & highly recommend them. The 1st bite was uncertain, then ate another, & another - delicious, absolutely delicious!  Taste like MORE!!!<br /><br />May have to check. Out the other flavors.

review/text: With this actually being marketed as "diet food" (admittedly with a fairly funny view once I read the package) I really wanted to not like these. I ordered them as an "add on" item to a recent order, to make up the last of the 25$.<br />They DO look quite odd. Like skinny Cheetos with a hole thru the middle.<br />However they TASTE absolutely fabulous. They have a sweet mildly onion-y taste, and are really crispy.<br /><br />For the price they are very, very good. It's a shame no stores sell these locally, but I will be ordering more next time I purchase on Amazon.com

review/summary: My Best Impulse Buy!
review/text: I saw this product at my local HEB grocery store in TX and was about to walk by the display, but something about the packaging was interesting.  As I am always looking for a low calorie snack to replace chips, I thought I would try the Sweet Onion Skinny Sticks first.  If I didn't like them, I had only lost a few dollars.  Well, not only did I like them, but I went back to the store a couple days later and bought two other flavors.  So far I like all the flavors, but the onion is still my favorite.  I shared some with my Curves group last week and every woman there said they were running out to buy some.  That should be enough to show what a great new product this is.  Since you cannot find them nationwide at the moment, buy them online at Amazon.  The price is the same as what I paid at the store.  Happy munching!

I found this sauce to have enough of a kick to enjoy, but not overpower the flavor.  No vinigar to intrude on the senses and it's not so hot that it numbs the taste buds either.  I've been ordering it ever since.  My favorite use is over my soft boiled eggs every morning.

review/summary: let me clear up some confussion
review/text: okay, what this product is: this is a "Crema" di Balsamico.<br /><br />What it is not: regular balsamic vinegar, or *aged* balsamic vinegar.<br /><br />Okay, so what is a "crema?"<br /><br />Aged balsamic vinegars are naturally thick. 12 year old balsamic approach syrup, and 25 year old definitely do. This comes from the aging process and natural evaporation. It also makes thick, syrupy, aged balsamic vinegars VERY EXPENSIVE. A good 25 year old bottle from the Carandini family will set you back $150 to $200.<br /><br />Regular balsamic vinegar flows like thick vinegar, but can make for a thin salad dressing if you do not want to use mustard or another emulsifier (although high quality walnut oil will emulsify with regular balsamic).<br /><br />So, sometimes you want a thick dressing that clings to your salad leaves (think bitter escarole).<br /><br />You want the balsamic taste, a thick consistency, but don't want $25 dollar-per-serving salad dressing.<br /><br />You then have two choices: 1) reduce regular balsamic over low heat until it is thickened. The pros are it is thicker, the cons are this method looses a lot of flavor and complexity from the heat.<br /><br />Choice two (2): is to use a "crema."<br /><br />Cremas combine regular balsamic vinegar with other thickening ingredients such as high quality starches (in minute quantities) and atomized grape flesh solids. It gives you the thick consistency you want, all the punch of balsamic vinegar, a bit more smooth tasting balance, and at a price you can afford.<br /><br />This Crema is made by the Emelio Carandini family of Modena, who make the best balsamic vinegar in the world (if you ever get a bottle of their "Noe" you'll never want to use anything else ever again).<br /><br />This is the highest quality crema on the market, made by the best balsamic vinegar family in the business. No, it is not aged and reduced balsamic...but it also does not cost over $100. This is an intelligent high-quality compromise product that does very well what it aims to do.<br /><br />An excellent product re-sold under the "Earthly Delights" private label but coming from the best people in the business. A tremendous value.

review/text: The actual ingredients of this product is listed as:  Balsamic vinegar of Modena 53% (wine vinegar, grape must, dye E150d), grape must, wheat syrup, modified cornstarch.  The fact is, wine vinegar isn't the same as balsamic vinegar.  We tasted balsamic creme in Modena, Italy made from balsamic vinegar, thickened with carob and it was smooth & tangy.  Not as strong & acidic as this product.  We placed the order because it was listed above the Carandini name on the site and we misunderstood that it's made by this authentic balsamic producer.  We paid about $12 for a 225 ml bottle of the "real balsamic creme" from Italy.  Quick and efficient service from Earthy Delights, but not the balsamic we expected.
