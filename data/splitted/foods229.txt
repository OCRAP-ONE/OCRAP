review/summary: I love this product
review/text: I have used about 5 or 6 boxes (24 count) of this brand and have really liked the flavor and the the freshness in every order that I received. I have only tried one other brand and thought it was stale and did not like the flavor. For me it is not to salty in fact I add a little salt before I pop it. I use one or two a day and always have a bowl of popped corn out for my grand kids. When ever they come over they always head to the snack shack (a little stand alone cupboard)for a treat. We try to have healthy treats but I think the pop corn is probably more healthy than the granola bars,crackers,cookies or dried fruit snacks and they seem to like the pop corn best. The only problem or maybe a benefit is that I have to floss a lot more.

review/summary: It's good!
review/text: Purchased this to use with a popcorn machine and while the machine had to be returned the popcorn itself is good. My kids loved it and thought the house smelled like the local movie theatre. Its easy to prepare and the taste is great. No extra butter or salt was needed it was perfect for our family. We just have to find a decent machine to use it with...until then we'll just use the stove.

review/summary: not movie theater popcorn
review/text: This popcorn is not the same as movie theater popcorn. If you have ever been to target and tried the popcorn that they sell at the little target snack bar it the same as that but ten times saltier. I recommend only outing half of the packet of salt. I am the tips of guy that eats super salty popcorn but this was way to much. Instead of buying this you should buy coconut oil, and kernals from the store, it ends up to be cheaper and tast allot more like movie theater popcorn

review/text: I had tried to use grocery store oil and popcorn in my countertop popper but it always tasted stale and not a bit like movie theater popcorn.  Decided to try this for a party and it made a world of difference.  Tasted just like fresh popped corn at the theater.  The packs were easy to use.  Just cut across the top and dump all 3 packets into the heated popper.  I will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Great popcorn.  My family and I love watching movies and eating popcorn.  We consume more popcorn during the fall and winter months.  We received this popcorn and quickly made our first batch.  Wow.......It was great.  We made the mistake of not mixing everything together (oil, popcorn, and buttery salt).  That was our fault because we didn't read the instructions due to excitement.  But our first batch was still very good (a little salty because we added the salt mix last).  We made another batch two days later and it was awesome.  This is as close to theater popcorn made in our house ever.  It was really, really good.  Every kernell popped and it was a perfect balance.  We will NEVER, and I mean NEVER buy microwave or store popcorn again....We will be placing another order very soon.  I almost forgot to mention that we bought the 8oz bags.  That was enough for a large bowl which will feed 2-3 of us.  Can't wait to order another batch.....Enjoy

review/text: We have been using this for over a year now.  We love it.  It pops perfect popcorn every time. In fact, we like it more than the popcorn at the movie theater.  It is possible to not put all the oil or salt in (with a little practice) if you have guests who want less flavor.  But we think it is perfect the way it is...every time.

It is so good, that as soon as you finish eat it, you want more. It has enough salt, a buttery taste, and oil. Everything is packaged together. I love it. I'm order more today! I use to go to the movie theaters just to get the popcorn, and leave and eat it at home. I am a popcorn critic in my head, and this is definitely Top 2.

review/text: Packaging is very easy to open, for me it does taste a little too salty but still enjoyable. I have a 6oz. popcorn maker however when I use the entire packet towards the end it want's to pop off the top so I may try the 4oz. next time. The only complaint I have is when I received this package due to the extreme heat we have had this summer by the time I received it some of the packets the oil/butter had leaked through and was a little messy as I had to wipe off each packet and throw away a couple.

review/summary: Pretty Good Flavor
review/text: This stuff is great. I use it in my whirley pop and it makes perfect popcorn. Flavor is pretty darn close to movie theater. Everyone in my family loves this stuff. I do like a bit more salt on my popcorn but this can be a bit too salty even for me. I cut the salt pack open before the rest and take out the salt. I would say I use about half to 3/4 what comes in the pack. Then I cut the rest of the pack open and dump it all in. This is about the right amount of salt for me. The only problem is the salt is butter flavored so you loose a bit of flavor doing this. I'd say make a batch like normal first and then adjust the salt to taste if needed. That's an easy fix. I save the salt and then I use it for future popcorn making without the kit.<br /><br />If I can find some smaller sample packs to try of other brands, I may look into that in the future when it's time to order more. But if I don't ever find anything else, this stuff is pretty good.

review/summary: closest to theatre style popcorn
review/text: Really good tasting popcorn, best I have tasted yet. A bit salty in my opinion. Just a hint, when making popcorn in theatre style poppers, always pre heat the kettle, it avoids soggy corn which sticks together. Fact is, the only thing that makes theatre corn better, is what's used in the preperation, meaning your oil and seasoned salt. You can make just as good as popcorn on a cheap popcorn maker with the proper ingredients.

review/summary: For grandkids,,,, easy really great healthy snack
review/text: We just got the Great Northern Princeton popper a few weeks ago and also sent a 24 count prepackaged case of the Great Northern 8oz pop corn. The kids (11 and 6) really love it... They actually do the popping themselves. I have just ordered the auto buy/shipping option for having them delivered every 3 months. Got a 15% discount to do it and makes it really convenient and saved a bit also. The kids have raved about the popcorn and the popper also,,,so its been a rally good deal for us. This popcorn is very healthy for the kids (Check out the actual info about the product with Coconut oil). If there are any problems in the future I will amend this rating. Hears hoping that this works out well.

review/text: I have a commercial type popcorn popper in my man cave garage. I entertain a lot. I have tried to measure out my own popcorn but tired of that, so started buying Northern Popcorn packs a number of years ago. It always pops perfect and tastes great. Its always a hit. I highly recommend. OH, And if you want less salt, just cut back on that portion. I tried other brands of packets and they were way too salty. I personally like the recipe Great Northern uses. Keep poppin' my friends.

review/text: I enjoyed the popcorn at our minor league ballpark so much that I was craving it even when we weren't heading to the games! Then we moved, and I admit I panicked a little bit - great addictive popcorn is 'few and far between'. I sent email to the ballpark, and the concessions manager gave me all the information about the brand of popcorn they were using. It was very exciting to find out I could order the same all-n-one packs from Amazon!<br />I have been thrilled with the 2.5-ounce size... it's the perfect size for a popcorn loving snacker. More than one snacker? Open 2 or 3 packs! Easy to make on the stovetop or microwave. I'm back to order more!!

As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl.

Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.

Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.

review/summary: Movie theatre popcorn from the microwave at home!
review/text: I looked at the old fashioned pop corn poppers (you know, the red cart and metal popper), but those looked like they would be a lot of work to keep clean as well as take up counter space I don't have. However, I still really wanted "movie theater" or "carnival/fair" popcorn. So I got the Presto popcorn popper that goes in the microwave and works either with or without oil. If you get the 2.5oz size pack of Northern popcorn, you can easily split it in half and make 2 batches. (The Presto popper is too small for a 2.5oz pkg all at once.) This stuff tastes great. Yeah, I know palm oil is horrible for your heart etc. etc., but THAT is what makes all that fake buttery taste so yummy. Like another reviewer said, the salt packet is a quite salty so I only used half (maybe even less) the salt for all of the popcorn in each packet. After looking at several online distributors, at $18.95 (subscription price) Amazon has the best price. 4 1/2 stars

review/summary: Perfect movie night popcorn
review/text: WOW.  This popcorn is delicious.  We purchased a large 4oz popcorn machine for our game room family movie nights.  When it first arrived, I wanted to try it immediately.  So, I bought some Orville's at the store and I was disappointed with both the number of popped kernels and the taste.  After the Great Northern popcorn arrived, I was immediately hooked on the flavor and ease of use.  The packages are easy to use and the product tastes great.  Our family only uses about half of the salt flavoring and can not tell a difference in quality of the taste.  My son says it tastes better than at the movies.  Now when we go out to see a movie, we keep the popcorn bag and replicate the experience at home!

review/text: This is a GREAT item -- very easy to use and you have everything you need to make great popcorn.  No worries about whether you have too much oil, too little popcorn, etc.  It includes the buttered flavoring in powdered form.  But you can also not use the flavoring if you prefer....and use your own if you want to change it up.  I highly recommend this product and am ready to purchase my next 24 pack!

When we first purchased our Lincoln Popper from Discount Tommy, I thought I would just make my own blend of salt, butter and other spices.  But I could never get it just right.  After trying Great Northern's theater popcorn, I thought, "Why?"  Not only is the flavor perfect, but the price is right!<br /><br />I love the subscription program with Amazon.  Not only do you receive a discount, but they will automatically send you your popcorn at intervals that you choose.  I'll NEVER run out of popcorn again!!!  Thanks Discount Tommy and Amazon.com.

review/summary: Popcorn Lovers Take Notice
review/text: When I read about Great Northern Popcorn packs, I was skeptical.  I thought it was just another gimmick to get me to buy everything prepackaged at a premium price.  After all, popcorn is all the same, right?  My wife insisted that we try it and I am glad we did.  If you love movie theater popcorn, this will be the closest you will get to making it at home.  I tried others and they just do not compare.  I am not sure if it is the type of oil they use, the type of salt, or the popcorn itself, but this popcorn is second to none.  Also, everything is conveniently measured out for you, so this makes the task of making popcorn so much simpler.  If you try it, you may be surprised how much more popcorn you start to eat!

The fact that the packages contain the oil, seasoning and popcorn all in one is a great feature.  The seasoning is perfect (maybe a little salty for some tastes).  Everyone at our events loves it.

review/text: I had just finished a Theater room in my house and decided the only thing missing was the popcorn! I searched and bought what I thought was the perfect machine and added the gourmet oil and popcorn, turned on the movie and sat back for the movie.  To my surprise, it just wasn't the same, no flavor, not even the smell was the same.  So I searched the web and discovered Great Northern Popcorn in pre-measured portion packs.  It was easy, and the result was just like I had dreamed, fresh great tasting popcorn, with the smell of a movie theater.  I highly recommend Great northern Popcorn for any event and any machine, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: THE popcorn for movie theater popcorn lovers
review/text: I am one of those people who MUST have popcorn when I go to a movie. Many times, its my favorite part of the movie.<br /><br />So, I finally bought a movie style popcorn popper because I didnt like the taste of microwave popcorn.<br /><br />When I first got my popcorn popper, I just went to the grocery store, picked up a bag of popcorn, some of that powered popcorn butter flavoring and some vegetable oil. It did the job but, like microwave popcorn, just didnt replicate the taste of movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I searched and read tons of reviews on Amazon and finally decided to order this brand.<br /><br />MY GOD! This IS it! With my first batch, I was blown away by the taste. This tastes exactly like the movie theater popcorn. If not better because you KNOW its fresh.<br /><br />First: The 2.5 ounce packet is enough of a serving for a person. I popped 2 of packets the first time and it was the equivalent of one of those huge buckets you'd get at the theater. I had to share. haha.<br /><br />Second: When I received the box of packets, I thought the oil was going to be a liquid. Its actually a solid. I had first thought I received a old batch but no, thats how its supposed to be.<br /><br />Third: Like the packets tell you... let your popper heat for about 5 minutes, then slide the "solid" oil contents into the popper as well as the corn/salt mix. All at the same time.<br /><br />It takes about 2-3 minutes before the popping starts but it'll pop up a TON of popcorn. And again, the taste. WOW! This is the popcorn I've been looking for.

review/summary: Delicious, Quality Popcorn
review/text: I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!

review/summary: Perfect for a home theatre popper
review/text: I love this popcorn, and with the subscription savings of 15% and free shipping that you get on subscription products, this stuff is a bargain.<br /><br />I used to use th 4oz kits with my Whirley Pop and it made delicious popcorn every time.  I moved to the 8oz bags when my Matinee Movie 8oz popper arrived from Discount Tommy.  The 8oz bags have nearly twice the yield of the 4 oz kits and are less than 4 dollars a case more (Thats only .16 more a kit for double the batch)<br /><br />My 8oz popper creates a little more old maids because the kettle is designed to spit out the corn on the bottom of the tray as it pops.<br /><br />The 8oz kit is a bit big for home use unless you actually have a commercial style popper.  There are very few oil based poppers (electric or stove) that can handle the yield of these kits, and if you have a Whirly Pop or Stir Crazy then I would get the 4oz kits.<br /><br />If you have a commercial style 8oz popper I would totally recommend these.<br /><br />The funny thing is that the 4oz kits have instructions for hot air machines.  They say just don't use the oil.  Are you kidding me!?!?  It's the coconut oil and the butter salt that give this stuff it's "movie theatre" taste.<br /><br />Buying this stuff for a hot air machine is just plain dumb.  Well, using a hot air machine for popcorn is just plain dumb, but that's just my opinion....  ;-)

review/summary: 4 oz. Great American Popcorn Portion Packs
review/text: We purchased a popcorn machine for our media room which called for the 4oz. packs of popcorn. The machine was purchased at Sam's Club where the popcorn packs were not available. Not finding this in town, we went to Amazon where we found exactly what we needed. It works perfectly in our machine. One thing to be aware of: the butter/oil packet comes solid and you squeeze it into the machine. When we first opened the case we thought that the butter/oil was old and had solidified. We needed to look it up on the Great American Popcorn site to assure ourselves that we did not need to send it back. It makes wonderful movie theatre style popcorn.

review/summary: One word....Amazing!
review/text: I used the 4oz size which is just perfect for me and my wife.  My wife loves popcorn and can eat a whole large tub all by herself...but this 4 ozsize packet could easily feed 3-4 people for movie night and completely fills my Stir Crazy popper.  I dont melt the oil like some reviewers said to do since it arrived solid...I just pour all of the popcorn first spread out over my popper and then squeeze out little blobs of the oil here and there over the popcorn.  Worked perfectly and I had maybe 2 unpopped kernels.  The popcorn was very large and fuffy just like you get at the movies.  When the popcorn is done I sprinkle a little of the salt then shake the popcorn around, sprinkle a little more, toss again then put the rest on...turned out perfectly and I am not sure why some people say it tasty overly salty?  Perhaps they are just dumping it all on?  This is fine salt made for popcorn and it sticks to the popcorn very well so I would do what I did and just pour a little on to the top of the popcorn, shake the bowl, put some more, shake again and so on so your popcorn is unformely covered.  The popcorn is spot on like the movie popcorn and I love the taste.  I would stick with the 4oz size and get a Stir Crazy popper...they are great and cook pretty much all of the kernels thanks to the little arm that slowly moves around on the service to keep the kernels spread evenly and to help coat all of the kernels with oil so they pop perfectly.  Oh..and the popcorn is just as light and fluffy the next day...I didn't even cover it.  I would highly recommend trying this popcorn and I will continue to buy this brand only from now on.  I have tried all of the gourmet brands at the local stores and this beats it by far...and the ease of use makes this a winner.  Cut the popcorn and oil pouches and put in your popper...when popcorn is done, cut the salt pouch and sprinkle, toss, sprinkle, toss...enjoy :)

review/text: As a lover of popcorn, over the course of my half century on this planet, I've pretty much run the gamut on the variety of ways to eat this delight -- over the stove, the air popper and then by nuking it. All were fads that faded over time. Then, through the greatness of Amazon, I found the Whirley popper, and ordered their popcorn to go along with it. It was great, albeit a bit expensive. Then I discovered Great Northern's Great American popcorn.<br />Not only was the Great American popcorn cheaper in price, but by comparison, the six-ounce package I ordered was larger than the similarly-packaged Whirley Pop at 5.5 ounces. The taste was probably about the same, although psychologically it tasted better to me because of the better value.<br />I probably went a little overboard, but thanks to the special 99-cent shipping at the time, I purchased three 24-count cases.<br />Each of these packages produces a whole lotta popcorn, which if not eaten right away, is still really good a week to 10 days later.<br />Just a great value for middle aged people who could use a little great-tasting ruffage in their systems!<br />Gotta go; feel another batch coming on!!!

review/summary: 8 oz Great american popcorn
review/text: I have a box of this popcorn and a box of Pop Weaver popcorn. No offense to Pop Weaver popcorn because I think it also tastes great. But I like the flavor of the Great American popcorn better. As for unpopped kernels, yes there are unpopped kernels. I think there will always be unpopped kernels. The trick to good popcorn is to turn the heat off when the popping slows. That's where the unpopped kernels come from. I suspect you could get less unpopped kernels if you like burnt popcorn. As for the taste, I think the taste is pretty close to the theater popcorn. The only difference to me is no hot butter. If you want to go EXACTLY like a theater, buy one of those hot butter melters like the theater has. Otherwise it is a great tasting popcorn. The 8 ounce packets give you a lot of popcorn. I believe I remember the packets for the 8 ounce machine saying it has 10 ounces of popcorn in each bag. Great American popcorn from this store seemed to have the best price I could fine and (in my opinion) is definately better tasting than other types of popcorn.

review/summary: Best popcorn!
review/text: "Santa" brought our family a "real" popcorn machine from Discount Tommy's a few years ago.  We have used it almost every weekend since then!  I had been concerned about the amount of microwaved popcorn my family was eating and thought this would be somewhat healthier.  We have really enjoyed the Great Northern Popcorn--all we have ever used in our machine.  The pre-packaged all-you-need ingredients are so convenient!  If we ever wear our machine out, I know that "Santa" will bring us another machine from Discount Tommy's and a huge box of Great Northern Popcorn again!

review/summary: Perfectly Popped
review/text: We've ordered Great Northern Popcorn from Discount Tommy for about a year now. The popcorn is for a machine we keep in our employee lunch room for "Popcorn Fridays".  The portion packs are great because anyone can just snip off the top and pour it into the kettle.  No measuring or mess to clean up afterwards.  And the balance of butter and salt is perfect (other brands can be too salty or too greasy).  We've tried other brands but the employees complained about the taste so we switched back to Great Northern and everyone is happy again. It tastes (and smells) just like the popcorn from your favorite movie theatre.  Yum!!

review/summary: Movie theater popcorn at home!!!!
review/text: For mother's day, I surprised my wife with a Great Northern Popcorn Machine and a case of the Great Northern Popcorn Tri-Pack.  The machine works flawlessly and the popcorn was absolutely delicious.  At about $1/per popping, the results couldn't be better or most cost effective.  The machine was easy to assemble, and adding the pre-packaged and pre-measured popcorn ingredients was a snap.  Delicious homemade popcorn in our theater room is a huge hit with the family and friends.  I highly recommend Great Northern Popcorn products.  A reputable company that stands behind its products, and delivers.

review/text: I first found this company on ebay.  I purchased one of their poppers and popcorn.  Shipping was quick and the popcorn was awesome.  Love how simple to make the popcorn with all the fixings in the bag.  If someone is on a reduced sodium diet it is very simple to not allow some or all of the butter flavored salt to go into the hopper.  I've found just the oil has a great flavor too!<br /><br />Floyd

review/text: My whole family have been eating this popcorn for years, popping it in "Tommy's" 8-oz popper while watching movies in our outdoors movie theater. It's so good, on the rare occasion we do go to the "Indoor Movie Theater", my kids don't want "Movie Theater Popcorn" because what we make at home is better. With Tommy's, we can experiment with different salts and additives (cheddar, butter buds, etc), and it pops wonderfully. It's almost all we eat. You won't be disappointed!!

review/text: This is now our favorite popcorn. We have long since stopped using microwave popcorn because it was either too greasy or chewy. So, we went back to popping kernels in oil on the stove until we bought a popcorn machine. Now, we gave away our other popcorn and all we use is the Great Northern Popcorn portion packs. The popcorn comes out perfect everytime with great taste. It is salted just right, very light, and not greasy. Highly recommend this product.

I see bad reviews for unpopped corn but I have very few with "Great Northern Popcorn" in the Stir Crazy popper! The corn pops so big that the top of the popper rises up and spills some on the counter.

review/summary: Great Popcorn - even 2 days later!
review/text: I bought a blue foundation 8oz popcorn machine from Discount Tommy along with a case of this popcorn.  The smell alone - oh my!  Makes my entire basement smell like a movie theater!  The popcorn, after the 2nd time when I actually followed the directions and gave it some time for the bottom heating element to "dry" the popcorn, is fantastic!  I've seem some negative reviews regarding it being mushy - obviously they either do not have an adequate popcorn make that heats well enough to dry it after all the steam/moisture the machine creates popping it in the first place or they did like me my first time through and couldn't wait to eat it immediately!  This popcorn is even good 2 days later if you turn your upper light/bottom heat on for an hour or so first to freshen it up - still tastes like it did the 1st day!  Leave out the "powder" bit and go to food.com and search for "Best Seller Caramel Corn" for a real treat!!!

review/text: This popcorn not only tastes great but pops very well.  There are some unpopped kernels, but I believe that's normal with any brand.  In reading a few of the other reviews, some noted it didn't pop well.  I went through that phase too but found out it was a problem with my popper.  Once that was fixed, the popcorn popped up a storm!  Many friends who have visited my home theater have commented on what good flavor the Great Northern Popcorn has--and it has a great price too.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: This popcorn is just like movie theater popcorn, only WAY cheaper!  Plus, you can use it either in your popcorn machine or on the stove, just make sure you use a large pot (like a spaghetti pot) because it makes a lot of popcorn.  One packet feeds 3-5 people, it's good stuff.

review/summary: Great Northern Popcorn is Great!
review/text: We all love it. I have a "Man Cave" in my basement with a popcorn machine. All my friends and family love the popcorn I pop. I now use nothing but Great Northern. I also have a small machine in the main area of our house and use nothing but Great Northern in it as well. Great taste, very tasteful seasonings, includes the seasonings and oil. We love it!

review/summary: I'm now a popcorn fan!!!
review/text: I never really cared for popcorn before...at least none of the "home" popcorn.  The only place I'd eat popcorn was at the theaters because the butter flavor was so good.  I purchase a kettle popper for our home and ran across a deal Great Northern Popcorn...... OMG it is GOOD!!  Just like the movies but way cheaper and I can enjoy it in the comfort of my own home!  YUMMY!!!
