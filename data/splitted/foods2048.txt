review/text: This is the best gluten-free pancake mix that we have found.  It is not a rice base which is nice for a change.  We really prefer Pamela products in general.  My daughters are excited to be able to eat good pancakes again.  you don't even notice that they are not "regular" pancakes.

review/summary: Our favorite multi-purpose baking mix
review/text: Pamela's products are some of our favorites, and the baking & pancake mix is at the top of that list. It makes great pancakes, but isn't limited to just those. Everything we've made with this mix has been flavorful with a pleasant texture. A lot of gluten-free mixes and products have a grainy texture to them, but Pamela's products are light and fluffy.<br /><br />For those who have an issue with dairy in addition to gluten, there is some dried buttermilk powder in the mix, but it hasn't yet caused any issues for my wife or me and we've been using the mix for about 5 years now.

review/summary: Best general GF mix ever
review/text: I have been GF for 7 years. This mix is by far the best general baking mix that I have found. It makes outstanding pancakes which the non GF family members actually prefer over wheat based ones and I now have friends using it who are not even GF just because it tastes so good and has an excellent texture. I like it for banana bread also and it works great as a flour coating for browning meats. I have tried to replicate the mix myself but can't come close.

review/summary: Easy and tasty biscuits
review/text: Purchased to give to a friend recently diagnosed with celiac disease.  Had to try before giving it to her.  I used cold butter instead of shortening when I made this.  (I'm a butter lover.)  I made six biscuits, perfect size for one person (my husband hates homemade biscuits). So good I ate four of them right away.  They have a different taste than regular biscuits but very pleasing and as drop biscuits easy to make.  I haven't made any other recipes with the mix but if the biscuits are any indication, this will be good.  I will be using this even though I don't have to eat gluten free.

review/text: The pancakes are better than my own buttermilk gluten pancakes.  I buy this mix not because I'm gluten intolerant but because they are the best pancake mix I have found.  I have tried french crepes with them as well and they are perfect every time.  There is no grittiness that is often the case with these mixes and the pancakes could not be fluffier.  I cannot wait to try more of this brand.  My other favorite is Namaste (they have a great bread mix).

review/text: I never thought there would be another flaky biscuit or traditional tasting cookie from my kitchen! This gluten free baking and pancake mix is a great find.  I had previously been mixing several ingredients for basic flour use so when this product was recommended I was more than willing to try it.  I am so glad I did.  I would recommend Pamela's to anyone that needs to eat gluten free.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMJWZO">Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix, 4-Pound Bags (Pack of 3)</a>

review/summary: WOW best pancakes I've ever had!
review/text: My boyfriend has Celiac and we got this mix to feed his craving for pancakes. The reviews do not lie, this makes the most wonderful pancakes I've ever had. Perfect texture and amazing flavor (I think the almond meal contributes quite a bit), haven't tried making anything else with the mix but will as soon as we get a 4 lb bag. The price is a little steep but worth it for the flavor, if you have a wheat allergy or Celiac. I don't have any issues with gluten, but these pancakes will be the only ones I make from now on. You will have a very difficult time believing these are gluten free.

review/text: I was blown away by how amazing this baking mix is.  I made the recipes on the back of the bag and they were incredible.  I have been sensitive to gluten for years and have tried EVERY gluten-free product out there.  Once you try this stuff, your search for a good flour substitute will be over.  Guaranteed.  The simple drop biscuits actually puff up and are light and delicious (I added garlic powder, oregano, and shredded cheese to approximate the Red Lobster biscuits - they didn't disappoint!)  The pancakes/waffles are fluffy and wonderful, and they even freeze and reheat (toaster) perfectly.  My 1 year old loves this stuff and you will too.  Thank you Pamela's!!

review/text: I had my coffee with donut holes this morning - GLUTEN FREE. If you can't eat wheat, you know that this is MAJOR.  I have tried Bob' red mill and other kinds i find in our local PCC, but Pamela's mix is by far the best and most "neutral" in flavor (no strong bean flour taste or have grits).  Have used the same pamela mix for pancakes and batter for chicken finger, waffles.  All turn out amazing.  There are a lot of recipes on Pamela's site to experiment!<br /><br />back to the donut holes - they tastes like the Dunkin' Donuts "cake donut".  My kids coated them with cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar... we have gone to heaven and came back.

I have been able to make ANY recipe using this product as a 1:1 replacement and it works, and more importantly, tastes, GREAT!!  Purchasing it here at Amazon is much cheaper than the health food stores, too.<br /><br />For those of you who have been gluten free for a long time, I might caution you to take it easy when introducing this product to your diet.  If you are like me, you've just done without a lot of grains, and your system will need some adjustment time.

It is AWESOME, and I have received it through the subscribe and save program for a while now and it has always come fresh and on time.<br /><br />This mix is a very tasty and easy mix to use.  I have used both the pancake and waffle recipes and both have turned out great--though my kids prefer the pancake version.  They come out fluffly and light!  The only caution: careful, they are addictive!

review/text: I have Celiacs and I think other celiacs can agree with me when I say that we have figured good tasting food just isn't going to be apart of our diets. Well not with this mix and all of Pamela products. Let me tell you she knows what shes doing. I make peanut butter cookies that some people say taste BETTER then the wheat version (and I use flax oil butter and organic peanut butter as well as 1/2 white sugar1/2 stevia and its actually healthy!). I make pancakes that are so good I cant believe my taste buds. I love to make PB&J sandwiches with the thick pancakes and it is the best. So me and my Celiac sis swear by all Pamelas products. You should definitely try the bread mix you will be amazed. One other thing I think Pamelas products save on not having to make commercial because word of mouth is doing just fine.

review/text: Pamela's ultimate mix is the best I have ever found.  I have tried so many other brands to make pancakes, pie crust, bread, and there are none that compare.  My son has autism and it is so hard to be on a wheat/gluten free diet.  I also have 3 other kids to feed and no one really likes the way these speacial food items taste.  Now that I have found Pamela's products, my whole family wants me to bake all the time.  I have made pancakes - excellent! and pie crust.  The crust does not come out like regular white flour crust.  It is more crumbly and harder to get out of the pie plate all in one piece.  It does taste very good.  I have had guests over and they still love the crust.  The pancakes taste better than even the Krustze mix I have used for over 15 years.

review/text: This would come as a shock to anyone who knows me, but , yes we have found a GF product that is actually decent. Not just decent..it's GOOD. This is one of the few GF copy products that is actually as good if not better than its gluten counterpart.<br /><br />they do take a bit longer to cook, you need to be careful to cook them thoroughly inside....low heat....also for some reason when you pre-make the mix it mysteriously thickens profoundly overnight....but anyway it is a solid hot breakfast for a hungry family.<br /><br />This mix can also be used as a filler within other products or mixes in the place of flour. It has a leavener so whatever you add it to will puff up a bit.<br /><br />I rather resent having to pay so much just to feed my family pancakes...but since that is my reality, they might as well taste decent. Go Go Pamela!

The one product that never seemed to work was a substitute for flour to make pancakes, waffles, cakes, pies, breads and cookies. Then I tried Pamela's and everything changed. This stuff is actually better tasting than wheat flour. It is truly delicious and makes absolutely great baked goods.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: I love this baking mix! This same mix can be used for banana bread, pancakes, waffles, muffins, and more. You start with this mix add 3-4 other basic ingredients and you are ready to start baking. Quick and easy! The recipes are all on the back of the bag.<br /><br />The thickness of the pancakes or waffles depends on how thick you layer the batter on the griddle. When they are fresh off of the griddle they'll have a firm surface similar to corn bread. When you pile them in a holding dish while you are baking, the surface will soften if you put a cover over it. The steam and moisture will collect on them and soften them. So, if you want the firm surface to remain, don't store them in a way that allows the steam to collect on them.<br /><br />I've had great success baking these, storing them in the fridge for a couple of days, and then re-heating them.<br /><br />The taste is amazing. After eating it, I don't get the bloating and stomach ache I used to get with regular wheat-based pancake mixes.<br /><br />Did I say I love this mix? I make pancakes almost every weekend. Yum!

review/summary: Another gluten-free must!
review/text: This baking mix is amazing.  I have used it for all of the suggested basics (waffles, pancakes, muffins, biscuits, etc.), but I have also substituted it for flour in nearly all of my old baked goods recipes.  Cookies, quick breads, pound cakes, scones - you name it.  It works great!  Pamela's has basically done the heavy lifting for you - they have found a blend of gluten-free flours that create light, delicious baked goods.  No one I have ever served them to has been able to tell the difference.  The only difficulty is that there is leavening and salt already in the mix, so you may need to slightly adjust your old recipes in order to accomodate this, removing (or lessening) baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  But this is an easy adjustment and the results are terrific!  As a side note, I have used and would recommend Pamela's GF bread mix for regular bread and bagels... I have not attempted either with the baking mix, but the bread mix works great.

review/summary: I feel normal again after discovering Pamela's!
review/text: I don't even know what prompted me to buy this product when I did but I must say it's been my best gluten-free purchase so far!<br /><br />After buying horrible-tasting, gluten-free products, it was refreshing to find a ready-to-use, gluten-free flour blend that tastes like "real" flour.  I initially bought it only to make pancakes and I was pleased at how they tasted (though flat.  I think I will try the seltzer water as mentioned). I'd been craving chocolate chip cookies like mad and made some with another gluten-free flour brand and the cookies were dry and the required xantham gum all by itself costs $10 for a flat package smaller than my hand.  I refused to spend lots of money every time I wanted to make cookies, then one day I decided to make Pamela's recipe on the package.  These are by far the best chocolate cookies I've ever had in my life!<br /><br />I've also eaten her store-bought chocolate chip cookies. It's $4 for 9 cookies.  The packaged cookies are good, but the homemade cookies made with her flour tastes way better.<br /><br />Now that I can order this flour in bulk, I will start experimenting with other recipes using this flour. It's too expensive to use the small bags ($6-$7 for 16 oz.) if you plan to do a lot of baking. I had been buying the gluten-free rice bread but for $6 per tiny loaf, and it's just awful.  My mom gave me a bread machine and I'm looking forward to making my own breads with Pamela's flours.<br /><br />To anyone who is gluten-intolerant and pondering if they should purchase Pamela's products, don't ponder anymore!  Pamela's are the best gluten-free products on the market.

I recently had the opportunity to meet Pamela herself at a cooking demo in New York and she is a wonderful, down-to-earth person who truly cares about producing a quality, easy-to-use product for those on a gluten-free diet.

review/summary: Yummy pancakes and waffles
review/text: Making gluten-free pancakes with this mix is incredibly easy. The sorghum flour in the mix gives them a lovely, nutty taste that goes perfectly with syrup. They cook up nice and light, with great color. We've also made gluten-free waffles and recommend that you use the slightly more involved recipe instructions for a great result.

review/text: Another great product from Pamela. I have used this for a number of years to make, pancakes, waffles and muffins.<br />I usually make a double batch and freeze them. This is a gluten free product that is not heavy. It is very easy to<br />purchase from Amazon and have it shipped. I am a senior citizen and can't drive to the health food stores only to find<br />that they are out or don't carry the product.

review/text: My family has been using this baking mix for several years now.  I have a wheat sensitivity, so we try to avoid wheat when possible.  We love the pancakes, chocolate chip cookies, and banana muffins you can make with the mix - even our picky 1.5 year old son loves them!  We recently discovered additional recipes on Pamela's Products website and plan to try some of those too.  As a side note...Amazon also sells Pamela's chocolate brownie mix.  If you love rich and very chocolatey brownies, these are for you!  To die for!

review/text: This baking mix is not only yummy, but versatile as well. You can make the normal baking mix items like; biscuits, muffins and dumplings (not listed on website, just add an egg to the biscuit recipe and reduce the milk a tad.) But you can also use it to make a nice yeast bread recipe, perfect for sandwiches. I've also used the biscuits for meatloaf. Try this!

review/summary: Pamela's Pancake Mix
review/text: I have Celiac Sprue, a genetic nutitional disease which makes me intolerant of gluten found in wheat, rye, barley, and oats.  The normal for Gluten Free food is lack of flavor and a desire for "seconds"  Pamela has done away with those drawbacks with her pancake mix.  My wife who does not have Celiac Disease loves the pancakes made from Pamela's Pancake Mix and joins me in an excellent breakfast daily.

review/summary: Best Gluten-free Pancake Mix!
review/text: I have been struggling to find ready-made mixes for my now six-year-old child ever since she was diagnosed with Celiac Disease two years ago.  I have gone through A LOT of flours, mixes, recipes and baking disasters.  My daughter also has a sensitivity to corn - there aren't many mixes or products that are free of corn (cornstarch, corn flour, traditionally-made baking powder, etc.) and this one is essentially (if not totally) free of corn.  It also produces awesome pancakes, an easy coating for chicken nuggets, a thickener in place of wheat flour for stew broth, and it totally flies under the radar of the rest of the family as being a GF mix. I stock up on the 3-pack of the 4 lb. bags now because I use it almost every day.  I've never reviewed anything before, but thought that this might actually help someone struggling with how to feed a GF child.

Upon discovering Pamela's Baking Mix I was pleasantly surprised that I could make Gluten Free pancakes, pound cake, pumpkin bread (etc) that my family enjoyed eating too!  I'm very happy to have found this product as there aren't many mixes out there that are so versatile and relatively inexpensive.  Pamela's Mix also lasts a while too, so you aren't having to buy yet another mix every time you turn around.  I highly recommend this product.

Pancakes are fluffy and breads and cakes soft and moist. I use for all types of breads, banana, raisin, sweet potato. I even used it for baking an apple pie. I have recommended it to friends who are not even gluten intolerant, and all are fans now. If you have tried other mixes and did not like the taste try this one you will be glad.

review/text: I use this product a lot when I need to 'dust' something with flour or am in the mood for some yummy blueberry pancakes. I mixed the flour with some spices and coated beef for beef stew and it turned out perfect.<br /><br />For people who are new to gluten-free and reading the negative reviews, remember that you are used to over processed gluten-full foods and mixes so not every gluten-free product may taste perfect at first. This one worked for me from the beginning, but other products weren't so great at first. Now that I'm more used to them, I enjoy the things I once disliked.

review/summary: Best gluten free flour ever
review/text: My boyfriend is gluten intolerant, and also was raised very Italian. So, pasta, breads, cakes, etc were his staples. It's been very hard to make gluten free versions, but the cakes, pancakes, and sweet breads I've made with this mix have been perfect. Everyone in the house feels that the gluten free cinnamon coffee cake I make is better then the gluten ones (Krusteze mix and store bought). Definitely the best pancakes ever. Occasionally you have to work with other things to get the texture you want, but on it's own it is close. Making cornbread with this is heavenly as well.<br /><br />It's convenient since there's already baking powder in it, and it's versatile. Even has made for a tasty beer batter on fish and onion rings. It's an absolute necessity in a gluten free kitchen.

Also, I just followed the recipe on the bag for zucchini muffins and I can't believe how good they are.  It's the first truly delicious baked good I've had since going gluten free.  Even my non-celiac boyfriend loves them.  The chocolate chip cookies made from this flour aren't quite as good as the real thing, but way better than anything else I've tried yet.

review/text: I do not have celiac (that I know of) but am trying to adapt to a gluten free lifestyle to help with autoimmune issues. I just feel better gluten free. A dear friend of mine turned me on to Pamela's and I fell in love! I had been paying almost $20 per 4lb bag at my local health food store and finally decided to order from amazon. I ordered on Friday afternoon 7/24 and UPS had my shipment to my door on Monday morning 7/27. I was VERY impressed! I have made killer pancakes, zucchini bread, banana bread, and AMAZING chocolate chip cookies. My entire family is enjoying this yummy baking mix! Thanks Pamela's and Amazon!<br /><br />By the way, my shipment came in a sealed Pamela's box inside of an amazon box and does not expire for over a year. I have been a local amazon customer for more years than I can count and have never received anything expired. Please pay no mind to that. :o)

review/summary: THE VERY BEST GLUTEN FREE BAKING MIX!
review/text: I love this mix because I've been able to use it to recreate some old family recipes, the ones Grandma would make for us as kids which I have such fond memories of. Who could ask for more than that? It doesn't have any bean flour in it so it doesn't have that aftertaste that is common in other mixes. There are some great recipes on Pamela's Website as well, especially the one for Cornbread. It really taste good to mix butter(or margarine) with some roasted pecans and a little honey as a topping for it. It makes really good pancakes too. The bread recipe makes a nice loaf, but I would consider it a desert bread, so although it does ok even if it isn't toasted, it's not really good for sandwiches, but it does work very well when you spread jelly or a chocolate/hazelnut spread on it. I buy this from amazon, it's a great price esp compared to the local health food store.
