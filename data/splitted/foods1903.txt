review/summary: Great Formula, with great ingredients
review/text: All infant formulas have the same ratios of nutrients - that's mandated by the government.  However, the ingredients used to source those nutrients, that's what's important.  Earth's Best is organic, and made with wholesome organic ingredients that you would actually want to put into your infant's body.<br /><br />My son was breast fed, but I couldn't make enough to meet his requirements when I went back to work.  I tried Infamil once, and he threw it up.  Earth's Best, he actually looked forward to drinking.<br /><br />Do you know that formula manufacturers used to remove Omega 3's from formula?  Because it decreases shelf life.  So be prepared to use the can within a month of opening it.<br /><br />Also, if your infant is allergic to soy, this product is not soy-free (It has soy oil).

review/summary: Earths Best is the BEST !!
review/text: Because the Earths Best Formula saved me tons of sleep I rate it a 5 stars !! Our baby was fussy, trouble being regular and sleeping thru<br />the night.. Our Doctor recomended we change to Earth Best and WOW<br />it has been great. I feel good feeding Organic. The best part is the<br />price...This is the Monster size can ! I looked at other web sights<br />and amazon.com has the best price and so much cheaper than stores.<br /><br />We saved an extra 15% by getting it auto shipped. I would also highly<br />recomend the Eaths Best baby food jars on amazon also. We get a couple of the variey packs shipped on subscribe and save.. that has saved me more than one late night trip to the stores<br /><br />A happy baby and happy wife....mean a very rested and happy Dad !!

review/summary: Formula is fine, but I'm not so sure I'd call it "Earth's Best"...
review/text: ... in fact it might just be the exact same formula as your closest local/national grocery store brand but with the added bonus of costing about 30% more. We had recently been using this formula until we ran out and I had to make an emergency run to the local grocery store for a quick replacement. The closest thing they had was their organic store brand. Funny thing is, when I got home to compare the two I noticed the ingredients are EXACTLY the same as well as some of the machine writing on the bottom of the cans where you can find the sell by date. From what I can gather after doing a bit of research the formula ingredients used to be different but have recently changed without letting customers know. Virtually all store brand organic formulas come from one manufacturing plant whether you buy it at store X or Y and it seems that Earth's Best is now being produced in this same facility but charging a premium price. I suggest checking this out for yourself, you might be able to save some money.

review/summary: So disappointed...
review/text: I used Earth's Best 3 years ago for our 1st son. We have a new baby, and I was shocked to find that they had changed lactose to glucose solids (SUGAR). In Europe the practice of adding corn syrup and glucose to infant formula has been banned. All organic formulas in the US have now switched from lactose to a syrup solid or glucose. We are switching to HIPP organic from the UK which is available on Amazon and a british store website. Plus Earth's Best practice of how they get the DHA/ARA is very questionable. #FAIL

I was nervous that he wouldn't like the taste or smell of formula after having pure breastmilk for 7 months and he had no problem with this formula.  It's also so reassuring to know that this is organic and high quality.  It's only a couple more dollars than the non-organic stuff!  It's wonderful and we are VERY pleased!

review/summary: Corn Syrup Solids in Disguise.
review/text: This product gets 2 stars for being organic and having no GEI's. However, when I checked out the ingredient list and saw "glucose syrup", I was suspicious. I contacted customer service and asked them what the glucose was derived from. This is the answer that I got:<br /><br />"The glucose syrup is from corn syrup solids.  It is a source of carbohydrates and is included to meet the label's nutrition claim for carbohydrate."<br /><br />Very disappointing, as I really try to keep our diet free from corn syrup and other unhealthy fillers. I don't want my baby to drink this.

review/summary: If you're forced to use formula...
review/text: My wife and I were avid and determined to breast feed as long as our daughter needed. At 8 months my wife got sick and her supply was shot so we had to supplement. I did countless hours of grudging research and while I believe there is no true replacement for breast milk this was the product we felt best giving. Daughter had no reactions and drinks it fine, milestones are well hit and growth is still on curve. Seems like a decent replacement if you choose or are forced to one.

review/summary: Great Formula
review/text: We started using this one after a month of reseach on organic formulas.  The bad thing is that when we run out of this we have to go to a store too far from us to get it as our baby will not drink any other formula and we love that the company is so responsive to our questions.  Now if more mainstream stores carried this I would be a very happy mom!  My 6 month old loves this the foods (she refuses to eat any other brand) and we are just now trying out the diapers from Earths best due to the fact that the pampers and some huggies have caused her to break out in rashes.

review/summary: Happy baby with Earth's Best formula
review/text: We tried different types of formula before deciding on this brand. Our 6 month old baby daughter was too sensitive to all other formulas out there. One would make her gassy and fussy, others would give her either diarrhea, or constipation. I was getting really discouraged and thought I'd have to breastfeed till she's 1. Luckily after the first bottle of Earth's Best she was fine. Now she's a healthy 11 month old and even though I am excited that we can soon stop giving her formula, I am a little sad because I am so used to relying on just this one product on her complete nutrition. I definitely recommend this product to others especially if they can take advantage of the "Subscribe&Save" option.

review/summary: The best option out there
review/text: I didn't use organic for my older kids, as it wasn't really available then.  With # 3, it was a must.  After researching formulas, we started with Similac organic since it is easiest to find in stores.  We were supplementing with formula, so I wasn't overly concerned about the sugar.  After a few weeks, we noticed that our baby was regularly constipated, and it took about a week (and reading reviews on amazon) to put it together. I moved over to Earth's best and within days, she was back to normal.  I couldn't believe it!<br /><br />That said, I do have a one small problem with this formula.  Because of the source of the DHA, the formula has a faint fishy smell.  We had one horrible can recently that smelled disgusting.  I figured that I got a bad batch and called the company.  The formula rep called me back and explained that the formula was fine, but the smell can sometimes be unpleasant.  My baby wouldn't drink it!  They were very nice to deal with and refunded my money.  I also looked online and read that Earth's best was pulled from the shelves in 2007 for the same problem.  From what I learned, cans that sit on shelves too long can get that smell.  I had to go to 4 stores to find another can, since the local Target only had cans from the lot with the funny smell.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy with Earth's best and will continue to use it.

review/summary: My Daughter loves this formula!
review/text: We tired so many formulas before Earth's Best--all the Enfamils, all the Gerber Easy Starts, and finally our pediatrician told us to try Earth's Best--my daughter loved it from the start.  First, I tasted the other formulas, and they definitely were not as 'tasty' as this.  Second, it's organic, what beats that?! Third, our doctor swore by it.  The only complaint is it made my daughter constipated.  Despite this, our doctor still encouraged us to stick with the Earth's Best, and once a day we feed her a bottle of 3oz water, 1 oz prune and that does the trick.  No fussing, no cramps and no gas.  The best part is my daughter is not only off the charts developmentally but also has gone through the cold season with only 2 days worth of the sniffles.  :-)

review/summary: Best for "spitty" and "gassy" babies!
review/text: This formula is the the best formula!  I switched to Earth's Best when the formula I was using had been recalled.  Another reason is that my baby was spitting up a lot with the former formula and was extremely gassy but the pediatrician and I thought she was just a "spitty" and "gassy" baby.  Her tummy could not tolerate other formulas either so I was very hesitant about trying Earth's Best at first but I didn't have many other options.  It supposedly has real lactose and is less sweet than some of the other formulas and it has generally good reviews on web sites I researched.  Since we switched to this formula a few months ago, my baby doesn't spit up anymore and she is less gassy.  The formula must be a lot easier to digest for sensitive babies.  As the company's name indicates, it really is the best!!!  I order this formula repeatedly from Amazon b/c you can't beat their price anywhere!

I wish they'd make a gentler organic milk formula too.<br />At 8 weeks we have gone back and tried this formula again b/c we had 2 big cans of this left in the cupboard. She has no problems now with this formula at all. So we will now use this from now on since organic milk is important to us.

After a considerable review and research we decided that this is the best one we could find in the market for now.<br /><br />There are several reasons why we picked this over the others..<br /><br />- This is organic (so a lot friendly to the baby as well as the environment).<br />- Pesticide / Chemicals / Hormone Free<br />- This was very very close to breast milk and our DD did have any problems switching back and forth between breast milk and the formula.<br />- The bowl movements were regulated and resembled very close how it would look if she were only breast fed.<br />- Less Gas / Less Iritations<br />- AMAZON's amazing price offer (on Subscription).

review/summary: Great & Green!  And it un-constipated our Baby Boy!
review/text: Our son was on Similac Organic from birth.  At about 3 weeks, he became very fussy and we suspected colic as he would cry for hours.  At about 4 weeks, he had a horrible day--he cried the WHOLE day.  We tried everything but nothing could completely calm him.  The next day, he pooped a very hard poop...and was finally calm.  So the poor guy had been constipated.  We went out and got some prune juice--gave him 1 teaspoon in every other bottle.  And then we decided to switch formulas....<br /><br />Thank goodness we did!  We wanted to stay organic, if we could, so we tried Earth's Best Organic.  It was great--less gassy, burps smelled better (as did the formula itself)--and, most importantly, his poops are normal again!  It did take about 1 week for him to get back to normal (during this time, we kept doing the prune juice & Earth's Best)--his little system sure was messed up!<br /><br />So we highly recommend Earth's Best Organic, esp if you want to go organic and you want an un-constipated baby!

review/summary: CONTAINS GMOs
review/text: My daughter is almost a year old and still breastfeeding. However, I had to have emergency breast surgery when she was 3 months old and she had to take some formula off and on during that time. I chose the Earth's Best brand because I like all of their other products. She seemed to tolerate it fine and we had no issues. Imagine my shock reading the Organic Consumers' email newsletter just now informing me that Earth's Best formula was found to have genetically engineered neutraceuticals (in the DHA). Apparently, Horizon Organic milk does too, which is very angering....if you ask me, if a component of a product has to be GENETICALLY ENGINEERED, that product is clearly not 'organic' and shouldn't carry the organic labeling.<br /><br />The only thing I will say is that the Earth's Best brand is a good brand, and I'm sure this product is still much better than all the conventional brands.....I would still pick this over regular infant formula any day....however, the organic label is misleading in a product that apparently contains GMOs. I don't want GMOs anywhere near my developing child, and until law passes that all GMO food be labeled, I guess you can't even trust organic food now. Buyer beware.

My son did really well on this formula, but was a little gassy, so I decided to give the Sensitive formula a try & ordered 2 cans.  Within just 2 days of him drinking this stuff, he was projectile-vomiting EVERY formula meal, but not the breast milk.  It didn't take long to connect the dots & figure out that somehow it was the formula messing with his stomach.  I did more research & bought the Target brand Advantage formula, and supplemented with infant probiotics.  He's been fine ever since.

review/summary: I feel good about this formula
review/text: That pretty much sums it up.  I mostly breastfed my kids, but when we were ready to switch to formula, I felt good about this one.  Didn't smell or taste chemically, and it was organic.  My second baby had a milk protein sensitivity so when he was younger and I first had to supplement with formula, we had to use Nutramigen and could not use this formula.  I hated the fact that there were no organic options for milk sensitivity (I wish Earth's Best had an option... they have a Lactose Free option but that is not the same thing).  Luckily when he got closer to 1 year he outgrew his sensitivity and we were able to switch him to this formula.  Much happier with this product.

review/summary: If u have to use formula this is the best one By far!!!!!!!!
review/text: I tried & tried & tried to breast feed & after hiring a lactation nurse, taking drugs from here & Canada ... Pumping every 2-3 hours with what looked like a car battery. I finally read in my studies & research that women with bad thyroids sometimes can not breast feed. So there you have it. Then I turned my research to formula & this one is by far the superior formula. My baby bear lives it. He actually likes it room temp.

review/summary: No organic brown rice syrup!
review/text: I wanted to nurse my daughter for a full year, but I had supply problems from the start. I managed to keep at it for 7 months, but I had no choice but to go to formula. Earth's Best made it easier for me to make the transition to formula feeding. I was so grateful that it didn't have brown rice syrup in it (which was found to have high levels of arsenic), and it didn't upset my baby's tummy. I guess it tasted fine, because she took right to it.<br /><br />I almost went with Similac Organic because of name recognition, but then I read about them using organic cane juice, which makes it sweeter than other formulas. Forget that! I'm glad I looked into what was going into the formula.

review/text: My husband and I did a lot of research when I was unable to continue breast feeding our 6-month-old.  When we settled on Earth's Best we saw all our worries about formula fade away.  Our little one eats it well and has not had any issues with it,  and we feel confident we are feeding her the best option for an organic formula.

review/summary: Great product and price with ship and save!
review/text: I wanted to stick with organic formula and tried similac organic but that seemed to give my daughter stomach problems.  She really reacted much better to Earth's Best and it also seemed to be not as thick and foamy as the similac (more like the consistency of breast milk).  This product does go for $35-$45 where I live so doing the ship and save through amazon is by FAR the best price!  I had been getting it shipped for about 4 months now (daughter is 7 months old now) and price has only fluctuated maybe $4-$5 for the pack of 4 containers.  This still at the most breaks down to $23/container- can't beat it!  Easy to mix, occasionally gets little chunks but can be mixed with a quick shake.  Highly recommend for value and quality of the product.

review/summary: Organic Baby Formula
review/text: When my great granddaughter was born, 9 mos. ago, I determined that I would make sure she had organic formula instead of conventional, and organic food, as well. I want her to have the best nutritional start possible for general health and brain development. I was thrilled to be able to purchase Earth's Best in the 31.75 oz. cans through Amazon. The order arrived at my home in a very timely manner, and I am relieved that she has what I consider to be the best possible formula (since she is now on formula) going into her rapidly growing little body.

review/summary: Our Triplets Love It! Very Affordable.
review/text: My wife and I are parents to 9 month old spontaneous triplets. We originally were buying another brand of organic formula (major brand at Target with green lid) prior to giving this brand a try. Our babies had no reaction to switching and enjoy this formula just as they did the other brand. We feel good about providing them an organic formula during the 1st year of their lives and this brand is the cheapest all organic formula we could find that was readily available. Couple that with the 15% subscribe and save discount and you've got yourself a great deal...<br /><br />Since we need to feed 3 babies (now 9 months old) and not just one, saving any amount of money makes a big difference to us. Thanks Earth's Best & Amazon for making our lives a tiny bit easier!!

review/text: You just never know what's in the products you purchase anymore... so it was exciting to find out that they offered an organic baby formula!!  I felt awful when my breast milk production suddenly came to an end, as I really wanted to avoid formula for as long as we could. But my son started on this formula at about 2 months and he loves it.  I tried one canister of Similac (only b/c I hadn't discovered Earths Best yet) and he seemed to spit up a lot after each feeding.  At 4 months old (tomorrow) he's a healthy 18 pound boy.  We are very pleased and look forward to trying the baby food that Earths Best offers for when he's old enough for solids.

review/summary: Earth's Best Organic Infant Formula Review - Price?
review/text: I love this formula! I started using it when I weaned my son off of breastfeeding around 9 months. I would have liked to continue breastfeeding to be honest, as it is better for baby in my opinion, as well as MUCH cheaper, however, I promised myself I would listen to my gut, trust my instincts as a mom and follow his cues, and that just seemed the time to wean so I did. I do love this formula, even with some of these reviews about the toxic stuff and syrup solids - people must realize that NO formula is perfect. A woman has breasts for a reason and no formula will ever compare, in my personal opinion. Not good or bad, just as mother nature intended it. Debating or reviewing the product itself is not the main reason I decided to write this review, however.<br /><br />My main reason for writing this review is the fluctuation of the PRICE. I was going to order last week, however it was almost $100 (with the S&S discount), where I had originally saw it for around $85. I logged back in today and saw it was $84.15 and decided I was going to order it today. A few hours later, when I went to place the actual order, it was $87 something. Now, this really isn't as big of a deal as it is annoying. I would still be paying $29.99 plus tax at Babies 'R Us per can, which is just shy of $130 for four cans, so you still save a considerable amount of money. The way I look at it, I buy 3 and get the 4th can for free ordering them on Amazon. However, what gives, Amazon???? Why does the price seem to change by the hour/day? That's obnoxious. Just a heads up to buyers really...order it when it is priced LOW and it's a phenomenal deal (although you do save money no matter what)!

review/summary: Breast is best...but, Earth's Best rocks!
review/text: I have to admit, I have been a bit snotty when it comes to formula vs breast milk.  An advocate for breastfeeding, I never thought I would need to resort to feeding my baby formula, but my view has changed dramatically over the "debate" when my 5 month old demanded more than my body could produce, leaving me to find another source of food for her.  As a result, I now think formula (at least Earth's Best Organic!) is such a great innovation.  As parents, I think we all strive to give our children the very best, and so in my search for an infant formula, I went to our local health food store (Mother's Market) and came across Earth's Best, read the high quality ingredients and decided that it was worth the extra money.  Thankfully, our daughter responded very well to it and didn't have any lactose issues.  I also like how it has iron, since BF babies lack the nutrient.  Anyway, our daughter has been on Earth's Best Organic going on three months and couldn't be a happier baby.

review/text: Nothings gets passionate moms fired up for debate like formula! If you have decided to offer formula to baby, then I think an organic product is the way to go.<br /><br />We choose Earth's Best because we trust the company and were scared by the many frightenig reports about imported, non-organic formula.<br /><br />We tried all the natural and organic brands and this was the one that baby accepted easily and stayed with. I love that its organic and available in stores, so I can always buy extra if we fall behind in orders. Subscribe & Save also offers this at a very reasonable price and ensures that the cupboard is always full.<br /><br />Some reviewers have commented that it clumps-- I didn't notice any difference in clumping between this brand and others. Shake vigorously and problem should be solved.

review/summary: A good formula for supplementing
review/text: My 2-month-old son didn't gain enough weight in the first two weeks of being exclusively breastfed, so we knew we'd have to supplement with formula, especially considering that human milk banks charge between $3 and $4 an ounce. Of course, we wanted to use something organic, considering that we're trying to avoid chemical exposure as much as possible (glass bottles, cloth diapering, natural detergents, etc.).<br /><br />He likes this formula, and with the Amazon subscribe and save discount, it's much more affordable than buying it in a retail store. It is, however, the first formula we tried. We haven't used anything else, so I don't really have anything to compare it to, other than the expressed breastmilk that my son still gets.

review/text: We did a lot of research on formula for our son - and switched him from the Similac Advanced that we supplemented with for the first few months, after reading the list of ingredients on the side of the container.<br /><br />Switching my son to EB was a breeze - we had absolutely no problems with gas or fussiness. It's a great option for those that can't breast-feed.<br /><br />Regarding the clumping: I typically filter water for my son's bottles in the morning and again in the afternoon, and set the bottles out at room temperature in between. This is how my son prefers his bottles, and I've found that either room-temperature or warmed water helps to break the clumps up and then it's very easy to mix up.

I also picked up Udi's Chocolate chip cookies and something like Brownie bites (looked like mini chocolate muffins).  Of the 3 items, these snickerdoodles were the best.  Great flavor, soft but not mushy- really just all around good!  The chocolate chip cookies were good but pretty sweet for our liking.  The brownie bites had a weird taste in them that hung around; frankly we didn't like them.  We love chocolate but i sure am glad i picked up some of these as they were the best of the 3 and the first to get eaten.  very good.

These must be kept frozen unless of course you or your family eats them quick enough; if kept out they do get dry pretty quickly but otherwise they are great!

review/summary: Best Chips EVER!...and they're GOOD for you!
review/text: We found these at Costco and fell in love with them.  They're SO GOOD...and they're actually good for you.  Since I couldn't find them at Costco the past couple of times I went there, I searched online and found them on Amazon.  Funny...after I ordered them I now see them at my local grocery store chain (Ralph's)...and even on the flight I took across the country last month (United Airlines).  However, I'm still glad I ordered a big box of them because we go through them pretty fast.  :)

review/text: These tortilla chips are delicious!  And they don't contain any bad oils or artificial ingredients.  I am following the Perfect 10 diet (with good success) and these fit on the diet nicely (in moderation of course... it is a starch).  Only way this could be better would be if ingredients were all organic.

review/summary: OMG!!!!  Solves that craving!!
review/text: Oh, YUMMM!!<br />These are THE best chips I have tasted in years.  I am allergic to lactose, gluten, soy, mint and grapes, which has made it hard to go through these past several years craving soda crackers or something akin to them, and even trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with a workable recipe I can make for myself.  Now I have found them!  These are my newest comfort food.  Wonderful with a chilled glass of Diamond Almond Milk, and I am that little kid back in the kitchen sitting with my milk and crackers.  The texture and tender-crisp "bite-factor" (to me) is so close to that of good, old fashioned crackers - - and the flavor is just deeply satisfying.  I will be up in the middle of the night snacking on these for sure.  I cannot rave enough about them, but I see that others agree with me in the quality and "yummy-ness" quotient of these wonderful chips!  To me they taste closer to crackers than tortilla chips and that is SOOOO yummy!<br />Thank you AMZ for putting these on S&S!!!  Come next payday I will need to be getting a whole case, maybe 2!!

review/text: My two year old son and I have Celiac Disease. We can't have gluten, because it makes us very sick. We also both happen to have issues with dairy too. It is very nice that there are AFFORDABLE, delicious snacks like this that we can eat and enjoy. My son loves them, and so do I. The multi-grain are the only flavor we have tried, and we are sold! They are so good. I am so happy to have found these!<br /><br />Most gluten free food is very expensive. Like, Betty Crocker's (albeit delicious) gluten free chocolate cake mix is $3.50 a box, and you get half the amount of a regular Betty Crocker cake mix at 98 cents! It is nice when I find great products that taste good and are inexpensive that we can eat. I am so happy that more companies are finally making gluten free foods!

review/text: I bought these at a grocery store and I had all I could do to not eat the whole bag and then lick the wrapper.  So olive-y! So delicious!!!.  Amazon had all BUT Olive so I waited for notification which came pretty quickly.  I ordered a case and I was....disappointed.  While the lot I received is good, it is not shout-from-the-rooftops good like the first bag.  My case was quite garlicky and slightly burnt flavored, but not really olive-y.  That first bag was so good though, that I will try again.  But not maybe by the case.

review/text: The Olive tortilla chips are tasty, but I certainly would not rate them the best tortilla chip ever.  The olive pieces in the chips are very small and dried.  They impart a light earthy flavor in the background and in no way overwhelm.  These are excellent with dip and do not break easily like some other gourmet chips.

I loved it instant hit with me I would definitly buy these anytime i seen them in a local grocery or back on amazon someday . I think they are unique  and something as I said a different pace and taste definitly worth getting others interested in trying.

review/summary: Good. Different. Not too strong. Could maybe be stronger.
review/text: I'm a pros and cons gal. I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting. Straight up, here's the pros and cons:<br />PROS: Super fresh. Nice portion size, especially because you'll want more than one portion. Attractive on a plate, unlike traditional tortilla chips. Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of "chip-lets" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste. Several people felt it was strong enough. They are definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Average Chip...
review/text: Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly "olive" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of "crunch".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty & healthier substitute for junk-food chips
review/text: Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming  that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories?  If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Olive' line of tortilla chips (think of a white corn tortilla chip with flavor profiles of black and green olives and a hit of garlic) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite.  These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself.  These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel.  Great product all around.

No trans fats, not overly salty, nothing artifical (like the label says...) makes for something a bit different that your typical tortilla chip.<br /><br />You don't need any salsa or cheese on top of them -- the flavor is perfect (if you like the taste of green olives, that is.)

review/text: When looking for snack products, I tend to look for those with the fewest artificial ingredients or no artificial ingredients, if possible.  On this count, chips from Food Should Taste Good easily qualify.  All the ingredients are pronounceable and identifiable (quinoa, pronounced keen-wa, is a South American grain).  I have now tried three of the seven flavors, Chocolate, Sweet Potato, and Multigrain, and they all, well, taste good as the brand name implies they should.  The Multigrain chips have a wholesome nuttiness that would go well with a variety of dips (although I'm eating them plain).<br /><br />Best of all, they're kosher, gluten-free, and vegan.  How can one go wrong?

A little sweeter corn flavor then the Tostitos, but not as much as the Sun Chips.<br /><br />They company/brand/motto of FoodShouldTasteGood lives up to its promise. Even though tastes vary greatly I think most people who like tortilla chips or even thin crackers like Wheat Thins will find these very enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing I thought was funny was that the mini bag seems to be just a scaled down version of the large bag since the picture which they claim is "Enlarged to show texture and detail" is really a bit smaller than actual size (which is about a 2" x 1.5" hexagon).

I was a little disappointed that the package was mainly air- there were only about 15 chips in the 1 oz. bag.  However, each chip was delicious and wholesome.<br /><br />They were perfectly seasoned- not too salty, but just enough to bring out the flavor.  The sesame and flax seeds were very evident, and a nice addition.  The ingredients list the chips as being partially made from corn, but frankly, they tasted mainly like whole wheat.<br /><br />I ate them plain, and they were excellent.  I think eating them with salsa would be a waste!

review/summary: Tasty chips
review/text: I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.<br /><br />Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.<br /><br />These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself.

review/summary: Pretty tasty chips with no weird ingredients
review/text: These multigrain chips are more like those vegetable/organic/seed crackers than a tortilla chip.  It does taste a bit like a tortilla chip, but most of the flavor comes from the seeds in it.  I don't think they're too salty and the flavor is pretty well balanced.  The thickness and crunchiness is comparable to that of a Wheat Thin.  I only had one chip broken in half in the last bag that I ate.<br /><br />The ingredients list is pretty interesting in that there aren't any long chemical names: stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.  Take a look at the gallery above for a picture of the back of the bag.<br /><br />Each bag is 140 calories and contains 7 grams of fat so they make a pretty good snack.

review/text: If you're like me and have a lot of allergies to different foods and preservatives, this is a great find.  I pulled the chips out and thought they were going to be just a bland chip, but they are very tasty...not too spicy or too strongly flavored either - just right.  I like the thin texture too and at less than a buck a bag, not too pricey as products like these tend to be.

review/summary: Wow, yum!
review/text: True to the name, Food Should Taste This Good, these tasty little chips really deliver. So fresh, no taste of stale cooking oil! Just the right amount of salt and crispy crunch and the touch of olive makes for a very sophisticated little chip. Small and sturdy enough for bite size dipping. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Entirely enjoyable
review/text: This product is a perfect size for a lunch-box or a quick snack.  I find it to be hearty and quite filling.  The whole grains are entirely satisfying and work well with most traditional accompaniments for chips.  They are a nice break from the same-old corn chips and all of my guests who have tasted this product find them to be tasty and interesting.  Many have gone on to buy and enjoy this product themselves.  Just like the olive-flavored chips, virtually all the chips are whole and unbroken, which is a nice change of pace from what one gets with most similar products.

review/summary: Tasty, goes well with most dips
review/text: These chips are a nice break from the carbon copy corn-chips that we are all used to.  They have a nice, but not overwhelming, flavor of olive that is really quite delightful and that even people who dislike olives might enjoy.  They go well with guacamole, salsa, one of my favorite spinach dips, vegetable pate and just about any other dip that one might care to eat with it.  They have a hearty taste and texture that is quite satisfying and almost all the chips are whole.  The size is right for a lunch.  Frankly, I cannot imagine anybody not finding these chips enjoyable.<br /><br />I suppose that the only caveat is that if you specifically want the same-old corn chip, then this is probably not for you.

review/summary: Somewhere between a Frito and a tortilla chip
review/text: ...but I guess a little more like a tortilla chip.  I found these tasty and satisying, not quite as salty as the grocery store type tortilla and corn chips (a plus for me).  I didn't taste anything that hinted of olives, though.  Devotees of all-natural foods might be attracted by the lack of GMO ingredients, artificial colors/flavors, preservatives, etc. - that's not a selling point for me, though.  At my age I need all the preservatives I can get!

review/summary: Great taste,all natural ingredients,"iffy" texture
review/text: I'm always in search for good, healthy, whole grain products. When I saw these chips, I jumped at the chance to try something new.<br /><br />The ingredients are superb: it has a corn base, uses non-hydrogenated canola oil, brown rice flour, Turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, flax seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, Quinoa and sea salt. They are not overly salty like most other tortilla chips, which is a nice surprise.<br /><br />They are hearty chips and hold salsa well without breaking. They have a very good taste - corn, nutty, slight hint of salt, and hearty.<br /><br />My main complaint is with the texture. They're crunchy, but have too much of a cardboard texture for my liking.<br /><br />Overall, they're deliciously healthy chips, if you can get past the texture.

review/summary: Crackertilla
review/text: CRACKERTILLA is a word I came up with because this snack is both a thin, round cracker and tortilla chip all in one.  It is light, crispy, and quite tasty. We strongly sense the company really believes that, "Food Should Taste Good."<br /><br />Although we were skeptical at first, the unique olive flavor attracted us to this product. In addition, there are NO artificial colors, flavors, or GMOs in the ingredients.<br /><br />After opening the bag, we observed an attractive sight and scent and . This product is not like average chips, it has the aroma of real-food. The taste is also unlike any other, not only because of the olive flavor, but because of the marriage between the cracker and tortilla chip. The crispness is just right, and the Olive flavor is included without dominating other ingredients. The one-ounce serving size is just right and allows one to easily travel or pack this with a lunch.<br /><br />Overall, this healthy snack is recommended for both kids and adults.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, "No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.

review/summary: An All Natural Winner
review/text: Though I like to try and use all natural foods, I will not sacrifice flavor just to "go natural". From the 1st mini-chip to the last in one of the 1 oz snack-sized bags, I was entirely satisfied and will definitely buy these. I started eating the chips plain and, from the 1st bite, found the multigrain flavor satisfingly strong with a just a hint of sweetness that took the edge off the grain flavor. The size and shape of the chips (more like crackers than larger tortilla chips) was good for snacking, plus the thickness provided just the right texture and "crunch" factor.<br /><br />Later I finished the chips with a pesto dip and the complementary flavors worked perfectly: the chip didn't over power the dip, but neither did it roll over and die. I am sure I would enjoy these tortilla chips with other dips.<br /><br />Finally a last observation is how well these mini-chips kept their original shape. Out of the entire (albeit small) bag, only 1-2 chips were broken.<br /><br />An all natural winner that will have a permanent spot on my households snack-food roster.

review/summary: Not as healthy as you think
review/text: The added grains make these a better choice than the usual chips. They have the same sugar, salt and oil so there are better food snack choices out there, if you care about your health. If they had been made with organic ingredients I might have given them another star. I doubt I would ever purchase this item. Snacks like this are expensive and with food prices going up it has to be really special to make it into the cart.

review/text: Olive Tortilla chips, who would have thought? These chips have a Mediterranean attitude. You can taste the olives but not overwhelmingly. They are great with the usual salsa and sour cream just like any other tortilla chips but these you can try more exotic things like an Italian salsa (tomatos and Italian dressing).<br /><br />Other serious reasons to buy these chips:<br />-No GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms; Basically you get all the plant chemistries God intended for your health, not the Monsanto Corporation.)<br />-Kosher Certified by the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations (For those who care about a holistic diet and raise everything to a spiritual level.)<br />-Certified Gluten-Free (I'm not sure who certifies this.)<br />-No Artificial Colors or Flavors<br />-No Preservatives (Except Sea Salt of course, 80mg per ounce.)<br />-No Cholesterol or Trans Fats

review/text: I liked the flavor and texture of the tortillas.  They are not spicy, but the taste is not bland because of the olives. The chips are small and the serving size in the bag is just enough for a quick, satisfying snack.
