review/summary: Great Bold Coffee
review/text: Timothy's Extra Bold Rainforest Expresso is similar to the freshed brewed coffees that you get at some of the finer restaurants.  It has a strong rich coffee flavor with no sharp or bitter after taste whatsoever.  It is a very smooth cup of coffee.  If I feel that I want a slightly less bold cup of coffee (for example early evening), then I go with the Diedrich Paradiso House.  I have tried a number of other bold coffees, and find most of them have a sharp after taste.  This coffee is Number 1 on my list so far.

review/text: As a new Keurig coffee maker owner I'm trying all kinds of brands and flavors. I'm a cappuccino and espresso drinker and really enjoy Timothy's Extra Bold Rainforest espresso. I make it as a small cup and use very little milk. I love the full flavor and the punch it packs. I also like the Italian blend. The value is good too, two boxes of 25 for $20.00. So far Timothy's is my favorite!

review/summary: It's not really Espresso, but it is good all the same!
review/text: First, let's start with a definition: "Espresso is a concentrated coffee beverage brewed by forcing hot water under pressure through finely ground coffee". Although some chains claim an "espresso roast" for their beans, many different degrees of roasting are used for classic (Italian) espresso drinks. Yes, the Keurig does kind of "force" hot water through, but not anywhere near the pressure of an espresso machine.<br /><br />Now, to this product: I really enjoy Timothy's Rainforest Espresso coffee. I use the smallest cup size setting on my Keurig B70 (5 1/4 oz.) and although there is no crema (the dark reddish-brown foam on the top of an authentic cup of espresso) the taste is rich and bold with just a hint of satisfying and pleasant bitterness. This, along with Newmans Own Organic Special Blend, are my go-to coffees for my Keurig. If you like a strong coffee you might want to give this a try, but I still go to a coffee shop when I am hankering for a real shot of espresso.

review/summary: One of my favorites
review/text: I ordered two boxes each of this and the Emeril's Big Easy Bold. While I like Emeril's, I love this offering from Timothy's. Admittedly, the 'espresso' name is a little misleading, but it is an excellent extra bold k-cup. Great aroma and flavor, body and acidity won't turn away the faint of heart trying a stronger cup, and it doesn't have the same sort of bite to it like the Emeril's roast does. The fact that it's Rainforest Certified only makes it stand out from the rest of the pack of extra bold k-cups out there.

review/text: There is more coffee in these K-Cups than most of the others.  We found one other and have been using our Keurig as our everyday coffee maker ever since.  We were originally disappointed because we were used to a strong cup of coffee.  I tried using less water with the other K-Cups but with these I can use the regular water amount and still have a great cup of coffee.  If you like strong these are the K-Cups to buy along with Parisian Nights.

review/summary: The best cup of coffee for the Keurig IMHO
review/text: I love good coffee and before I bought my Keurig, I had Lavazza shipped from Italy.  I just hated making a pot and then only drinking a couple of cups before leaving for work and letting the rest get old. I bought the Keurig because I had one at the office at work and I liked the Lake & Lodge blend that they brought in.  This coffee is however the best I have found for the Keurig.  Not quite as strong as the Parisian Nights or the Midnight Magic, but the flavor and aroma are fantastic!  By far the most gourmet and tasty blends I have found for the Keurig.  Take into consideration that I am only sampling the bold blends as I really like strong coffee.  This is the only coffee that I have found that rivals Lavazza for its taste and aroma.

review/summary: One of the Good Ones for the Keurig
review/text: I enjoy dark strong coffee like Starbucks, french roast and sumatra.  I don't enjoy coffees with a sweet tangy flavor such as Dunkin Donuts and Gevalia.  To begin with, the Keurig Brewer tends to brew a slightly less bold or strong coffee than traditional methods such as a french press or even slow drip.  So for me, nothing other than extra bold K-cups will do the trick in the Keurig Brewer.  The strength of the Extra Bold Rainforest is strong enough for my taste (could be even a litte stronger).  The flavor is slightly smoky and rich but also slightly bitter with an almost stringent chemically after taste.  This however, is normally not noticeable.  I only notice it after immediately tasting another coffee.  Gloria Jeans Black Gold Extra Bold is smoother but also not as bold.

Only occasionally (1 out of 5) would these cups work properly in my maker--never had a problem with ANY other K-cup we have purchased (and we have 5-6 brands in the drawer at any given time). These cups would almost always back up into the maker creating a huge mess and half an undrinkable cup of coffee complete with most of the grounds from the K cup.<br /><br />Look like I just got a bad batch, but by the time I realized these were problem cups, the Amazon 30 day warranty had run out, leaving me no recourse other than to give them a negative review.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy treat
review/text: First off, I eat a lot of this stuff. I became somewhat of a chocolate muesli addict in Germany and would sometimes actually order another brand from a store that imports to the U.S. from Germany -- a pretty expensive luxury. The Seitenbacher Muesli "Choc&oacute; Max" that I found a few months ago here on Amazon is tons cheaper in comparison.<br /><br />So how do I like it? It's pretty good, overall. It has just the right amount of sweetness for my taste. However, personally I think this has a bit *too much* chocolate in it (yes, there is such a thing!). A second drawback for me is that the oats basically melt away in your mouth. I'd prefer them a tad crunchier. But those are small quibbles due to the fact that I'm comparing them to the chocolate muesli I grew used to in Germany and that are ridiculously expensive if you purchase them in the U.S. So if you are looking for an affordable, healthy and tasty treat, it doesn't get much better than this.

review/summary: Consistently good quality flax meal
review/text: I got the 4-pack some time ago, and I've been adding the flax meal to different foods. The omega-3 oil increase definitely is beneficial especially if you're vegetarian, or if you simply eat a lot.<br /><br />Some good ways to incorporate this healthy stuff into your diet:<br /><br />- Soup. Don't cook it into the soup, or you'll break down the Omega-3's - apparently cooking destroys the benefit according to what I read about flaxseed oils. Add it to the soup around when you add cheese or croutons<br /><br />- Sauces and chutneys. Indian cilantro or mint chutney can hold a lot of flaxseed meal without its taste being affected. Likewise for hot sauces, salsas and so on.<br /><br />- Waffles. The flaxseed meal becomes a kind of solid fat that enrichens the waffle. I add it to regular, chocolate, or oatmeal flour waffles. Yes, the waffle maker may affect the flaxseed meal directly in contact with the hot plates, but the rest of the fsm is not exposed to as much heat.<br /><br />- As they suggest, breads of all kinds.<br /><br />- If you're grilling a cheese sandwich, might as well up the fiber content and get whatever Omega-3's as you can salvage. Stick it in the cheese.<br /><br />- Believe it or don't it incorporates into nachos and pizzas too. If that's all your kid eats, maybe a flaxseed meal infusion will help (but do fix the food habits, fsm is not a fix-all)<br /><br />DON'T:<br /><br />- Try to eat it plain, I tried it, and it's about as disgusting as trying to drink vegetable oil, plus it has fiber<br /><br />- Add it to stuff that is still cooking. No benefit, the fat changes to regular unhealthy Omega-6 with the high heat from contacting the pan surface<br /><br />- Overdo adding fsm to stuff. I tried to push the envelope, and if you overdo it, the food tastes slick and even a bit soapy, kind of like it's gone bad.<br /><br />- Add it to clear liquids or foods. Sounds obvious, but once you feel a benefit (it can take a week or so) you can get carried away. The last thing you want is to be disgusted by it.

review/text: After having read about the various health benefits of flaxseed, I had tried a couple of different kinds before I chanced upon Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal in the grocery store.  The other brands I tried were good, but Bob's Golden Flaxseed Meal is great!  Not only does it provide excellent fiber, but it also tastes good.  It has a sort of nutty flavor.  In addition, the price is reasonable.  So far, it's the best flaxseed I've come across.

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

review/summary: Perfect for adding flavor to dry food. Our little dog loves this stuff
review/text: I don't know a lot about dogs but I thought they ate anything. The dachshund we had growing up would eat banana peels if you left them out. We rescued a Maltese (5 years ago now) and while he is healthy, he eats when he's hungry and leaves the rest.  He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty.

review/summary: We're both happy at long last!
review/text: I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken "in meaty juices" (it HAS to be the "in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the p�t&eacute; kind, I.e. "in meaty juices" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based "in meaty juices" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft p�t&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar "in nearby juices" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.

review/summary: Chicken is always good
review/text: Our westies love the Caesar Canine Cuisine foods, they seem to prefer the pates to the sauced varieties, but they eat all of them. I like to give them a big variety of flavors and Caesar's food comes in so many wonderful flavors. I like to have several chicken dishes to balance out the heavier beef varieties.  And it is a better deal than in the stores.  So that is super for me.

So far he has never refused to eat any of the Cesar Canine Cusine varieties and usually consumes them as soon as he can get at his bowl.<br />I am very pleased with his condition, very active and a shiny coat and none of the bad breath, which occurred with other foods.

NOT a healthy diet for anyone interested in good nutrition for their pet. BUT...our 18+ tiny rescue mutt isn't long for this world and has taken a liking to this doggie junk food above all else. It was either cave in and buy it, or she was going to starve. But don't get your healthy young pet hooked on this slickly marketed product, designed by Mars to use up the waste products that aren't good enough for human consumption. There are much better choices that will provide better nutrition at the good pet specialty stores!

review/summary: Terrific for picky dogs
review/text: I have a 5 lb Maltese who eats more like a cat. He eats until he is full and walks away. Dry food is best, I am told but it so.... "dry". I don't want to give him human food because I'm told I shouldn't - but also because he eats so little, I want to be sure he's healthy. My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors.

review/summary: Delicious Dense Cake - an excellent choice when looking for a more nutritious less allergic cake mix
review/text: This is my favorite cake and muffin mix.  It makes a very nice dense cake that no one would guess is gluten-free!  I feel most oils are a more nutritious alternative to dairy-free margine, so I always use a different oil (walnut, almond, grapeseed, etc) and they all turn out delicious.  I also substitute different sweeteners for the sugar such as maple syrup, honey, yacon syrup, date sugar, and coconut sugar and have been consistently very pleased.  The bag also offers variations to make:  pineapple upside-down cake, coconut cake, orange cake, lemon cake, ginger spice cake (one of my favorites!), marble cake, pumpkin cake, carrot cake, zucchini cake, banana cake, applesauce cake, snicker doodles, mexican wedding cookies, thumbprint cookies and pie crust.  Enjoy!<br /><br />More information from manufacturer's website which was missing from this webpage prior to my posting here in my review:<br />Create-Your-Own Cake & Cookie Mix-NEW - Net Wt. 19 oz (538 G) - UPC 833330001146 - MIX IS NOT PRESWEETENED.<br />Description: this mix is not presweetened.

Also that Whole Foods has a version that isn't as good according to my source.  Just wanted to make those options available to readers.

review/summary: Fantastic cupcakes and cookies for those with food allergies/intolerances!!
review/text: We are a household with multiple food allergies, and recently used this mix to make cupcakes for my preschooler's birthday party.  We can't use dairy, egg or wheat (among other things), and this mix met our needs and exceeded our expectations!  I've tried various cake mixes over the last year or two, and this was by far the best.  All of our party guests enjoyed the cupcakes---I even heard a "Yummy!" from a 2 year old little boy (who is used to the taste of wheat flour cupcakes)! I did make one change to the mix (it calls for the addition of margarine and water) by using sparkling water---I found that it made the cupcakes a little less dense. We used this mix to make sugar cookies and jam thumbprints too, and they turned out great.  We also use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SARZ64">The Cravings Place All Purpose Pancake & Waffle Mix, 23-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, and love it! (By the way, for the cupcake frosting we used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FPDYRG">Cherrybrook Kitchen Gluten Free Vanilla Frosting Mix, 9.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and recommend it as well).

review/text: I bought this hoping to make Lemon Charcoal Biscuits with it (if you can't fathom a Lemon Charcoal Biscuit, I'm very sorry: it's your loss).<br /><br />The problem was that everything which ought to have been crunchy turned out chewy instead.  No doubt the charcoal biscuits are lemon-y enough, and I'm quite certain the digestive benefits of charcoal biscuits in general are still there - but the crunch I expected is nowhere to be found, and no amount of fiddling with the mix seems to work.<br /><br />Therefore, let me advise that it's probably better to use this mix for cakes and pan breads rather than for biscuits (cookies) - or perhaps it was just my misfortune, I can't really say.

review/summary: Dense! But a lifesaver for gluten, sugar and dairy free people
review/text: Finally a mix that does not have sugar! More gluten-free companies need to get on this!<br /><br />I made cookies and boy are they dense. I don't know how a cake would turn out with this mix...<br />If I tell myself that these cookies are more like a biscotti, then they're absolutely delicious gluten free biscottis! The taste is great, I would just like a way to make the cookies a little more moist (so if Cravings Place or anyone else has suggestions, let me know!).<br /><br />I cannot have dairy, so I used coconut milk and coconut oil. It gives the cookies a bit of coconut flavor, and I used some smashed up bits of a stevia-sweetened chocolate bar,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EMQGVI">Dante Confections - 98% Cocoa Stevia Chocolate Bar: 8 Bars</a>, so I could have chocolate chunk cookies.<br /><br />I would love to see a gluten, sugar, dairy free BROWNIE mix! Seems like The Cravings Place has a great thing going with the mixes (my experiments from making brownies from scratch based on internet recipes have failed horribly), so if they could expand their product line, I would/will be a faithful customer for sure!

review/summary: Best multi-allergy free cake & cookie mix
review/text: I am allergic/severely intolerant to wheat, dairy, eggs, and nuts.  There aren't too many mixes out there that are made for multiple allergies.  The Cravings Place mixes are the best out there!<br /><br />The cake does come out denser than "normal" cake, and can be more crumbly/dry.  The taste, however, is amazing.  I have made the vanilla, ginger spice, and orange cakes/cupcakes.  Fooled a bunch of coworkers once, they were so delicious!<br /><br />I use this mix to make a very important traditional Christmas cake, so I no longer feel left out during the holidays (since I'm the only person in the family with food problems).  I am going to experiment with making other traditional holiday cookies with this mix.<br /><br />I haven't made a bad cookie yet, using the recipes on the bag.  I like crunchy cookies, but have not figured out how to get them crunchy instead of chewy.  If you like moist, chewy cookies, then this is definitely the mix for you!<br /><br />In fact, I can't keep my husband (no food issues) out of the cakes and cookies I make from this mix.

Since my 6 year old is the only one eating these, one can divide the batch into four and make four varieties of cookies from one bag. I've added chocolate chips, jam thumbprint cookies, rolled in cinnamon sugar, and rolled in sprinkles.  They all turned out really good.  I've had no problems freezing and thawing them already baked. They tend to be a little grainy, as all rice cookies are, but were enjoyed without notice by his friends who shared the cookies.

review/text: One of the things I love about Peeled Snacks is that many of the dried fruit and nut mixes they make are completely preservative free.  For this reason alone, Peeled Snacks is one of my favorite dried fruit snack companies as I must avoid preservatives (especially sulfur preservatives) due to migraines.<br /><br />In addition to being preservative free, every fruit I have had from Peeled Snacks aside from the mangoes is great.  (The mangoes taste more like the mango seed than the meat of the mango fruit.)<br /><br />Farmer's Market Trio is by far my favorite mix as I love cherries and apples, but you should try the different mixes yourself to find your favorite.  Just check the packages for preservatives if you have allergies, migraines, etc.  Most, but not all are preservative free.

Two things make me give it that evaluation: This Ghee was coarse not smooth and it tastes too much like artificial butter, like what you get on your popcorn at the movies. It almost makes you wonder if they didn't add a little phony oil to the pot, but I digress. This Ghee cooks well, I make eggs over easy using this product and the eggs don't stick to the pan. It also is good for adding to recipes that call for butter, but I warn you that the butter flavor is, to me, very strong. There are other Ghee products out there that you need to try before you settle on this product. But the fun part is that you'll enjoy them all!
