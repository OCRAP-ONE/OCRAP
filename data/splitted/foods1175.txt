review/summary: I Love This Korean BBQ!
review/text: To be perfectly honest, this is the first time I've ever had Korean BBQ and it absolutely knocked my socks off.  A close friend recommended Mama Eun's home delivery service and I decided to go for it.  I placed my order, paid the bill, and forgot all about it.... until one day when the delivery guy dropped a package on my doorstep.<br /><br />Mama Eun's packaging system is great!  Everything came securely wrapped up inside a cozy disposable (or reusable) ice cooler.  The freezer packs inside kept the meat nice and cold during shipping and are now hard at work in my freezer (nice bonus!).<br /><br />Then, I went to town.<br /><br />I tossed about half of the package onto the grill and a few minutes later the aroma had my mouth watering.  Seriously, people - this is great stuff!  Everything is already marinated inside the package and ready to go.  The meat was so tender and fresh I seriously reconsidered every buying any kind of meat at my local grocer ever again.  Who knew delivered food items could be so darn yummy!<br /><br />Now I'm hooked.  I love Mama Eun's "homemade style" and business approach.  Everything was very professional (but not in a lame corporate way).  They even included some cooking tips/directions in the delivery.  Needless to say, i was very impressed by this company and will be back again soon.  I'm placing my next order right now...

Most importantly, galbi was sooooo delicious. I have to say that it's better than my mom's. I became a facebook fan. :) I ordered 2 lbs which was a lot more than I expected, but I think that I will order more in order to save shipping cost.

I've been to a bunch of Korean BBQ restaurants, and this was right up there with the best of them. The amount of meat you get is more than enough to feed 4, and for the price it's a great value.<br /><br />If you like Galbi, or Korean BBQ in general, I highly recommend Mama Eun's!!!

The first cup brewed was ok, or at least I don't remember any grounds in it. Then a couple cups I would notice little brown pieces floating.  Other times, I would find the bottom of my cup was the entire k-cup of grounds.<br /><br />The K-cups are lined with a tea bag-ish filter, which seems to be loosely pressed or glued between the foil lid and the plastic  cup.  I don't know if it's the pressure of the water spraying it off, or a bad seal, or what...<br /><br />I've never had this problem with other brands, and I am hesitant to purchase another Van Houtte brand k-cup again.  Hopefully this was a one time thing, but it costs too much money to hope it doesn't happen again.

review/summary: Lithe and balanced, Woodford is a polished sophisticated bourbon.
review/text: Woodford Reserve has a cult following and it's easy to understand why: it has a lean, semi-dry, aspect that emphasizes herbal and botanical notes and downplays the resiny fruity "candy corn"'aspect one often finds in bourbons.  It is sophisticated and grown up hooch for more discriminating palates.<br /><br />Woodford is a lovely medium amber color - darker than Makers or Beam but lighter than lighter than, say Kentucky Spirit or Craig 18.  It's lovely.  Nose is full of toffee walnut and tobacco.  There's some leather and cream too.  First sip opens bright with honeyed corn.  Vanilla notes from oak arrive shortly and the midpalate blooms with herbal and floral aspects that mute the sweetness combined with the leather and tobacco meets toffee aspect.  Finish is medium long and a bit dry with oak vanilla floral qualities and a kiss of distant smoke.  It's a very tasty experience - if lacking the depth of flavor of the very best.  The absence of "corn likker" fruitiness is most appreciated.  This is a good bourbon for convincing scotch drinkers to consider bourbon.

It is one of the five "staple" teas that I have settled on during years and years of tea experimentation.  It has such a flavorful, happy taste that I smile every time I drink it!  Honestly.  To make it truly divine, add 1/2 teaspoon of raw honey and some vanilla soy milk.

I steep it for a little over a minute, take it out, put it aside and am able to use it for a second cup. So I get 2 cups of tea out of one bag.<br /><br />I'm a fan!<br /><br />= )

As far as them being made in China, please we can't trust the FDA anymore than we can trust another country!!  Our FDA allows our food supply to be genetically modified without allowing us to know which items they are modifying. They also passed aspartame and splenda when everyone knows that it is poison and slowly killing us.  Really, I have as much faith in products made in China as I do in the U.S.  thanks to the horrible job of our FDA!!!  They can't be trusted for sure.

review/summary: Great for Sensory Kids
review/text: I have a toddler with sensory issues who only eats crunchy foods. These mangoes (and the other fruits from this brand are also good) are a lifesaver. They taste great, come in individual packages so I can send them to daycare for his lunch, and are a healthy alternative to junk food. My 7yr old daughter loves them as well, and she doesn't like fresh mangoes. The freeze drying makes the flavors more potent. Yes, they are from China, but it is impossible to find freeze dried mangoes otherwise. Unlike other brands, these freeze dried fruits come in nice size pieces, and have not been reduced to powder.

review/text: I bought this since I had similar freeze dried fruits from Costco, but is disappointed to see that's they are made in China. This means that the fruits are from China and so are the chemicals that were probably used to grow them, they are probably not as healthy as claimed.  For more than 1 dollars for a few pieces per bag, it's better to get fresh fruits.

review/text: Best olive oil you can get.  I've missed it since I came back to the States.  You will find no better flavor...it is "frutatto" or "fruited," so it has. a very robust flavor in addition to being unfiltered. If ya don't like the "sediment" stick to filtered types .  I would say that anyone who rates this below 4 stars lacks educated taste buds when it comes to these things!  Olive oil you buy in chain grocery stores are not even in the same  class as this! If you like grocery store stuff with italian sounding names, best stick to that, but if you are  an olive oil snob like me, you won't be  disappointed!

Deceptive product photo shows the original foil bag in which FRONTIER organic products are usually sold, not the "bait and switch", who-knows-what-kind-of PLASTIC BAG in which this stuff arrived!! Would cost alsmost as much to return it as it cost to buy it, so I will be throwing it in the trash. Won't order from this merchant again.

review/text: This recipe is my favorite. I bought 5 boxes of this flavor during last years deer hunting season. Everyone who tried this was impressed with the flavor. I did add some liquid smoke, some salt, and additional cayenne pepper to some of my batches.  I make enough deer jerky to fill up (8) 1-gallon bags every season and this is by far the best I have tried to date

review/text: I purchased this box for my nephews and cousins as a present. Including teenagers and four years old had fun and serious excitement to get this kind of lollipop. The taste was ok, but the real deal is the scorpion inside. I never tried, but I've been told it tastes weird but not the bad way. I can recommend everybody who wants to be very popular to give a really cool gift.  If the child can have a regular lollypop can get this one too. For Halloween it's a perfect treat...

This coffee is only available/produced from Green Mountain yearly between August to November, so after that the "Best before" date needs to be noted. (it doesn't mean the coffee will go stale though) Most are dated with Feb or April, but to my surprise, this box is dated for June 2, 2012 which made me even more happy because the listing description has no note on the date.<br />Oh! lastly,..I LOVE GM Pumpkin Spice!

review/summary: Tastes great, but not exactly a "health" bar.
review/text: I bought these to try to supplement my fiber intake without having to deal with powders and pills. Over the last few years I've found that increasing my fiber intake is a great way of losing weight and maintaining it, so I try to get around 30g a day. Foods high in fiber fill you up more quickly and aid in digestion, The Daily Recommended Value of fiber for adults is 25g per day. Most people in America probably get much less than that, closer to 7-10g a day. At 9g of fiber per serving, just eating one of these bars a day will provide a lot of assistance in meeting the DRV.<br /><br />In addition to the fiber content, the bars really taste great. I've never been a fan of granola-type bars, and figured with a name like "Fiber One" these would taste like cardboard, but they are one of the best meal bars I've eaten. They are moist and have a good texture. All of the ingredients seem fresh.<br /><br />At 4g, these bars are very low in saturated fat (they contain poly and monounsaturated fats - the "good fats). Total net carbohydrates is 19G (28g-9g of fiber), so they do contain a little more sugar than I would like (it is the third largest ingredient). Here is the nutritional info:<br /><br />Calories - 140<br />Total Fat - 4g (2g saturated)<br />Carbohydrates - 29g<br />Fiber - 9g<br />Protein - 2g<br /><br />My only real problem with these bars are the ingredients.  They are fairly heavily processed.  The second main ingredient is "Semisweet chocolate chips."  Following that are whole grain oats, and then corn syrup. Although these are a fairly significant source of additional fiber, I would have preferred they not add all the extra sugar.

review/text: I have bought the Fiber One Bars in Oats & Chocolate, and Oats & Peanut Butter.  I love them both.  The Chocolate are my personal favorite.  It's nice to me to have them individually wrapped for a quick snack or meal to keep in my car while I'm driving to jobs or between jobs.  The taste is sweet and satisfies my sweet tooth without a lot of the guilt and it does fill you up and has 35% fiber.  It's especially nice to order groceries through Amazon when they are having sales and then get them delivered for free to your door.  My kind of grocery shopping!  You won't go wrong with these snacks or meals!

review/text: When I tasted my first Fiber One bar, the only thought running through my head was, "why on earth didn't I buy more of these?"  These bars taste better than any high fiber bar out there.  I had to read and re-read the nutritional information.  There are 9 grams of fiber in each bar.  Imagine eating something REALLY good and good for you.  I can't say that about too many food items.  But, I gladly recommend this product.  Every flavor has an outstanding taste.  Even my three year old loves them.  Need I say anything more?

I eat them, but I make sure I am alone at home and near a bathroom.  Those who aren't effected must have intestines of steel.  Co-workers and I were speaking about these bars this afternoon.  I'd asked if any of them had ever eaten them and, if so, what kind of side-effects resulted.  After all the embarrassed smiles and giggles, I didn't have to ask further.  Maybe they could reduce the fiber just a little?  Otherwise, the Chocolate Peanut Butter is the best.

review/summary: Great for getting your fiber up...not for the weak stomach peeps
review/text: I have been eating Fiber One bars for 2 years now, and I've lost 50lbs. I am a runner and I'm always thinking of ways to increase my fiber intake. Luckily Fiber One products have me covered. These bars are so easy to take with you; to the gym, work, lunch, as a snack! I buy them in bulk now and enjoy them in my lunches. The recommended amount of fiber a person should have a day is about 18-25 grams...and this one little bar can take care of 9 of those grams! How awesome is that?!  I love the chocolate ones the best, but they now have a new one call chocolate mocha! And the gas that people have talked about on these reviews goes away once your body is able to handle more fiber. I have none of those side effects now.  Enjoy!

review/text: The reviews of this extraordinary product pretty much cover the bases.  Tasty?  Check.  Full of fiber?  Check.  Causes extreme gut pain?  Check.  Causes nonstop farting like you were born in New Jersey?  HELL YEAH.<br /><br />What can I add to this?<br /><br />Well, a few months back my coworkers and I drew up a contract for a spirited competition.  The contestants were to eat three bars back to back with plenty of fluid at breakfast.  The winner would be determined by the last person to use the bathroom.  Unfortunately during a test run where I consumed three bars in one sitting, I discovered that even tapping out and running at a full sprint to the bathroom was too much of a risk - especially at work!  Thank GOD I was wearing  my Ex Officio Give-N-Go Briefs!  That at least contained the rush that I experienced.<br /><br />We devised a different sport to compete in.  Eat one bar and then 30 minutes later go to the gym and use the elliptical machine.  You win in one of two ways:  1.  Hold out and do not pass gas at all during a 20 minute workout. However you can also win by passing enough gas to drive your competitors off of their machines.  So even if you tap out early you can still win.<br /><br />It is critical to use the elliptical during this challenge due to the rapid cheek movement it causes.<br /><br />I gotta stop eating these things.  No one wants to sit near me anymore.

review/text: I've built up a tolerance to the fiber one bars. Don't eat too many if you haven't had one in a while. It's best to slowly introduce them.<br /><br />I don't always eat them, maybe every 3-4 days. But when I do it's usually a binge of at least 5 or more at a time( I know, it sounds excessive but my stomach handles them no problem). To me, it's better than gorging on candy or other complete junk. After a binge I am so satisfied from the fiber, oats, and chocolate. They are always delicious every time, I never get sick of them. And after plowing through 5 or more, I know they are gonna go right through me and take other junk with them on the way out, what's better than that? enjoy!

review/text: Wow, I had one yesterday and all afternoon and night I was filled with gas.  I couldn't figure out what I ate that caused this but I loved them so much that I was looking on line for a place to order a big box.  I'm so happy that I came across the reviews on Amazon, otherwise I would have ordered more boxes and had to get rid of them.<br />One thing I do know is that if your body is not used to a lot of Fiber that it can upset your stomach.  What you may want to do it gradually introduce it into your diet i.e. start with a third of one and see if that bothers you.  If it does, then its not the fiber - its something else in the bar.  This is what I'm going to try because I really like them.  Thanks for all of the reviews because I'm not sure I would have figured it out.  There is a blog on the internet about these bars complaining about the same thing.  They actually wrote to the company and received a response back that they all had a good laugh for the day!!!!  The blogger said that there is chicory root in the bars and that can cause GI problems I will have to look at the ingredient list myself then look up the chicory root.  If its not that, then its the fiber which means you have to gradually get your body used to it.

review/text: I started eating fibre one bars when I began Weight Watchers. I found it to be a tasty filling snack. Oats and chocolate is my favorite flavour. I don't really care for the caramel or the peanut butter ones. But the oats and chocolate ones are delicious.<br /><br />It's hard to find them in large packs where I am but whenever I do, I scoop them up. I find them filling either for breakfast or as a mid-day snack. I used to hide them from my kids, as I do with all my Weight Watchers stuff, but finally realized that I should be happy they were eating them too (albeit frustrated that I would be met with an empty box when I went to pack my lunch).<br /><br />These taste so good that it's hard to believe they are healthy.

review/summary: High fiber isn't necessarily a good thing!
review/text: I recently cut fiber one bars out of my diet after I noticed that I get all the fiber I need in a day just by eating whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables and nuts. If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a "healthy" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision. (And so are my friends!)

review/summary: Great Bars, with a good price
review/text: These are really good chocolate oat bars, and although I know the price changes, the unit price I paid for them were pretty close to the unit price at Wal-Mart. You get 12 boxes of 5 for a total of 60 bar which is a lot. But I highly recommend them as daily snacks or even breakfast plus they're high in fiber with their being 9g per bar. There are different flavors, but Oats and Chocolate is usually the cheapest. Overall, the bars are tasty, healthy, and great for snacks. I highly recommend.
