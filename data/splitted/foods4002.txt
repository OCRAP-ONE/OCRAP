review/summary: Lentil Soup - this is YUK!
review/text: Are you kidding? 4 stars, this is the worse soup I have bought on amazon, its rare that I write comments, but this deserved a low rating, the pasta in this soup comes across as dumplings, it can't be healthy for you. Try something else, Progresso has a much better flavor. I will try another lentil dry soup mix, I will be giving this away to the food bank.

review/summary: super good chex mix flavor.
review/text: This a simply good Chex Mix flavor(B B Que)and is great sprinkled on a green salad or anything you might want to try it on or with. My idea was on a green salad and it works very well, it is also good as a snack. I will get it again as I like the flavor which to me is very mild with out a bite to it which is a plus as far as I am concerned. Experiment and have fun trying it on different things.

review/summary: I've eaten these for 15 years
review/text: I have been eating these pepperonis for 15 years.  I have had two go bad in storage but that is not Bridgford's fault.  They store for a year or more at room temperature if you keep them in a cool room but if one gets a puncture in the wrapper or exposed to too much heat, etc., then all bets are off.  If the wrapper is still vacuum tight and the expiration date has not passed, then it should be fine.  If the wrapper is loose at all or the product has expired then, yes, you might have one that is bad.  If it is as bad as some here describe then it is my guess they are eating spoiled food.  Not smart.  But in 15 years of eating these, I have only thrown out two for spoilage and that is after having stored them for quite a while.<br /><br />These do have more fat (and more flavor) than bagged pepperoni.  They do make great pizza but you will have a hard time slicing them as thin and even as some big factory - so just don't expect the exact look, feel, and taste.  These are still delicious in their own right.<br /><br />I have to laugh about reviews from folks who eat seemingly spoiled food and then say that anyone who likes this must work for Bridgford. No, I do not work for Bridgford.  I just eat their products.

review/summary: Great if you like solid/dry meat snacks.
review/text: I eat this like a summer sausage with cheese crackers. I'm a fan of meat snacks like beef jerky and summer sausage.<br /><br />I know that this is meant to be used as a pizza topping but all the summer sausages I have tried lately are very moist almost like Spam or potted meat. I like a more dry summer sausauge so I thought I'd try this.<br /><br />This is very dry and solid. This is a plus for me.<br /><br />If you eat it in thick pieces like I do, it has a grainy quality to it. The spices are very strong, distinct, and unique.<br /><br />Where this loses points is the pepperoni casing that surrounds the pepperoni. In most sausages, the casing is so thin that you can't even taste it or know it's there.<br /><br />The casing on this is thick and it tastes similiar to wax paper.<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again even to use on pizzas. It will take me a long time to use the two sticks I have left.<br /><br />It's a decent product but just not good to use as a meat snack. It's not worth buying it for pepperoni on a pizza, either, for me. I'll just stick to Hormel for that.

review/text: This is great pepperoni, but it's not for everyone. If you're tired of buying the limp tasteless mush they package precut in bags at the grocery store, this is what you should buy. It's good seared, baked, and raw. We've served it frequently with cheese and crackers. Many guests (but not all) appreciate the bold flavor. For a pack of three and with a subscription, this price can't be beat. It'll last you a good long while.<br /><br />(Just make sure to cut off the casing before eating!)

review/summary: Haven't order online yet, but this is abolutely the BEST!
review/text: The person with the negative view must have received pepperoni that had accidentally been punctured at some point. Something is definitely wrong. I have been eating this pepperoni for over 30 years and it is fantastic! Thirty years ago, my brother convinced me to put some slices of the pepperoni in my spaghetti sauce; it was outrageously good. I have used it ever since--me and my entire family.<br /><br />I even eat it "raw" (can't be raw or it wouldn't keep). It's one of my primary snacks on the Atkins (and I've lost 25 lbs). I hope the nay-sayers try it one more time--they are missing out.<br /><br />The super Wal-Marts sell it and they are always running out. And by the way, I live in Sacramento and I'm an instructor at a college; don't work for Bridgeford! I'm only online because Wal-Mart runs out so fast (just came from there) and I would like to buy a large supply I can count on. Actually, I have two, inch and ahalf pieces that I've hid from my husband in the fridge. I guess I'm addicted!

review/text: Haven't bought this online, just at the supermarket.<br />It's good on homemade pizza. Thick slices are amazing. Just peel off the casing or it warps the pepperoni into a concave dome that pools the fat. And there's TONS of fat.<br /><br />Another tip would be to put the cuts on paper towels then nuke them. Good to get rid of as much grease as you can.<br /><br />LOL at the people eating them "raw" and giving it a negative review. What the hell are you expecting?<br />This isn't a sausage stick to eat like you just bought from a gas station.<br />The fat content is way too high be to eaten plain. Add chunks to a soup, bread, whatever.

review/summary: Different
review/text: I have been preparing pizza at home exclusively for over 20 years and only considered recently to purchase pepperoni in quantity to get a better price. I had tried several brands over the years but this brand has not been offered in my area. After reading other reviews I decided buying 3 pounds was not a big risk.<br />I knew not having a meat slicer was going to be a challenge but I also knew that "practice makes perfect".<br />The flavor is different from what I considered to be the best of pepperoni I had tried, but I have not tried any that may have been considered gourmet quality, and I like it. It is oilier but I don't consider it excessively oily.<br />The bottom line is that if you enjoy preparing pizza from home you should try this Bridgford pepperoni. I have had 2 shipments and both arrived in 3 business days.

review/text: This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance). If you're sensitive to spicy food, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />Each package yields enough pepperoni slices to populate roughly two 12" pizzas (one if you really want to pile on the toppings).

review/summary: Handy for "Seasoning"
review/text: Off and on over the years I've kept a package of pepperoni in the frig because it's a great "seasoning" product.  You can throw a few into just about any savory dish to add extra flavor.  It works a lot like bacon in that regard, in those instances where you don't need a lot of meat, but a little helps to round out the dish.  You can use these instead of adding flavoring fats too, like butter or olive oil.  It adds variety and broadens your options especially for quick cooking, or when you are out of some of your usual basics and don't feel like running to the store.<br /><br />The problem sometimes is that some brands of pepperoni taste a bit odd - perhaps chemically, or greasy, or papery and bland.  These are good.  I will say that these aren't super-intensely flavored, but to my mind that is good for my purposes.  If you want to get an intensely flavored pepperoni for a particular application or for direct snacking, I figure you want to hit up your local Italian market.<br /><br />I also like the size and thinness of these - they are very thin, which I think is great, because I typically would use these in circumstances where I would want only a few and well distributed in small pieces.  I can use these whole where with some other brands that are cut thicker I'd typically have to cut them up some first.<br /><br />These also taste fresh and have a nice texture.

I found it locally and I have been eating it ever since, I use it when making Pizza and it tastes very good, I like it when it gets crispy in the oven on top of the pizza. I am not an expert in pepperoni, however this low calorie choice does a great job, it doesn't have any after taste or all that grease, maybe because it is made with turkey (less grease, fewer calories) and high quality ingredients. I love low calorie turkey pepperoni! Thank You

review/summary: The slices are, um, greasy
review/text: This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie.

review/text: I have purchased and prepared other gluten free pastas that were 'fine', but none that were actually good. In an Italian language class, I was told by a teaching assistant who lives in Italy that it is not at all difficult to find good gluten free pasta there, so I went in search of one I could purchase. I found a review of this Italian pasta online that was very favorable, so I thought... ok one more time I will try to find a decent pasta. My husband needs to be gluten free, not me, and I have SO missed good pasta. Well, wait no more.. this is it. Cooked precisely per the directions in a salty (like sea water) pot of water, topped with my homemade sauce and it is wonderful. Thank heavens!  I had almost given up on finding a decent gluten free pasta.

review/text: My wife has Celiacs and as a result I have been on a quest to find a pasta that she can eat and I enjoy. While gluten free will never be like semolina pasta, this comes really close.<br /><br />It cooks well and does not suffer from what other gluten free pastas do, which is a very small window of just right. You can slightly under/overcook and you will still have an enjoyable meal.<br /><br />Like regular pasta, save a small amount of the cooking water to toss the pasta with before your sauce or pesto.

review/text: To me, this tasted like coffee with a little chocolate added.  Although it had the bitterness of coffee, it was also pretty sweet.  Not surprisingly, natural sugars are pretty high in the ingredient list.  Natural flavors (whatever those are) were before cocoa, which explained why the chocolate flavor was, at best, an after thought.  To make matters worse, the texture was watery.  I love chocolate, but I prefer the fruit-flavored Mix 1 protein drinks.  However, I hate coffee, so a coffee lover might like this.

review/summary: Wrong Picture/Wrong Product
review/text: I ordered this product assuming the picture "Lamb and Rice" was accurate. I received "Lamb and Oatmeal". Called Wellness as we have been unable to find "Lamb and Rice" product lately. They said that they no longer make "Lamb and Rice". Too bad, my dog is allergic to gluten and cannot digest the "Lamb and Oatmeal" blend. I gave away the remaining 11 cans. Seems the Amazon vendor substituted the "Lamb and Oatmeal" for the "Lamb and Rice" without my knowledge or approval. Buyers be advised. The picture does not represent what I received from the vendor.

review/summary: Buyer Beware!
review/text: Three and half years ago one of our dogs was diagnosed w/ IBS. We tried every diet, medication and supplement and nothing worked until last year when we discovered Wellness Simple Solutions Lamb and Rice, which is a single protein diet. We used the canned food and the kibble. Even our vet was impressed with his progress. Our now 11-year-old dog was now living a healthy life and he no longer suffered between constipation, diarrhea and hot spots.<br /><br />Several weeks ago all it returned, then suddenly disappeared only to return again.<br /><br />At the same time we noticed that some of the canned food had a different color and smell. I called the company and told them how he was reacting and asked them if they had changed the recipe and they said they had.  Towards the end of the conversation the rep asked me to read her the numbers on the bottom of the cans. She then asked me to return certain marked cans because they accidently mislabeled them! They were not the Lamb and Rice single protein food. She also offered a refund for the unused cans.<br /><br />The FedEx box arrived in a heartbeat, no letter of apology and no refund.<br /><br />What is even more troubling is the fact that this large corporation, to my knowledge has made no effort to let their customers know of this error. I'm truly concerned that there are others who use this product and are now dealing with what our dog has had to deal with for the past several weeks, not knowing they are feeding their dog mislabeled food.

review/summary: Best Soy Sauce I've ever tasted.
review/text: This is very very good Missy. First of all, you should not be using that Kikkomann crap you<br />bought at the grocery. This is a professional grade soy sauce, naturally brewed with a very<br />smooth and savory texture that is flavorful and easy on the palate. A must for any Chinese<br />takeout, and particularly for homemade marinades. Dont even attempt to make Teriyaki marinade<br />without a good quality dark soy sauce like this.<br /><br />Lee Kum Kee is a major producer of a variety of Chinese food products for the consumer and the<br />restaurant trade. They have a fantastic website with recipes and instructional cooking videos<br />covering a range of well known dishes. 5 Stars! (link to website posted in Comments section)

Well, given that these three ounce bags sell for .99 at the store, it makes sense to buy these @.72 each(subscribe & save price) I have twins that like these as an occasional snack so, it was worth the money. I am saving in the long run, 'cause I know I would have eventually bought 35 bags. BEWARE these things are HOT. Or perhaps I am a whimp. Great packaging. Very fresh and crunchy.

Smaller dogs should have days of fun with what is in the bag. The product is made in the United States and each piece is shrink wrapped with the bag, but the boys knew what was inside the Amazon box before I even opened it.

review/summary: Picky cat loved this!
review/text: I've spent years trying to figure out what my cat likes.  I thought I had narrowed it down to chicken, but he eventually got sick of that too.  Based on previous purchases I was sure he hated all seafood except for tuna water.  Being that Tiki has a lot of tuna mixes, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Amazingly, he loved it!  I was really surprised since the brand of chicken he likes also makes quite a few seafood varieties that he did not like.  For whatever reason, he seems to enjoy every seafood variety in this pack (but not so much the chicken, as it's a lot drier in comparison to his usual chicken in gravy). He's still insanely picky and doesn't like the same food several days in a row, but I can combine even a little bit of this with his other foods and he'll eat it.  Very happy with this find!!

review/text: I have a cat who has to have a calorie-restricted diet and was not doing well on the Rx food from the vet. Much heaving and discomfort. I switched brands, this, that, the other and no food seemed to help. This is the only brand that keeps him in good trim, with no dry heaves. It's basically fish or chicken, fish oil and that's about it. There are a few varieties with a bit of rice.<br /><br />The food looks like tuna or chicken salad and the cat LOVES it. I am sure I gave him extra years of life by putting him on this food.

review/summary: My Cat loves this stuff...
review/text: My 13-year old male cat has been a non-fish eater his whole life. I decided to upgrade the quality of his food and bought a sample pack of Tiki Cat. He went wild. There is quite a variety and he favored some much more than others. But the best way to find out is get a sample pack and see what he/she likes.<br />Theres a variety of tuna combinations, calimari, sardines, mackeral, lobster and crab. The fish is very fresh and apparently fished in low mercury oceans so you can relax about the amount you feed your kitty.<br />Our cat now demands fish nearly every day. We still feed him other high-quality cat foods, but most of the time...it's Tiki.

review/summary: Too much fish for a variety pack, but....
review/text: I bought this variety pack so my cats could try the chicken flavors without fish, but they hated it. However, they did like a couple of flavors...so I will order those (if I can remember which ones! argh)<br /><br />My BIG questions/concern: the fine print on the bottom of each can says "feed one can for every 3 lbs of bodyweight daily"...<br /><br />One of our cats weights 16 lbs (Maine Coon) and the other, 12 lbs, so I will need to feed a total of 9 cans/day. (who can afford that?) This MUST be wrong info?<br /><br />What cat would eat that much food in one day?<br /><br />Makes me question the company. (they also included one flavor that had menadione sodium bisulfate - a known carcinigen - listed on the can, but when I called I was assured they eliminated that from all flavors last year, and that they just haven't "caught up" with new labels yet.  hmmmmm.<br /><br />If you are feeding this food, do YOU feed according to the label instructions?<br /><br />I've been feeding/offering 1-2 cans of Fancy Feast Classic/day to my 2 cats, but they never finish it.<br /><br />Why do I need to almost triple that amount of Tiki Cat?  (I do put out high quality (40% protein) kibble 24/7.  A good quality, high protein kibble fills up cats in all the right ways, so one expects them to eat less. My cats only eat 1/2 cup of kibble/day (that's total for both, not each cat!)  Seems way too little, but they maintain their weight just fine on it and the FF. So, I have to wonder about how TikiCat came up with the huge amount needed to feed?<br /><br />I'd love to hear what others do. If cats "need" that many cans of TIKI CAT, then each can must be very low on nutrients, as I assume to get the proper nutrients, they need all those cans as per the label?  I hope someone can make sense out of this.  I emailed the company just now as I totally missed that last line until placing an order for Hookena Luau, Hana Luau & Napili Luau. (some of their cans have better (safer) ingredients than others; and those are the more expensive ones & of course those are the ones I will feed IF I find out I don't need to follow the feeding guidelines.....)

review/summary: I no longer have to choose!
review/text: I've been planning on trying Starbucks instant coffee for some time now. I'm a firm believer in trying something before committing. But the $3300 price tag on this was going to be a pretty big financial hit, especially after having been laid off from my job as a product tester at the chloroform plant. As you can probably imagine, I get into a lot of car accidents, and my old Pinto was once again in serious need of repairs.<br /><br />So I was stuck. Do I take out a loan to buy a new fender and Nomex shell for my Pinto, or use the money to enjoy the rich taste of fine Colombian coffee, hoping that the caffeine boost will avert yet another school crossing tragedy?<br /><br />Thankfully, once again Amazon has come to the rescue! The new ridiculously low price of $2.49 (that's 99.9256% off!) is practically charity! It's also literally a lifesaver! I never dreamed that I'd live in a world where I could both afford to get the dents and blood stains off of my car *and* enjoy a good cup of coffee! It's like living in a utopia! Now if I can just find another well-paying job inhaling dangerous chemicals then I won't have to keep hiding from the police and the bank's loan officers! Well, I might still have to hide from the police, but you get the idea. Thanks, Amazon and Starbucks!

Add a minced clove of garlic to the oil to give it some old world taste.  ~POW! That's good! :)

review/summary: Tastes good and doesn't affect my blood glucose level
review/text: I've been sucking on these and some other sugar alcohol hard candies for a couple of months, trying to stave off the munchies, and they're generally really good. Though some other Werther's flavors are mostly sweet with little punch, the Caramel Coffee have lots of flavor.<br /><br />The package says that a serving is 5 pieces, but that seems a lot. Each individual piece has 3 g of carbohydrates, with 2.8 g from Sugar Alcohol. Some say that is a net of 1.6 g each. I have diabetes and I've checked my blood glucose level at 15 minutes and an hour after eating a couple, and I see no spike at all. Perhaps different people metabolize these things differently, so individual mileage may vary. The best thing would be to check the blood and see if these work for you. They do for me.

review/summary: Better than no coffee candy, but not near the best
review/text: Werther's Caramel Coffee is readily available in many grocery stores right along with the other Werther's candies. When it first hits your tongue the coffee flavor jumps right to the front and it is also nice and sweet. However, the longer you have it in your mouth, the weaker the coffee flavor becomes; understandable since coffee is listed next to last on the list of ingredients. And when you eat one immediately after you finished one of the really strong coffee candies, you can't taste the coffee at all in the Werther's. However its availability and price are huge pluses, especially for those of us who live in the boondocks. It's sure better than no coffee candy at all.  5 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies.<br />  God bless. Mike

review/summary: love these but
review/text: I love Werthers hard candies SUGAR FREE.  I particularly love the dark coffee sugar free.  Unfortunately I cannot get it in my local drug store.  I can get other Werthers but not the coffee sugar free.  If I purchase it here on Amazon I must get a pack of 12 which I think is a bit much.  I suggest you offer a package of say SIX and then I would reconsider.  They are good and VERY low calorie just enough to satisfy a craving.

review/summary: My dog actually eats these treats!
review/text: My dog cannot be bribed.  I have tried EVERYTHING.  The only thing he can be bribed with so far are these treats and real food (steamed chicken meat, peanut butter, and cheese whiz).  I can't really use these for training, because he still doesn't like it as much as the human food.  But it's an good treat if I want to reward him for going potty in the right place in a pinch.<br /><br />My pack didn't come crushed like some of the other brands.  Some are crushed, and I do have to be careful with them if I want to pack them to go.  I need to put them in a hard plastic container to keep them from turning into powder.  Also avoid getting them wet...man they become one sticky mess when they do.

review/summary: Great-for-Training Treats
review/text: Either chicken or beef freeze-dried liver is a great training reward for dogs, and because it has such a strong flavor, it's also great to mix with crushed pills if a dog refuses to take medication in other ways (like my dog who hates peanut butter and cheese). My dog goes crazy for these treats, so I buy large quantities. But I suggest starting out with small size bags until you know your dog will like these treats as much as my dog does. The only down-sides of using freeze-dried meat is that dogs can only eat small amounts at any one time, and the handler MUST wash his/her hands afterwards. I have found that Pooch Passions treats are very expensive, compared to other freeze-dried meat treats, but I feel that this brand is well-worth the expense.

review/summary: Brought back the young dog in him...
review/text: I first discovered these on a recommendation by the owner of a local pet store in Middleburg, Virginia.  He said that it was a product that he couldn't keep on the shelves and it done wonders for many of the owners who come in and bought it.  As you can see, I was very skeptical of such a recommendation, but boy was I wrong.  My dog is an 11 year old Golden Labrador Mixed.  We started giving him the nickname, "Old Man" a few years ago, because he was starting to get up slowly, walk around slowly, wouldn't run, had to stretch and *hated* I mean HATED going up the stairs to go to bed.  Now, things are much different.<br /><br />We started giving him 1 treat every morning as his "medicine".  It took about a week and half to fully see the difference, but it was amazing.  It was so long since I had seen him run around the house, or run to the door when he thought someone was there knocking.  One of the funniest things now is Pizza Night.  He knows that when he sees the pizza man or when someone is bringing it over that he's going to have a good night.  Either myself or fiance, will take one of our Crusts from the pizza and begin tossing pieces of it it to him.  Before he would let it hit him in the face and fall to the ground or we would have to let him eat it from our hands, but now he is snatching it right out of the air when we toss it.  He'll jump in the air to catch it if he has too!! One of the biggest differences we have seen, even after all the other things, is that he now runs up the stairs when everyone is ready for bed.  That is a big thing for an older dog to do.  These treats are amazing.<br /><br />It really has changed his life, and it has made us feel so happy to see him excited and want to run around and play like he was a young dog again. I passed some treats on to a co-worker after telling him all about these changes, and he is now a believer as well.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone who has a dog that is starting to slow down because of age.  Remember though, It takes about a week or two before it starts working.  So, don't be discouraged if its not right away.

review/text: I am so impressed by these treats! First they are very moist and soft. They almost appear to be "people food". Also I only buy American food and treats for my pets since the big scare. These seem to be American-made and of good quality. The most impressive thing is what happened when I gave my big Airedale a treat for the first time. I filled her bowl per usual, put on of these in along with a few other treats. I then left the room to feed my other dog. She inhaled this and then abandoned the rest of her plate, without touching it, so she could find me to beg for more. I have never seen her abandon her plate before. I then fed my Beagle one and the Airedale tried to take it out of her mouth. Bottom line is my doggies go nuts for these. They are pricey but the dogs are so happy it is worth it!

review/text: A friend of mine gave me a bag of the beef version of Sea Mobility jerkey strips, and my dog loved them so much I decided to try the venison.  She's crazy about both flavors.  She gets one jerky strip after each afternoon walk, and can barely contain herself as she waits for me to open the bag and feed her the jerky strip.  The strip is scored so you can give the treat in several pieces at just the right amount for your dog's weight.  I don't know how much extra help the glucosamine gives her, since she's on regular supplements for that anyway.  But I'll keep giving Sea Mobility jerky strips to her because it's delightful to watch her joyful behavior when I reach into the cabinet and take out the bag containing her favorite treat.

I never finished the box before they were out of date (didn't throw them out - just ate the remaining ones after the "best before" date.  Still tasted the same - moderately good.  Gluten free is a big plus for this bar, and one of the main reasons I bought a box.<br /><br />Oh - worried about the THC content?  I work for a major organization that does no-notice urinalysis on employees, using some of the most sophisticated testing equipment available.  I did not come up positive for anything on the day of my no-notice drug test.  These seem to be quite safe since there's only a tiny, tiny bit of THC in them per the company and per my experience with testing.<br /><br />GRITS

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00164V0VW">Kraft Italian Salad Dressing, Fat Free, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 60)</a><br /><br />Big mistake, I am stuck with 59 packets of these horrible tasting salad dressings.  Kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item.  Horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing, although I have tried other Kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad. Does anyone want to buy 59 packets of italian dressing?  I will more then likely wind up throwing these out unless someone in my family decides to try them and likes them.

review/summary: Fat free and tasty too!
review/text: I served this dressing to a group of men that would normally turn their nose up to anything that is 'fat free' and they all thought it was great.  Has a nice texture and a good herbal flavor.  Not overly acidic.
