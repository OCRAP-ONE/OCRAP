review/summary: Great Taste - Very similar to Cap'n Crunch w/ Kashi 7 Whole Grains!
review/text: As a big cereal fan I like to try out new products (especially when on sale :). I am very happy to have picked this one up! The cereal is similar in taste and shape to Cap'n Crunch, but the pieces are smaller and more wholesome (made with Kashi's 7 Whole Grains).<br /><br />My general criteria for cereal is that it should have a reasonable amount of fiber and less than 10g of sugar. This particular cereal has an even fiber/sugar ratio (6g each) so you know it is healthy. The honey taste is great and hits you right away with each bite.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those who want a healthy cereal with a better taste than Cheerios or Oatmeal.<br /><br />Peace, Ben<br /><br />Eph 3: 20-21

review/summary: Kashi has brought cereal back into my life
review/text: When I was a kid I ate cereal all the time for breakfast.  As I got older, I started to get away from the cereal in favor of things like whole-grain English muffins.  This was because the cereals out there were either chock full of sugar or "healthy" and, therefore, tasteless with a cardboard-like texture.  Kashi to the rescue!<br /><br />I particularly love this cereal because of the honey flavor.  It is a nice, light flavor and has what I consider to be the perfect degree of sweetness.  Unlike with sugar cereals, I don't have the sensation of instant tooth decay when I eat this one.  Better yet, the cereal is a blend of whole grains.  I find that eating this cereal and other Kashi products helps me to stay full longer and also makes me less likely to crave sugary goods.  I've long been reluctant to let my daughter eat much cereal for breakfast for the abovementioned reasons but she loves this cereal just as much as I do.  It's definitely gratifying to be able to serve my daughter something that she not only loves, but that I know is also healthy for her.

review/summary: Really Good!
review/text: This cereal is great.  I never get tired of it!  The only downside (for me at least) is that it has soy lecithin.  I am somewhat allergic and if I eat too much it upsets my stomach.  I realize this is only an issue for a rare few of us, but a lot of "health conscious" companies consider things like soy, gluten, etc.<br /><br />Considering most people aren't allergic to soy, this cereal is definitely worth a try!

review/text: I like kashi products but this was just plain terrible to me. The texture was like ground up and processed cardboard...i really feel bad giving this such a bad rating because i like this company but i have to be honest...this is the kind of product that turns people away from trying to eat healthier. I do think they could have done a better job with this ..mainly the texture ..its not the least bit crunchy dry and if you add milk it just turns to mush instantly. Having said that i'm glad some people like it ..i just dont happen to be one of them.

review/summary: Kashi Honey Sunshine Cereal
review/text: I have a love hate relationship with cereal, actually with all breakfast foods in general.  I really have to be in the mood for it if I'm going to want it.  And finally today I had a craving for cereal, so I excitedly tore into the box of this new cereal I had gotten on a whim at the store.  Sadly, after this cereal experience, I don't think I'm going to be in the mood for breakfast foods for a good long while again.<br /><br />Honey Sunshine looked good on the package.  Like sweet little morsels just waiting to be scooped up with a spoonful of milk.  So that's what I did.  And then I got the blandness that is this cereal.  I couldn't taste the honey.  At all.  Not even a little sweetness.  To be honest I didn't taste much of any kind of flavor, which is strange since they supposedly use a seven grain blend.  It was just the crunch and the taste of milk with maybe a little rice flavored after-taste.  I guess the crunch of the texture was nice, but that was the only happy experience I had with this cereal.<br /><br />I will say this, Kashi usually has a decent line-up of ingredients.  Their seven grain blend seems healthy and the sweetener is evaporated cane juice.  But I did notice the main ingredient in this cereal was yellow corn meal.  Always with the corn it would seem.  And there is some honey in this mixture, but it was near the bottom of the list along with some other obscure ingredients I had never heard of before.  Health wise this cereal seems ok too. There is quite a bit of sodium somehow, 6% of the daily value.  And the sugars are 6 grams even if it didn't taste like there was any in there.  Finally, 2 grams of protein seems to round it out.<br /><br />So a decent listing of ingredients but it really isn't worth it if you're not going to enjoy the flavor.  I won't be buying this cereal again.  And unfortunately I still have most of the box left that I'll have to convince myself to eat so I don't waste it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I'm not a health food nut by any means. I actually went to the store today intending to buy Cap'n Crunch, but this stuff was on sale and the picture on the box showed a cereal that looked similar to Cap'n Crunch. I know Kashi foods tend to be healthier, and I'm also trying to save money, so I bought this cereal thinking, "why not?" However, I wasn't really expecting much.<br /><br />I am pleased to report, though, that this stuff is really tasty! It doesn't really taste like The Cap'n, but it's slightly sweet, pleasantly crunchy, and has its own great flavor. Plus, it has way more fiber than Cap'n Crunch. Probably less sugar, too.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I eat my cereal dry. I'm not sure what it would taste like with milk, but I imagine it would be good.

review/text: Wow, this cereal is really addictive!  A lot of other reviews have (correctly) compared it to "Cap'n Crunch", and it's true, it does have the same shape and texture.  But tastewise I'd also compare it to "Honeycomb", because once when I had a real craving for "Honeycomb" I stumbled on this, noticed the generous amount of fiber, and decided to give it a try.  YUMMMMMM!!  I'm so glad I found it!  It's healthy and has lots of fiber & stuff like that - and at the same time, reminds me of those kids' cereals I used to love!  ENJOY!!

review/summary: Tastes healthy.  Not going to fool the kids.
review/text: My standard for a good tasting cereal is whether I'd want to eat it straight from the box.  Kashi's Honey Sunshine did not pass that test for me. It tasted too "healthy."  You know the commercials where the person in the grocery store doesn't believe the product has any fiber?  Would not happen with this cereal.  I thought it tasted mealy.<br /><br />I knew it wasn't going to be as sweet as Cap'n Crunch (and that's a good thing) but I hoped it would be closer to Honey Nut Cheerios (which has 2 grams fiber and 10 grams sugar compared to the 6 of each in this one).  For me it tasted like Corn Pops with significantly less sugar and more fiber (Corn Pops has 0.2 gr fiber and a whopping 14.8 grams of sugar). Eating Honey Sunshine dry, I thought it had the taste and mouth feel of additional fiber.  As I said above, mealy.<br /><br />For a healthy cereal, it doesn't taste bad but it isn't going to fool a child used to more highly sweetened cereals.  But not many children need high fiber cereals so that might not be a consideration.  I won't buy this particular cereal again; I even bought a different cereal because I didn't want to finish the rest of my Honey Sunshine.

review/text: I have had the fever tree and regatta brands, but not the third one.  We are lovers of the very popular Moscow Mule cocktail.  The fever tree has a true ginger bite, a bit on the spicy side but not as spicy as the ginger beer you will find in the Latin section of the grocery store ( goslings I believe? ).  I really like the regatta. It is a bit more neutral but still very tasty.  I think this a great gift idea.  Attach some cocktail or mocktail recipes and it is a great housewarming or party gift.

review/summary: Not bad, some of the better products out there
review/text: I tried different brands, and I find myself buying this one more frequently whenever I can find it at a good price (~6). I use it as a salad dressing instead of vinegar.  Or just add water and drink! I do not have fancy lab instruments to verify authencity ( NMR testing can actually trace the carbon to the poemegrante tree).  The label claims 100% pomegranate.  In my opinion, labels are not always true.  Other brands list, sugar, flavors, ..etc.<br /><br />Compared to other stuff I tried, this is is good.. I have one pomegranate tree in my backyard and I make my own juice whenever I have the fruit.  This taste good but nothing like the real stuff.  This does not mean it is fake however, the high temperature cooking process they use does affect the taste.  Plus there are many varieties of pomegranates out there, some sweet, some tart, some blonde, some red..etc.  If you have access to the real pomegranates, I suggest you make your own, otherwise buy this.  Making pomegrante juice is easy in a blender, but it cost alot to buy the fruit, if you can find it

review/summary: You should not go... with this mango.
review/text: I bought this for someone who loves both mangos and cold brew Iced T.  After trying this out, neither one of us really cared for the taste, as it was pretty bland.  Turned out we just ended up throwing it out and getting what she usually drinks which is Lipton Cold Brew.  I would not reccomend it.

review/summary: Great Iced Tea!
review/text: I originally tasted this as iced tea in a fine restaurant several years ago. I asked for the brand and flavor and have been ordering it ever since! When I serve it to friends they always want to know just what I had asked!<br />My son-in-law, who does not drink coffee, visited us and I gave him some as iced tea. He loved it, took some bags home with him and has been drinking it both hot and cold ever since. He now has his father drinking it!

review/summary: Makes cloudy iced tea
review/text: This tea is just OK. It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste any better than Luzianne or Lipton. And, unlike Luzianne, it's cloudy which I really don't like to see in a clear pitcher and glass. I would be embarrassed to serve this to guests. I've made it according to the enclosed "moon brewing" directions and also in my iced tea maker. It's cloudy both ways. Also, these tea bags make a gallon of tea each so unless you like really strong tea, they're too big for a 3-quart iced tea maker unless you dilute it after you brew. I'm disappointed and won't order this flavor or this brand again.

review/summary: No heat, but super easy to cook and good flavor
review/text: I really like this product for it's simplicity. Essentially a single serving of pre-made curry in less than 5 minutes - what's not to like? You toss the packet in a pot of boiling water for five minutes, cut it open, pour over rice and you have a meal. It's also possible to microwave this curry, but it's easier if you just boil the packet instead. The flavor is good and carrots & potatoes are already included (also they are not mushy or overcooked) so all you need is some cooked rice and if you choose a little cooked beef, lamb or chicken and you have an entire meal with almost no trouble at all.<br /><br /> My ONLY complaint and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the medium hot should really be called mild. There is no heat at all to this curry - if you want heat, bring your own and add it. This company (brand) makes the same product in a black box that is called "hot" and while I don't consider it truly hot by an stretch, it does have some heat and thus a little more depth of flavor. I much prefer that version to this one in the green box. However, in a pinch, craving a single serving of curry and being too lazy to do all the work of cutting/cooking fresh veggies etc either of these versions will totally work. ESPECIALLY if you live in a place with zero Indian restaurants and no Indian food options in the local grocery stores.

review/summary: The only treat my dog likes.
review/text: My Yorkie was a rescue, so I don't know anything about his puppyhood.  It took me a long time to figure out the commands he had been taught.  Trying to get him to respond to treats so I could get some new concepts into his brain was interesting.  He didn't seem to care for any of the standard treats other dogs love.  I think I tried everything in the local pet stores.<br /><br />Then I bought some wild Alaskan salmon on line and they sent a sample of these.  An instant hint.<br /><br />Also check out the salmon oil.  My picky eater would sometimes not eat when I fed him.  In general that isn't a problem, but I do want him to poop on schedule, like when I am home to let him out.  Eating on schedule is essential.  With a little salmon oil on the bottom of the bowl, regular food, and a little more, he eats soon as I put it down.<br /><br />There are several flavors, some chewy and some crunchy, but my dog has to have the chewy salmon.  He has gone through one 2.5 pound bag, and isn't bored with them yet.

review/text: My dogs LOVE the Yummy Chummies and we've been giving them to all three since they were puppies (our oldest is now 5). We normally buy them at COSTCO but they were out for two months, so I ordered them at Amazon. Quite a mark up guys! I pay $9.39 for a 2.5 lb bag at Costco and $25.00 at Amazon!! Today, Costco carried them again, so I stocked up. They are excellent treats and my dogs are worth it, but come on guys, THAT much of a markup?? Yikes!

review/text: We switched our three dogs to Yummy Chummies after we almost lost one to the chicken treats from China. The dogs love them and they are good for their coats and diet. They make an excellent training treat and can be broken up into smaller tidbits if necessary.  This is the first time buying them on line and they seemed slightly less moist than the ones we bought in the store.  Very happy that they are made in the USA and will continue to provide them to the dogs.

review/summary: Poor quality
review/text: I had purchased the premium variety of these treats when Costco carried them, and my dogs loved them.  I bought the original recipe  treats here because the premium was too expensive.  What I recieved was a bag filled with broken and crumbled pieces and a lot of dust (Amazon shipped it thrown in with several books, with no padding around it). One of my dogs flatly refuses to eat the treat pieces (the other dog would eat sawdust if I offered it to him), which makes me think they have gone bad.  Since I cannot find a use-by date on the package, I do not trust that this is a wholesome, safe product.  the remainder has gone into the rubbish.  For the safety of your animals, I advise that you not purchase these from Amazon.  I believe they sell old product.

review/summary: Best Dog Treat For Picky Dogs
review/text: I have the an extremely picky little dog, a Havanese, and he literally refuses to eat treats that most any dog would eat. I went through a lot of treats and spent a lot of money before finding Yummy Chummies and I considered myself lucky when I found these at a local store.<br /><br />My dog loves fish, and he absolutely ADORES these and will do just about anything for one. I've been rewarding him with these multiple times a day for two years and he's still not tired of them.  I started buying the 2.5 lb. bag here on Amazon because we go through them so quickly. One word of warning -- they do have a strong fishy odor when you open the bag, but individual treats do not smell as strong.  That said, your dog will not end up with fishy breath!<br /><br />Tip:  for small dogs, these are soft and big enough to cut in half to help stretch your dollar.

review/text: Dogs love these treats.  I work with a number of dogs and I have not met one that will turn their head at these treats.  I cut them up in two to three smaller pieces and have them ready in baggies for training purposes.  They are soft, chewy and fresh.  Dogs (and humans) can smell the salmon and it puts them at attention for what they are working for.  I do recommend purchasing the two bags for $37.68.  A much better deal then purchasing the one bag.  These treats will stay fresh.  I've tried many dog training treats including the use of home made chicken, hotdogs, and bacon.  This is the best so far of all of them and probably the healthiest.

My dog Sophie really responds to her commands when she knows she'll get a Yummie. I dole them out sparingly as my vet says Sophie's "living large" and needs to loose 5 lbs...:)) I break them in halfs when I give them to her. I recommend them to everybody.

I used to give him duck jerky, but since it's made in China, I worried about the quality.  With these being made in Alaska with wild salmon, I have no worries, and the salmon oil does wonder for his skin, coat and joints.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1CG50">Arctic Paws 2-1/2-Pound Yummy Chummies Original Bulk treats</a>I picked up a package of these chews at a local pet store and my dogs just loved the salmon taste.  I wanted to get another since the chews were so popular with the dogs and I went back to the pet store I purchased them from.  They couldn't find any and didn't have any on order, so I came home and went to Amazon, my go-to guys. The order arrived in two days and the dogs are happy again.  They just love these treats.  Both dogs sit on the floor and stare up at the top of the refrigerator where I keep the large bag.  It didn't take long for them to find the hiding place, so I know they like the Chewies and the salmon is also a healthy treat for them.  I will continue buying them at Amazon.<br /><br />The Chewies are soft but keep well in a sealed bag so they don't have to be refrigerated.  This makes the 2 and 1/2 bag a real deal.

review/text: I originally bought these on a trip to Alaska....small bag. My dog loved them. Their magic, however, is the fact that with all that salmon oil, Yummy Chummies cured an excessive shedding problem. I was brushing daily, taking him for expensive chemical shedding treatments and had even resorted to vacuuming the dog. Nothing helped. The amount of shedding was MAJOR! (I had a Golden for 10 years... I am not a shedding wimp here either). Within 2 days the improvement started and has been wonderful. We are down to normal dog hair in the house and much more snuggle time.

review/summary: Yummy Chummies are the Best!
review/text: If you care about what your dog eats, this treat is a good one and healthy.  It contains Omega 6 and 3 fatty acids for healthy skin and coat.  Also  promotes healthy heart, reduces plaque and tartar buildup and is nourishing.  My dog does not get treats just for the sake of having a treat, but if he did this is the treat I would use.  I use these strictly for training because he responds so well in order to get one.  I break each piece into about 8 smaller pieces and he gets one little piece each time he responds to what I ask of him.  My dog loves these Yummy Chummies and so do all the dogs at the training class.<br />Thanks Amazon for carrying these quality treats for dogs!

review/summary: Yummy Chummies
review/text: I purchased Yummy Chummies about 7 years ago while on a trip to Alaska.  We brought a bag home as a special treat for our Sheltie.  He loves this treat so much that we have continued to buy the product online. It is a bit pricey to purchase at pet stores due to the small package size, so we buy the larger 2 1/2 pound value bag. Our Sheltie is now 12 years old and still looks forward to his special treat.

review/summary: Dogs LOVE them!
review/text: I first got a hold of this product on a visit to AK and brought it home to my sled dogs as a souvenir. They loved it so much that I HAD to order more, but of course a flight to AK was not in the near future. I was happy to find that Amazon had them and offered free shipping if I spent enough! I ordered two of the 2 1/2 pound bags and was disappointed to find one of the bags had not been sealed properly and product was all over the shipping box. Though not a huge problem, it makes me wonder whether the poor seal was a company mishap or result of bad handling. The product is still edible, or so it seems, as my dogs still love them. I just wonder if the second SEALED bag will be more welcomed! For like-ability...I give it a 5 star. For packaging...4 star. Overall, I will buy this product again.

My dogs still love it as much, but in this time of economizing I am not pleased with the change.

review/summary: Good vegan gummy
review/text: I've been a vegetarian for almost 8 years and gummy bears have been something I've missed terribly. Since gelatin is the key ingredient in gummy bears (gives it the elasticity), it's hard to duplicate that when making a veggie version. I picked these up at a local HFS on sale and was pretty impressed. They have a good flavor and the texture is pretty nice (note: not as chewy as the traditional ones). This brand and Sunny Bears are both 2 I enjoy and recommend to other veg*ns.

review/text: I'm very glad I tried this product over shelling out the big bucks for the real thing.  I thought the taste was good - the olive oil was actually quite good - but a bit underwhelming for the hype (and cost) of real baby eels (at least in Spain).  Definitely worth a try though if you are curious!  Delivery was quick, packaging was good.  Just keep in mind that this is the size of an anchovy tin and shipping is more than the actual product.  Although still cheaper than the real thing, it's value is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I just can't give 5 stars to something I probably wouldn't order again.

review/text: This brand of salmon treats have a fairly strong smell. The scent helps keep your dog focused if their attention waivers, however the smell can also be a liability if your dog is so food motivated that it makes him/her crazy.<br /><br />With wheat as the second ingredient (which dogs can't really digest), I wouldn't give these treat to my dogs. Look for something with meat as the first ingredient (not meal or by-product), and without rice, wheat, corn, flour, or sugar added.

review/summary: $36 for 21 lbs of bad dog food? You can do a lot better!!!
review/text: Look at the first three ingredients of the following products (the first ingredients on the list are the highest in the makeup of the food):<br /><br />Product A: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal<br />Product B: Chicken,chicken meal,whole grain brown rice<br /><br />Does a product primarily composed of corn and "by-products" sound as healthy for your dog as one whose first two ingredients are chicken and followed up by rice, a quality grain? Do dogs feed themselves on primarily corn in the wild? Of course not.<br /><br />And what if I told you that Product B is sold for $30 per 40lb bag at Costco, while Product A is being sold at $36 for 21lbs worth of inferior food? Which sounds like the better deal to you?<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and save yourself some cash while also providing a healthier meal for your loved one. I'm not here to push Costco's Kirkland brand dog food, which is Product B in this comparison and is clearly a better value then Beneful. Blue Buffalo, Taste of the Wild, Canidae,etc are other examples of much higher quality foods that can be had for a lot cheaper. For once you can eat healthy AND save money.

review/text: My dog was on this food for a while because i like many other people thought the veggies on the bag meant it was healthy but what it really means is their is no substance just corn and wheat gluten and dyes to color the food to make it look like vegetables. Please take it from me, my dog was chewing holes in his skin because of this food,i spent $700 at the vet for anti-histimine shots and creams and visits only to find out from my groomer that it was the food i was giving her. She was allergic to the dyes in it. I started giving her California naturals and she looked like she gained 3 years of her life back. Shiny coat, healthy glassy eyes, good energy and happier than she had been in a while. She is 14 now and i will never buy her anything but wonderful food like Nutro, California naturals, Merritt.
