review/text: Over the years, this chili powder has gotten harder to find. It has been a staple of our family's chili for decades, and I am very glad to be able to still purchase it. It has a perfect blend of seasonings that requires nothing more than ground beef, onions, and tomato soup to make an outstanding bowl of chili.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A8SDCO">Williams Chili Seasoning Bulk Mix 18 oz</a>

review/summary: Real chili
review/text: This is real chili.  I originally found  it by accident when I couldn't find my old chili mix.  This is even better.  It does seem pricey  for chili mix but it goes a long way..  I also use  it to season other dishes  because I don't have to stop and measure several different spices.  Try it first exactly as the instructions on the bottle, then go from there.  Adjustments for the group you are feeding are easy.  Just use a little less or a little more.  It's fast, easy and delicious.

review/summary: The New Standard in BBQ Sauces and Rubs
review/text: We love the Original Sauce on brisket, chicken...I even frequently use it in place of salad dressing.  Taste it once and you'll understand why it's voted as the best BBQ sauce by Men's Health & Country Living magazines as well as a winner of numerous national BBQ competitions.  It has a great blend of spices that complement your food without being a "sauce bully".  It's also nice to not cringe at the ingredient label (16 organic ingredients with no HFCS or Trans Fats).  Glad to see it on Amazon so I don't have to be at the mercy of the supply at my local Harris Teeter.

review/summary: As seen on Shark Tank!
review/text: I just had to try this! So far I have opened the spice rub and the original sauce. LOVE THEM!!!! I have put them both on chicken and meat. I REALLY liked using both on the meat. My roommate really liked the spice rub on the chicken. The kids (ages 12-18) even liked it and they are picky eaters. Whenever I make chicken or meat now they ask if I'm going to use the spices. I'm looking forward to opening the other two bottles. If I am happy with the other two I will DEFINETLY buy more and I'll buy it here on Amazon. At their website they offer a 4 pack at the same price but the shipping is higher. The difference is that Amazon's is a sampler set. At the website you can mix and match- for example 2 spice rubs and 2 sauces of choice, 4 sauces of choice, etc.

review/text: The Original sauce and rub are great:  the hints of ancho chile really makes for some great bbq!  The Sweet sauce is also good, but my tastes in BBQ sauce tend to the robust and spicy like the Original.  I've put rub on the pork steaks, then grilled them with the sauce, delicious!  I've also put the rub on chicken for some great bbq sandwiches. You can also mix the rub with Old Bay and put it on fish.  The Mustard BBQ sauce is new, and I've yet to try it.

review/text: Coming from a popcorn obsessee, this is the BEST STUFF OUT THERE. Actually. I made the mistake of sampling it at the store, bought some, and now I fear I'll never be able to go without it :) It's DELICIOUS. Amazing. You absolutely HAVE to try this. It's the perfect balance of yumminess, with a light, airy texture, and simple ingredients. It's fairly healthy! I could EASILY eat the entire bag in one sitting though, which would kind of cross over the healthy aspect of it ;)<br /><br />However, this isn't such a great price on it. My Super Target sells each bag for $3.00.... it really should be cheaper to buy it in bulk on Amazon. Unfortunately, this time, it's not :/

review/summary: Disappointment
review/text: When I stumbled across Angie's Kettle Corn, as a fan of popcorn, and a minor health nut I was thrilled. As I opened the bag however, I was sorely disappointed. Best word to describe the flavor: bland. I tried the white cheddar and caramel flavors, both lacked any substantive taste. I even went so far as to put sea salt on my popcorn but it did not help the flavor. Save your money and buy a better product such as True North's Almond Pecan nut clusters instead!

review/text: I was buying this at a cider mill in the fall and kept eating it hoping it was healthier than potato chips.  Once the cider mill closed, good kettle corn was hard to find until I looked on Amazon.  Well, I bought a case of this on warehouse deals and between my husband and myself and taking one bag to my mom at her assisted living home, most of these are gone already.  This corn tastes great and very habit forming.  My husband always picks on me for shopping but this corn he hasn't complained about, just keeps going in the garage to get another bag out to eat when he gets home from work.  I will definitely buy more when the box is empty.

review/summary: Great taste and HORRID quality control
review/text: Bought several 18 oz bags at Costco.  The taste is superb and no one should buy this product until they fix the quality control problems.  Popcorn is one of the top causes of broken teeth so Angie's may cost you a root canal and crown becasue of the excessive amount of unpopped corn that you may accidentally chomp down on.<br /><br />The unpops are throughout the bag - not just at the bottom.  The 'sweet' is added to the popped corn before all the unpops are shaken, strained, seived or whatever to get them to fall away to be discarded.  The uppopped are then glued via the sweet sticky to the popped corn.  Even shaking the bag will not dislodge the unpops throughout the bag.<br /><br />When you get to the bottom of a large bag, there is more than 1/2 of small pieces and unpops (I measured).<br /><br />Every handful of Angie's that you pick up, you need to transfer to your other hand and remove the stuck on unpops... or throw the bag out... or risk expensive dental work.<br /><br />This is not a commercially viable product As Is.  Sorry.

review/summary: This was a Godsend.
review/text: First things first, this is magical, but only one component to fix your problem. Make sure you're got collars and sprays/topical treatment for the pet(s), too (if not flea lights like Victor) to cover all areas. If you only go with one approach, it's likely you'll be going in circles.<br /><br />I read aaaallll the reviews. Used Adams before and did well, but this seasons fleas were, apparently, ones where hell hath no fury in comparison.<br /><br />Zodiac helped make a mountain into a mole hill. We had a nightmare on our hands, and were looking at bombing as being our last and only option.<br /><br />Enter Zodiac - thoroughly sprayed on 8x5 carpet, couch, and two recliners. AS A TIP - covering all of those areas well took the entire bottle, if you're trying to gauge for your own needs.<br /><br />Thinking of keeping a spare on hand, because fleas are scary in their relentlessness, and heck knows its best to beat them at first sight.

review/text: I had searched far and wide for this scotch bonnet pepper sauce nearby where I live...but it just seems that the midwest doesn't crave this particular flavor.  I fell in love with this stuff in the Caymen Islands and finally found it through Amazon.  It's a fabulous flavor-- mixing the 'zing' with a bit of unique sweetness.  Unbelievable on most everything...meat (pulled pork, hamburgers etc.),pizza, soups (especially chili), with snacks and appetizers (like hummas), and in pasta (my favorite....mac n cheese for a nice variation).  I bought three bottles this time, to make sure I have enough to last for a while.  One thing to be aware of is the thick texture.  I added about an once of filtered water to bring it to a more desirable consistency for myself, after having used a small portion...I just added the water and shook it up.  To me, this sauce is not just HOT like some of the others out there that have no flavor attached to the heat, instead, it just has a fabulous, dynamic flavor that I simply can't get enough of.  At less than four dollars a bottle...you CANNOT pass this JCS scotch bonnet sauce up!

When I opened this most recent bag, I noticed that there were rubbery morsels mixed in with the kibbles.  The shape & size of the kibbles changed slightly also.  After 5 days of attempting to get my dog to eat this I finally gave up.  I called Purina, and the representative I spoke to recommended Pro Plan as an alternative.  My dog loves the Pro Plan, which looks just like the way the Purina One Vibrant Maturity use to look.  Purina is an excellent company; the rep. sent me a coupon for a free bag of Pro Plan and another $5.00 coupon.  She told me that the formula was changed about 1 year ago.  I donated this bag to the local shelter.

When I received the package of only 8#s, I was disappointed with the size vs the cost.  I am a new amazon food consumer.  I will continue to order but will be more wary of quantity vs cost especially with these types of items.  The product is great and I did receive it in a timely manner, aside from a delay due to weather storm in the Southeastern Mountains.

It has a nice, sweet taste and keeps its fizz better than its competitor, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024NXUZI">Diet Pepsi Cola - 24/24 oz. bottles</a>. It's strange how Diet Coke relaxes me when I need to relax and gets me going when I need to get going!

review/summary: Interesting rejection
review/text: It is interesting how I had written a review and it was rejected. I looked over the guidelines and there is nothing that was even close to a problem, so here is the benign rewrite of it:<br /><br />Pricing is just not that great considering I can buy it at full price at a number of local retailers for about 67-cents a bottle. If it was the same price or less, then I would consider buying it online. So until that happens, I will have to pass as this is not as good of a deal as it should be.

review/summary: I Love This Korean BBQ!
review/text: To be perfectly honest, this is the first time I've ever had Korean BBQ and it absolutely knocked my socks off.  A close friend recommended Mama Eun's home delivery service and I decided to go for it.  I placed my order, paid the bill, and forgot all about it.... until one day when the delivery guy dropped a package on my doorstep.<br /><br />Mama Eun's packaging system is great!  Everything came securely wrapped up inside a cozy disposable (or reusable) ice cooler.  The freezer packs inside kept the meat nice and cold during shipping and are now hard at work in my freezer (nice bonus!).<br /><br />Then, I went to town.<br /><br />I tossed about half of the package onto the grill and a few minutes later the aroma had my mouth watering.  Seriously, people - this is great stuff!  Everything is already marinated inside the package and ready to go.  The meat was so tender and fresh I seriously reconsidered every buying any kind of meat at my local grocer ever again.  Who knew delivered food items could be so darn yummy!<br /><br />Now I'm hooked.  I love Mama Eun's "homemade style" and business approach.  Everything was very professional (but not in a lame corporate way).  They even included some cooking tips/directions in the delivery.  Needless to say, i was very impressed by this company and will be back again soon.  I'm placing my next order right now...

Most importantly, galbi was sooooo delicious. I have to say that it's better than my mom's. I became a facebook fan. :) I ordered 2 lbs which was a lot more than I expected, but I think that I will order more in order to save shipping cost.

The amount of meat you get is more than enough to feed 4, and for the price it's a great value.<br /><br />If you like Galbi, or Korean BBQ in general, I highly recommend Mama Eun's!!!

review/summary: A great root beer if you're looking for a smooth character
review/text: Henry Weinhard's Root Beer is quite easily my favorite, I must admit. There is a creaminess to it, a body, that makes it a real pleasure to drink. However, there is a trade-off.<br /><br />If you're looking for a root beer with a biting, unapologetically brash character, you best look elsewhere. This rootbeer has subtle notes of vanilla mingled with it's sassafras, hinting at it's sweeter cousin, the Weinhard's cream soda. In my opinion it's mildness makes it extremely drinkable. For this reason I personally prefer to use other root beers that are thinner and less complex for root beer floats and enjoy this by itself.<br /><br />Before TSA rules prevented me from packing liquids in my carry-on baggage I would always bring a six-pack back with me from West coast sojourns. It was always worth it.

I now go to the grocery store and by them by the case. Buy it you will not be dissatisfied. It has a very creamy flavor with a good head. Yes, not many do. I hate when i buy a root beer and there is no foam at the top. This you open it and sit it down and it rises. This is one of those true root beers. Turns out they started making this drink during prohibition and tried to make it just like a beer, needless to say it's one of the best on the market.

review/summary: Wonderfully complex flavor- A party in your mouth!
review/text: I discovered Weinhard's several years ago while living in Oregon.  I was so immediately impressed with the wonderfully complex taste that it became a tradition to have Weinhard's at all of my special events,birthdays, Superbowl, holidays etc.  When I moved back east I really missed my Weinhards.  One time I was out in Utah visiting and drove back to Ohio with about a 100 bottles in the trunk.<br /><br />When the bottle is first opened there is a thick creamy head unlike anything I have ever seen in a soda product.  When you taste it, there is a progression of separate distinct wonderful flavors as it fizzes in your mouth.  Weinhard's is primarily a microbrewery out west.  The Root Beer is is just a part of what they do.  They have been using the same recipe since they first developed it during the Prohibition era (for good reason).<br /><br />In the past twelve months there have been a few large grocery stores that have begun carrying Weinhard's in the Midwest.  Initially I was very excited but after sampling a few cases I have observed that it not quite the same as what I had fallen in love with.  I don't know if this is because they changed the recipe company-wide (maybe in an attempt to be more price competitive in a down economy) or if it is made a bit differently in this part of the country.<br /><br />Either way, it's still my favorite Brand hands down.

Nice selection of tea flavors, the fruit ones have a natural taste.<br />The box is nice, about what you'd expect in a tea box. Made of 1/4" lath that is stained a dark brown. The stain chips easily, but then lath isn't a hard wood. I knocked the whole box off the dining table and got a small crack in one corner of the lid, I expected much worse damage. If you're buying to use the box for another purpose later, remember that it was only meant to hold tea.

review/text: I bought this item because I was at a loss for an idea on a Mother's Day gift to give my wife. I saw this item and its 1-star rating, and that piqued my curiosity. How can a purchase of tea bags be given only one star?<br /><br />I received this just a few days before Mother's Day and my wife talked me into giving it to her right away. My wife and I are quite pleased with both the nice, partitioned box (it is just like the picture and description I saw before ordering it) as well as the large assortment of teas.<br /><br />In this particular case you are getting the following:<br />A handsome tea chest that is lined with red velvet.<br />120 bags of tea; 20 each of Orange Spice, Raspberry, Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Peach & Green Teas.<br />Each bag is individually wrapped in foil.<br />The whole thing cost less than $20!!!<br /><br />Neadless to say, the five stars is partly for the great value we got in the box plus teas as well as to partly offset the ridiculous 1-star rating it had previously received.

review/text: After reading the reviews, both positive and negative, I decided to give this a shot.  After all, the gold box price made it almost silly not to try.<br /><br />Yes, the box is flimsy.  While attractive, it is very easy to damage and not really suited for much of anything else, other than holding tea bags or small trinkets of some sort.  But let's be honest here; you really don't buy a tea assortment for the box, do you?<br /><br />The tea: yes, this is what you buy it for, and the flavors, at least to my pallet, are wonderful.  I will not pretend to be some expert at tea, but I do know what I like, and I very much enjoy a number of the flavors.  My wife is enjoying this collection even more than I am, so how could I possibly say anything wrong about it.  I have not tried all the flavors yet, but between she and I we have, and not a one has been a dissapointment.<br /><br />All in all, we have been very happy with this assortment.  Due to the nature of the box, I probably would have given this 4.5 stars, but I will not mark it down to 4 as the tea quality deserves the benifit of the doubt.  While maybe not for the tea "expert", I think those looking for a nice blend with nice flavors will be very happy with this.

review/summary: Nice Deal for Mediocre Tea
review/text: Got this on special for $10.30 :-). At that price I can't complain. Presentation was nice. Tea is adequate, nothing to write home about. Yes, Twinnings or even Bigelow is better. Very flavored-Green-Tea oriented, and actually it only has 10 Earl Grey in there, not 20. So the selection is not really idea, when you consider how many interesting teas are in a Twinnings assortment (and EG is my favorite). Had I paid $36 I'd be giving it one star. Box is good, but not a neat hinged box like you get at a fancy restaurant. The wrappers are garish.<br /><br />I've lowered my rating because when I moved, I left the mostly full box behind.

review/summary: Very Disappointed!
review/text: I should have known that there was something fishy when the product details said that the product dimensions are 13 x 10.5 x 2.5 inches and 3.8 pounds when the shipping weight said 2.15 pounds.  In actuality it is 12 X 10 X 2.5 and comes in a CHEAP (do not even know if it IS wood) box AND it weighs 1.14 pounds on my postal scale.  However, to be fair, I have not taken the plastic wrapper off because it is a gift so it could be very, VERY thin wood.  In addition, the container opens like a box rather than a chest.  There are no hinges on the back.  I am very disappointed with this tea "chest" AND it's price!

review/summary: I would buy it again
review/text: I decided to try this sauce recently and overall I thought it was delicious.  I've had Pad Thai at many different restaurants around Chicago and Boston, and my version of Pad Thai using this sauce felt less "greasy" as my wife put it.  Another reviewer commented that the flavor was not "authentic"; whether this is true or not, it was still good.  In the future I may try a different sauce just to compare, but I would have no problems buying this sauce again.

review/summary: Decent
review/text: For store-bought pad Thai sauce, this isn't terrible.  Restaurants have a variety of styles, so it's hard to be "authentic" to what most Americans expect, but this has all the major themes.  I have yet to see another storebought sauce that contains all of the following: tamarind, dried shrimp, fish sauce, and fresh chili paste.  This does.  Most others are a combination of high fructose corn syrup and vinegar.  If you want higher quality product than this, I'd skip directly to making your own from scratch and check out Chez Pim's pad Thai recipe.  Also: Don't be shy with the oil.

review/summary: Worth a try...
review/text: I tried Pad Thai during a vacation to Hawaii and loved it. This sauce did not really compare to what I had on the islands. I tried it with chicken and with shrimp in my own kitchen, but it just wasn't as good. Not enough depth of flavor. Now, having said that, I intend to use the whole jar. I can't get Pad Thai where I live, so this is better than nothing! And its an excuse to use extra roasted peanuts, yum!

review/summary: Geat Curry
review/text: If you like Indian food then this is a great curry powder. We use to buy this in Atlanta but when we moved to Southern Virginia no store carries this brand.  We tried other brands and they did not live up to the quality of taste that Badia added to our food.  The only down side is the shipment is 12 bottles and it will take a long time to use them all up.  So we have given a lot of them to friends for them to try, so I guess it is not much od an inconvenience.  All in all a great product.

review/summary: La Panzanella Sesame on your Doorstep!  Mmmmmm mmm good.
review/text: We found these La Panzanella Sesame Mini Croccantini and their regular version at the Marin French Cheese store in Marin County, on a trip in 2011 with friends.  Great crackers, combined in a fresh see-through package, that shows off the product well, but most importantly - their taste was just great!  Love 'em.  Couldn't find them in the local markets, so of course - Amazon came to the rescue as someone else penned (okay, I'm ripping that bi-line off..lol). Its true, too.  Ordered up, and they showed up - undaunted a few days later, with the Prime program.  What a delight.  Ordered up caviar as well, just this past week - to bring in some new flavors for the new year, with these crackers.  Tis going to be a great 2011.  Enjoy the crackers!!  Try them.  They are darn good.  Better than Ack Mack by far.

review/text: I discovered these crackers during a visit to Seattle- and couldn't locate them in my area markets- so Amazon to the rescue again for hard to find foodstuff- The crackers are terrific and low in calories- they make a wonderful snack on their own and are perfect and sturdy enough to hold cheeses and spreads- and there are two sizes- one to use more as a flatbread instead of bread in a dinner bread basket and the other this smaller size<br />I personally like the black pepper and the sesame but all of the flavors are yummy..

review/text: Worst Thing I have ever put in my mouth. Ever. I opened them, immediately noticed a 'funky' smell, but gave it to my one year old anyway with out much further explanation.  I tried a bite of it after she started to cry and run away from the bar. I could not spit out my bite fast enough! It made my usually strong stomach churn and I could not get the taste to go away. They smell and taste like rotting dead for months shark carcass. No joke. Seriously. She is now afraid to eat anything that resembles a rice crispy bar. which is actually pretty adorable.

I find that the simplest pasta recipe involving Colatura may well be the best (3 parts excellent olive oil with garlic sauteed lightly, 1 part colatura, pinch of red pepper flakes, touch of parsley, salt & pepper to taste, toss pasta in this sauce). Distinctly different from (and better than) using the best available bottled anchovies.

review/summary: Never Thought I'd LIke Something Other than Quacker Apple Cinnamon
review/text: My wife and I picked up some packages of these of the dollar store and weren't sure if they'd be a good deal or not. Were very pleasantly surprised. I almost exclusively eat Quaker apple cinnamon oatmeal, but I really liked the three flavors I tried.<br /><br />I have to comment on the great packaging idea of this product comes in. First, if you care it's post have lower amount of packaging than comparable products and be better for the environment. Anyway, the thing I really do like about this is the pouches are also the measuring cup. You take a bowl, tear the pouch open, dump out the contents, then you fill be empty pouch with water up to a line on the pouch, dump it in the bowl, stir and then nuke it for 90 seconds. I don't know why nobody is ever thought of this before in any of the packaging I've seen, but it saves the guessing at how much water to put in or caring stupid measuring cup around with you if you're eating it work like I do. My only minor gripe is the line it asks you to tear at isn't always the area that had the tear point so I mistook the tear line for the fill line and put in too much water the first four or five times I used it.<br /><br />When we went back to the store we picked up another three boxes pulled me out for the next few weeks. Give the stuff a try. You won't regret it!

I have tried the peaches and cream flavored, the apple cinnamon flavored and the strawberries and cream.  They are all good, but the peaches and cream is my favorite.  I love it for something quick, but warm and filling to eat.  I make mine extra creamy by adding milk instead of water.  It's great to eat before I go to the gym, because it fills me up but not too much that I feel sick while working out.  I would definitely recommend this for oatmeal lovers!

review/text: I got a sample of this item at a food industry show and really enjoyed it. It is delicious and nutritious, a great way to start a cold morning. It is a nice touch that the pouch can be used for measuring the water.
