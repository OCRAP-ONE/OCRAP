review/text: I do enjoy eating this mostly healthy cereal, especially when compared to most of the other cereals out there, but WHY did they have to add<br />artificial coloring, YUCK!!!  THAT is NOT healthy....If they'd remove this, I'd be interested in purchasing more and telling others about this yummy,<br />mostly healthy cereal to help start their day smart...  :)

review/summary: Smart Start Cereal
review/text: Love the taste, stays crunchy with milk added for awhile. I like it like that. Me and my daughter eat it every other day. With any cereal everyday is too much. Variety, variety...<br />Has little clusters of I guess would be oats.<br />Tastes sweet so I think the "healthy" wise people may put this in the category of not so healthy. But it does taste good.

review/summary: Doesn't last long for agressive chewers
review/text: I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.

review/text: Our Siberian Husky is overweight and on a diet.  She also is great at building placque and tartar on her teeth - baad breath! She has a touchy stomach on top of it all.  Tried these bones in all flavors and she loves them.  They help with her teeth and breath.  She gets one bone for her lunch (she's a 3 meals a day gal).  Her other meals are now canned green beans with either yogurt (plain) or low fat cottage cheese.  She has lost about 11 lbs and is doing great!  No more throwing up her food!

review/summary: Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!
review/text: Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of "Brian Amazon" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing).

review/summary: More of a treat then something to keep your dog busy.
review/text: Let me start by saying our dogs love these. As soon as they see the bag they stop whatever they're doing and run to their crates (where we typically give these to them). However, for our dogs these are definitely more of a treat then an activity. I have one dog who is an aggressive chewer who finishes these in under five minutes. He doesn't chew them as much as bite of chunks of it. My other dog isn't quite as strong of a chewer but it usually takes her just around fifteen minutes to eat the whole thing (this review is specific to the Biggest Boodas). So for my dogs this is less of a chewing experience and more of a treat. And when the eat them this quickly, they do get expensive quick.

review/text: My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon. I like that they are safer than rawhide bones and easy to digest and she really seems to enjoy them more than other bones I've bought for her. I tried a few other brands when I stopped being able to find the booda bones at pet stores and she would not even eat some of them. You can't go wrong with these, they are reasonibly priced, safe, help reduce tartar, and dogs seem to love them.

review/text: That is how I want to start off this review:  I'm not vegan.  I thought I'd give these a go because of the reviews, but I typically don't really care about whether food is vegan or vegetarian or not.  I've tried a fair few different types of chocolate covered espresso beans.<br /><br />This isn't the best or worst that I've ever had.  The aftertaste is kind of a powdery flavor.  I didn't much care for that.  I suspect it has something to do with it being a dark chocolate covering (instead of milk chocolate).  The espresso beans are pretty excellent.  Really good quality, not super grainy.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend these.  While I didn't *love* the aftertaste (it wasn't disgusting or anything), I do appreciate that these are "supergood" for the consumer, the farmers, and the earth.  For a vegan product, it's pretty darn good -- better than I was expecting.  Pretty tasty.

review/text: This is only the 2nd time I've ever tried chocolate covered espresso beans.  The first was some non organic unhealthy brand an acquaintance purchased at a store.  Obviously they didn't much impress me, because I never went out and bought any.  To be totally honest, I'm not even a coffee/caffeine lover!  And if I buy chocolate, I make sure it's really dark (in the high 60% to 80% range)- for its antioxidant properties!<br /><br />  Anyhow, being that these are certified organic, and fairly traded, I thought I'd buy a bag (Vitacost).  It arrived today; and all I can say is, it was love at first bite!!  Both the chocolate and espresso beans are the right acidity- not too bitter.  ..And just the right amount of sweetness!  It's hard, but I'm keeping myself in check, so that I can savor them for at least another day (and not be up all night from a caffeine overload) =oD<br /><br />  Hopefully these will come back in stock (at a reasonable price)- and SOON!!

It's actually kind of nice to have a bunch of little packs, but the ziplock is hard to open (grab below the ziplock and pull apart like you'r opening a bag of chips).

review/summary: GREAT but hard to open!
review/text: As a vegan, it is hard to find quality chocolate... let alone tasty chocolate covered espresso beans!  These were SO good and I will DEFINITELY purchase these again someday.  (Not too often though, because they are not exactly healthy for you!)  The only issue I had with these is that the bags they come in are just so darned difficult to open!  If you decide to purchase these (which you should!), make sure you're not waiting until a huge craving hits to open these... because you will go crazy.  But seriously, this product is vegan, organic and awesome.  It is nice to see companies who are socially aware when making a product.

review/summary: A family favorite
review/text: When I start it is hard to stop. This candy is one that my children bought for their father every year.<br />We would go and buy a box for few bucks and he would pretend to be surprised every time they gave him a box.  He is gone now but we still buy a box and put it under the tree.<br />These are a nice cherry flavor and the chocolate, could be a bit smoother but it is fine just the way it is.

review/summary: YUMMY !
review/text: Scott's Cakes is one of the best brands of fudge I bought all during the past holiday season.  You can't eat any better than this brand.  It's sometimes difficult to find a white chocolate/maple no nut based fudge and I found it.  It's easy to eat the whole container which is nicely wrapped and the truffles are really large approximately 1 and a 1/2 inch yummy fudge.  This is perfect for gift giving with the Scott's paper box it arrived in.  Fudge was fresh and delicious.  ( I know not the nutritional label as it did not arrive with one or I would have posted that information )  The fudge is quite expensive for just 12 pieces but then again these are really large truffles.  5 stars.  I will buy again the next holiday occasion.

review/summary: Organic Onion Powder
review/text: With more and more news coming out about our foods and spices being adulterated with chemicals and pesticides, the wife and I have been doing a lot more shopping for organic foods and spices. Amazon.com is one of my favorite places to shop for just about anything and when I started looking for organic spices, Amazon.com did not disappoint.<br /><br />The Simply Organic brand has several items available on Amazon.com and so I bought some of the onion powder and also some of the garlic powder. Because it comes in a 3-pack, I shared a bottle with each of our kids after they arrived.<br /><br />The bottles are big enough to last a while and the price is right. The quality appears to be superb and you can't go wrong with any organic food item. If you are an Amazon Prime member, you get free shipping on top of it. I will buy this brand again when I run out.

review/text: I use herbs and spices liberally on all my food.  Simply Onion offers the right-sized jar (2 ounces) for people who use onion powder as often as I do.  In addition, the bargain price comes in when they package 3 jars at a time.  I know larger sizes of spices are available, but if they aren't used frequently, they do go stale.  The taste of Simply Organic Onion is great and three 2-oz. jars help keep it that way. Can't beat it for the price.

Yet one among the shelve stands out. I picked up World Harbors Sticky Rum BBQ and was delighted to find out just how amazing it tastes. Its all natural as well with no gluten, just wheat and soy. They also have many other flavors as well ranging from Apple BBQ to Mango and regular BBQ. Sticky Rum however is just amazing..and it goes with everything from chicken, beef, mash potatoes, french fries you name it. Simply the best. It's mouthwatering, smoky and sweet and I hope they continue to make it.

review/summary: 4 year old boy says, "I really love it!"
review/text: Background: My sons (ages 2 and 4) are picky eaters. Very. So in order to get them to eat their veggies, I serve these cold and call them smoothies.<br /><br />My 4 year old says of this flavor, "It's my favorite. I really love it. It's really yummy."<br /><br />Some of the reviewers has mentioned not liking that the spout is on the corner instead of the top. I asked my son if he minds and he said, "It's very cool"<br /><br />Also, some complaints were made about them breaking open in transit.  The packages I got were sent from the company to family in Texas and then forwarded on to my APO address (literally across the world) and all of them arrived intact.  I'm thinking the packaging problem is with Amazon.<br /><br />I love that they're organic and my sons think they're delicious!<br /><br />I only wish Amazon offered them at a better price. And shipped them to APO.

review/summary: Hard for toddler to use; taste isn't great
review/text: I only bought one package of these, since they were on sale for very cheap.  We go through 2 fruit and veggie pouches every day, so I'm always on the lookout for a deal.<br /><br />A few of the pouches actually leaked all over the inside of the box, so there was a huge sticky mess and several had to be thrown away.<br /><br />As for the non-leaky ones, we had two problems:<br /><br />(1) The placement of the spout.  All the other pouches have a spout at the top, and that's what my toddler is used to.  He had a hard time eating out of this one, with the spout on the corner.  I'm not sure why they did that, but it's not working for toddler self-feeding.<br /><br />(2) The taste.  My 21-month-old son LOVES fruit and veggie pouches.  He will eat pretty much anything in pouch form, from broccoli to spinach to green beans.  These, however, he did not like.  He would only eat about half of it before he would give it back to me, refusing to eat more.  That tells me that either the packaging or the ingredients are inferior.<br /><br />Bottom line: we will not be purchasing these again.

review/text: Original review: This is a good quality product and a great value, but the bag I got was a little stale. When I open the packages of other brands, I get a noseful of fresh peppermint aroma and that is missing here. Davidson needs to use  more sophisticated packaging to keep it fresh. How about something similar to the bags coffee comes in, instead of a paper bag with a folded over top?<br /><br />Update April 2011: Davidson's has upgraded their packaging to a zip-top bag with a foil barrier, and the difference is amazing: intense peppermint aroma and rich flavor. Excellent.

I'd poured a week's worth of use, and close the rest of package tightly, but smell/taste is gone by now completely. I don't know why is it - I have used herbs for a long time, never had this experience. It is dissappointing - it was too good to be true thing.

review/summary: Weak smell, weak grassy taste
review/text: The price on this is pretty good, but it seems the adage of "you get what you pay for" is also true. There is only the most mild smell of peppermint when you open the bag, and crushing some between your fingers doesn't release any additional scent. I've tried several brewing methods, and the peppermint taste is weak even with steeping it a long time. The only way to get a cup that approaches a decent flavor is to use a lot (couple of tablespoons) for a brew. Still, even with using a lot per cup, the taste is more grassy than minty.<br /><br />I really enjoy peppermint tea, and often add it to black teas to temper their strong flavor. While the price on this bag was great, I won't be buying it again - way too weak. There are several other brands out there that cost a bit more, but are a far better value.

review/summary: Ten months since purchase-STILL GOING STRONG!
review/text: The packaging for this tea is now GREAT!! BUT, since there had been complaints of it loosing its flavor, I have stored them in glass jars in the very back of my kitchen cabinet. As soon as they are opened the rich aroma is abundant. We have been drinking this tea by the gallon for the last several months. It has helped my family with head congestion which is just another positive as we drink it because of the flavor. This is a GREAT price and a great tea--would recommend to anyone. You can perhaps now keep it in the foil lined bag--but I just wanted to be on the safe side. Glass does not absorb odor--thus I felt it put in a dark place would do the trick-and it did. I WILL be buying this again until I can get a VERY large plant to grow--which may never occur! :)

The stay fresh bag really works.  It's about 90% as strong as when I first got it.  Decent tea!  I add a bit to cheap bitter coffee to spin up the flavor a bit.  Friends "love" my "coffee."  He he he!  And Yes, I also do the same with my spearmint teas.  :)

review/summary: Not happy - not peppermint
review/text: Buyer beware.  I drink a lot of peppermint tea and I was looking forward to trying this product.  Unfortunately, while the bag is labeled Peppermint Tea, the product inside is very definitely Spearmint.  The smell and taste are extremely different though evidently the people packaging it can't tell.  It's also not returnable. I will not be purchasing anything further from Davidson's tea.

review/summary: A BIG Hit
review/text: Our 3 dogs love Dingo bones.  But these peanut butter flavor bones are an obsession of our smallest rat terrier.  He's only 5 pounds, so bones tend to last several sittings for him.  Give him one of these and he's occupied for as long as it takes to finish.  He'll still play with other bones, but he loses his mind when he sees me go for this bag.  I just wish they were priced as well as the other Dingo products and less difficult to find.

review/summary: Dog loved it but left a mess
review/text: My doberman went nuts over this bone.  He tried to devour it rather quickly.  My only complaint about this bone is that it left a mess on the floor; the red color of the bone rubs onto the floor.  It did wipe up fairly easily.  Just make sure when you give the bone to your dog he's not eating it on a carpeted floor.

review/summary: Dogs love this bone!
review/text: I have two 70 lb. dogs. One chews on anything but the other chews on almost nothing. Both will immediately attack this bone and have a ball chewing on it. The one dog usually ignores regular rawhide but I didn't have to wait and see with this, he took to it right away. The price fluctuates wildly with these kinds of bones, so watch for a sale. I paid about 3 bucks.

review/summary: WARNING: Open package received with signs of used product
review/text: Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red "meat" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Too big for my dog
review/text: I have a labrador retriever. He weighs 82 lbs. He loved the bone, but I made the mistake and allowed him to eat the bone in one sitting. It was too much of a shock to his digestive system.  The next morning he developed diarrhea. I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again.  To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.  I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting .

review/summary: Can't make them this good at home!!
review/text: I'm very particular about what I feed my dogs. I often make my own "canned/wet" food and treats at home to ensure the quality and safety of the food I'm feeding my dogs. After looking at the ingredients in these biscuits and checking out the price when purchased in the 12 pound box, I realized I could not make biscuits of this quality at home for this price. My dogs really love these biscuits, and I feel good about the quality of this product. I also love that I can divide these biscuits into various sizes, as I have dogs that range from 6 lbs to 130 lbs. Even with 5 dogs this 12 lb box lasts a long time, and it is packaged in 3 heavy zipper bags, so you don't open all 12 lbs at once and they stay fresh. I would recommend these to anyone who cares about what they feed their dogs.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE These Biscuits
review/text: I have known for a long time that Canidae is a great product, and is not usually sold in stores, so when I saw these biscuits on the Amazon website, I immediately ordered them.  I have two Eskies (miniature American Eskimo Dogs) so I had to have enough for both of them.  This is a big package, so it was definitely enough.  Canidae is so highly rated for both dry and "wet" food that I didn't have to worry about these biscuits containing anything that might not be good for my Girls.<br /><br />It has "Balanced Omega 6 & 3 Fatty Acids" and they are advertised to help control tartar and plaque.  Can't speak to that yet (neither has had a dental for a year) but I do know they love them.  It's a single biscuit that can be snapped into 4 separate pieces.  My Girls, both under 26 pounds, receive 2 half-pieces in the mid-afternoon (that's 1 biscuit broken into 2 pieces) and although one of them trots off with her half-piece as soon as she gets it, the other stands right where she is and crunches down the first half-piece and looks for the next one (just about demands it!).<br /><br />As the package ran low I knew I had to have more for them, and so re-ordered from Amazon.  Another package duly arrived, before the first one ran out, for which I was thankful.  And so were The Girls!

review/text: The Canidae Dog Treats, Lamb and Rice flavor, is the best treats for my dogs.  I have been feeding these treats to my dogs for years, and they are still the best.  They are snap biscuits so I can regulate how much I give them at a time, and guard against weight gain.  I use the Lamb and Rice because one of my dogs has an allegery to chicken and wheat.  I have never had a problem with Canidae Dog Treats, as they are healthy and safe to feed my dogs. I have been feeding the Canidae Dog Treats for well over 20 years and I plan on continuing to do so as long as I can still get the 12 pound box, as I have Big Boys to feed.

review/text: The Canidae dog treats has been well received by my 1 year old Presa Canarios.  The "snap" configuration of the treat works great since you can break off as much or as little as you want.  I liked the nutritional content of the treats.  So many times the dogs may love the treats but they are not the healthiest for them.  These treats are good for them and they love them.....  I have switched my dogs to the Canidae dog food as well.....

I feed them the same formula Canidae kibble and canned food, so these treats fit in well with their diet - no worry about upset tummies.  They smell kind of nice too, almost like cinnamon.  There is usually a good amount of crumbs at the bottom of the bag which I just sprinkle in their food bowls at dinner time.  I'll continue to buy these for my dogs for as long as they make them.

review/text: I have fed Canidae All Life Stages food for several years to my mixed dog collection, with great results, but for some reason, had not offered the Snap Biscuits.  Finally, I purchased a bag and offered them up.  Well, they must taste treat-like because they gobble them up, and have evidenced no digestive upsets.  Safe and tasty is the verdict.  My test group is aged two years through 10 years, size eight to twenty-five pounds, in generally good health.

review/summary: Great Value, A Little Broken Up
review/text: I was looking for a bulk price bargain on my preferred premium dog biscuit for my two Vizslas & this definitely met that criteria. Canidae's Snap Biscuits always have some bits and pieces in the bottom of the bag, which is understandable since the biscuit is a snap variety. I was afraid the larger quantity might mean more waste & I was right. There were three (3) plastic 4# bags in a large single cardboard box to comprise the 12#, so they must shuffle a bit & in the end the amount of tiny bits & powdery crumbs in the bottom of each bag was a significant amount of waste. Though I'm sure I could use the wasted crumbs in their food bowl, I am very careful to watch their food intake at meal time.<br /><br />I love the nutrition & quality of Canidae's Lamb & Brown Rice Snap Biscuits, but I will likely stick with the single 4# units in the future, which are packed in individual bags.

I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that I thought would love them, however he rates it a 2 star. I was hoping he would be a little more excited about them. They are a larger treat so I break them up into smaller pieces. They also have good things in them.  Most of the time he will eat the treat. Others times he will take it and then drop it in the living room and come back to it later. I will not be getting them again.

review/text: These are one my favorite kind of Sun Chips. They have a zesty taste that is not too sharp or bland, with just the right "kick",  and a nice crisp texture. While these are not a health food, their sodium and fat content is much better than other snack foods. These chips work really well with a dip and vegetables for a pre-dinner snack.<br /><br />Shop for price. The price printed on the 10.5 oz bag that I buy at my local supermarket is $3.79 (and I pay less on sale), so the price on Amazon is higher than the manufacturer's suggested retail price.
