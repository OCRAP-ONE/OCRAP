review/text: If you have a smart or highly persistent dog that will chew bits off almost any toy except a Kong, skip this.  I would have, but it was a gift.<br />The first time I left this toy in the crate with my smart, 6 month old blue heeler mix puppy, I came home to find she had somehow managed to unscrew it and eaten all the treats. The second time she played with it all over the house, and the noise drove me crazy. Bang, boom, bang. She kept rolling it down the stairs, off a ledge, and knocking things over when it rolled behind them. But she was thoroughly entertained, so I let it be. The third time she played with it while I was cooking. A few minutes later, I looked down to see she had unscrewed it again, and was chewing on the various pieces happily. I didn't stop her since the brochure said it was virtually indestructible material. When I picked it up a bit later, her chewing had apparently ruined the threading so I could no longer screw the lid back on. Went right into the trash.<br /><br />Entertaining, but not durable at all.

review/summary: Not for every dog
review/text: I have 2 Corgis, and also foster for Corgi Rescue. So far none of the four dogs I have had since buying this toy (my 2 plus 2 rescues) have played with it for more than a few minutes. They are all otherwise high energy, playful, food driven dogs.<br /><br />They LOVE Tricky Treat, Buster Cube and MolecuBall so I thought this would be a nice change. Big expensive yawn. I gave it two stars only because it appears well made. I bought it almost a year ago, and kept it around in case one of the foster Corgis might like it, but so far nothing. It is currently in the donate to the animal shelter box.

review/summary: Not as pictured...
review/text: The picture shown does not match the item I received. I specifically ordered this product because it showed the jug to have a plastic rope and not an actual rope (my dog loves to tear apart ropes,  and I'd had a tug-a-jug that had the plastic rope previously and that was a great product. I'm not sure if they're making it with the plastic rope anymore, but I assumed that since that was what was shown, that's what I'd receive.) I'm not really happy with this bait and switch because I have to closely monitor my dog with this toy to make sure she doesn't shred the rope and render it useless.

review/summary: They shoud re-name this the "Tug-A-Huh?"
review/text: I have two dogs: one is not very good at figuring out puzzle toys, even with scaffolding and attempts at teaching him, the other is like a dog genius. That, coupled with her highly food driven motivation, usually leads to her mastering these types of treat toys instantly. This is the only item I've ever purchased that she can't manipulate well. Unlike some of these other types of dog toys, I also find that it has to be fairly full to work well. She's a relatively small dog and even if I put all of her kibble in the smallest jar, it's even tough for me to get it all out with the little pull rope because it sinks to the bottom of bottle and has to go up the bottle neck to exit. Also, because I have two dogs, sometimes the other dog wants to come in and play, too. This works nicely with the ball dispensers, but for this jar, if they both pull on the rope, the motion required to actually get the treats or kibble out immediately becomes impossible. Regardless of the number of dogs in your household, this is one toy I'd pass on.<br /><br />Update: My medium chewer has now completely chewed apart the rubber pull rope with this. If I could change my original 1 star rating to a zero, I would.

review/text: We ordered the medium/large tug jug.  It smelled like plastic so strongly my dog would not go near it no matter what food we put in it.  I tried it with a friends dog four times and the dog could not connect that kibble came out when he let go.  All he wanted to do was tug.  The rope was so stiff he couldn't really get a grip on it and the rope also smelled of chemicals.  Between the BPA in the bottle and cap and the inflexible rope, we found it was unusable and sent it back.

review/summary: Not worth it...you'll need to spend more money
review/text: So the version of the toy I got had a rope and not the rubber 'rope'.  It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions.  I had seen the toys in the store and had only seen the rubber ropes so figured that was the current version...I figured wrong...and within 10 minutes my dog had untied and completely frayed the rope, thus ending the whole point of the toy.  They have a 'helpful hint' of what to do when the dog has destroyed the rope of putting different sized balls in the toy to get a 'similar' effect...that's great, but it's not the toy I bought.  AND now, I have to go out and buy the balls to put in it so I don't completely waste my money on what became a useless toy in 10 minutes.  It's a good idea but I wouldn't recommend this toy...they need to work out some kinks first and/or up the quality of this product.

review/text: I was so excited when I bought this toy, imagining the hours my dog would spend entertaining herself with this toy. Unfortunately my mutt took two seconds to size it up and decide that the best way to get the treats out was to chew the rope off, which she did promptly. She was right, and I could hardly be upset with her, but I was disappointed that such an expensive toy was so easily destroyed.

review/text: My dog destroyed the rubber "cord" in 5 minutes (worse yet, swallowed it), got very nervous trying to get the treats out and almost attacked my other dog for trying to get it from her (which she never before did). I had to take her toy away and wish i could get my money back. $10 is not a cheap tog toy, so it could be at least durable. I bought it because i thought it'd be a good distraction to keep her entertained and less anxious when i leave, but now i'm afraid it'd be inducing aggression and causing harm if ingested. And that would cost much more... Better stick to Kong toys, the only ones so far my chewing dog cannot destroy it!

review/summary: Great toy for an energetic dog
review/text: I was looking for a durable toy that would hold the interest of my 5 month old Border Aussie puppy and the Tug-a-Jug has been a great find. He was a little hesitant of it at first but once he figured out that the toy dispensed food, he is having a great time figuring out different ways of getting his kibble to come out. It is also a very durable toy, which is what I was looking for. He is an aggressive chewer and has chewed through a lot of his other toys - even though he has tried to chew on the jug, he has not been able to inflict any damage to it so far (we've had it for about 3 weeks now). The Tug-a-Jug is made of very durable plastic. The bottom opens so you can fill the jug with kibble or treats and I was happy to find that it has extra threading so it screws on very firmly and stays on even with my dogs wild play with the jug.

review/summary: Love it for most dogs
review/text: I've used this product, and others from Premier, for years.  For most dogs it's GREAT (I've fostered dogs and have my own).  I have both the small and medium sizes, which actually both work well for my 50 pound dog but I change them based on the size of kibble I feed.<br /><br />I like that they changed from the plastic-type "rope" which could easily be chewed and swallowed, but I don't like the new cotton rope - it's simply too difficult to clean and doesn't dry quickly enough.  I cut it off, purchased a piece of non-toxic acrylic rope, and have been satisfied (just have to tie the ends and burn them so they don't unravel).<br /><br />Kind of a pain to have to get a different rope and wish they would change it, but the replacement only cost me 50 cents.  The jug itself is more durable in the medium size than small, but I use it in a crate that has thick soft bedding now and has lasted almost a year so far.  When my dogs used it on hard floors the bottom of it cracked, although that was after 5 months.<br /><br />There were a couple very powerful chewers that managed to break the tops of these easily (I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a> or the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLWJ1G">Premier Busy Buddy Linkables Dog Toys Value Pack</a> for them).  However in general they've worked out great and my dogs love them.  You can try making it more challenging by adding a rubber ball inside or pieces of carrots.

review/summary: Excellent for the right dogs and play areas
review/text: As far as treat dispensing toys go, this is by far the best design. My 2 boxers love to bat things with their hands, and this thing takes quite some time for them to empty of kibble. The down side is this is my second one, I had the smaller version before and they managed to crack the bottom so that the toy was useless. The last one didn't last long, but I let them use it on concrete so I know that was a big factor. I think this new one will last quite a while as long as I allow them to play only on carpet. My boys use their hands exclusively to play with this thing; if your dogs tend to use their mouths and throw things up into the air I doubt this toy will last.<br /><br />I would love to see a version of this made out of aluminum. The dogs smell the treats, so it's not really necessary for the toy to be transparent. I would gladly pay the extra cost to have one of these made of aluminum, or carbon fiber, or something that I know they could use for a while and not worry about breaking.

review/summary: "Grandson" love it!!
review/text: Purchased for my four year old Dobie "grandson". He's a full blown case of a four legged kid who has a terminal case of the "terrible twos".<br /><br />Daughter said  it didn't take him long to figure out how to make the treats spill out. She loads it with dehydrated banana and papaya chips and it keeps him occupied for a good 45 minutes with each fill.<br /><br />He's figured out the bottom comes off and tries to find ways to take the bottom off, hasn't managed to do so .....uuummm.......yet ;).<br /><br />She also has five cats who are fascinated by the toy and when the Dobe let's them near it they bat it around and pounce on the rope. She's put some dry kitty food in it a couple times and the cats "team work" to get the food to spill out.<br />Dober-baby is only allowed to us the toy on carpeted floors because he tends to swing and bang it on the floor, the cats are put in a room with tile and they shuttle it around until it is empty.<br /><br />I would purchase again and expect I may have to...and soon...... if they cats decide the dog doesn't share fair.

review/summary: Dog ate the rope, but this thing has endless possibilities!
review/text: This toy is great! It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible. Less than 24hours after teaching her how this thing works, she figured out that the rope was keeping the food inside, so she promptly took it to her bed and ate the rope. We were initially disappointed - it was a sturdy cotton rope! Watching her just inhale the food out of it (literally, she would tip it neck-down into her mouth and just pour the food out of it with no rope to stop the food), we decided to put some objects inside the bottle to make it more challenging, since the rope idea seemed to be a little too easy for her. We started with two golf balls, then moved up to two racquette balls, then a tennis ball. The tennis ball is almost impossible for her to get the food because it's so large the food won't move around it, so we went back to the racquette balls. So far, so good. She beats the thing against the floor, throws it into walls, and gnaws on it like it's covered in frozen peanut butter, and it holds up like a dream. She's gone from inhaling her food in under 30 seconds to taking almost 2 full minutes to eat a meal.<br /><br />Other reviews have mentioned flimsy plastic, but we've found our's is great and made of sturdy, thick plastic. So far she's only scratched it a little on the outside. Others have complained of the same rope issues we had - the dog unravels or chews it off. Adding objects inside the toy that help block the food is a very simple, extremely cost-effective way of altering the toy to make it easier or more difficult. We change it up sometimes from the racquette balls to small wood blocks, a variety of smaller objects (plastic Gatorade caps, golf balls, etc) - anything that is too big to come out the neck but large enough to block the food without being impossible. We've started putting it in places she has to work to get to before she can eat from it - on a chair, in an open box, hidden under a pillow on the floor, etc. Not a whole lot of effort on our part, but it pays off in spades when she's mentally tired for an hour or so after dinner!

review/text: The package says that this is supposed to be practically break-proof, which I thought was perfect for my year-old Beauceron who is a pretty aggressive chewer.  Finally!  A toy that would make his brain work and keep him occupied.<br /><br />Three uses.  First one he very quickly discovered how to get the treats right out.  Second, he learned how to get the screw-off bottom to come off of the jug.  Third time - he chewed the plastic to bits by the time I got it away from him - and he was in the same room with me!<br /><br />I'm a dog trainer and only recommend high-endurance products for my clients.  This didn't even come *close* to meeting my expectations!  Total disappointment.  Will not buy another 'Premier' Busy Buddy toy for my chewer!<br /><br />At almost 3 years old, we still rely on the blue K9 Kongs, Holey Moley, and Everlast Treat balls to stand up to his strong jaws and chew drive!

He has been working on this Tug-A-Jug (filled with kibble) for the last 2 1/2 hours.  Amazing.  We plan to give him at least one of his three daily meals in this to keep him occupied.  He is 4 months, and in that teething stage, so this toy is a real life saver. We'll get him another one when he chews his way through the rope on this one. This was money well spent.

She is the type of dog to scarf down her food in a second flat if it's in a bowl, so I give her breakfast and dinner in this thing and it can take upwards of 2 hours for her to get it all out. I notice that she doesn't act as hungry or bored during the rest of the day which is great! I also have a kong toy that I would fill with treats but that was way too easy for her. The bottle is made out of hard plastic and so far she has hardly made a dent in it. Beyond a collar and leash this is by far one of the best investments I have ever made for my pup. I would recommend this for my friends!<br /><br />Emily

review/summary: Broke On the 4th Day of Use :(
review/text: Last night, I visited a friend who had bought this toy for my yellow Labrador.  My dog is a very fast eater when I feed her from her bowl, so I was delighted to try this.  I've used Buster Cubes in the past, and still really like them, but my Labrador has figured out how to remove the center piece that controls the difficulty so food spills out easily.  Buster Cubes aren't much of a challenge for her anymore.<br /><br />When I put my dog's dinner into the Tug-A-Jug last night, for the first time, she looked at me as if I had played a cruel joke on her.  She saw the food in the toy, looked at me, cocked her head, and went to her food bowl.  I encouraged her to play with the toy, and she quickly figured out that she could get pieces of kibble by rolling the toy around, picking it up and dropping it, etc.  Right now, she is eating her breakfast, tail wagging, as she manipulates the Tug-A-Jug to get the kibble out.  It's only her second meal from the Tug-A-Jug, so we'll see how long this treat-dispensing toy lasts.  :)<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Today is the 4th day of use for this toy.  I have been feeding my dog 2x/day by placing her kibble inside.  This morning, my 13-year-old Labrador figured out how to remove the end cap and eat the kibble without working it out of the narrow end.  Tonight, she bit harder than usual and the end cap snapped, just above the threads.  It's not a treat-dispensing toy anymore.  I'm glad I didn't buy this car for myself, but I'm sorry my friend's gift was so short-lived.

review/summary: Dangerous and not durable
review/text: This is the second "Tug-a-Jug" food puzzle I've purchased for my wire fox terrier. The first lasted about five months until she chewed through the rope. But this toy kept my dog more occupied than any other food puzzle I've tried, so I decided to purchase a second one. My plan was to put this one away as soon as my dog was done with her food so she wouldn't "play" with it and chew through the rope. So in other words, I blame my dog's destructive terrier prowess on the demise of the first toy rather than the manufacturer.<br /><br />But after just one week of use for the second toy, the bottom part where the end seals onto the main container literally cracked and shattered into many pieces when I was sealing the toy.<br /><br />My dog may chew through ropes but she's not that rough with toys, and I was using normal strength to twist the end piece on, so I'm pretty sure this one was a dud. But after that, I'm totally done with this company. The shards that came off in my hand were tiny and sharp enough that if just one shard had broken off without my notice and go mixed in with my dog's food, she probably would have ingested it and had internal bleeding.

review/summary: Worth a try!
review/text: 3 dogs, 1 loves it and uses it as intended.  The only complaint there is that he's become far too good at it and learned how to push the rope in and out very quickly.  He 48 lbs, gets his regular meals in it and finishes in about 15 minutes.  I wish it took him longer but it sure is awesome watching him be so good at it!  Worked great for the second dog for a few weeks, he wasn't as good at it, so it took him a bit longer to empty it so we thought it might be perfect for him.  We were wrong, he chewed the rope in half one day.  :-(  Third dog is just kind of dumb and just smells it and looks at it.  The plastic is really rugged though, they're able to toss it around on stained concrete floors without breaking it!<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this company's toys.  One of my dogs chewed a Kong but hasn't been able to destroy Premier's Squirrel toy.  Dumb dog likes the Twist 'n' Treat, it doesn't take very much brain power...

review/summary: Awesome product for many dogs!
review/text: This is our 3rd jug. My dog Loooooves it and eats his dinner out of it every night. Our first two had a rubber rope in them and the first rubber rope was destroyed by a foster puppy who ate everything in sight. The second rubber rope started to dissolve after prolonged coating with kibble crumbs and drool so I figured it was time to buy a third one (that one had been used for almost 1 year at 2 meals a day so it held up to ~700 uses, not bad!). So when this one arrived I was soooo disappointed that it has a cotton braided rope. Some reviewers prefer this because their dog has destroyed the rubber rope but seems to me that any dog who could chew apart the robber rope could destroy the cotton one too no? Here is my problem with the cotton version. It works at first because it is kind of stiff. I have a very drooly dog who has softened the rope making it harder to get kibble out and in time the braiding has loosened a bit making it fatter so the other day he could not get anything out and gave up. I was not home but know he must have tried for a LOOONNGGG time before giving up. This is his jug he has successfully used for well over a year so I am sure he was confused why it was not working! My other major beef is that I used to take the rubber rope out to was it by hand or in the dishwasher. The new rope is knotted on both ends and can not be removed (no I can't un-knot it) without cutting the rope which I am going to have to do. I am soooo bummed as this was my way of slowing my dog down at meal time. I am now looking for something to substitute for the rope and wish the had left well enough alone!<br />UPDATE!!! I contacted premier customer service who confirmed (as I suspected) that most people prefer the cotton rope. They however offered to send me a replacement rubber rope that they had left over and they sent it promptly at no charge! They are an awesome company and would recommend trying this- since most prefer the cotton rope you may like it as much as I do with the rubber rope!

review/text: Our one year old westie can chew up almost anything.  I've spent lots of money on toys that were made for aggressive chewers, and were destroyed 20 minutes later.  This treat dispenser is great.  We've had it several months and it's still in excellent condition.  I read reviews before purchasing, and bought the larger size because it had a rope instead of a plastic piece.  I definitely recommend the rope.  I was afraid the larger size would be too big, but Max loves it.  He weighs 15 lbs.

review/summary: Good Toy...
review/text: We have a JRT Mix and he is too smart for his own good.  The first time we used this 'puzzle' toy it took him about 45 mins to get to the end.  By the third time he had figured the most efficient way to get food to fall out and he now employs that same technique to finish off a scoop of kibble in about 10 mins.  He really enjoys focusing on this task for the 10 mins, as the JRT is an obsessive breed anyhow.  It gives him a good job to work on.  I recommend this simple toy as we have seen good results and it performs exactly as advertised.  Durability is good, our guy is tough on toys, but if you give it to him with food in it and then remove it from him when complete, there are no issues.

review/summary: Excellent Busy-Buddy Tool
review/text: This is one of the greatest inventions for Dogs that either eat too fast or need to be preoccupied with something to do. We have been using the jug about 8 months and have stopped feeding our dog with the dog dish and now only use the Jug. It takes him several minutes to get his food out, keeps him entertained and he actually chews his kibble instead of inhaling everything in 10 seconds like he would do out of the dish. The jug can also be filled with treats and is a great tool for dogs with attachment issues. For example, our dog used to go nuts and tear up the house when we left, but now we fill the jug with kibble before we leave to keep him busy. It keeps his mind occupied long enough to forget about us leaving and as a result he no longer becomes destructive when we are away. If you have a dog that is too smart for his/her own good and needs a good toy to keep 'em busy then I would recommend the Jug hands down. I have gone through more dog toys in the last 18-months than I care to admit and this has been the most effective, long-lasting items that is actually worth more than what you will pay. Your dog will thank you too!

review/summary: This has Haven-and-Coda Australian Shepherd Approval
review/text: I've been looking for this toy forever.  Last I heard, it was only available online and it was rather expensive -- good to see that the price has come down.  The local PetSmart finally picked it up in their merchandise, so I had to grab one.<br /><br />The dogs can't get enough of it!  They're Australian Shepherds, so they combine high intelligence, high drive and EXTREMELY high energy, and it's hard to find a toy that will stand up to that.  They get bored so quickly once they figure something out, and then their new goal becomes "how can we destroy this previously-entertaining item?"  This toy is one of the few that has actually worked well for them.  It took them around an hour to figure it out, but they've been merrily tugging away ever since.  It seems really durable, and it's certainly keeping their attention.  (Maybe they'll stop unscrewing the plug to the bathtub drain now...)<br /><br />If you crate-train your dogs, and they have to stay in their kennel when you're away, I HIGHLY recommend this item.  Haven is our little deaf girl, and she has some anxiety problems because of it.  Any time my boyfriend and I leave the house, she freaks out.  This toy keeps her occupied when she's in her kennel, and rewards her for being in there.<br /><br />The only problem I've had with it so far is that the dogs both want to play with it solo -- may have to get a second so they'll both get a turn.

But anyways, this toy keeps him entertained for a long time here are my pro's & cons for it:<br /><br /> Pro:<br />-not expensive<br />-has several different areas to hold his interest (the bottle, the rubber spike ball & the rope)<br />-durable<br /> Cons:<br />-If your dog shakes toys around then that hard heavy plastic bottle can do some damage to you or your walls<br />-your dog may do what mine does & bring me the toy to set it up for him to get treats, defeats the purpose of him figuring it out<br />-my dog didnt love the treats that are made for the toy, so I just bought small size dog treats & cut them in half, works great!<br /><br />The pro's definitely outweigh the cons & I highly recommend this to other dog owners, especially ones that are strong & destroy other toys

review/text: My bloodhound mix loves, loves, loves this toy. She walks around carrying it from the rope until she can settle into her favorite corner to "go to work". The only problem is that we live in an apartment building with hardwood floors.  The hard plastic hitting the floor is definitely LOUD and our dog likes to throw it up the air for added effect, which creates an even louder THUD.  I would definitely recommend this toy but if you have neighbors downstairs, they might hate you.

review/summary: Fantastic way to feed your dog
review/text: I got this when a trainer recommended that I find ways to make life more entertaining for my dog. Apparently dogs find working for their dinner to be entertaining. It actually is really great. I just unscrew the bottom, pour the kibble in, and then my dog spends the next 20-30 minutes getting it out. And he does seem entertained - I think eating his food slower makes him feel fuller too. I mix this up with a couple of other kibble dispensers so he doesn't get too used to just one way - then it would be boring again. One warning - the med/large is really good. My friend has a small and a full cup of kibble fits easily into it. Unless you are feeding your dog a lot, you probably don't need the big one.

review/summary: Could not be more pleased with the tug a jug
review/text: I have a basset hound who loves to get in trouble if he's not occupied.  He's also highly motivated by food.  These two things make the tug a jug perfect for him.  I started him by taking the rope plug out initially (this can easily by done by unscrewing the jug and pulling the plug through).  I lined the rim with peanut butter and put his meal inside.  He quickly learned that rolling it around and tipping it made it dispense food.  After a couple of days of this, I put the plug back in.  He now spends 1.5-2 hours a day trying to empty this thing.  When he's done, he collapses and sleeps.  It's a beautiful thing.  I feed him all his meals in it now and it's his favorite toy.

At first, it'd take her about 40 minutes or so to get all the food out (I put her kibble in it), but as she got the hang of it, it would only take her about 10 minutes.  I put a tennis ball inside the jar with the kibble to make it a little harder for her and now, on average, it takes her about 30 minutes.  She loves this toy and I love watching her toss around the jar and fiddling with the rope to get the kibble out.

review/summary: There's no tugging with Tug-a-jug
review/text: I have two large dogs that are super chewers; they destroy just everything so I was excited to try the tug-a-jug out because of the claim of durable construction.<br /><br />The plastic bottle itself is holding up well.<br /><br />The "rope," which is a rubber/plastic flexible piece that plugs the top of the jug is another story. The half of it that extends out of the jug that is meant for tugging was chewed off in about an hour. It did not crumble or flake though, which was a relief interms of safety. Thankfully, another reviewer had the same experience so I kept a close watch on this. The other  half  still remains in the jug and stills works fine as a plug to keep the treats inside the jug.<br /><br />The other rubber/plastic piece that surrounds the next of the jug/bottle is slowly being chewed away. Many of the flexible dental spikes were also chewed off within the first hour. After a week of use, the main piece has some tears in it. My guess is that it will break off soon.<br /><br />The dogs really like it. One of them sat for two hours trying to get her treats out, so this was a worth while purchase in terms of a toy or  activity that actually keeps my dog busy. There was no tugging though. The dogs just sat and held it in their paws occaisionally rolling it to shift the treats around to get them out.<br /><br />This toy is really not that different than the Kongs that I have, which have survived two years of chewing! The dogs could care less that they can see the treats because they are too busy trying to stick their faces into the open end. This is not a noisy toy.

review/summary: Best Food puzzle I have found Yet!
review/text: I love to challenge my dog with food cubes. The thing is great--most of them are way too easy and dispense the food too quickly. This one is perfect because it is a little bit more challenging, and there are ways to make it harder such as adding pieces into the jug to block the food from being dispensed (like a golf ball). Also, the bottom screws off so it is easy to load in the food. Many food cubes you have to load the food in little by little which is annoying when you are trying to feed your dog his entire meal in a puzzle cube~! I highly recommend this one ( i have 2 other puzzle cubes and this is by far the best).

review/summary: Tug a Jug
review/text: I thought this toy would be great for my dog.  He was in desperate need of mental stimulation and I thought if he could figure out a puzzle while he was eating his dinner that would be great.  However, within the first 20-30 minutes he had it, the rubber "tug" rope was broken in half.  I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it breaking was being bent since it was a smooth break instead of jagged.  He still uses it though, even without the rope.  Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown.  Even though he isn't using it the way it was meant to be he still likes it and gets a lot of use out of it.

review/summary: My GSD's absolute favorite toy
review/text: I recently adopted Jake, a 3 yr old German Shepherd Mix from a GSD rescue organization and was excited to introduce him to a variety of new toys.  Most he destroyed within minutes. The Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug is his favorite toy and keeps him challenged and entertained for long periods of time, while other toys get tossed aside.  He has easily figured out how to maneuver the bottle to obtain the kibble inside and it's adorable to watch how excited he becomes when he wins the prize...each and every time.<br /><br />I know that other reviewers have complained that it's difficult for the dog to get the food to come out. Perhaps the pieces are too large or the rope is not extended.  Keeping the rope fully extended for him, Jake is able to retrieve the kibble...not with complete ease...but with a little effort and determination. I would highly recommend this toy for a dog in need of a fun and durable toy that will keep him mentally stimulated.

It seemed like a good idea at first but i dont think my dog very much liked it.  There are scent holes at the bottom and she could see the treats inside so she would try to eat the plastic!

review/summary: It keeps him occupied, but annoying to hear
review/text: My dog Cooper enjoys this toy as much as he loves his Kong toys.  He still hasn't figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him occupied for a couple of hours as he tries to figure out how to get it.  Most of the time he chews on the rope.  He has a strong bite and so far the rope is still holding on strong -- this is also why I bought him the medium/large. I felt that if I got him a small he'd chew the rope right off.<br /><br />The only con is that the toy is a little big for him to carry sometimes, and I didn't realize that the plastic bottle was going to be as hard as it is so it makes loud annoying sounds when it drops on the tile and hard wood when he tries to carry it on top of the sofa or bed. So other than the loud banging noises, I'd say this is a good toy. Highly recommend if you have carpet.

review/summary: Finally something keep my Jack Russell busy
review/text: My 8 month old Jack Russell, Fritz, loves his jug. I fill it full of kibble and a few finely broken biscuits before I leave for the day for work and Fritz plays and plays for hours. I had to get a second one for him to have at my boyfriend's parents house because it's the only thing he truly loves 75% of the time.

review/summary: This thing was made for terriers
review/text: My husband and I have two English Jack Russell Terriers under six months old. They're both much more interested in playing than eating, but my vet was adamant that letting them graze all day would make house training significantly more difficult.<br /><br />The answer has been to make their eating more of a challenge. We've got two oversized Kongs that we'll fill with their breakfast, but they eat out of the kongs very quickly. In the evening, we needed something that would keep the puppies busy for at least ten minutes, so one of us could get some food in our own mouths before it was time for the pack to go out.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug has been great. Both puppies are challenged by it, but not so challenged that they lose interest. There's a perfect balance between work and reward. It holds a lot of food and assorted small treats, it's pretty easy to load, and the beasts haven't figured out how to unscrew the bottom lid.<br /><br />Some of the pictures for this product on various websites show a rope. Mine actually came with a silicone "rope" that's got a cone shape at the end, which ensures something gets scooped to the neck almost every time they pull on it.<br /><br />Only downside for my two is that if the food drops below a certain level they lose interest... might be because it's too much work, or it might be because they're full. Either way I have to make sure to dump the leftovers into a kong or a dish at least once a week so they get to eat the food before it gets stale.

review/summary: Kept her interest, then she destroyed it
review/text: My dog really enjoyed this. she spent hours trying to get the treats out. but in the first 10 minutes she chewed the plastic 'rope' in half out of frustration. So now the toy doesn't work as intended, but still i put her dog food in there since i know she'll be able to get it out pretty easily, it will just take more work than the bowl. This is a really great toy, just wish the rope would have lasted a day. so be sure to supervise play before you leave your dog with this one.

review/summary: Ho-hum
review/text: I received my order this chocolate quickly and it was well packed. There was no damage to the chocolate from heat. In fact the merchandise was in the very good condition.<br /><br />The confection itself had nothing specific to recommend it. Oh, it was good but it was not remarkably good. I believe one day just as well by buying supermarket chocolate. In my opinion this was definitely not gourmet chocolate.<br /><br />Therefore, although I don't have anything actually negative to say about this stuff, I don't think it is worth the price and again I think one is better off buying chocolate in the supermarket, since the quality of their product is as good as this.

review/text: This isn't a vegetarian sauce (shrimp is an ingredient) -for those concerned about such things.  It has a little bit of kick to it, but not much.  It says sour and spicy on the bottle, but I would call the flavor of the sauce more of a sweet and sour.  I made a zucchini stew with basically this sauce mixed with the zucchini and cooking broth and it was pretty good.  4.25 stars.

review/summary: E S S E N T I A L........Y U M M I N E S S... ! ! ! !
review/text: AMAZON.COM seems right on target, listing this item under "Health and Personal Care"!  Whilst others may consider this a mistake, (as I did at first), I got to thinking....WHY NOT list it under "Health amd Personal<br />Care"?  The "health" ingredients in this scrumptious little candy bar are as natural as most un-organic food -- especially candy -- is today,  Yes, I'll admit that "sugar", "corn syrup" and "hydrogenated palm kernal oil may not be the best for one's diet....but they ARE natural products, not chemical facimilies.  The other ingredients are natural too....the one exception being "artifical flavours".  Oh, well...the scrumptious flavour of this treat...plus the money one saves by not buying fancier and/or organic chocolate, (at least, not all the time), can easily make a person sleep better at night, as the thought of bank interest compounding, (or stocks going up, etc.), leads to more relaxation, and better sleep!<br /><br />Also, "3 Musketters" has 45% less fat than other typical chocolate snacks!<br /><br />So much for "Health" benefits of "3 Musketeers"!<br /><br />And "Personal Care"?  You bet!  Eating one of these wonderous little bars makes one think one is eating a chocolate confection at the court of Louis XIV, Louis XV, or Louis XVI!  (And or the courts of Peter The Great,<br />King Mongut of Siam....or any other monarch, or at the mansion of any rich and famous person of your choice!)  It is SO easy to forget the "gourmet" quality of this smooth little treat, because it is so readily available in candy stores, mom-and-pop groceries, huge supermarkets, and online!  However, the smoothness of this confection, and it's sweet chocolate taste, should not be taken for granted!  There is NO sticky nougat, and NO "pesky" nuts, to draw attention from the wonderful texture and magnificient flavour!  (I have read that "Preppie" food is boneless...probably skinless and without fat, as well.  No difficulty in prying meat or fish for the upper classes!  So, too, can a readily-available "3 Musketeers" be considered an<br />"upper-class" treat, even if it doesn't carry a huge price tag.  Nothing interferes with "chewing pleasure"...it's just "chocolate fluffiness", covered with a darker chocolate topping!<br /><br />(True, if you favour "rocky road" ice-cream, then "3 Musketeers" Bars may not be for you.  But if you like your steak or fish fileted, and your flavour in your candy-bars to be sweet and true, ....THIS is your snack of choice....just as it is mine!)  Deluxe, inexpensive....wow!  What a bargain!  And it even has the "OU" (highest-quality kosher) symbol on each wrapper, as well!<br /><br />If you want to cut calories and fat still further...and/or want a second type of treat from your "3 Musketeers" bar, try "volumiizing" it.  "Volumizing" is a calorie-cutting technique, which can easily be done with a "3 Musketters" Bar.  Simply put some milk, (whole, skim or dry), intro a blender, add one or two "3 Musketters" bar(s), and whirl away!  Presto....the best "Malt" available, outside of the ones I used to have in a neighbourhood, Brooklyn, NY candy-shop as a child!  (In fact, you could even add malt, (Carnation Instant...also sold by Amazon.com), to make a super treat!  Or place "3 Musketeers" bars inside a cake batter, for an additional taste experience!  Recipes for this little gem of a snack seem endless!  And no nougat, sticky caramel, or nuts, to get in the way!<br /><br />One thing I miss from the "3 Musketeers" bars, as they now are packed, is a picture of Alexander Dumas' 3 Musketeers, themselves, For, of course, it is from this novel that the candy bar gets its name.  Althos, Porthos, D'Artagnon,....where art thou?  Thy pictures surely USED to be on this bar!  This scrumptious,  easily-eaten fluffy little chocolate concoction, which surely would be at home in any French, or other Royal Court, reallt needs your pictures on it again!<br /><br />In the meantime.....bite into this wonderful, easily eaten, chocolate confection masterpiece!  Don't let it's wide availabily make you think of it as a common candy bar...for it is truly a gourmet treat!

review/text: As an ex New Yorker, I've had fond memories of fresh baked 7 layer cake from a local Brooklyn bakery. Unfortunately this product is a very poor representation of the product. The cake was too dry and the filling had very little taste. The chocolate topping was both too sweet and too soft.  I purchased 2 cakes and they were sent US Mail. One cake had its topping melt in the Texas heat while sitting in our mailbox and was thrown away. I'm still searching for a great cake.

review/text: I bought all the flavors of NurturMe offered on Amazon and we decided to try the peas first.  When I mixed the formula in, I could not believe how bright green the peas were.  I tasted them and they tasted like the freshest peas I ever ate.  I had only planned to throw these in the diaper bag for a quick feeding on the go with easy portability, but so far these are the only peas my daughter will eat!  Next we tried the apples and they were better than the best applesauce I've ever had.  I make my own baby food, and because many fruits and veggies arent the best right now, these powdered baby foods are better than what I can make homemade!  Every flavor has been as good as the last.  All are bright, colorful, and taste very, very fresh.

review/text: This NurturMe All-Natural Baby Food actually resembles the taste of fresh peas, and not just a little bit either.  I'd say the taste is STRONGLY reminiscent of fresh garden peas.  That's amazing considering most baby food just tastes like yucky, watered down mushy imitations of the real thing.  Not so in this case.  Highly recommended for all mothers and fathers that want their baby to eat only the most nutritious and edible foods.

review/summary: The only store bought baby food I will feed my baby
review/text: I'm an older mother with my first child and I make all of my baby's food at home to avoid any unwanted ingredients and to make sure that my child has the freshest and best tasting food possible.  All his food EXCEPT for the NurturMe products that is!  I found their peas and apples while I was on vacation and was completely shocked at how fresh, bright, and tasty they are.  I refused to feed my child that grey stuff that passes for canned baby peas even from supposed "organic" or healthy brands because it isn't anything I would personally want to eat due to the processed taste and color.  As the other reviewer stated, I've honestly never tasted peas that were so fresh and sweet.  I would never have thought that dried baby foods would produce such a fresh looking and tasting end result, but they look and taste so much better than anything that is canned or in the plastic pouches.  I tried buying fresh or frozen organic peas myself and making my own pea puree but it never came out as nice as these.  When I used fresh or frozen peas my baby wouldn't eat them because I was never able to get the pea skins pureed fine enough and he kept choking and coughing while he ate them.  I make my own sweet potato, squash, blueberry, etc. but these are really the only green vegetables that he seems to love.  My only complaint is that they can be hard to find in supermarkets or big box stores.  Thanks Amazon for keeping them in stock.  And, yes, they are super handy for mixing into other foods or taking them on the go, but for me the main selling point of these is the fresh sweet taste which makes my baby scarf them down!

review/summary: What a money saver
review/text: We own an Australian Shepard who WAS getting ear infections frequently and always scratching. This started about two years ago. I finally took her to a new vet, (my old vet NEVER mentioned food allergies, hmmmm). Vet said chronic ear infections are usually due to food allergies and that we could try their food at $100.00 a 20lb bag. YIKES! We found NL Lamaderm at Wal-mart. We noticed after just a few days that Sheila stopped scratching. Needless to say really, the change of food,(which, by the way, she gobbled up),caused really bad gas. But after a few weeks that stopped too. No ear infections, no scratching. We are thrilled with this product. We pay less than $25.00 for a 20lb bag at Wal-Mart. Thank you NLPP for providing us with the key to a healthier dog.

review/summary: so-so flavor, too much fiber for me
review/text: I like some of the Snickers Marathon bar flavors, but not this one.  It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.  Mostly this just tastes sweet.<br /><br />For many people, this might be a healthy snack substitution.  Each bar has only 150 calories yet has 11 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbs (9 grams of sugar).  It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them), but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white bread, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product, I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor.

review/summary: Tastes Good, Drink it all and it makes you VERY nervous
review/text: I Love the Blue Sky Energy Drink, Wild Berry Flavor, but was used to drinking the 8 oz size that I would buy at the grocery store, so I was very surprised to receive a whopping 16 oz size via Amazon. Since I was used to drinking the 8 oz size with no problem, I gave it no thought to drink the 16 oz. BOY was that a mistake. Not only did it make me VERY nervous, but it was entirely too much 'energy' for my system at once. From then on I only drank half a can at a time and I was fine. They should put a warning on this stuff. DO NOT DRINK A WHOLE CAN.

review/summary: Fantastic truffle butter!
review/text: The ingredients are simple and natural: Wisconsin butter, Salt, Truffle Oil, White Truffles, & Natural Flavorings yet a little of this butter goes a long way to impart an earthly garlicky flavor in your food. Arrives tucked in cold packs and lasts a long time in the freezer. The butter is filled with bits of truffle you can see and taste. I think their secret is whipping truffle oil into the butter to enhance the flavoring. Regardless of the secret, it's a potent and tasty truffle butter.

review/summary: Mmmm...great in oatmeal!
review/text: I eat steel cut oatmeal almost every morning and I was so happy to discover this sweetener.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and not too sweet.  I'd much rather use agave than something artificial or pre-sweetened.  I'm sure it would also be delicious on pancakes or maybe even ice cream!  YUM!

review/summary: Sohgave! Maple Agave Syrup
review/text: This product (I think) is better than the "fake" maple syrups (check their labels--most contain NO MAPLE SYRUP AT ALL!) The difference in calories is absolutely amazing (the brand with the rustic wintery retreat pictured on the label has 200 calories per serving and the agave 60!) I can pronounce and spell both ingredients in the agave -- can't do that for the "fake" stuff!! The first time I tried it I just served it heated in a pitcher- the way I usually serve syrup- the kids & grandson loved it & thought I had found the "Perfect Brand!!" I think I have!  I couldn't remember where I bought it--spent weeks looking then found it at Amazon.com!!  No-brainer- ordered a case & shared!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035MV1VC">Sohgave!

review/summary: Unpleasant Aftertaste
review/text: A while back I was looking for more natural sweeteners so I decided to give agave a try on the recommendation of others.  I had success with another maple-flavored agave for pancake topping, but this version left an unpleasant plastic-y taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Since learning that agave is very similar to high fructose corn syrup, I've switched to more natural sweeteners: maple syrup, honey and rapadura.

review/summary: Packed in cooler & delivered quickly
review/text: I LOVE TWIX MINIS because they are the perfect size. I have bought, and LOVE ALL 3 of the different size "TWIX MINIS" packages that are either sold by Amazon, or "Fulfilled" by Amazon (compared to the other merchants), because they always come in a small white 6 pack size Styrofoam cooler with ice packs. I can't remember if they always came like that, or if it's just in the summer that they use the cooler, but they have always been packaged well. I have Amazon Prime so whenever they have them on sale, and they are "Prime 2 day Free shipping" eligible, I get them in 2 or 3 days , or it takes 4-5 days at other times.

review/summary: No BPA, but price is a bit much
review/text: I've gotten these for around a dollar per 2-pack at my grocery store, so the price here isn't that great (though the convenience of them showing at the door might make it worthwhile). But skip for the price, not for the BPA. There is no BPA in them. See their website:<br /><br />http://www.gerber.com/faq?catid=5225<br /><br />I know the BPA stuff is scary, but you have to be careful before you put reviews up on websites that scare new mothers for no reason, especially since many mothers use this and don't need the guilt of thinking they've been unknowingly harming their children. I used these packs with my older child and now with my baby, and they are very convenient for diaper-bag use - no breakage! I skip them for home use since they don't recycle, and our grocery store has a good/cheap organic line packed in glass.

review/text: From the Gerber website:<br />BPA is not used in making the plastic cups for GERBER� pureed baby food products. It is important to note that even products with the number 7 plastic are not made with BPA, (the number 7 refers to recycling information, not the presence of BPA).<br /><br />We have confirmed with Gerber that their organic baby food containers are a mix of plastic types numbers 1 and 2 and because they are a mix, they are not recyclable under either such category and are given a number 7 code for recycling. See the ZReport on BPA for more information.

review/summary: Awesome Baby Carrots!
review/text: My daughter LOVES these carrots.  I like to make my own baby food, but with all the concerns about nitrate levels in vegetables - specifically carrots - I choose to buy these pre-made since I know that Gerber screens for nitrates in all their products.  These have a great consistency and are not too thick, and not too thin.  I've even tasted them and they are quite good.  They have a rich, fresh carrot flavor that doesn't resemble over-cooked, canned carrots. I highly recommend these.

review/text: I fell in love with these when visiting the UK this fall and so happy to find them on amazon! If you have not had them before, they are not what most would think of as a cracker; being soft, not crispy but can be toasted. The rough cut oats are quite evident. I like grabbing one or two for a quick snack, far better for me than cookies! I suggest giving them a try.

review/summary: Very tasty, was worth trying
review/text: This is a very tasty product and was well worth trying.  As with many fresh meat and produce purchases it is pretty expensive compared to buying locally, but at the same time for someone living alone like I do, to have something like a corned beef roast pre-cooked and sliced into 12 ounce trays is a time saver.  This to me tastes as good as cooking a brisket at home, and I don't end up with a large amount of meat that I probably don't end up eating even as left overs.  When I am in the mood for corned beef, either as part of my main meal or since this is sliced for sandwiches, I can just microwave this.  12 ounces is more then enough for one person at a time.

When I first opened a can of Nescafe Cafe Con Leche it brought back memories! It is the closest thing to "cafe con leche" that you'll get in a can - I just add a little sugar and it is absolutely delicious. Those of you who grew up drinking cafe con leche should try this :)

review/summary: Where's the Coffee?
review/text: I know this is supposed to be sweetened and creamy. But drinking a cup of it, I could not shake the idea that I was instead drinking a hot and melted tube of cake icing. Detecting the coffee flavoring which was supposed to allow it to be called 'coffee' was really difficult.<br /><br />Buying it because of the pre-made convenience (and okay the cheap selling price) is self-defeating when the coffee does not taste like coffee. It was next to impossible for me to detect! So, I'd rather pay a little more for halfway deccent coffee, and have to obtain milk and sugar separately.<br /><br />It's certainly not the type of product which you would want to serve in a 'high society' environment hoping to impress your guests about knowledge of coffee. It's international, but the coffee concept is not on par with Italian Cappuccino.<br /><br />But on a plus side, you can drink several cups of this stuff without worrying if it will keep you up at night. It either is decaffeinated. Or the existing caffeine content in the product is so low that it does not affect people with sensitivity.
