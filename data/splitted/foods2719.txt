review/summary: Nice seasonal treat
review/text: I buy these often thru warehouse deals as on regular Amazon, they are costly the way my dogs like to eat these.  This last batch was very crunchy; not sure if it was the way they were baked or if they were older.  Either way, the dogs liked them.  I took a few to work to give co workers for their dogs and and they thought the shape was cute and their dogs liked them also.  Even my husband, the football fan would give these to the dogs and usually he has nothing to do with "my dogs."  With that said, they must be good!

review/summary: Where are the Christmas cookies?
review/text: My dog loves these treats, and I love to gift them to my friends and family with dogs, as well.  Very disappointing that I wasn't able to get any of the Christmas designs this year.  I bought a bunch last year; this year, only the non-Christmas designs are available.  :-(  Very sad.

review/text: I have been taking this product for almost 3 months now.  It has helped me with all my symptoms of menopause, in particular, the hot flashes.  If I skip 2 days of taking these the HF come back full force.  It took about a week of 1 capsule a day to help. I have never taken more than 1 a day although the recommendations on the bottle says 1-2 tablets three times daily.  I'm sure if I took two a day I would have different results, possibly better; but, I'm plenty satisfied with what these already have done for me.<br /><br />  I shared them with my husband for the first 7 days, he said he saw no noticeable difference.  We don't really have much trouble in that department anyway, so he may need it more in the future.<br /><br />  Wonderful product. I am so pleased with it.  Without it, I'm afraid I would have needed a hormone replacement that was prescription -- or a cave to live in til this passes. I have placed another order today. -- As always, Thanks Amazon.

review/text: Who knew that 8 simple words could mean so much? I for one, did not. However, the fates would smile upon me one evening in a drunken stupor, when I took a gamble on Geier's Liver Sausage. Imagine my surprise when I found I had not only received 1 but 6, 6.5 ounce cans of flavor country.<br />Let me tell you, the pork and pork liver flavors blend together and make you question, where does the pork end and the liver start? Onions solidifying the union of salt and natural spices into a holy trinity of taste.<br />Which brings us to the sodium nitrite, oh sweet, sweet sodium nitrite, thank you for preserving these wonderful little gifts from the gods.<br />Look no further then Geier's Liver Sausage, Hausmacher Brand, for all your tissue and organ meat needs.

review/summary: Ginger Snap / Vanilla Wafer Nirvana!
review/text: If your grandma ever made molasses cookies, they might have tasted like these extraordinary ginger snaps! They're light and snappy, without being a jaw-breaker. The amount of ginger and sugar is just right and the molasses is unsulphured, thus, there's no yucky aftertaste. The Country Choice vanilla wafers are equally delicious! At over six bucks a pound, these cookies are a bit pricey, but worth every penny. Try these with a nice cup of tea or an ice-cold glass of milk. Now, try not to eat the whole box full...I dare you!

Well...we're still organic!  Not only did he like them, he didn't even notice.  He still hoards them and insists they are only "his".  I enjoy them as do our 3 kids.

review/summary: 4 stars since organic
review/text: If these had not been organic I'd only given 2 stars. I'm used to eating Nature's Path organic ginger spice cookies which is the one I'm using to compare. The NP ones have a stronger ginger flavor which I prefer. The crunch factor (hardness) is about the same. The price point is the biggest factor. The NP at $32 w/o coupon for 12 9 ox. boxes are approx.4.75 pound (the last case I bought had a coupon so were $22 or 3.26/lb). These are about 6.50/lb. at Amazon's current price. I probably won't buy these again as I'll stick w/ Nature's Path. That said, I did give this brand's chocolate mint cookies 5 stars and I do plan on purchasing those again as well as trying their chocolate chip and oatmeal cranberry.

review/summary: Used To Be Great, But No More!!
review/text: These cookies used to be great, but alas, no more!!  I bought two cases (12 boxes) of the ones with an expiration date of "OCT 11 09 B" from Amazon recently.  When I received them I found only two to three whole cookies per box, the rest were broken in multiple pieces.  I had previously had this problem with the "OCT 11 09 B" cookies that I purchased from Kroger and Whole Foods.  Two problems that I noticed right away: 1) the natural ginger snap cracks are two deep and the whole cookies that are present break with very little force, and 2) the cookie boxes rather than being stacked vetically in the case taking advantage of the stucture of each box to protect the cookies, are layed flat on top of one another.  Therefore, just stacking cases on top of one another crushes the cookies.  When I called the company and pointed out these problems, they blamed Amazon's mishandling of the cases as the cause of so many broken cookies.  They promised to reimburse me but I only received coupons to replace one of the two problem cases. If the broken cookie pieces had not tasted so good and if they had not been organic, this rating would have been a "1".

I really don't care for the taste of spearment tea and so the weaker taste suits me fine.  There is a slight hint of honey, but after drinking this tea for 4 months and 3 boxes I still don't taste any orange or spice.  My mother and daughter have both tried the tea and said they liked the flavor.  If you like a strong spearment flavor this tea will be too weak for you.

review/text: I ordered a bag of the Soft Peppermint Candy from Stewart Candy Company. On the back of the bag it says: they do not mark their all natural candy with a color stripe to identify the different flavors. They identify their flavors on the individual candy wrappers. They have 5 different flavors....keep in mind I ordered peppermint. When I opened the bag there were about 40-50 individually wrapped mints, of the 40-50, about 10 were marked peppermint, the others were in a plain wrapper. I opened one of the peppermint marked candies and sure enough it was peppermint. I then opened one of the "mystery" mints and found that it was one of their Honey mints.<br />It turned out that most of the bag was in fact the Honey mints. I contacted the Stewart Candy Company and explained the issue, they sent me a replacement bag of peppermints. I opened the replacement bag and the whole bag is marked peppermint. I am wondering if the first bag was in fact mess up's or 2nd's. But I am pleased that Stewart Candy took the time to make it right.

(They were for stocking stuffers - sure glad I opened them before Christmas rolled around!)  Oh - by the way, the title says "soft" peppermint candy.  The texture is like those little pastel pillow-shaped mints.  Again, they taste fine.

review/text: The soft honey candy by Stewart really surprised me because I wasn't too sure what to expect, but it was definitely a pleasant surprise.  These are all natural, individually wrapped candies that are sweetened with honey so they are not too sugary; they soften as you suck on them and they are soft enough to chew without worry of hurting a tooth.  I keep some in my purse in case I need a little something in my mouth when I'm out and they taste great because they are not too sweet but sweet enough to enjoy.  Their all natural status make them fine for sharing with children.  It's a great treat whether it's shared in the office, your home, or your purse.  Enjoy!

review/text: I was a little hesitant to order these as I'm trying to avoid corn syrup and the company does not seem to have an ingredients list for their products anywhere.  But I took a chance and ordered it.  For those of you who like to know the ingredients of something before you put it in your mouth, here it is -<br /><br />Sugar, Natural Citric Acid, Natural Orange Flavor<br /><br />Yep, that's it.  They're a bit smaller than Bob's Peppermint Balls and a touch softer.  No coloring, so they look rather plain, but a nice orange flavor to them.  I'm now inclined to try the other flavors and am hoping that they are all corn-syrup-free...<br /><br />I'm not sure I would recommend these for children, though - the size is such that I would worry about choking.  Doesn't mean you can't indulge your adult sweet tooth, though!

I've found it is easiest to get around by mixing any powdered stevia with a tiny bit of hot water at the bottom of your cup or pitcher, then add room temperature or cool water, drink mix, ice and enjoy.

review/summary: There are much better Stevia products
review/text: This was one of the most bitter stevia products I've tried.  The best I've had is probably Nirvana stevia, but it's based out of Australia, so shipping's pretty high.  Second best is NuStevia's packets that have stevia mixed with a sugar alcohol.  NuStevia's regular stevia is not good, in my opinion, though not as bad as Spoonable stevia.

review/text: Caribou Daybreak Morning Blend coffee is one of my favorite blends.  I don't like a strong coffee, and this one is a little less than medium strength but has a really smooth rich coffee taste, it's excellent.  If you are a lover of the Starbucks strength coffee, this probably would not be one you would enjoy.

review/text: I just LOVE this coffee!  It's just so light, not heavy and "burned" like a lot of morning coffees, but it has all the caffeine that you're accustomed to for morning.  I have always loved Caribou's coffees WAY over Starbuck's (Starbuck's is AWESOME for growing roses, however), and this one is just perfect for us.  It's not overdone, just a smooth, rich blend of some of the most awesome beans available.  If you put your nose close enough to your Keurig, this one is a delight to smell after you pull down the handle and it pierces the top. Ahhhhh!  SO LOVE this stuff, highly highly recommend!

review/summary: I don't have to travel to Minnesota
review/text: The best coffeehouse in the USA is Caribou Coffee. That's just an opinion, but an opinion I'd challenge anyone to test. When I go to the Mall of the Americas in Minnesota, the first place I stop is the Caribou Coffee shop. I don't like Starbucks coffee at all, and usually look for any alternative.<br />Buying these Caribou coffee pods aren't up to the in house experience, but still enjoyable (not as good as grinding and brewing your own with their blend either). This coffee pod is filled (possibly overfilled) so it's not a wimpy coffee at all. If you're looking for a great strong coffee on the mild side Daybreak may be a good option for you. My best advice is to wait till it's shipped and sold by Amazon for the best price, but if that isn't an option, you may want to get your caffeine fix with an alternative seller.

review/summary: Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than Caribou's signature blend, along comes Daybreak!
review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household.  Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee.  With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings.  I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick.  Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma.  And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments.  This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop.  It goes great with a little skim milk, too.  A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us.  So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly).  Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it.  It's my new go-to k cup!

review/text: I've had my Keurig brewer for almost 2 years now. I've tried tons of k-cups from companies including Green Mountain, Timothy's, Folgers's, Coffee People, Gloria Jean's, etc. This is by far the best coffee I've found. I normally brew on the larger cup size (9.25 oz) and it is the ideal cup of coffee. Not too strong, not too weak. The aftertaste is pleasant and not bitter. I would definitely recommend this coffee to anyone and everyone.

review/summary: My favorite K-Cup coffee
review/text: Taste is a personal choice and I prefer light roast coffees. My favorite brand is Peets, but until Peets gets into the K-Cup market this will have to do. This brew is light and not bitter, however I do detect a slight, stale flavor. However this stale flavor is common in nearly all ground coffee, including the tail end of a bag of my beloved Peets coffee. I also taste a sweet note in the coffee that counteracts the typical bitter notes, potentially allowing me to drink a cup without any adjunct sweeteners or milk. This has happened when I run out of milk (cow, soy or almond) and I just don't feel like using aspartame (Nutrasweet).

Daybreak morning blend gives me what I need in that first morning coffee: a definitive coffee taste, the caffeine kickstart, and the reassuring coffee smell that lets you know another day has started...<br /><br />It does so without being overpowering or bitter. I also enjoy this in the evening while reading, watching TV or sitting around and talking.

review/text: "Caibou Daybreak Morning Blend" has just enough caffeine to get you going in the AM without the caffeine overload feelings that stronger blends provide.  I drink a cup black and I'm on my way without any empty stomach jitters.

review/summary: Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than Caribou's signature blend, along comes Daybreak!
review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household. Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings. I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!

review/summary: One of the best coffees we've tried so far!
review/text: I bought my wife a Keurig machine a year ago and we've tried a lot of cases of coffees, teas, apple cider, hot chocolate... you name it and we've probably tried it.<br /><br />So far, this is one of our all time favorite coffees.  It's rich, has a wonderful aroma, and it's flavorful without being bitter.<br /><br />It's a little stronger than Coffee People Donut Shop but just about that same type of coffee.  We love them both as do many of our guests and visitors.

review/text: the coffee tastes good when there aren't grounds in the coffee. i thought first time i made the mistake somehow...i don't know how since you just plop the kcup in the machine, but now it's happened for like 1/2 the kcups...it's terrible and a waste. this has never happened with other ones. i have other ones from different companies and it never happens, just with these caribou daybreak morning blend ones. :(

review/summary: Best coffee we have found
review/text: My fiance and I dont seem to like the dark roast coffees and medium roast k cups (except for the Dunkin Donuts one) that much so when we say this at the grocery store and saw that it was a  light blend that we hadn't tried yet we figured why not. We are glad we did.<br /><br />This coffee smells so good when it is brewing so we knew that was a good sign when we made it later that night after we got home shopping. Then we tried it and basically fell in love with it and don't drink anything else now in the mornings. We do have an iced coffee that is different on the weekend but that's another review.<br /><br />I highly recomend this coffee to anyone who like us feels that the bold and medium roasts are just too strong. This isn't at all and is just an all around very good tasting coffee.

review/text: My wife loves this Caribou Daybreak blend, I don't because it is too wussy! I know, a strange word to describe coffee but it has NO kick at all! At the other end of the spectrum, I also don't like espresso blends because they are too strong. I suspect this blend might be good for iced coffee, though.

review/summary: Shipping not as promised
review/text: The Caribou Coffee is of course equal and the same as any I could buy in a store or at any other on-line vendor.  The time it took to get to me was unacceptable though.  I will not be ordering my coffee from this vendor again.  I opted to pay for speedier shipping although I was eligible for the free Super Saver on this item, because I knew I would soon be running out of coffee at home.  I then received a notice of a shipping date that was almost 2 weeks from order date!  I had to then take my time and get stressed arguing with them about the fact that I'd paid extra for expidited shipping. I did get my shipping fees refunded, but not my coffee sooner.  So I had to then go out to a store to purchase coffee to use until the order from Amazon finally arrived, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place by placing the order on line.  Not a happy camper on this one!

I really like this stuff.<br /><br />I have not tried a whole bunch of Vinegar powder/salt options but this stuff tastes real good.<br />My wife really likes fries and vinegar chips as well.  This was a great addition to my seasonings.<br /><br />BIG DEAL...  This stuff does not have any kind of flower in it to prevent caking. This means those with some allergies can eat it!!!<br />Check first to be sure they don't change the formula on me.
