review/summary: full of flavor
review/text: I love good caramels.  I can never resist trying any brand I come across, in an attempt to discover my perfect caramel.  Some caramels can be sticky sweet, like butterscotch topping.  Others, like the most common grocery store brand, can be very bland, like cardboard.  I found these Fleur de Sel caramels to have a lovely fragrance.  I felt that I could distinguish the ingredients, as one can sometimes do with handcrafted products made with good quality ingredients.  They had an outstanding buttery, natural flavor which was not overwhelmed by saltiness.  The saltiness was more subtle than I had expected, I had been afraid that they would be overly salty.  For someone like me, who does not do well with overly sweet, sugary confections, the salt balanced the sweetness nicely.  In my 68-degree house, the first one I sampled was stiff, which made it less than perfect.  I set one close to a cup of hot tea, and the heat from the hot cup improved the texture.  I would like to melt the remaining seven pieces, and use them to coat a Honey Crisp apple, and coat it with some chopped peanuts, but there is just not enough caramel there for that application, and it would be costly.  They are not an inexpensive candy, and you don't get a very big package.  For that reason, if I could have given the product four-and-a-half stars, that's what I would have given.

review/text: These are wonderfully smooth and tasty, melt-in-your mouth caramels. However, I still prefer the Le Petit Saunier sea salt caramels. They certainly were delicious, but I expected a bit more saltiness.

review/summary: My Favorite Mass-Market Jerky
review/text: Sugar Ray's Honey Chipotle is my absolute favorite jerky available in average/common stores.  Its not too soft or too hard. Just enough density to give a satisfying chew without overworking my jaw muscles. And the flavor is fantastic! A little sweet with a gentle kick of spice. You say "gentle kick", what is that? Enough spice to warm my mouth, but not tear me up or make my nose run. Also enough spice to keep the vultures (my kids) from wanting more than just a taste.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price.  This jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products...I just can't resist the flavor! Haha.  So if you don't like the price, don't try it.  Like me, you might not be able to go back to your old jerky.

review/summary: Tastes Great, Completely Fat Free!
review/text: I was looking for a snack that was high in protein but low in fat so I started looking at Beef Jerky, but all the other brands have at least some sort of fat in them, usually a minimum of 1g, which may not sound like much, but when you're dieting, every gram counts. So when I found this brand I was very pleased. It tastes great and did I mention it has zero fat? Oh yeah, I did. But each service (28 oz) only has 50 calories, no carbs and some good protein. Switch to this brand/style. You won't be displeased.

review/summary: A new favorite!
review/text: I have been on a beef jerky kick lately, and this is one of my new favorites. It starts with the tenderness of the meat. The meat is on the soft side but still has a nice chew to it. It's real pieces as apposed to the artificial looking variety. The flavor has a nice smoky BBQ base and the sweetness of the honey and the mild heat from the chipolte is perfect. I've tried multiple Sweet Baby Ray products and have yet to be disappointed. Grab a bag or two, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I fell in love with the chocolate version of these candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany. A perfect combination of chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer. I thought I might prefer the hazelnut version since I'm not a chocolate lover, but in this case, the chocolate version is better because it offers a better balance of flavors.  The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination.  These aren't bad; I just prefer the chocolate in this case!

review/summary: Fantastic Crisps; Use for Everything
review/text: We love these crisps.  They are akin to a cracker as opposed to a potato chip.  As such, we use them in soup now all of the time and they are so much better than soup crackers.  We also use them with cheese and as the legend on the package tells you, the sellers developed them for their then cheese store.  However, these crisps became so popular that they left the cheese business for this instead. These are actual New York bagels, sliced and put back into their ovens to become crisps.  I buy a big bag of these at Sam's Club locally. I've also tried Stacy's chips but like these better.

review/summary: Great Price, Great Packaging, Great Taste!
review/text: If you've never had these Bagel Crisps before they are about the size of a large potato chip but much thicker and made from bagels.  They are crunchy and taste like garlic and salt.  Compared to the Ranch Wheat thins (15 crackers a serving) I usually snack on, the serving of Bagel Crisps (6 crisps) has 10 less calories but fills me up the same.  However, there is a lot more sodium in the crisps, 320mg vs.190mg in the Wheat Thins.<br /><br />The package of 12 arrived quickly, well packaged, and fresh.  My particular order which was placed in mid July has an expiration date of May 2011.  Plenty of time to eat all 12 packages without feeling rushed!<br /><br />All in all... for a moderately healthy crunchy snack you can't go wrong.

review/text: After ignoring these in the supermarket for some time, I was introduced to them at my new job where everyone kept scarfing them down. Being a garlic lover, I just had to try one. I'm hooked. They are light, airy, and so full of flavor. They do get your hands a bit greasy reminding you that they aren't a fat free light food. I'm not into potato chips, so I searched my supermarket for the garlic flavor to no avail. How delightful I can order them from Amazon!<br /><br />I gave the review 4 stars because sometimes the bag is full of broken pieces instead of full bagel chips. As another reviewer said, a resealable bag would add to the product. However, maybe the creators know how quickly they will be devoured... :)

review/text: A very fresh tasting, uncomplicated sauce. The first time I tried this sauce, it immediately became my favorite. Very happy to find Amazon carries it and especially in the 16 oz size. I don't like the taste of sugar in pasta sauce and have never understood why so many vendors add it. This sauce has no added sugar. Plus, the sodium is decent at 10% RDA per serving. But don't buy it for health reasons; buy it because it tastes amazing - like you've made it yourself from fresh tomatoes.

review/summary: Pleasant sharpness in the bite
review/text: Finally I received this sauce. I had to order it 3 times, until I now finally got the parcel (UPS has stolen the first 2 shipments!) I was reluctant to even try for a third time, because I was not sure if amazon would still believe me if also the third order wouldn't arrive. So I had it shipped to Hubby's office address.<br /><br />And here I am, happy that I did it, because this sauce is really a delicate accompaniment to any pasta, and I would have missed out if I had given up!<br /><br />I had previously tried the Basil sauce and the Puttanesca sauce of this brand, and this variety is also really good. No processed ingredients, it is just like homemade, but faster. I am usually cooking my sauces from scratch, but I have these jars as a back up if I am really tired or sick or just too lazy. Contains only natural ingredients, not processed crap that the corporations are dumping into their supermarket brands.<br /><br />A bit pricey, yes, but you have to pay for the quality and the convenience. One malus point I would give, though: this variety is only available in the smaller jars. So for a dinner with 500 g pasta I would need 1.5 jars, that means I will have half a jar open in the fridge. I would prefer a bigger size jar, just like the other varieties have. That is the only complaint I have. (The fact that UPS is employing a thief is not their fault, I am aware!)

review/summary: Got fish? You need this!
review/text: Last year I purchased this product on a hunch at a local discount store(TM)at a tremendously discounted price. Now I am hooked. Works wonders on fish, but also terrific on potatoes, rice, eggs, chicken, steaks, Italian dishes and in all sorts of casseroles. It is a delightful medium grind blend of salt, black pepper, parsley, garlic, onion, lemon peel and green peppercorns. The mixture is a bit heavier on salt than I would like but I use it sparingly as it is quite potent on the other spices as well.<br /><br />I like to mix about a third cup of spice with a cup and a half all purpose flour in a baggie which I refrigerate for at least a few days. The spice flavors the flour which I then lightly sprinkle on fish or meats before pan grilling in a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a cast iron skillet. The result is a beautifully browned, light, crunchy, low fat, flavorable crust surrounding a wonderfully moist fillet of salmon, orange roughy, tuna, chicken or even rib eye steak.<br /><br />Fisherman's Wharf really kicks up homemade potato salad, scrambled eggs and homemade chicken salad. I have mixed it with mayonnaise to spread on ham, tomato and lettuce sandwiches, BLTs and leftover turkey and fresh vegetable wraps. It also makes a quick and tasty salad dressing using olive oil and apple cider or balsamic vinegar. The uses for this wonderful spice blend are limited only by your culinary imagination.

review/summary: Nice herb and citrus flavors
review/text: We eat fish and seafood about twice weekly, and we use this Spice Mixture about half the time (the other times we use a brown sugar & paprika based rub).  This mixture imparts herb and citrus flavors.  My preferred method is to brush the fish with olive oil or mayonnaise, and then sprinkle it with this spice mixture (sometimes I also add Panko bread crumbs).  And then just bake it - serve with a lemon wedge!  Simple and flavorful.

review/summary: If you like Peet's coffee
review/text: I'm new to Keurig and formerly a Peet's addict.  I like a very strong dark roast with a thick mouthy feel. I hate watery coffee.<br />So I started with all the extra bolds....having tried Newman's, Timothy's Sumatra bold, Black Tiger, Midnight Madness as<br />well as Emeril's.  So far, Emeril's is my first choice. Best aroma, which definitely sets off the taste buds. Strong full mouth<br />feel, with a bite on the back end. Not french roast bitter, though.  I'm still hoping Peet's will make some k cups but until<br />they do (when I don't want to use my k cup), Emeril's will be my choice.  Surprised because I did not expect this from a<br />coffee with Emeril's name on it.  I run an 8 ounce in my b30 and it's a solid morning drink.

Your friends and family won't mistake it for Starbucks but it's a great cup of coffee in the morning. Don't let Emeril prevent you from trying this brand!

review/summary: Good strong coffee
review/text: I have a Keurig and use the Emeril cups for my morning has-to-be-strong coffee.  I know many people feel that the other K-cups taste a bit watered down, but these do not!  I often drink my morning cup on the smallest brew size and then work my way up to bigger cups throughout the day as I need less caffeine.  Also, the Emeril's are great with the travel mug setting because they are strong enough that even with all that water it still taste's good.  I use a lot of creamer/splenda though so my taste buds are slightly biased.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the shipping and delivery of this from Amazon took way longer than I expected.  If you need coffee fast - this may not be the way to go, but if you can plan in advance the prices are worth it to order at Amazon (though the absolute best deal is a box of 80 K Cups at BJs).

review/summary: As only Emeril can do!
review/text: This coffee is as big and bold as Emeril himself.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites of all time with the Keurig, it makes a fantastic full bodied cup of coffee without the typical burnt or overly bitter taste normally associated with dark roasted coffees.<br /><br />When brewed an immediate wonderful coffee aroma will fill your kitchen and it develops a very light caramel colored froth that hugs the edge of your cup or mug.<br /><br />A major pick me up, Big Easy Bold holds up to the largest brew sizes and makes a delicious full flavor cup for travel mugs where ordinary K-cup coffees normally become watered down.<br /><br />Brew a small size, top with the froth of scalded milk and you will have the best cappuccino replica you ever tasted at home.<br /><br />Big Easy Bold is best to sit for a brief moment after brewing before adding sugar or another sweetener as the initial "bite" of the coffee quickly mellows into deep rich flavors. I found myself at first adding too much sugar and finding the coffee a tad too sweet a minute later as the flavors settled into one great cup of coffee.<br /><br />If you love rich, full bodied cups of coffee you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />If breakfast blends and watery medium roasts are boring you, kick your cup up a notch, give it a try and fall in love with your coffee again.

And I do like many of the bolder k-cups, such as Midnight Magic and Rainforest Espresso, but those are simply better coffees to me.  Maybe I'll give the Emeril's regular another chance, but it did not win me over the first time around.  As a side-note, I really like the Emeril's decaf--it is much more drinkable to me than the Emeril's regular.

review/summary: I like the coffee, not the new price
review/text: I've been buying this coffee via subscribe and save for a few years now. It's my husband's favorite! When my last shipment was sent (just a few days ago) , I noticed the price had gone up significantly and had I known this in advance, I would have canceled the order. I have since cancelled future shipments. I am disappointed in the extreme increase in price in comparison to other like products.I realize that coffee prices are on an upswing (again), but this was a little more than I can accept.

review/summary: One word - BITTER
review/text: Horrible coffee, terrible bitter taste and a lingering aftertaste that I can't even describe!  Tried a lot of brands of K-cups and none have ever been so bad.  It's in a class by itself.  I love strong coffee,  and I gave this brand a try.  Guess I'll try another, I'm turned off of Emeril.  No Bam, just bust!

review/summary: What's wrong with these K-cups?
review/text: My daughter got a sample of this coffee in her starter pack and raved about it so I bought a box.  The coffee tastes great but out of the five cups I've made so far, two broke open and spewed coffee grounds into my cup and made a real mess.  The one I'm drinking now.....I used a paper towel to try to remove quite a few grounds from the cup so I wouldn't have to throw out three cups of coffee.  This has never happened to me with any other K-cups.<br /><br />I'll stick with Green Mountain Double Black Diamond from now on.  It's great coffee without the mess.<br /><br />Hey Emeril, see what you can do to fix this problem.  I imagine you've lost more than one customer because of it.

review/summary: Emeril's Truck-stop Slag
review/text: Someone recently bought a Keurig to share at work and also bought a box of about 8 different coffees for it.  Most of them were pretty good.  There were decent tasting representatives spanning a nice range of roast.  Of the selection, only this one (Emeril's big easy bold) was truly unpalatable.

review/summary: A little unbalanced
review/text: I love good strong coffee. It's a combination on how it's roasted and the beans used. This coffee is just way too strong. It is unbalanced and though isn't bitter (which comes from weaker coffee) it is a tad over roasted and charred tasting. Instead of tasting toasty nuances you are stuck with a smack in the face. Though very good for that wake up coffee, it's not the coffee to have if you want to savor the rich and delicate nuances that many good coffees bring to the table.

review/summary: My new favourite for a nice bold morning brew
review/text: When using a drip coffee maker, I often slipped in an extra spoonful of grounds to make my morning coffee extra strong so that the milk would not dilute it too much.  After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's "Big Easy Bold").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one. If you're like me you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Nice bold K-Cup but left a weird after taste
review/text: This is a good choice for a K-Cup if you like a bold rich cup of coffee. I ordered this brand for 3-4 months because it  was the best tasting bold K-Cup I found.<br /><br />I am giving it three stars because the last few shipments were not that great. It left both me and my husband with a weird metallic taste after one cup.<br /><br />I ordered Martinson's bold K-Cups about a month ago and loved it! I probably will not buy this brand again.

review/summary: Pretty good if you don't get one with a defective seal
review/text: This coffee actually tastes pretty good for a darker roast however the number of defective K-cups with seal problems can be significant.  The issue is that the seal covering the Kcup, which gets punctured to enable the drip through, seems to continually burst open during brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in your mug and quite a mess of the machine.  My wife and I have started calling these "bursters" as it happens quite frequently with these Emeril's Kcups.  You can clearly hear it from far away when you get a burster and I think if you were to be doing something directly over the machine (such as putting dishes away in a cabinet above it) there is a possibility of getting in contact with some of the scalding hot steam from the sudden release of the pressure when the seal breaks open.  The seal bursts right at the final peak brewing time, probably at about the last 30% of the brewing process.  The result are a lot of coffee grounds in your mug and over the machine brewing area.<br /><br />I have been buying a lot of Kcups quite frequently in bulk that past few months.  I've tried many different types of Kcups and have purchased several hundred of each, I have never had this happen to any except the Emeril ones.  This is not just an isolated incident, there a significant number of defective ones in each of the 18 count boxes.  Usually if you get a box which has a burster you are going to get quite a few in there, probably around 5 at least.<br /><br />Wherever these specific Kcups are being made, there is a clearly a problem in the manufacturing processing and quality controls checks.  I've also seen a few cases where I have gotten a Kcup that has 2 seals pressed onto it thus resulting in a broken seal right out of the box.<br /><br />The coffee actually tastes pretty good, I really like darker roasts and this is one of my favorite ones however the quality control needs to be significantly improved.  If I was paying full retail for these I would be pretty annoyed, I think I've paid full retail for these once at a premium supermarket and sure enough there were a couple bursters in that box so it is not an issue with the bulk purchases or anything like that.  As I said I've bought hundreds of other brands in bulk and have had no issues yet.

review/text: I purchased this product for my husband who loves very bold coffee.  Each time we have made the coffee in our Keurig it explodes all over.  (Clearly after the third try I have now thrown the rest away) We were lucky to always be away from the coffee maker, but if you were standing there it would have burned you.  All the other types off coffee that we have used and continue to use work perfectly, so I know that the Emeril coffee was the problem.  If you have kids keep them away from the coffee maker.

review/text: We got this flavor because it was A)on sale and B)Emerils- it should be tasty, right? WRONG. I won't go on and on about how much I dislike it, and it's all personal taste, but I like strong coffee and this is strong...in the wrong way. It tastes like burnt cigarettes smell. Like cigarette butts. And its aroma matches, making this non-smoker's house smell like a lounge. It is thick as tar and even if diluted with water, still retains a burnt ash taste that coats the inside of my mouth. We have had a 12 pack for over 6 months...the last two are going in the garbage, like tossing away a dollar bill. I'll stick to Dark Magic for a nice strong coffee. But, if you like that smokey flavor, this may be good for you. I personally feel like I licked an ashtray and have to brush my teeth after every sip. Blech!...maybe I did go on and on about how much I didn't like it. Oh well, don't say I didn't warn you!
