review/summary: Underneath the MANGO tree...
review/text: Me HONEY and me make boolooloop soon... :)<br /><br />I actually sampled the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3V880">Fischer & Wieser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce, 21-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> but the contents are exactly the same, only the bottle size is different.<br /><br />And it just happens that Mango puree is the main ingredient in the Habanero sauce, followed closely by Honey - so think REAL SWEET. And apple sauce, ginger, some vinegar, sugar, spices and, of course, Habanero peppers. No preservatives whatsoever.<br /><br />I don't know why, I expected a super-hot mixture, something likely to burn a hole in my stomach if swallowed but, as it happens to be the case with the other Fischer & Wieser sauce I sampled, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3Q0QK">Fischer & Wieser Razzpotle Roasted Raspberry Chipotle Sauce, 20-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>, this one too is a well-balanced - it means NOT HOT - concoction that discretely but effectively enhances the taste of whatever it may be added to. My uses so far, and the Habanero met and exceeded expectations: an Egyptian omelette (don't ask how or why), lamb chops, salmon.<br /><br />When used as directed, the Habanero sauce will tilt any dinner toward the mysterious, the flavorful, the exotic.<br /><br />P.S. - it's a 5-star ONLY if you don't mind 'sweet' in a hot sauce.

review/text: I recently bought this basmati rice through Amazon. I was searching for Tilda brand basmati rice. I typed "Tilda basmati rice" as my search query. I found this rice in the search results. I ordered it thinking that it is the Tilda Brand. I was disappointed when i arrived and found that it is another brand. This rice is actually good in cooking. Their service was good. I receieved it in 3 days. My only disappointment was it was not the brand that i was searching for

review/summary: Pill Pockets are a life saver - REALLY!!!
review/text: My cat has CRF and suffers from heartburn/acid indigestion as a result and has no desire to eat while symptomatic. (He lost 7 pounds, and I was desperate to help him.)  My vet suggested that I try giving him an antacid and advised that I use the Greenies Pill Pockets.  I took his advise; what a difference a pill makes!!! I would never have guessed this would work, but it has, and my cat is happy to eat again and is holding his weight. I may not have my cat forever, but as long as he is alive I will provide him with whatever he needs to keep him happy and comfortable.

MUCH more reasonable from Amazon than at pet specialty stores, even the big ones.  If I know a pill has a really bad taste, I'll break the tab and the Pocket so the cat won't even try to chew them.  I hope we don't have to use them often...I hope my cats stay healthy...but having these around sure makes pilling a lot easier.  We love them!  They came quickly in the mail and were well-packed.

review/summary: changed my rating..now it's "not so much delish"
review/text: well, I loved the stuff.  I really did.  I made pot after pot, day in day out and I was convinced this was the best coffee around.  But the quality has veeeeeeeeeeery verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry slowly been changing.  Its good coffee, don't get me wrong.  But it's no longer superior coffee.  It has that awful back taste that lesser blends or not so fresh beans have...an ugly bite.  No amount of french roasting will cover the fact that a bad bean is a bad bean.<br /><br />I can't say it's all bad.  It's just not superior.  I hung in there for a while, even mixing it with an expresso bean to ramp it up.  But all I see is that it makes the other coffee taste weak and bitter.  So the search is on again.<br /><br />________________previous revue________________<br />it's got everything:<br />rich roasted bean aroma before it's ground.<br />freshness<br />perfect oil balance (the beans SHINE like little patent leather shoes)<br />perfect acid balance<br />a touch of chocolate like flavor<br />winey<br /><br />fantastic coffee. Now I'm spoiled rotten.  Had to make do with a lesser (although I used to think the lesser was good coffee but now  pftt!) when I ran out, became miserable and surly without my morning perfect cup.  and this IS the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />if you're a coffee person, get yourself a coffee maker that grinds too, because no point in pregrinding and wrecking the perfection.  if you're gonna do it, do it right.

review/text: For price I'd give it 10 stars at 6.25/# for organic coffee. This batch expires 12/11, so plenty of time to use it up if you want to stock up on this current bargain. As for flavor-it's a mild version of the typical french roast minus the overly burnt taste. The beans are fresh smelling and glisten. If you are a Starbucks fan I doubt you will like this coffee as it will be too mild unless you use double or triple the amount of beans. I plan on trying other flavors of this brand since the quality and price-point are an incredible value.

Although Kicking Horse Kick Ass Dark and 454 Horsepower are as good, the price has gone up so it is no longer a deal. Hey,I like what I like.

review/summary: Downgraded my rating also - now it's totally poor quality
review/text: I'm really disappointed in the decline in quality of this coffee. Camerons coffee remains inexpensive, but the flavor has continued to go downhill.  It's no longer mild and tasty.  They got the bitterness down (for those who missed it) and that is all.  It is bitter and weak. I add more and more coffee, but it has no nice flavor.  In addition, before I wrote that it didn't make me sick the way some non-organic French Roast coffee does. But I had horrible indigestion after one cup.  I buy Melita at the supermarket sometimes (non-organic) and this does not happen when I drink one cup.  The flavor of whatever this now is - is terrible unless you make it VERY strong PLUS add another kind of coffee to cut it. The package I just received is not very drinkable when brewed without another type of coffee added to it.  To illustrate this point - I once added Green Mountain (supermarket brand) Decaf to it and it tasted BETTER with decaf added to it. I have canceled my order. This was a bait and switch, I fear.<br /><br />Here is my previous review from when I first ordered this coffee a year ago:<br /><br />Great coffee for a very decent price!  I agree with several other reviewers that it is much milder than most French roast.  But I think it tastes better than almost all the coffee I've tried.  It's on a par with some $25 stuff my father bought in Italy! I have problems with digesting coffee sometimes, and haven't had any problems with this brand so far.  I recommend it.  However, I just got a new bag so I'm going to check out allegations that the quality is going downhill.

review/text: My son is a health fanatic. He only eats things that are good for him, not things that taste good.  So when he started drinking coffee I was shocked - -but he tells me that coffee is good for your brain, it is just all the pesticides and fungicides that are added to most coffee that is not healthful.  So you always want your coffee organic.  And CostCo only carries organic coffee sporadically, if at all.  Thus we have to buy it on Amazon.  I tried several of Amazon's organic coffee offerings  - -and this one is the best for the price.  We buy it regularly on "ship and save" service for an additional discount.  It has a clean flavor, not at all muddy/murky.

I am a long time lover of unflavored coffee, first I just by chance tried organic/fair trade from the store and found that the taste is very much preferable to the non-organic of the same flavor.  I then found "Coffee Fool" online and found the most delicious coffee choices available anywhere, organic or course....once my budget caught up with me I started buying the organic coffee at Walmart, also very good and better priced than the grocery store.  For about the same price as the Walmart coffee though, I do believe I like this better and so of course once you add the benefit of fast easy shipping, this is the clear winner for my coffee choice!

review/text: The first impression I had of this coffee was "weak". I used the same amount of coffee I always use. The next pot I used about 25% more coffee and it was better but still weak. I used even more the next time and although it was strong enough it just didn't have the full, bold richness I was expecting after reading the other reviews. I like a dark coffee, not bitter but almost and this isn't it. It's very smooth and subtle which I do not consider good qualities in coffee. Additionally, the beans were irregular in color, some quite dark and others light. They were also very hollow and brittle, not firm at all. This is an inferior coffee in my opinion.

review/summary: Partial proof against an acid bitter aura
review/text: I have NEVER brewed what I could consider a cup of coffee which tastes as good as fresh roasted beans smell. Even this coffee didn't get all the way around that several lifetimes curse. HOWever, I can say with at least some confidence that these beans are worthy of the praise in reviews.<br /><br />One thing I notice about coffee when it's truly based from a good bean processed with care: It tastes good lukewarm and cool as well as it does hot. Normally I can't stand coffee unless it remains in the hot range. In the case of Cameron's ebony, oily, glossy beans, the coffee I brewed tastes almost better cool than it does hot.<br /><br />I'm in the early phases of stocking my cupboards with certified organic foods, so this is the first of this type of treasured coffee I've purchased. I am absolutely ecstatic to have an organic coffee which even my acid aura can't pH down to bitter, LOL. Just to have quality gourmet organic coffee beans, whoa!<br /><br />I'm almost beginning to feel blessed again.<br /><br />The rest of this review, below, was originally posted as a comment under John Magnotti's thought provoking review [he exposes an endearingly realistic "coffee snob"]:<br /><br />Very much enjoyed your clearly stated realism. Interesting observation about ORGANIC bigger than the roast type, and relating it to [attempts to focus] audience.  I had noticed that [priority] subliminally, but not clearly until you noted it.<br /><br />I'm clinging by fingernails in that audience at the moment, though years ago I would have been looking for flavor markers first and only. Now, if it's not organic, I'm crossing forefingers from each hand, warding off a plague or a curse. Been too sick for too long; I'm also crossing fingers in the other way, on one hand, in hopes that the availability will continue for viable, economical, flavorful organic foods.<br /><br />I came to a point not long ago when I was seriously concerned I wouldn't be able to eat anything at all again, due to soy products everywhere, in everything. An intolerance to soy and its accompanying trains of GMO's and toxins can be terrifying in addition to deadly serious.<br /><br />Thankfully increasing magnesium input is helping keep excess toxic intake rapidly "moving OUT" so I can again eat foods from grocery stores and restaurants. But, I'm increasing my stock of ORGANIC from Amazon, to give me a core of sanity, health, and strength for my body to work from. A core of that is all I think I'll need, but it's not quite solid enough yet.<br /><br />IMO, we all have different taste needs, unique genetic structures, and dynamic chemical balances... different "constitutions"...<br /><br />Believing that, and believing in free choice, I don't have any desire to limit other peoples' preferences from the marketplace... I just hope to have access to adequate products for my needs to keep me alive and healthy enough to appreciate that state of being... if I'm even right in what I discern my needs to be.<br /><br />Still here but on shaky ground(s),<br />Linda Shelnutt

I like stronger coffees but not those that have a "burnt" taste.  The Cameron's organic french roast has a full bodied flavor that most coffee lovers should enjoy, without the bitterness or burnt taste that you get with some darker french roasts.  While everyone's taste is different, if you are a coffee lover, it's certainly worth a try, especially when you consider the 32 ounces of beans you get at what I think is a very modest price.

For the price of this coffee, it is above average in quality.  Is it perfect to the coffee aficionado- probably not.  I've been buying Cameron's coffee online for over a year now and am very satisfied.  It is a bargain in my opinion compared to buying a daily cup at the coffee shop or paying for it by the pound at the niche store or in the supermarket.

review/summary: Perfect Cup of Coffee
review/text: First off, I want to thank all the reviewers for the Cameron's Organic French Roast Coffee. Without your reviews, I would never have made the purchase and boy was I glad to take the advice! Prior to this and like many others out there, I had no idea who or what Camron's brand is or even that they had a coffee product.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, I can literally say that this is the best cup of coffee I've ever had in my life. Prior to this, I was drinking on Eight 0' Clock Colombian and I thought that was awesome as well but this french roast beats it by miles. There is just so much flavor in the coffee and one of the reason why I was hesitant on purchasing a french roast is due to it being stronger and bolder than say, a lighter roast. In my mind, this usually means more bitterness. Well, I'm wrong. Cameron's french roast is not bitter at all. I've dried darker coffees in the past where even after adding my usual amount of cream and sugar, they were still bitter. With this french roast, every sip tastes like what I think coffee should taste like. Describing coffee taste is pretty hard in my opinion though. So if you're reading this, trust my review and the many others on here on this coffee. It's really good!

review/summary: Deliciously, Bold tasting coffee
review/text: This coffee is absolutely delicious. Once you open the bag, the rich, dark roasted smell is noticeable. It is nice and oily. The flavor lasts on your tastebuds unlike some dark roasted coffee that has some taste at the beginning but quickly evaporates. I would highly recommend this coffee.

review/summary: A good tasting cup of coffee at an affordable price
review/text: I have purchased this coffee several times and have always been pleased. Always fresh, today I received 2 packages (4 lbs total) that had an expiration date of 3/29/12, almost a full year away although I go thru about a pound of coffee a week it won't last that long.<br /><br />Not only is this a good coffee for drip brewers I use it for re-filling my K-cups. Ground in a burr mill grinder to the espresso setting I find the taste similar to many of the pre-packaged "extra bold" k-cups. The K-caps that I bought have more than paid for themselves by allowing me to reuse the actual k-cups themselves as opposed to the solo-fill cup which has no filter and also allows coffee to drip from the side and not just the bottom as in a k-cup.<br /><br />The taste is noticeable, but not bitter.<br /><br />If you "cold brew" coffee as I do for iced coffee this is an excellent choice, flavorful but not bitter or overly roasty tasting. Very enjoyable to me over ice with some soy milk.<br /><br />Time to make the coffee.<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />brett

review/summary: good mellow coffee
review/text: I'm not a coffee connoisseur. I tend to add a lot of milk and sugar to most cups of coffee to compensate for what seems to me to be bitter or too strong. These coffee beans make a good, dark cup of coffee without needing a lot of sweetener or cream to mellow it out. They came fresh and stayed that way, in the same bag they came in on the counter, for over two weeks. Good product, good price!

review/summary: Love this coffee
review/text: I've tried many different brands of coffee, including the overpriced Allegro brand at Whole Foods, the overrated Intelligentsia Black Cat on Amazon, and beans from local coffee shops.  Cameron's is the brand that I have been most satisfied with.  I've tried Cameron's Gold Cup, which is good, but their French Roast is the best.  Its always smooth, robust and never bitter, no matter what method I use to brew it, French press, espresso machine, or Moka pot. I drink a lot of coffee but this 32 ounce bag still lasts a month.  You won't find coffee this good for this low of a price anywhere else.

review/summary: Organic but Average at best.
review/text: Camerons Organic French Roast had such good reviews that I had to try it.  I knew that it was going to be a disappointment when I first opened the bag and took a big sniff and wasn't hit by a strong coffee-ish aroma.  I am not an "Organic" seeker, I just like a good cup of coffee at a reasonable price.  This coffee is just "ok" but not even as good as your basic cup of Folgers.  Unless you truly prefer "Organic" products, you should skip this average coffee.

review/summary: Fair aroma and flavor. Not particularly fresh.
review/text: I usually only buy freshly roasted beans from various online stores, but bought these on a whim while ordering some other stuff from Amazon.<br /><br />When I received the beans, I was immediately disappointed with the bag which did not appear to be vacuum sealed very tightly. The date on the bag indicated something to the effect of "Sell by 6/23/2013" which tells me that these beans were probably roasted in June of 2012; it's now September, which means these beans have been sitting in the bag for 2+ months with a less-than-ideal seal. Not good!<br /><br />When I opened the bag and took a "whiff", the beans smelled okay but definitely didn't have that rich chocolaty aroma that I'm used to with freshly roasted beans. The beans all have an even dark appearance with a mild oil sheen; no burned charcoal in this bag, which is good!<br /><br />I had my first cup this morning and was less than thrilled with the brewing aroma; it again lacked the richness that I'm used to with my other blends. The flavor can be described in the same way; it's not bad at all, but not particularly outstanding. Compared to the "established" household name brand beans that you can pick up in any grocery store, Cameron's Organic French Roast is a definite step up in flavor but it just can't compete with the roasted-to-order boutique blends.<br /><br />If you can manage to get these beans freshly roasted and in a tight vacuum sealed bag (where so much air has been sucked out that the beans all leave impressions in the side of the bag), this may very well be an excellent coffee. As it was shipped to me... it's only Fair.<br /><br /> Edit (06-Sep-2012): Spelling corrections. I must have been half asleep when I typed this! Need... more... coffee... !! It's  worth noting that I ground up the entire bag and brought it to my workplace for my coworkers to use in the office coffee maker; they are accustomed to drinking long oxidized grocery-store purchased name-brand coffee (which I refer to as "butt-blend"). Cameron's is a real treat for their defiled palates!

review/summary: A Coffee Snob buys this
review/text: Since coffee is one of the most highly "pesticided" crops out there, we searched for an organic, whole bean coffee. We are sticking with this one. Excellent flavor.  We prefer whole bean because the oils in coffee go rancid once it is ground. We only grind enough for the week and store it in the refrigerator. We have not been disappointed with this product in the least bit. And one of us is a "coffee snob."

review/summary: Great Coffee, Beware price has increased!!
review/text: This was my go to coffee for the last year.  It is for the most part very fresh (oily shiny beans) I have only received 1 bag that was not fresh and 1 bag that looked like it was accidentaley cut open with a box cutter.  However I just recently cancelled my S&S on this item as the price has steadily increased over the last year.  I can get a better deal at my local Costco (2 lbs for $13.00) on decent coffee.  If Amazon is able to get the price down I will be back and will resubscribe.  It's just really unfortunate that the price has increased so much :(  Overall my rating is on the coffee itself and not on the price.  So if your in the market for a delicious well balanced coffee that's organic - I highly recommend Cameron's.

review/text: I have tried several French Roasts from Amazon, but this is now my #1; which I order via Subscribe & Save. This is the first organic coffee that I've bought in bulk (vs. by the cup). It is full of flavor; not overdone w/a burnt or bitter taste. Also, quite smooth w/o being too acidic & still maintains its flavor after sitting an hour+ on hot plate.  It's a great price compared to other organics & the package easily lasts a month if two people drink 6 cups/day. If you're skeptical that organic doesn't give you more for your money...this will make you a convert!

I grind fresh, place in filters with a Melita cone. I subscribed for a few months and was able to speed up or slow down delivery to my needs with the click of a mouse. I decided to try the Cameron's, "Intense French," and it's equally delicious, but different. As the name implies it's Intense. I've only had it for a few days and will finish the 2 pound bag and see what my taste buds tell me. Either way, I'm a happy coffee drinker thanks to the Amazon community that raved about Cameron's and piqued my interest enough to give it a try.

For the price we'd rather go with another roast such as some of the independent blends available online on Amazon.

review/text: This is good coffee, and a very reasonable price. My standard is Starbuck's Extra Bold Dark French Roast. By comparison, I do find the Cameron to be lacking some of the "punch"; it's less bold and more acidic, which I do not prefer. However, it's better (livelier) than Starbuck's organic coffee, and I find a happy medium mixing the Cameron about half-and-half or less with my Starbucks French Roast.

review/summary: A Fantastically Rich and Dark Bean.  Smooth and Silky Every Time.
review/text: With the high price of coffee beans these days, and me being an avid coffee drinker, I thought I would take the opportunity to try out some different beans here on Amazon.  I had been an Eight'O Clock Coffee drinker over the last few years, but in addition to their prices starting to rise, I've noticed that the quality of their bean has gone down over the last year.  With that - enter Cameron's Organic French Roast Whole Bean Coffee!  I had never heard of Cameron's before, but am I ever glad that I purchased it - I now have a new coffee for home!<br /><br />Cameron's delivers a high quality French Roast bean.  When you open the bag, you immediately know you are in for a treat.  In addition to the rich smell, the beans are very dark and moist.  You can tell they were roasted perfectly.  They grind into espresso roast nicely with a good grinder.  Finally, they come through the brew in an amazing blend of smooth and silky textures. The taste matches and surpasses the rich smell.  It is bold and impressive.  It will make your mornings so much happier.  Highly recommended!

review/text: I love good coffee beans.  I've been drinking this coffee for several months.  My favorite way is to grind it with milder coffee because otherwise it is a little bit bitter.  But for the price, you can't go wrong.  Another plus is that it's organic.

review/summary: another satisfied customer
review/text: I just ordered another two bags of this wonderful coffee.  I only have a couple cups of coffee a day so I want it to be great stuff. I've found this to be a worthy everyday coffee.  I tried another brand through amazon before and it was okay but had an unusual taste for a french roast although I wouldn't describe it as terrible, just different.  I think everyone has an individual taste distinction and cameron's organic french has definitely found a favorable spot in my taste buds.  I may experiment with other coffees from time to time but I've got a feeling that this will end up being my regular brew. The price of bulk coffee at my local grocery store has hit $12/lb so at about $7.50/lb this is an unbelievable buy. Of course I buy at least 2 bags at a time to take advantage of the Super Saver free shipping.

review/text: I like a robust dark French roast coffee and organic is important to me.  I thought that I would switch to Cameron's brand to save a few dollars, but found the brew to be too light for me.  I upped the amount of coffee per pot by 20% and still was not satisfied with the taste.  I have switched back to Cafe Altria for the robust coffee flavor I crave.  If you like a middle of the road flavor, then Cameron's should be OK for you.

review/summary: We Love This Product!
review/text: I use this product a lot, especially on grilled steaks.  I have learned to use it as part of a rub on my steaks.  I'll share what I do.<br /><br />First I marinate the steaks for 30 minutes in a vacuum Foodsaver container, but a zip lock bag for 60-90 minutes would work.  (The vacuum opens the pores of the meat and lets the marinade better permeate the meat.)  Then I pat both sides dry and then add ground sea salt, ground black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and then I liberally sprinkle Emeril's Southwest Essence and then hand pat them all into the meat so they all adhere to the meat.  Then I turn the steaks and do it again.<br /><br />My Weber gas grill will always get to at least 600 degrees, and in the summer in Phoenix I oftern get over 650 degrees.  With a clean grill I simply place the steaks and close the cover.  I grill my steaks based solely on time.  Depending on the thickness it will be anywhere from 3-5 minutes per side, usually 3-3.5 minutes.  I open the grill, flip the steaks and close the cover again.  The flip side is usually 30 seconds less than the first side and once the timer goes off I remover the steaks and let them rest.  If I am grilling asparagus I grill them now while the steaks are resting for a total time of +/- 4 minutes.<br /><br />By the time I get back to the kitchen the steaks will be rested and will be medium rare.<br /><br />Like I said, the Emeril's spice is perfect for us on this meal and since we do steaks at least once a week in summer, we use this product a lot.

review/text: I honestly love the flavor of this spice.  I have a chicken salad recipe that I use this with and it's hard to not eat all the chicken salad by myself.  I do not like chicken salad but I went to a party that had little chicken salad cracker sandwiches and the person used some southwestern flavored spice mixed in with other ingredients.  When I went shopping this was the only spice I could find that said Southwestern.  The first time I used it I realized that the sandwiches tasted better with this seasoning than the other little cracker appetizers I had.  I have used this seasoning now for 6 years and would not use any other.  It's very hard to find at the grocery stores now so, when I found that I could purchase this item at Amazon I did.

review/summary: Poorly packaged in very thin bags
review/text: I ordered a 40-pack of KTC's Creamed Coconut. However, it was an unpleasant surprise when I opened the package and removed the shrink-wrap around the 40 single boxes of creamed coconut: almost all of them were oily - some looked as they were submerged in oil.<br /><br />Ok, mishaps can happen, I said to me. I contacted customer service and told about the problem. I received a replacement. Unfortunately, the same problem, yet worse. Now practically all of the 40 7-oz. or 200 gram boxes were oily.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I opened a box and saw that the coconut cream was placed in a very thin bag. At first glance, I couldn't figure out where it leaked. Yet, when I pressed gently the bag began leaking out from tiny holes. The longer I held the bag the more the creamed coconut warmed up and the more it leaked. How can someone dare to sell creamed coconut in such crappy bags?!<br /><br />Once again, I contacted customer service,yet this time for a refund!<br /><br />Avoid KTC creamed coconut! Instead, buy Let's Do Organic's Coconut cream. It costs slightly more but it is organic and has a good taste and IT IS WELL PACKAGED. I just pay $12.70 for 6 7-oz boxes of Let's Do Organic Coconut Cream with Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save' offer.

They arrived packaged in a plastic jug with a label indicating they are a product of Madagascar, but nothing about their being organic.  When I pay extra for an "organic" product, I expect something to validate that claim.  If they are actually organic, they are obviously not certified organic, so we are just supposed to take their word for it, I guess.

review/text: I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and very pleased with how quickly Beauty Spa and Concepts, Inc. got my order to me. I placed the order for the vanilla beans on a Friday afternoon and received them in the mail on the following Monday morning.<br /><br />The size, smell, quality and quantity of the vanilla beans in the container is wonderful and the price fantastic. I would recommend BSCI to others and will most likely be using them again.<br /><br />The only way I can see them making their already great products and services even better would be to include tips for use and storage of the product in the delivered packages.<br /><br />Thank you for your excellence.

review/text: The aroma is wonderful.  It came in a large plastic spice container.  I've already started making my vanilla extract with it.  They shipped fast and I received it fast.

review/summary: Purest white sea salt ever
review/text: Palm Island Premium white sea salt looks and taste pure. I serve it on my dinner table when guests are over, because it tastes as good as it looks.  Use it when cooking pasta or potatoes, too.  Great stuff from the Islands!
