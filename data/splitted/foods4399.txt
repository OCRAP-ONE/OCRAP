review/summary: Middle-of-the-road extract sauce
review/text: I'm a hot sauce junkie and have eaten many bottles of Dave's and other sauces. I rate Dave's Ultimate Insanity an average.<br /><br />It has an unnatural bitter "cayenne-on-overdrive" flavor that is usually only found in hotter sauces. I find it's hard to use in cooking as that flavor is as unavoidable as the sauce's heat is. Though the primary ingredient is habanero peppers that pepper's flavor is needlessly absent. That's too bad.<br /><br />There are sauces at equal heat that have more diverse and interesting flavor, and this does include some of Dave's stable, for example his Naga Jolokia sauce. And as I said, there's also hotter sauces out there, although most of these taste similar to Ultimate Insanity.<br /><br />Warning: this is an extract sauce, and it'll do a number on an empty stomach. High-fat dairy is a good cure.

review/summary: Another chemical experiment
review/text: This is another chemistry product which has little to do with real food.  Hot...yes.  Good?  Well if hot is all there is then this is hot.  Food?  Not really.  Fine food is made directly from food and not the result of "chemistry."  Flavor?  Not much of any kind other than hot sensation.  I am not fan of chemistry derived food products such as this or many other which are equally synthetic.  This is completely useless to anyone with a desire for other than a hot "free based" oil lacking the subtleties of real food with a vast array of odors and taste which only real food has.  Hotter sensations can be purchased directly from a chemical supplier without all the bother of pretending a product of chemistry is also a food.

review/summary: Extremely Disappointed
review/text: I love spicy food, and I add hot sauce to almost everything I eat, but this hot sauce a completely disappointment.<br /><br />The name itself is b...s..., I have tasted more spicy hot sauce than this.<br /><br />Just for anyone interested, the main ingredients as indicated on the bottle are: red habaneros, hot pepper extract, red chiles. However, all I tasted was black pepper, not even a hint of habaneros. It's 2nd worst hot sauce for me (Tabasco is #1 because it is a SOUR sauce, nothing hot about it), because it reminded me of the cheap instant noodle soup bowl (black pepper beef flavor noodle soup) that I used to eat when I was a child.<br /><br />No taste, no flavor, and no aroma. No tonge numbing, no throat burning, and no stomach twisting. Just plain dull heat and cheap taste.<br /><br />Well, money well wasted. By the way, I used 6 drops on my one bowl of steam rice, and the heat didn't even last 5 minutes.<br /><br />The bottome line is:<br />This is NOT a hot sauce for spicy food lover. A good hot sauce makes food tasty with aroma and flavor, this one doesn't.<br /><br />It's like I can make the sweetest cake for you by loading it with tons of sugars, is it sweet? Of course, but is it a good tasty cake? You tell me.

review/text: For a few dollars more, you can get larger pig ears elsewhere. See my other review.<br />The dogs did like these and they were packed in a bag in a box which is a plus. The problem was there were about 25% smaller ears 1/2 the size of the largest ones.<br /><br />They aren't bad, but I spent $7 more to get a much better product size wise from a different vendor and it was worth it as there were only a few smaller ones in that order.

review/summary: No more like lemon zest than wood shavings
review/text: This product is NOT lemon zest.  Bears no resemblance to lemon zest - does not look like lemon zest, does not smell like lemon zest, nor does it taste like lemon zest.  In fact the label says 'Contains granules of dehydrated lemon peel'.  The picture of lush, juicy lemons is hugely misleading and if I was able to give this product no stars, I would.  I thought I would give it a try, but the consistency of the rehydrated whatever it is was mushy, tasteless and without smell.  I did not risk putting it in my ginger cookies and had to make a quick trip to the store to get some real lemons.  Don't waste your money as I did.

review/summary: Got lemons .... make toothpaste?
review/text: I use lemon zest for cooking, when I don't make my own. It is great in Mediterranean dishes.<br />I decided to get this for a new toothpaste recipe I picked up. Yeah, that sounds strange, but if you make your own toothpaste you don't have to worry about how much fluoride you are getting in it, and it is probably one-eighth the cost of commercially prepared products.<br />I decided if I was getting fluoride in tap water, I didn't need it in my toothpaste also. And now I am not sure I need it at all. It sure didn't seem to prevent cavities for me. So, since I can't find non-fluoridated toothpaste under $6 a tube at the store, I am going to be going for the Zesty life. Their orange zest is great also!

review/summary: Naturally-flavored AND sugar-free? Naturally!
review/text: For those seeking sugar-free products without all of the chemical sweeteners like aspartame, this sugar-free Maple Praline Syrup from Blackberry Patch is a natural solution. A rich praline pecan flavor with hints of vanilla, this syrup is sweet and delicious without being cloying. The thick, slow pouring syrup offers a nice mouthfeel similar to that of "regular" pancake syrup, a nice switch from the watery, too-thin textures of some sugar-free products.<br /><br />A special bonus is the natural flavoring--no off tastes, no strange chemicals!<br /><br />It's important to note that the sweetener here is maltitol, a "sugar alcohol" that can, for some, create gastrointestinal discomfort in large amounts (20-30 grams/day). I don't have this experience (perhaps because I don't consume such large amounts), and I appreciate that maltitol is not carcinogenic... A little online research from credible sources may be useful if you're concerned about this issue.<br /><br />Blackberry Patch makes a number of delicious naturally-flavored sugar-free syrups; this one is my personal favorite. Experiment and find your own favorite!

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/summary: YUMMY but Expensive!
review/text: OK, I have to admit these are REALLY yummy, and they don't have anything really yucky in them.  As a vegetarian family finding fruit snacks without gelatin (bovine source) is a tough job.  And finding them without any HFCS, artificial flavors, and artificial colors is even harder.  So, as far as taste and quality go these are great.<br /><br />However, they're REALLY EXPENSIVE!  My 4 year old could easily eat a box a day if I'd let him, and so could I truth be told.  At over $4 a box, that's pretty pricey for a quick snack that doesn't offer up any real nutrition. I know quality ingredients cost more, but jeez.  Maybe if they offered a bulk pack or something, reducing the price AND the packaging, it would bring down the cost a bit.

review/text: This snack was an accidental find for us.  Now both my husband and I are as addicted to it as my three year old daughter is.  Most kids love gummy bears but they are filled with sugar, have no vitamins in them, and are made with gelatin, a no-no for a vegetarian.  This snack is a great substitute: low sugar, loaded with vitamin C (good for immunity), and no gelatin. And it tastes good!  When you want something different but you don't know exactly what you want, instead of going for something fatty, go for this snack and you (and your kids) will feel satisfied. We like the "tropical treat" flavor better than the red one (forgot what that flavor was called).  I highly recommend this product to families with kids.

review/summary: Best fruit snacks we've found!
review/text: The flavors of these little bunny-shaped fruit snacks are quite strong, yet natural tasting.  The "tropical treat" packs include a mixture of orange, mango-peach, and tropical punch.  They are all good, but the mango-peach is AMAZING!<br /><br />Annie's has even managed to pull off kid-pleasing, bright colors - including true red - without using artificial colors. These little gems get their color from natural sources, like carrot juice concentrate, though your children will never know the difference.  The texture is a little different (softer) than other fruit snacks or gummies, but I have never known a kid or adult who didn't like them.<br /><br />A few more thoughts about the cost and packaging... the packets are small, but they each contain at least 25 fruit snacks - more than twice as many as in the little packets of "junky" ones at the grocery store.  They still come out at well under $1 per pack, with each pack providing a full day's supply of vitamin C. I'd pay more than that for a quick snack from a vending machine or convenience store, and not feel nearly as satisifed (or as healthy!) after.<br /><br />We've solved the eat-the-whole-box temptation by making these "take along" snacks only.  That's what individually packaged snacks are for at our house, and these are reserved for lunch boxes, car trips, etc.  That way, the option to eat packet after packet just isn't there.<br /><br />I must say that I, for one, am thrilled that Annie's has put in the time and effort to make a healthy snack in cute, colorful, appealing individual wrappers.  While I know it is wasteful and drives up the overall cost of the product, the real truth is that is it hard to send a kid off to school with plain, boring organic food while all of their friends are packing the latest and greatest in kiddie fad food, complete with shiny wrappers, cartoon character packaging, and gimmicks galore.  Our kids reach a point where they are embarrassed by their own "uncool" snacks (box of raisins? yawn!) or so tempted by the junk that they become fixated on getting their hands on it somehow.<br /><br />Products like these fruit snacks let kids pack a snack with some "bells and whistles", clever packaging, etc.  They can be sent as soccer practice snacks, class party offerings, birthday party treats, etc., and are universally well-received. While we don't rely on them heavily at our house - fruits, veggies, and homemade snacks will always have a place here - it is good to have them available when needed!

review/summary: Yummy little bunnies
review/text: Wow, I am VERY impressed with these cute little gummy packages. I just purchased a pack of 4 based on reviews and recommendations. I am glad I did! Here's a situation for you...Imagine you are eating a gummy bear, you take a bite, you pull the gummy and "snap!" the gummy breaks like it's a piece of taffy. Sound familiar? With these little gummies, it is a completely different experience. They almost melt in your mouth. They are also USDA certified which is an even bigger plus. Thank you Annie's for another great product!

review/text: I stumbled across these at my local supermarket. I was hesitant to buy since it was $4.00 a box, but I'm always willing to pay a bit more for quality. I was so pleased with these! Of course my little ones love them, but so did I! They are a delicious gummy snack but taste more like real fruit juice rather than just.......sugar lol. And I love the texture as well. It doesn't stick to your teeth so much. I highly recommend these snacks for your kiddos or heck, even for you!!

review/text: I want to point out that these are definitely fruit snacks and not like gummy bears. I searched gummies and these came up, so I decided to try them. The flavor is really good, and I love that they're organic. They come in individual packs in each box, so they're easy to take with you. They make everyone super thirsty, though. Overall, I'd recommend them. Just be sure to have some water.

review/summary: Best olive oil ever
review/text: We just arrived from a wonderful week vacation in Spain (Madrid) where olive oil is the omnipresent king among the ingredients used in Spanish food. We were recommended by a friend who is also a Chef in an Spanish restaurant to taste one particular olive oil which he was very fond of: "Oro Bailen". Needless to say we fell in love immediately with this olive oil (do you believe in love at first sight?) very fruity and yet so intense in flavor. So much we liked it that upon my arrival in Houston we googled it and found that Amazon had it for sale. We also discovered that "Oro Bailen" had been awarded many international prizes, a fact that did not surprise us at all. A great buy for epicurean gastronomy.<br />Juan Francisco M.

review/text: Bought this exquisite olive oil through [...]. It is a must for that special touch on high end Spanish dishes. It has a velvety texture and a dark yellow color, almost like honey with a first press, single batch olive flavor that will enhance by far many spanish dishes, grilled meats, salads and cheeses. I have three types of olive oil in my kitchen, and Oro Bailen is the "strong" one that I keep as a precious jewel for that "special touch" needed. Your palate and your guests won't forget the moment.

I was a potato chip addict until I discovered these.  Now I can walk right past the potato chips.  With 10 grams of protein, 2 grams of fat, and only 140 calories per bag they are a home run.  A bag of these and an apple make the perfect breakfast on the run.

review/summary: Low Fat and Few Calories (HEALTHY SNACK); Great Taste
review/text: Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps are a healthy snack and I absolutely love them.  Trying to be health conscious and trying to avoid fats, I was looking for snacks that would satisfy both requirements.  I stumbled on these snacks at two (2) places: Dean's Natural Foods stores and Whole Foods.<br /><br />Be careful that you only select the Glenny's that say Low Fat on the label. Why? This is important if you are trying to cut fat out of your diet as well as calories.  There are no saturated fats nor any trans fats nor any cholesterol in the low fat Glennys.  There is only one gram of fat per serving.  And the calorie count is extremely low (only 70 calories per serving) versus for the regular Glennys over 110 to 120 calories per serving.<br /><br />The taste is great and for those who need a crunchy snack sometime during the day; this is a healthy alternative to potato chips or pop corn.  Two small servings which would only be 140 calories and 0 saturated fat would provide you with 10 grams of soy protein, 25 mg of soy isoflavones, 3 grams of dietary fiber and more soy protein than tofu or soy milk.<br /><br />Cosmopolitan Magazine quotes: "Even better than potato chips. Delicious."<br /><br />Additionally, each serving gives you 4% of your daily calcium requirement and 8% of your iron percent daily value. Each serving would be about 10 chips approximately.  I open the 3 ounce+ bag and separate the contents into ziplock bags (10 chips apiece) so that I can regulate the calories and the amount of fat in my snacks.<br /><br />What is nice for those who are afraid to buy a 3 ounce+ bag of anything.  Even if you succumbed to eating the entire 3 ounce+ bag: all would not be lost.  You would be getting 20 grams of protein, 50 mg or soy isoflavones, 6 grams of dietary fiber and 300 calories total in the whole bag.  The taste is great whether you purchase the low fat apple cinnamon, the white cheddar or the lightly salted, the low fat barbeque...all have a great taste.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this snack..a lot of crunch.<br /><br />Sample a bag.  I think you will be a fan after that.<br /><br />The 1.3 ounce bags (which are being offered on Amazon) are even better than the 3 ounce+ (85 gram) bags that I have been purchasing.  You have the bags already divided into individual snack portions with 24 bags in the pack.  Terrific!<br /><br />Bentley/October 2007

review/text: We used to purchase Glenny's Soy Crisps from Walgreens, but they no longer carry the product in the Walgreen stores where we shop. I was so excited to find these on Amazon! These are better (crunchier) than baked chips and are packed with protein. The product comes in several flavors. My top favorites are BBQ and lightly salted. The lightly salted is probably the healthiest because the sodium is lower, but it's enough salt to still taste good. One bag is 3 points on Weight Watchers Point Plus program.

review/text: I have always been a Glenny's fan and order this specific type of soy crisp very often. This shipment, however, contained bag after bag of soy crisps that were burnt. I had ordered 2 cases of the 1.3 oz size of the lightly salted and each bag I opened contained only browned soy crisps.  Their color was darker than what I usually buy and they all tasted burnt. The only positive of this experience was the vendor, WebVitamins.  They were very customer-friendly and gave a refund for the damaged product. I had tried contacting Glenny's directly, but they never responded.

review/text: I bought these since many people commented on how great they taste.  I think they are bland and need to be salted (even though there IS salt on them and I ALMOST NEVER add salt to my food).  I don't think they replace chips and  I don't know that I'll be able to eat the rest.  I certainly didn't think "these are yummy" as I tried them.  Also, each bag is 2 servings--I mistakenly thought each bag was 1 serving.  I will by Stacy's soy chips again before these---those are YUMMY--I never should have tried something new.

review/summary: Love this company, not really digging the flavor
review/text: It's was hard to star this review since taste is so subjective.  I ended up giving it four stars because I love the company and their Jambo! flavor so much.  The tea is high quality.  The cause is good (a portion of the profits goes to children orphaned by HIV/AIDS).<br /><br />That said, I really disliked this flavor.  The second I opened the package, the scent of cloves hit my nose, and the clove taste in the brewed tea was even stronger.  Not my thing!  The cloves totally smothered the cardamom, ginger and tea flavors.<br /><br />In short: Great company, but only buy this if you love cloves!<br /><br />Because the tea is small, you'll want a fine filter. I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G72D70">swissgold� TF 300 Tea Filter</a>.

review/summary: Good decaf but misleading marketing from Amazon
review/text: I have gone through about 40 cans of this decaf as it is my favorite decaf and the only one I'll buy. In fact, I chose my coffee machine based on the the vendor that had the best tasting decaf capsules or pods. However, I find Amazon's advertising to be somewhat misleading.<br /><br />Illy's website indicates the full retail price of this product is $22.00.  Amazon indicates the "list" price is $27.36, which reportedly equates to a 19% savings.  Generally people assume "list price" means the "full retail price," or MSRP, not the "full retail price plus 24%."  This can mislead people into thinking they are paying less than the manufacturer's retail price when they would be paying more than that.<br /><br />I may still switch to buying through Amazon versus through Illy because Illy doesn't provide a convenient way to change payment methods or recurring delivery quantities (currently, Illy forces you to wait in a queue to speak to a representative which would be okay if you enjoyed inefficiencies reminiscent of the '80s or enjoyed being hung up on after wating in queue for 10 minutes.) However, as a buyer, you should be informed that the Amazon Prime list price is higher than the retail price available elsewhere.

review/summary: illy iperespresso pods rock!
review/text: I really like these little iperespresso pods. They are so easy to use with none of the clean-up of my old machine. I bought the (Gaggia for illy) machine based on the fact that it uses these pods. The Francis Y1 is another good choice. All the favours are great, but Decaf is our house favorite. We have went through 3 tins in 2 weeks. The coffee is strong yet silky smooth with great crema. It tastes great as a latte with some steamed milk, or an iced Latte, over ice with a splash of milk. Don't be fooled into thinking these machines and the pod system doesn't work, they do work, and they really do make great espresso.

review/summary: pretty good flavor balance, nice chewy texture, could have more licorice flavor
review/text: I like these a lot.  They are only slightly salty, with a bit of molasses sweetness, all balanced against a mild licorice flavor.  They are medium-hard and very chewy, although they must be kept in an airtight container or they get too hard.  Personally I would prefer a stronger licorice flavor, but these are still among my favorites.<br /><br />Salty licorice is indeed a strange thing for those who haven't tried it before.  If you've never had it before, don't start with a case (like what's sold here).  And definitely stay away from Double Salt licorice until you've learned whether you like the saltiness.<br /><br />If you want black licorice but don't want the salty flavor, try "Haribo licorice wheels". Those have more licorice flavor than these coins, and less other flavor.  They're a bit sweet and a bit softer.<br /><br />Note that these coins also come in bags.  Buying them that way is slightly more cost-effective, but the tubs might be a little more airtight.

review/summary: This is good slightly salted licorice
review/text: First off, if you have never had dutch salted licorice, you may want to try it (if you can find it) before you buy this.<br />I fell in love with double salted licorice when I first tried it over 25 years ago.  Every time I let someone try it, they<br />would spit it out within 3 seconds.  Once I went to Amsterdam and loved it when I went into a candy store and saw dozens of<br />kinds of salted licorice in bulk to select from.<br /><br />Nowadays I get the single or slightly salted instead of double salt (DZ) as I can eat more of the single salt than the stronger double salted.<br /><br />So it comes down to, if you like salted licorice, you will love these slightly salty coins of goodness.<br /><br />If you don't, well then get something that you do like.<br /><br />Sean B. Halliday

review/summary: Not for sissies
review/text: If you like this stuff (like I do), you are in to real hard core licorice.  This is an excellent value.  If you are a red licorice fan, you will not like this product (read the title).  Don't worry about the so called "salt".  There is 0mg sodium.  The salt flavor comes from ammonium chloride.  That sounds really nasty, but I looked it up in Wikipedia.  No problems...it will not hurt you.  It is difficult to find double salt licorice, & when you do, it is quite expensive.  This is a good deal.  Besides this stuff, I buy Haribo Wheels, again, from Amazon in the 5lb. box.

review/summary: Good candy but too tough
review/text: These are much more palatable for the uninitiated than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETXO8M">Gustaf's Dutch Licorice, Double Salt</a>, the flavor is right in-between, neither too sweet nor too salty. However, I have to say I like the others better, the coins are much too chewy for my taste and don't really dissolve very well; little bits often get stuck in my teeth instead. Think of chewing a stale tootsie roll. I'm not sure if mine are getting stale or if they're just made that way, I don't think I'll order more for a while. I'd love to have a variant of these with a little bit stronger licorice flavor and less tough chewiness. Maybe I'll try the cats next.

review/summary: To "coin" a phrase...
review/text: While vacationing in Steamboat Springs in 2007, my husband and I stopped into Fuzziwigg's Candy Store. Since my husband likes licorice, but not knowing this particular brand, we bought only 5 licorice coins.  He loved them!  5 coins didn't go very far and I frantically wanted to get him some as a Christmas present.  Amazon, you're amazing!  Not only did he get 1 container of coins... he got 6!  He's in Heaven!  He has about 4 or 5 coins every night - and I'm watching the level of licorice so that he won't run out.  What a great product!

review/text: Although I like to consider myself open to 'cultural cuisine', I found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying about $6 for it at a international marketplace.  My significant other did the same.  I like salty stuff, and I love licorice, but this was just plain nasty.  Not only was it too salty, but it had a terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor that went up to my nose and made me wonder if perhaps the candy had been tampered with or manufactured incorrectly.  I went online and read some other reviews...other people have had similar experiences.  I guess it's one of those acquired tastes that has to be developed early.  Oh, those Dutch!! I love 'em (but hate this "candy")!

review/text: We have bought 2 packages of these that were fine. Last week I bought another package and the treats had a dark, burnt like color, and seemed very dry. I just assumed they had been over baked...but I should have listened to my instincts and not given them to my puppy. She had 2 treats and became very sick. Lethargic, vomiting, just looked damn pitiful. Had to see doctor, who gave her some medications by injection and advised us to take the treats away immediately, to which I did. She has since recovered, given NO more treats. I have emailed Blue Buffalo, no response. I have called them earlier today, no answer. I have now been on hold with them for 20 min...and still counting. This is VERY UPSETTING considering how they market their company as responsible and caring...and not to mention how much their products cost!<br />21 min....<br />I doubt I will ever get someone on the phone.<br /><br />JUST BEWARE of these treats before feeding them to your pet.

review/text: My dog loves these.  It's a nice size to keep her occupied for a few minutes (small dog). I like them a lot because they don't have that yucky beef jerky dog treat smell.  They smell like a baked, fruity cracker, depending on what flavor you buy. We regularly get the apple and banana, but I've seen in some stores all kinds of wild flavors.  Based on the ingredients I'm pretty sure I could eat them if I needed to.  Only complaint is coming from Amazon they were a little more crunched up than usual, but a better price than Petco.  Bag is resealable, although I put them into a jar as soon as I get them.

It is so simple to make, just add water, stir and cook on stove for 25 minutes.  It really tasted like something you might have spent hours on.  I was absolutely thrilled to find it here on Amazon.  Now it will be a staple in our cupboard at home.  oh, and that "specialty" store charged $8 per box!  I love Amazon, and their prices.

review/summary: What a DEAL!!
review/text: I played it safe and only ordered 2 bags because I was ordering other stuff, and now I'm kicking myself!  My husband got a bag with all his favorites in it, mostly chocolate, and I got what I swear was a 40 flavor blend! Love the odd little shapes, and can't wait to buy more!
