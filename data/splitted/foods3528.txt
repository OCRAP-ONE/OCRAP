review/summary: CAIRN TERRIER HEAVEN!
review/text: I recently purchased these bones for my 4 Cairn Terriers. All my dogs absolutely LOVE them ! Even the 11 year old enjoys chewing them and getting off a "little crunchy bit " . The one review stated that they are a little  " messy" . That is true as there are some loose pieces of grizzle  when you open the  plastic wrappr ( that itself is a GREAT feature to be INDIVIDUALLY  wrapped). How I have solved this problem is  that I wash each bone  under running water and then towel dry it before I give to the Cairns . That way there are no loose crumbs. The dogs  enjoy chewing these and it keeps them busy for a long time. When all the the crunchy tendons on the bones are gone , they still enjoy chewing at the  marrow. I have not yet seen any diarrhea or  even any large pieces  chewed off the bones.  They dont seem to splinter either. THUMBS UP for this  product !  They are all natural and  even my Male Cairn who has multiple allergies can enJOY  them!!

review/summary: Smokehouse lamb bonz
review/text: Dogs got them as an alternative to beef bones which they are allergic to.  They got right into them, but you must supervise as the knobby ends break off and they are about the size of a large marble so could cause some trouble.  I also noticed they splintered, so they were removed at that point. I like the idea, but the safety issue was a problem.

review/text: My dog doesn't like big bones. She barely chews them and then they lie around all yucky! These knee bones are a perfect size. She eats them all up. The fact that they're USA bones is a big selling point for me. I would NEVER give my dog foreign bones because I don't know if they are processed correctly to kill bacteria.

review/text: We have 2 Min-Pin mixed breed dogs that are 2x - 3x larger than normal min pins. Because of their size, normal treats are either too big or too small. These knee bones are perfect for them and we finally found something they won't power through in 10 minutes. These bones are a bit messy so we either give them to the dogs outside or on a blanket inside. They do have a smell when first being chewed but it goes away as the dogs work on them. We are very happy with these bones.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: These bones are just gross.  First of all, they are not wrapped tight enough to keep them fresh.  When you open them up, they just smell old.  They are dry and brittle and break just by touching them.  I gave one to my 2 year old lab and within seconds it was splintering.  I threw the entire pack away, along with the pack of smokehouse knuckles I bought at the same time.  GROSS. I would not recommend these.  Ask the meat man has way better quality products. Real bones for Real dogs, not this fake crap.  Don't buy!

review/summary: Popular at my house
review/text: I have given the knee cap bones to my 75 pound chocolate lab and 11 pound miniature dachshund for years. When we added a 5 pound miniature chihuahua to the mix I wondered if she could hold on to her bone with the larger and more savvy dogs in the house. No problem! She is quick and limber and gets to chew whichever bone she wants. She likes to get hold of a bone the older dogs have been chewing on because they have softened it up a bit. Then she chews it for all she's worth. The older dogs are indulgent with her, and she always leaves one nearby as a trade. I take the bones out of the mix when they get small enough the lab could choke on them. The little ones get put in the crate with the chihuahua when we go in the car. All my dogs have great teeth and I credit these bones. They never splinter, but the dogs can chew off smooth bits, which they eat. This brand of knee cap bones are huge and provide many hours of chewing enjoyment for my animals. I highly recommend them.

review/text: My 5 lb. Pomeranian was able to chew off the large knobby end of the bone, and then managed to chew off a a smaller 1" knuckle-shaped piece from somewhere (by this time I had already taken the larger knob end away from him), getting it stuck in his throat.  Luckily, he threw it up while we were rushing to the vet.  Even small/toy dogs who are big chewers should not be given this product.

review/summary: Do not buy!
review/text: I would not recommend these to ANY dog owner.  First, they are package very poorly.  Most bones are wrapped in plastic with no air inside, these come in loose plastic and therefore lose the freshness that you expect them to have.  They don't smell like regular dog bones..they smell OLD and just gross.  I bought the knee bones as well as the regular dog bones from smokehouse.  Both were gross.  Splintered very easily and were way too brittle for a dog to chew on. Sometimes cheap things---are really just CHEAP.

review/summary: Upset my dog's stomach
review/text: Got these for my chocolate lab and it gave her diarrhea.  I also have a black lab mix and she can chew on them just fine.  To be fair though, this chocolate lab has a very sensitive stomach.  I have to take her own food when I board her at the kennel and I don't have to do that for my other dogs so if your dog doesn't have that sensitive a system, I think these will work just fine.  My black lab loves them.  (I just have to keep them away from my chocolate lab.)

review/text: I recieved this jerky as a free replacement for another buffalo bills product with I hadn't liked.  They definitely stand behind their products and are very pleasant to deal with.  This jerky has a sweet barbeque flavor, and is quite tender and moist.  Very few pieces have a little gristle; for the most part they are easy to eat.  I agree they could have less salt for my taste, and also for health reasons, but they are quite delicious as they are.  This is the best jerky I have ever had.

review/summary: The ONLY dog snack my dog will eat!
review/text: I love this dog snack because it's vegan and nutritious.  My dogs love it for the taste.  Buying snacks for them is very difficult because most snacks on the market are full of unhealthy ingredients.  It's also difficult to find good vegan snacks.  (My little dog cannot digest animal protein and is allergic to a lot of non-animal products.)  Cloud Star has more than one vegan flavor, but my smaller dog loves this one so much that she won't eat any other kind.  It's the perfect size for her tiny little mouth.  The itty bitty biscuits are the only ones that she can eat without my help.  I also love the size for the sake of my older dog, who is a bit overweight.  I can still give him snacks without worrying that it's going to make him gain more.<br /><br />I cannot buy these anywhere in my area.  Only the larger biscuits are sold, which are too big for EITHER of my dogs to eat.  I am thankful for the internet because it makes it possible for me to keep the pantry stocked with them.<br /><br />Oh yeah, one more thing I like about them is that there is no disgusting smell when you open a package.  They smell fresh--good enough that I tried one.  Certainly not something I'd eat on a regular basis, but the dogs sure LOVE them!

I was told by my Veterinarian one of the main reasons (besides no soft food) the have great oral hygiene. these natural bones are the right size and the dogs never leave them alone until they are gone or I take them away. Dont give these to them before bed time (crunch crunch crunch). I notice they develop a thirst after chewing for awhile. No digestion problems as a result of eating on these. a great bang for the buck as far as dog treats go. Strongly recommend for dogs that have good teeth.

review/text: I recently purchased these bones for my 4 Cairn Terriers. All my dogs absolutely LOVE them ! Even the 11 year old enjoys chewing them and getting off a "little crunchy bit " . The one review stated that they are a little  " messy" . That is true as there are some loose pieces of grizzle  when you open the  plastic wrappr ( that itself is a GREAT feature to be INDIVIDUALLY  wrapped). How I have solved this problem is  that I wash each bone  under running water and then towel dry it before I give to the Cairns . That way there are no loose crumbs. The dogs  enjoy chewing these and it keeps them busy for a long time. When all the the crunchy tendons on the bones are gone , they still enjoy chewing at the  marrow. I have not yet seen any diarrhea or  even any large pieces  chewed off the bones.  They dont seem to splinter either. THUMBS UP for this  product !  They are all natural and  even my Male Cairn who has multiple allergies can enJOY  them!!

review/text: These bones kept my dogs busy for a half hour.  I like how these Natural bones did not leave a flaky mess like some other bones do.  The one thing I didn't like was the cost.  I thought I received a good value and would really like to buy them more often but not for $8 for 4 bonz.

review/summary: Smokehouse lamb bonz
review/text: Dogs got them as an alternative to beef bones which they are allergic to.  They got right into them, but you must supervise as the knobby ends break off and they are about the size of a large marble so could cause some trouble.  I also noticed they splintered, so they were removed at that point. I like the idea, but the safety issue was a problem.

review/text: My dog doesn't like big bones. She barely chews them and then they lie around all yucky! These knee bones are a perfect size. She eats them all up. The fact that they're USA bones is a big selling point for me. I would NEVER give my dog foreign bones because I don't know if they are processed correctly to kill bacteria.

review/text: We have 2 Min-Pin mixed breed dogs that are 2x - 3x larger than normal min pins. Because of their size, normal treats are either too big or too small. These knee bones are perfect for them and we finally found something they won't power through in 10 minutes. These bones are a bit messy so we either give them to the dogs outside or on a blanket inside. They do have a smell when first being chewed but it goes away as the dogs work on them. We are very happy with these bones.

review/summary: Gross
review/text: These bones are just gross.  First of all, they are not wrapped tight enough to keep them fresh.  When you open them up, they just smell old.  They are dry and brittle and break just by touching them.  I gave one to my 2 year old lab and within seconds it was splintering.  I threw the entire pack away, along with the pack of smokehouse knuckles I bought at the same time.  GROSS. I would not recommend these.  Ask the meat man has way better quality products. Real bones for Real dogs, not this fake crap.  Don't buy!

review/summary: Popular at my house
review/text: I have given the knee cap bones to my 75 pound chocolate lab and 11 pound miniature dachshund for years. When we added a 5 pound miniature chihuahua to the mix I wondered if she could hold on to her bone with the larger and more savvy dogs in the house. No problem! She is quick and limber and gets to chew whichever bone she wants. She likes to get hold of a bone the older dogs have been chewing on because they have softened it up a bit. Then she chews it for all she's worth. The older dogs are indulgent with her, and she always leaves one nearby as a trade. I take the bones out of the mix when they get small enough the lab could choke on them. The little ones get put in the crate with the chihuahua when we go in the car. All my dogs have great teeth and I credit these bones. They never splinter, but the dogs can chew off smooth bits, which they eat. This brand of knee cap bones are huge and provide many hours of chewing enjoyment for my animals. I highly recommend them.

review/text: My 5 lb. Pomeranian was able to chew off the large knobby end of the bone, and then managed to chew off a a smaller 1" knuckle-shaped piece from somewhere (by this time I had already taken the larger knob end away from him), getting it stuck in his throat.  Luckily, he threw it up while we were rushing to the vet.  Even small/toy dogs who are big chewers should not be given this product.

review/text: I would not recommend these to ANY dog owner.  First, they are package very poorly.  Most bones are wrapped in plastic with no air inside, these come in loose plastic and therefore lose the freshness that you expect them to have.  They don't smell like regular dog bones..they smell OLD and just gross.  I bought the knee bones as well as the regular dog bones from smokehouse.  Both were gross.  Splintered very easily and were way too brittle for a dog to chew on. Sometimes cheap things---are really just CHEAP.

review/text: Got these for my chocolate lab and it gave her diarrhea.  I also have a black lab mix and she can chew on them just fine.  To be fair though, this chocolate lab has a very sensitive stomach.  I have to take her own food when I board her at the kennel and I don't have to do that for my other dogs so if your dog doesn't have that sensitive a system, I think these will work just fine.  My black lab loves them.  (I just have to keep them away from my chocolate lab.)

It's a staple at our house and for years has been impossible to find on grocery shelves locally. Buying a case of 12 every few months is a hearty way to add something to a quick evening meal. Great on potatoes too.

review/summary: Cracker? Cookie? Either Way -- Delicious.
review/text: CRACKER COOKIE BISCUIT BLISS<br />I'd call these tiny snacks cookies rather than crackers, based on sheer yumminess, but they aren't especially sweet, and I suppose if they want to call them crackers, that is their prerogative.<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />Kudos for putting them in a bag rather than in a bag inside an unnecessary box as is usual for products in this segment.<br /><br />TASTE & TEXTURE<br />The taste is appropriately peanutty, somewhat salty and slightly sweet. It brought back childhood memories of Cap'n Crunch Peanut Butter Crunch Cereal. The texture is somewhat similar to shortbread -- crumbly with the slightest hint of (pleasant) buttery oiliness, which I imagine is coming from peanut ingredients and not from dairy butter (since it doesn't contain butter).<br /><br />INGREDIENTS & HEALTH CLAIMS<br />The ingredients are all pronounceable and recognizable as food. Things you may actually have in your home. Phenomenal. They don't really make any health claims, sticking with 'all natural' and 'no additives', neither of which I would disagree with on the basis of the extremely short ingredient list. Calorically you could do much worse in the prepackaged snack cookie/cracker segment, but this is still a snack food.<br /><br />RECIPE POSSIBILITIES<br />I can see creative cooks using these treats in all sorts of interesting ways -- as a pie crust, in lieu of graham crackers perhaps? As part of a trail mix or dessert bar? If you have used these treats in your cooking I'd love to hear about it in the comments section. :)<br /><br />IT'S FOR YOU IF...<br />- You love peanuts/peanut butter<br />- You prefer products with ingredients you don't need to look up on wikipedia<br />- You like some salty with your sweet (or sweet with your salty)<br /><br />THINK TWICE IF...<br />- You have a peanut allergy (sorry, I know sort of obvious)<br />- You are expecting tiny, soft, peanut butter cookies<br />- You honestly think you can stop eating after 27 very tiny crackers (1 serving)

review/summary: Tiny but Tasty!
review/text: Yes, these "crackers" are more like peanut butter cookies, they taste very much like nutter butter cookies, and are very small (just one is about the size of your finger tip) as other reviewers have stated. But they pack a very intense peanut butter flavor so a little goes a long way.  Which is good, as a little is all you can have if you adhere to the recommended portion size. One way to make sure you don't accidentally eat more than you're supposed to, is to portion out the servings into small little ziplock bags or wrap them up in cellophane then twist tie them off and store in a large ziplock bag to keep them fresh. I suggest doing that for just about everything you eat. It's what I do to keep track of the calories these days. And at least that way if you do eat more, you can't claim ignorance about how much you actually ate. It does help keep you honest.<br /><br />Would have given this 5 stars, but I didn't really appreciate the fact that these cookies were not shipped in a box. They come in a bag, and Amazon shipped them in a bag, so there was no real protection for the delicate cookies and so there was some amount of breakage and crumbling of the contents. With such a small bag to start with, and at $6 a bag, losing any amount like that is unacceptable.<br /><br />Edit; I just want to add since purchasing these crackers from Amazon I've found a site called "netrition.com and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought these crackers from netrition for only 2.99 per bag. and unlike Amazon they DID ship them in a box! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 powder and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food. Netrition is a whole lot better!

review/summary: The crack of good-for-you peanut butter cookies
review/text: This is the most amazing peanut butter cookie I have eaten in awhile...and it's good for you!  Unless you eat the whole bag, which I did in one day. They are small, so you can eat them by the handful.  Also, for some reason, there seem to be a lot of pieces at the bottom, which makes me sad.  But, you can save them and use them for toppings for yogurt, ice cream, fruit.  Better for you than hot fudge (although that would make it taste even more awesome)!<br /><br />And I like to think that they are really good for you too...especially since they are all natural.<br /><br />I really like all the PB2 products that I've tried so far.  Another win!

review/summary: Love it or hate it product it seems.
review/text: I was really looking forward to eating this product but was surprised by the saltieness of it (not in the nice salty sweet way you think of peanut butter cookies).  When I gave it to my daughter (thinking it may just have been me) she did not care for it either and commented that it kind of tasted like dog biscuits.  That is precisely what it became and our dogs LOVE it.  If you buy this be prepared for a salty taste and give it a fair chance as I see by other posts it may be something you love; I just didn't happen to be one of those people, unfortuantely we fell into the hate catagory.

review/text: The product arrived with about 20% of the product broken into crumbles so it couldn't be used as part of a hostess gift basket as intended.  Under Amazon's policy, they could not be returned.  I opened the package thinking my family would enjoy the treat and the flavor was only so-so.  If you see them in a store so you can ensure you're getting a package of unbroken wafers, they might be a good complement for ice cream.

review/summary: Little Treasures
review/text: I was extremely surprised by the flavor of these crackers.  They are like the cookie part of the Nutter Butter, with five times the flavor in a tiny little square.  It is interesting that "after-taste" is typically a negative thing.  But with these crackers (which are more like cookies) the "after taste" is a huge positive.  Five minutes after eating one tiny little cracker, I still had a bit of that peanut butter flavor.  I took them to work and my co-workers LOVED them.  We were all surprised by the ingredient list, which is very short and no crazy long words.  They were commenting about how they could still taste the peanut butter.  These are little treasures!

review/text: Received these PB2 Thins in good condition, some were crushed but not many. I would call these cookies instead of crackers simply because they do not have the consistency of crackers but more of cookies. They were ok, but too "peanuty" for my tastes. Because of that, I would not purchase these again.
