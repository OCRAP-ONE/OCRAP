review/summary: "Wow, those are beautiful!"
review/text: Opened my first tin and heard myself say "Wow, those are beautiful" at the sardines within.<br /><br />What splendid coloring! Rich and inviting....<br /><br />Dug in to find 3 of the largest sardines I've had the pleasure to meet.<br /><br />As I pulled the first one out, again, heard myself say "wow, those ARE beautiful."<br /><br />These look, and taste, like solid healthy fishies.<br /><br />.... I just drained the tin... even that seemed easier, and tastier, than I'm used to.<br /><br />I've had nothing but good experiences from "Wild Planet" -- so much so that I half-expected this to be a dud or, at best, average.<br /><br />But once again, I am so impressed with the products this company puts out.<br />><br />><br />><br />UPDATE:  Ingredients say "Sardines, extra virgin olive oil, water, sea salt, aqueous natural smoke."

review/summary: Bland tasting sardines
review/text: Pros: Got this for about $2 per can with Amazon's subscribe and save. Cheap considering it is packed in olive oil. Packed with 3 large sardines with skins and bones for extra nutrients.<br /><br />Cons: Where is the flavor? I have tasted various canned sardines. I can occasionally tell the differing flavor characteristics that each brand seems to have. Some taste very smokey. Others seem to take in the taste of the olive oil they are packed in. One brand I noticed had a lemony aftertaste. I actually prefer strong tasting fish but I can find that I appreciate each brand and really haven't found one I wouldn't buy again.  Until now. I wouldn't mark in in the dislike column. More towards the didn't really prefer. After a brief almost non-existent smoke taste, the fish itself is flavorless. It is also dry. The olive oil seemed to impart no flavor or moisture to this product. I had to pile on the hot sauce to get through the first two cans (I usually plop one can over rice as a quick snack). Plus this product was processed in Vietnam.<br /><br />Conclusion: I bought 12 cans. Definitely will shop for other brands due to the bland flavor of this product. But for the excellent price, I will still give it 3 stars. I wouldn't say I didn't like it. It is just canned sardines. Just pile on your choices of salt, spices, and sauces. Then chow away.

review/summary: smoky taste good, tin not full
review/text: After reading the reviews I was interested to try these. I am enjoying my first tin at this moment. When I opened it, I said, that reviewer was right. They were very casual about filling the tin. Three not that large sardines floating in a LOT of oil, room for at least two more sardines. I dont think I will be buying these again unless it turns out this one can was a fluke and the others are more full. The smoky flavor is nice, but its not enough to make up for the insufficient quantity. My favorite brands are Season and Crown Prince. I would always get Crown Prince except they are like twice the price.

review/summary: Tasty Sardines - Perfect for an Easy to Pack Weekday Lunch
review/text: I've tried Wild Planet's Wild Sardines-water packed and this product, the Wild Sardines in extra virgin olive oil. By far the tastier, according to my taste buds, are the little guys packed in the EVOO. I agree with other reviewers that the fish are firm, large (average only 3 per tin) and not overly "fishy" tasting. My 14 and 15 year old teens, a boy and a girl, both enjoy these quite a bit, and have Mom and Dad's permission to eat a can whenever they want, as long as they eat the bones too! Neither objected to that.<br /><br />I would enjoy trying some packed with mustard or Italian herbs/seasonings - a little something to add some variety. I frequently grab a tin of these for a healthy, work-day lunch, and since we are buying through the subscription plan, the cost is almost half of that at the local natural/health food store.<br /><br />I too have enjoyed reading through the company's website and find them to be very transparent, including their response here on Amazon to "Shebear's" criticism of where the sardines were processed. I live in Michigan, where we can only eat our local fish once a month (many kinds anyway), so any fish I try to incorporate into my family's diet has to come from far away. In a product like this, I'm happy to pay a higher price for the increased carbon footprint and this relatively small, in the grand scheme of our lives, deviation to being devoted Locovors.

review/summary: Best sardines ever
review/text: I will begin this with the statement that I have never been a fan of canned sardines. Recently, I read about their tremendous health benefits and have wanted to cut back on meat.  Fresh fish in the market is so expensive and has so much mercury in the wild versions and don't get me started on the farm raised varieties. Anyway, the smaller the fish, the lower the levels of mercury. I bought the Wild Planet brand and rinse them in cold water. I don't need all the oil and I think it gives them a much fresher taste. The slightly smokey flavour is delicious. I highly recommend them.<br /><br />I don't know where Shebear "Shebear" gets their information about the source of the sardines. The Wild Planet website specifically says that they are caught off the California coastline. I grew up in the Monterey Cannery Row area. The sardines were a thriving industry at one time but then they were gone. These are the return of the Pacific Coast sardines.<br /><br />Edit: found this FAQ on the wild Planet site. I am impressed with the transparency of this company. The sardines are truly caught in US Pacific waters, however, they are processed in Vietnam. Here is their statement:<br />Why are Wild Planet tuna and sardines caught in the US but packed in Vietnam?<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no US sardine or tuna cannery capable of processing our volume requirements and the last sardine factory in the United States closed in 2010. In addition, the US cost of production would greatly increase the retail price beyond the reach of most families. Our goal is to make US-sourced sustainable seafood choices mainstream and thus have a greater impact on fishery harvest practices for the long-term good of ocean conservation.<br /><br />We have elected to process our 5oz cans of albacore and skipjack tuna as well as our sardines in a highly respected partner facility in Vietnam. This facility offers state-of-the-art canning expertise in an immaculately clean, accredited environment that produces higher quality finished products than any cannery we have seen in the US.<br />[...]<br /><br />Also, btw, their cans are BPA free, a big plus in my book.

review/summary: Taste Terrible, Caught in Cali but Processed in Vietnam?
review/text: If you hate sardines and fish and you like albacore tuna white meat you might like this.<br /><br />First off these have no fishy sardine taste.<br /><br />These are not cracker sea salt and "extra"olive oil quality sardines by a long shot.<br /><br />I'll have to hide these in my salads. I bought 2 packs of 6 I bought extra lettuce to down these. Yuck!<br /><br />I love sardines! Canned fresh, with or without heads and guts, with skin and<br />bones in water and or oil... always have always will.<br /><br />I don't like mustard or marinara because it hides the taste of the sardines!!<br />I can even tolerate them raw... "cooked" in vinegar. But usually too dry cooked in vinegar<br /><br />But if this were my first and only try at a sardine, I would pass!<br /><br />These sardines are DRY&lt; DRY &lt;DRY&lt; DRY&lt; DRY ! Olive oil does not mask the dryness!<br /><br />It tastes as if all they natural oil was sucked out of it and they tried to hide it with the<br />least flavorful olive oil they could find. OO loses it's flavor with heat so this is almost forgiving.<br /><br />But these are Tough! I'm used to sardines flesh kinda fatty and giving away, at the touch of the fork<br />not the kind you have to stab hard to break apart.<br /><br />Also, not prominently mentioned is that they are smoked. This could be why they are so dry,<br />but while not my favorite I've had smoked sardines that are not this dry.<br /><br />Also I don't like the caught off the coast of California as an ad technique then on the package<br />it is shown as processed in Vietnam. Could be why they don't taste at all fresh. Probably<br />freeze dried to make the voyage.<br /><br />I was looking forward to having sardines without the BPA. I'd rather BPA than<br />these nasty, dry, tough things they are passing off as sardines!

review/summary: Closest thing to 70s Girl Scout Fudge Patties I've found yet--Keebler Fudge Filled Cookies
review/text: For anyone who remembers those fudgy little cookies and has been missing them, this is a good news/bad news story.  The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby.

He is now joking that the serving size is a box instead of a sleeve!<br /><br />Apparently these taste amazing with peanut butter.

review/summary: Reformulated version much worse than before
review/text: When this product became a "Helper Complete Meal" instead of just a regular "Complete Meal", they reformulated the topping, which used to be a breadcrumb-based parmesan-cheese blend. The new topping is literally just parmesan cheese, and not a lot of it, and the product is notably worse off for it.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor is very mild, not "Alfredo" at all, but it is still reasonably tasty and the chicken tastes pretty good. The overall flavor is a generic creamy chicken dish with some hints of cheese. It is, however, a delusion to suggest it feeds 4 - the amount of chicken is enough for 2 (or maybe 2 adults + 1 child).<br /><br />What is there is indeed easy to make, and tastes pretty good for a thing out of a box. If you're just running out of steam but still want something with some 'comfort food' vibe, then this is OK. However, if you're looking for a high-quality meal, look elsewhere. The mexican-style version of this with the rice is much better tastewise, for the same price.

That being said I made this in my microwave and it wasn't bad. The chicken, what of it there was, actually tasted like chicken. One package makes enough to feed 2-3, but if you are like me and have to feed five you'll need to use more than one box, which it does have instructions for on the box. One box would make a decent side, however, Lipton makes a similar product that costs less if that was your intent. Also it is not complete either and you will need to be sure to have milk to add to it.

Not that pistachios are cheap or anything but for the price - heck I will just buy matcha instead!<br />This pistachio matcha really does smell like pistachio.<br />There is a slight very slight chemical like smell but it does not come out in the blend when you make your matcha regardless of if you use just water or make a latte with it.<br />I really do like this matcha and the base comes through very nicely and with pistachio for some reason seems to make even more sense because pistachios have green on them. Yeah I know its a mental thing and I am after all somewhat mental however this may also be quite nice in a white base as well!<br />Try as many of these Red Leaf Matcha as you can you won't be unhappy with your matcha flavors!

review/text: This is a delicious matcha with pistachio flavoring that is authentic and lovely. When I first smelled the prepared bowl of matcha, I was surprised and confused that it smelled kind of spicy, like nutmeg and cloves. It wasn't unpleasant, just totally unexpected. The smell carries over to just the beginning part of the taste, where it initially seems a bit spicy but then morphs into a nutty, rich pistachio flavor. The matcha underneath definitely takes on an earthy flavor, and I can't help but wonder if the spiciness isn't at least in part from the matcha that the pistachio flavoring is just bringing to the foreground. Overall the nutty flavors really work well with matcha and make for a great energizing drink!

review/text: The matcha straight out of the bag smells very strongly like sweet pistachio, reminding me of pistachio halva. Very intoxicating smell!<br /><br />The matcha frothed up well during whisking and is a lovely green colour, matching a perfect colour to pistachios too!<br /><br />As a traditional cup of hot matcha, great strong earthy green tea base holding hands next to the  pistachio flavor. The matcha isn't astringent. Slight bitterness, but it fits the bill almost with a smokeyness of the pistachio. There is a sweet nutty taste at the end of my sip. The best part of this cup is that sweet nutty taste, very well done! I'm thinking I could drink this one as a traditional cup all the time.<br /><br />As a iced latte (prepared with matcha, ice, soy milk and a bit of sweetner), this pretty much tastes like pistachio ice cream! Creamy, sweet, and nutty with strong green tea base. This one came out sweeter than normal because of the sweetness of the flavoring. With that said, if adding sweetener, be gentle.<br /><br />So my tea peeps, totally give this one a shot. I guess it sounds kinda weird since I think others might associate pistachios as just a salty snack, but this one is sweet, nutty and tasty!

I opened the box and some of the cone boxes were also crushed a little.  You could shake the boxes and tell they were broken.  I opened each box and out of the 6 boxes 90& of the cones were broken.  I called Amazon and they were sincerely apologetic and sent me another case.  Unfortunately the same thing happened.  I didn't bother calling this time.  I was afraid they would think I was scamming them.  I think between the 2 cases(12 boxes) I got 5 boxes of cones if you took all the damaged ones out.  When I say damaged I don't mean cones with just a little bit broken.  I  mean totally unable to use at all.

review/summary: I like this brand of coffee
review/text: I've never been disappointed with the Cafe Excellence brand of coffee.  The Serendipity blend has that good coffee aroma with a taste to match.  I've given it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 because it doesn't live up to the other blends of Cafe Excellence that I have tried.  It is still better than most other coffees.

review/summary: Don't Buy This!
review/text: I guess the people at amazon who decided this Nielsen Massey Orange Flower<br />Water is a good substitute for Monteux can't taste, smell or feel. First, it tastes<br />more like oranges than orange blossoms. And there's a hint of a gasoline-like<br />flavor in there, too. Second, it doesn't smell like orange blossoms. It smells kind<br />of like aged oranges - with a hint of that gasoline again. And it isn't a water. It's<br />actually oily on the fingertips and you need to wash your hands after touching it.<br />Monteux Orange Blossom Water was truly a water. Besides a flavoring, you<br />could use it cosmetically. It had the slight perfume taste and smell of orange<br />blossoms. And no fumes. I have no idea what to buy now that Monteux is so<br />hard to get but I do know that Nielsen Massey isn't it.

review/text: Nielsen-Massey's Orange Blossom Water is dreadful -- primarily because it isn't orange blossom water at all. It's a mixture of chemicals with orange oil added. I bought it and will not use it in my cooking -- I'm afraid it'll ruin what I'm making. If you've used Monteaux in the past, be warned THIS IS NOT MONTEAUX!!

review/text: I haven't used this product, but people seem to be slightly in the dark about how to acquire orange flower water without difficulty or great expense, so here it is.  Think outside the box and go to an Indian or Pakistan grocer.  They'll have super-cheap, big bottles of decent rose and orange flower water for a few bucks.  This is really not the kind of thing you have to throw money at unless you're in a small or non-diverse area.

I guess I never got over it and to this day have to have a Chuckles fix periodically.<br /><br />The sugar coating keeps them from being sticky. The artificial flavors are seductive.

review/summary: Best Cubes For Absinthe
review/text: Hands down the best cubes to use for absinthe and I mean superior to the slightly refined white cubes. There's just something fittingly Belle Epoque about the raw brown cane sugar cubes. At first I thought the price was a little high but since it's four boxes it works out to be a little cheaper than buying them in the store. I think it rather comes down to how often you foresee yourself using sugar cubes. I'd absolutely recommend the cubes in terms of quality, not sure one needs four boxes of the things however. See what you think.<br /><br />As with any brown sugar, these cubes offer the subtle flavours derives from the presence of molasses that aren't found in white, refined, sugar. Since I use these primarily for absinthe, that adds something nice to the resulting drink.<br /><br />So the cubes are highly recommended, the price is probably dependant on buying them in four packs, but it'd be nice if they were available individually from this seller.

It has the brown sugar box picture on (with orange box with brown sugar pictures).<br /><br />When I looked for "La Perruche Brown Sugar", this item came up on a list of 10x items, and I bought this thinking this was the brown sugar due to the picture.<br /><br />Well, white sugar came and I checked my order, and of course, I bought the "La Perruche Pure Cane Rough Cut White Sugar Cubes" with the brown sugar picture on it...<br /><br />I also couldn't return it, since it was a grocery item. That being said, the white sugar is good too, I just prefer the brown one and was expecting brown sugars.<br /><br />So please Amazon, change the picture to the correct one to avoid confusion!

I don't need a laundry list of unpronounceable ingredients, I just want a simple afternoon snack to get me through to dinner. Apple and Pear is my favorite so I've been stocking up with the 12 pack. The portion size is perfect for me as a daily snack and provides a couple servings of fruit. The consistency is a little gummy which can cause bits to stick in your teeth but I'm still happy with the bars overall and I'm glad they aren't too dry actually. I've used energy bars as breakfast replacement when I'm traveling light and I don't think these have quite the calories for that use but they are perfect as a snack.

review/text: We received a bar in a snack pack on a transcontinental flight with our 16 month old son.  While we thought the rest of the pack wasn't appropriate for his age, this seemed okay since, as the name implies, is just fruit. He ate the bar in less than 2 minutes!  He loved it.  Granted, our little guy is a fruit and veggie nut so this is not a problem for us, but the convenience of a bar when we are out and about is very appealing.  So we kept the wrapper and are going to purchase a box from Amazon.  Great product even for a toddler.

review/text: Fresh and tasty corn.  I just got back into making popcorn old fashioned style (on the stove) and what a difference.  The microwave popcorn that everyone is eating is like super salty cardboard compared to stove-top popcorn.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor - try this stuff (they have smaller sizes).  I promise, you won't go back to microwave.

review/summary: Dr. Pepper flavor works well in a BBQ sauce!
review/text: As a long-time fan of Dr. Pepper I thought I'd give this sauce a try. I wasn't expecting it to taste very much like Dr. Pepper and figured it'd just be a pretty standard barbecue. Not only does it have the distinct Dr. Pepper flavoring, it works very well on everything I've tried it with - chicken, burgers, and in baked beans. Even some people that aren't Dr. Pepper soda fans liked it. If you're a fan of barbecue sauce and a fan of Dr. Pepper you're almost guaranteed to like it!

review/summary: Boyfriend loves it!
review/text: I bought this for my boyfriend because it combines his two favorite things in the world: Dr. Pepper and barbecue sauce. He loves this sauce and uses it for almost everything. We used it to make a Dr. Pepper barbecue chicken pizza...he was a very pleased with it.<br /><br />Now, my opinion...I like Dr. Pepper, don't love it. This sauce just doesn't mix well with my taste buds and leaves an odd after taste for me.<br /><br />I'd say if you are a Dr. Pepper fanatic who loves to cook then you'd probably enjoy this.

review/summary: If you like a sweet Kansas City sauce, this is it!
review/text: We're partial to thick, sweet sauces for our BBQ so if you are also -- you might like this.  My husband said he can taste the Dr. Pepper, but honestly, I do not (and neither do our kids.)  No real heat, barely a hint of heat anyway.  I made pulled chicken, and pulled pork with this.  I added a bottle to the pork during cooking and it held up really well in the Croc Pot.  And the meat really took on the flavor, so while it's thick you can still get the flavor into the meat during preparation.<br /><br />Not trying to take anything away from Amazon, but you can buy a single bottle to try at your local store.  And buy in bulk from Amazon because was much 25% cheaper.

review/summary: Surprisingly good dipping sauce
review/text: I got this on a lark since my nephew is a huge BBQ sauce fan, and has never tried this particular brand. I can take or leave Dr. Pepper soda. It's not bad, but I don't exactly seek it out. So I was not expecting that I'd really care much for this sauce.<br /><br />It's actually quite good! It excels as a dipping sauce, especially for chicken. Not bad on pulled pork either. I also tried it as a cooking sauce and was less impressed - not bad, but it really is best as a dipping sauce. As expected, it's pretty sweet, but has enough tang so you get a variety of flavors.<br /><br />While I still prefer my own homemade BBQ sauce, for a bottled version this is pretty good.

review/text: I won a bottle of this originally from buying a bunch of 2 liter Dr. Pepper bottles. I never heard of it and assumed it would taste horrible, but after it came I was pleasantly surprised to find it was up there with Chik-Fil-A BBQ Sauce. It's sweet and not overbearingly spicy like most store bought BBQ sauces are. Great as a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets/tenders and good on ribs too. If only Chik-Fil-A would bottle their sauce, but this is a great alternative.

review/summary: Dr. Who?
review/text: I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. We are big Dr.Pepper fans, & I frequently use Dr. Pepper soda in my cooking.  When I saw the BBQ sauce, I thought perfect, I'll have it on hand & won't have to make it myself.  This is a MAJOR disappointment.  It's not sweet, it's more acid than I like, it doesn't taste at all like Dr. Pepper, there are no indications in the ingredients list that it is remotely related to Dr.Pepper, about the only thing I can say good about this stuff - it does bring some heat.  Save your money.  This is not what you're looking for!

If I had to do it all over again I would have ignored the novelty of the product and looked for a quality BBQ sauce. This is what I recommend you do. Try Tony Roma's BBQ sauce. Comes in a lot of great flavors and it is nice and thick.

review/summary: These are really tasty jelly sticks
review/text: My boyfriend purchased a two-pound bag of these at BJ's and they are very, very good.  Do note, however, that the orange slices pictured on the front of the bag implies that these are oranges covered in chocolate which they are not. The packaging is misleading yet very smart marketing for those who don't read the label. My boyfriend thought he was buying chocolate covered oranges.<br /><br />This is actually an orange flavored jelly stick covered in dark chocolate that is made with real orange juice.  It does, however, taste like chocolate covered oranges but without the texture associated with eating oranges. Four pieces are 140 calories with 30 fat calories and 21 grams of sugar. For those with peanut allergies, these are processed in a peanut free plant as per the description on the back of the bag.<br /><br />This is definitely candy and definitely tasty to both me and my boyfriend.

review/text: These little pieces of candy are amazing.  The chocolate coating is just enough to quench your chocolate craving and when you bite into the jelly center which is orange flavored, you go WOW!  Texture is great.  Doesn't melt in your hand.  They travel well, and here's a suggestion for you.  Freeze them.  They take on a whole new texture when you bite into them cold.  Highly recommend them as a little snack that feels like an indulgence.

review/text: We have a favorite cookie in this house (from England) called Jaffa Cakes. It is a soft cookie with orange jelly in the middle and a dark chocolate topping. The best part of it is the jelly and chocolate.<br /><br />So when we came across these, we were in heaven. The best of Jaffa Cakes and available locally!<br /><br />The middle is an orange flavored jelly and the outside is a dark chocolate coating. They are not super sweet but that's what makes them tasty. They are semi-tart orange with the deep flavor of the chocolate. A perfect combination.<br /><br />The chocolate can look cloudy or scuffed when taken out of the bag but I believe it's because they get tossed around inside. If you want a perfect chocolate finish, you have to buy them individually packed.<br /><br />I picked up a 2 lb bag at BJs for $10.

The chocolate coating is fine but the orange center is so tangy as to be almost lacking in sweetness entirely. My tongue could not take it! I contacted Jelly Belly only to be told I would have to send back the entire bag for a substitute product, as if, and at my own expense. Such a lack of customer service I've never encountered. I had to throw the whole bag out and vow to not deal with them again. Consider this a forewarning to be taken seriously.

review/summary: FABULOUS as a meal or snack
review/text: I have been eating these glass noodles since I was a child then rediscovered them in college, and we boil them for a few minutes then let them "steep" in the hot water for another 5 minutes until pliable, then we mix with soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar and scallions, and some chicken or beef and water chestnuts, this is a fabulous treat and can be a snack or a meal. You can use either the seasoned rice vinegar which is sweet or the original, and go easy on the sesame oil, it is very strong and can overpower your dish. We also add a bit of canola oil, just a suggestion. I originally had these noodles at the Luau, a wonderful restaurant that we went to when I was a child and I have loved them ever since. Wonderful texture and take on the flavors you imbue them with. They can also be fried in very hot canola or peanut oil for a crunch in salads...very versatile and great to have on hand. When frying, be aware they expand tremendously and will blow up out of the pan if you do too many at once. Start small until you see how big they get.

review/summary: Tasty bites of energy
review/text: I couldn't do without these to keep my energy going and stave off hunger during long runs.  I have tried both the fruit punch and multi-flavor packets, and found the fruit punch to be delicious, but some of the flavors in the multi were slightly unpleasant; I wish I could tell you which ones they were.  Beans are less messy and much easier to eat while running than gels or shot blocks, as you can breathe more easily with a small bean in your mouth than the other items, which are thicker and harder to swallow.  One packet fits into the zipper pouch of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KQBH52">Fuelbelt Sprint 10-ounce Palm Holder with Pocket</a>, which I also love for longer runs.  My advice would be to find a store that sells these beans in individual packets, and try a few different flavors before buying a bulk box.

review/text: Castelvetrano are some of the most delicious Olives around. The Roland Castelvetrano Olives, while delicious, are not high grade. During the initial brine Lye is used. Although the Olives are later rinsed the olive is permanently altered. Additionally, the brine in the can contains citric acid and is a little bit overwhelming for those individuals not used to preservatives. Discard the brine and the can and soak the olives in water in glass jars to remove the excess citric acid and unwanted flavor. Replace water with a home-made brine for longer storage.

My plan was to follow the recommendation of another reviewer, and put the olives in a glass jar with water to reduce the brine. But, at the rate we are devouring them, I don't believe that will be necessary.<br /><br />My only regret is that I didn't purchase more at the same time. I'll stock up on my next purchase.

Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do.<br /><br />Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption:<br /><br />*Breast cancer<br />*Brain damage<br />*Infant abnormalities<br />*Thyroid disorders<br />*Kidney stones<br />*Immune system impairment<br />*Severe, potentially fatal food allergies<br />*Impaired fertility<br />*Danger during pregnancy and nursing<br /><br />and for all ~<br /><br />Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!

review/summary: Horrible to deal with, bad warranty, unpleasant, many are hard to chew
review/text: We ordered a large sampler of most of their products and some other items from this company's brochure. The cover says "Harvest Fresh taste". So we thought it was like fresh fruit. It wasn't, and, being middle aged, we could not chew it, it stuck in our teeth, and most was drenched in sugar. We tried it all. No one wanted to eat any of it. We were dissatisfied. They also did not send a free item their brochure promises for purchases above 79 dollars.<br /><br />No fear, the second page says "100% guarantee. All our products are unconditionally guaranteed. If you or your gift recipient are not satisfied, please contact us for an immediate replacement or refund. It's important to us that you are happy with your order."<br /><br />So I did and asked for a refund. So far, not on your life. So far they have had roadblocks and stalling, like requests for data on the bottoms of tins, when most items, and there are a lot, are in  small cellophane packages in a large sampler with no tins. A mess and a time consuming, aggravating horror to deal with.<br /><br />Unless you are addicted to candied type fruits, many heavily sugared and tough and hard to chew, and cannot do without, keep away from this firm or find what you like elsewhere. Especially if your teeth are not the youngest. These people do not honor their guarantees and are really no fun to deal with. I emailed many times and called. Both ways were unpleasant. I probably will have to contact my credit card for help.

review/summary: Interesting - if only for the color
review/text: I must not be enough of a salt afficionado to be able to tell the difference in taste between this and regular sea salt.  It looks marvelous in a salt grinder ball, but other than that, it tastes like salt.  I gave it as a gift to my husband along with a couple of other varieties and a grinder and he was pleased, mostly for the visual appeal.<br />I would have given a 5 if I had been able to discern any difference in flavor with this on my food.

review/summary: Much better than pills
review/text: One of our dogs whom we adopted as an adult had torn cranial cruciate ligaments in both back legs and a really difficult time getting around.  We opted for surgery on one leg to see if it would help, but the repair did not improve her mobility.  After two years of glucosamine supplements, she is tearing around the yard after our two younger dogs again.  It used to be a struggle to feed her the giant pills, and to remember them every day.  Now we just give the two younger dogs their Greenies and she gets her special one all at once as a daily treat--she views it as a reward, and it's easy for us to be consistent.  They are also labeled by week-day so that my partner and I no longer become confused about whether one of us has already medicated the dog on any given day.<br /><br />She has been on these for half a year now, and if anything, she has improved from her time on the pill supplements.  About a month ago she jumped onto our bed, which is about 3 feet off the ground.  We were delighted; for a long time she could barely stand up.  If your older dog has limited mobility due to joint problems, definitely give these a chance!

review/summary: Great!
review/text: I have a 10 1/2 year old chow-shepard mix... a big girl about 95 pounds.  She started showing some signs of something hurting her as she laid or sat down and then when getting back up.  She didn't have a lot of energy to play or to go for a walk.  The Vet said she's getting arthritis we should try to give her some supplements.<br />We came across these at a mega-pet store and bought a package.  I've followed up with two more and about to buy another to be the fourth month of this experiment.<br />Does this work?  Well, for our dog, she no longer moans as she's lying down or getting up.  She's running around the house again, running in the yard after the squirrels and if we get anywhere near her leash, she's trying to get it off the hook for us to go, go, go.<br />Miracle?  Maybe.  Right product at the right time for my `pup'?  Yes indeed.<br />Do I recommend?  To every dog owner I know; and tell them Amazon has the best price too.

review/summary: No false claims here!
review/text: My dog has just turned 10 and we noticed on long walks, especially in the winter, she would get a little sore and limpy. While she's in pretty good shape and in excellent health, we were concerned about her joint health.<br /><br />My husband found these products at a pet food store and picked up a small package. For one week's worth of these treats, the total cost was $9.99.  I was skeptical as we'd tried a few other joint suppliments and not really seen any results.<br /><br />When I opened the package, I did appreciate that each day is labeled. When you have more than one owner in a house, knowing if the dog has had her daily dose can be an issue. This eliminates that problem entirely.<br /><br />We tried out the week's worth of treats and there was a small but noticible difference. Our bed is low to the ground and she had a much easier time getting up without straining and she wasn't limping after her walks.<br /><br />I decided to purchase a larger amount and saw that Amazon had the 28-pack for over $5 less than the store was selling it for. This made the decision for me and the treats arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Now, I have a dog who not only looks forward to her walks even more than normal but always is happy to hear the words "joint cookie" when she gets home from them.

review/text: Our 10-year-old Chesapeake Bay Ret had to have TPLO surgery after tearing his ACL.  Three months later, he's in great shape and I truly believe these treats -- along with another prescribed glucosamine "treat" and being extra diligent with his exercise -- has made all the difference!  Highly recommend!

review/text: I'm so glad that a women at my local PetSmart recommended these for our Dalmatian! They are much better than the pills and have more glucosamine than supplements. Before taking these she was having trouble getting up and down the stairs, her back legs would give out for no reason, and she was having severe muscle spasms. Within a few days of taking these she has gotten noticeably better.<br />She also has a very sensitive stomach and even after taking these for 2 1/2 months they have not upset her belly at all!

I assumed it would be like other treats and she would turn her nose up at them, but she LOVES them! I haven't given them to her long enough to claim that the glucosamine & chondroitin helps any, but if it helps pets as it does humans, then I assume they will do her good. Because she loves them and they have the glucosamine in them to help her joints, I will buy them for her again! This bigger box on Amazon.com this time!
