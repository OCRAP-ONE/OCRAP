review/summary: my dogs won't eat
review/text: I ordered the natural balance salmon dry dog food because I had good luck with the natural balance salmon dry cat food.  Further, I am a pescatarian and was disappointed to see how almost every dry dog and cat food brand at the grocery stores and on the market contain chicken, lamb, or beef bi -products.  I love my dogs, but I cannot see feeding baby lamb to my dog! Even the "only fish" labelled dog and cat foods on the market often contain chicken, etc when you look on the ingredients list.  So I was very pleased to find a cost effective solution to this in natural balance.  The only issue is that my dogs will not touch this food! They would rather starve than eat it it seems, perhaps because it is the diet formula?  I'm not sure.  However, I will say that they all (including the cat) flock to the Natural Balance salmon dry cat food lol so I will continue ordering that for the cat.

review/summary: The only food he eats!
review/text: My pure bread yellow lab is surprisingly a very picky eater and after going through several other brands this is the only food he will eat.  He doesn't have allergies that we're aware of and hasn't had any bad reactions to other foods, he just won't eat them.  Now I've moved to an area where I can't get this food at a nearby store, so I've come to Amazon.com to start ordering it regularly for delivery.

It would make him lick his paws until they were red, paw at his face, itch, and worst of all have very frequent messy poops!<br />I tried many remedies and foods until I tried Natural Balance.  This formula has helped all the problems he had with food allergy.  And, he has hardly any smelly gas anymore!

review/summary: This product made my dog very sick - Recall Alert on brand
review/text: This product made my dog very sick. He is an older 11 year old pug with allergies and this particular mix is supposed to be good with allergies. I decided to try it because my vet had run out of Science Diet Salmon and Sweet Potato and I found this very reputable looking dog food with free shipping on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Within 3 days off feeding it to my dog he seemed to loose all energy and my wife was concerned we wouldn't have him very much longer. I then Googled the brand and found a recall due to salmonella contamination! Granted, the recall wasn't on this specific mix, but when I tried to contact the company they haven't even bothered to respond within four days! I ran out and found another vet who carries science diet and within a day or two my dogs is energetic and back to his old self.  This dog food is supposed to be 100% guaranteed, just return the unused portion back to the retailer - yeah, shipping 28 lbs of dog food back to Amazon and finding the box it will fit in  is real convenient...

review/summary: Great food!
review/text: I have a 7 year old female Newfoundland who has had allergy problems for years.  I have tried all sorts of things except buying hypoallergenic dog food.  After reading review about this food, I thought I would give it a try.  She is getting around much better, has more energy, quit licking hair off feet, ears getting better, and her coat is getting more beautiful color back(bronze).  Financially it is not easy to buy this food! I have 6 dogs total, a few I found and took in, not that we can afford to.  In this difficult economy people are just dropping their dogs off and the shelters are full.  I would love to have all my dogs on a good food like Natural Balance but can not afford it.  So, my Newfoundland will be the only one on it because of her problems.

review/summary: Seems to be a good kibble
review/text: My German Shepherd puppy has never had solid stool since switching him over to premium kibble.  The breeder had him on Science Diet which I've read is not a very good food.  I tried putting him on Blue Buffalo LBP but could never get consistently firm poops.  After reading the reviews I decided to give this brand a try.  Since switching, my pup has consistently good stool in the morning and afternoon, but for some reason by early evening, his stool is still soft (although not a runny as when he was on Blue Buffalo).  The reason I'm giving this a 3 star is that 1. This particular blend smells very fishy.  If you don't mind fish breath on your dog then its not a big deal.  2.  The first ingredient is not a protein thus the protein levels are lower than other premium dog foods.  This may be OK for an adult dog, but I'm not so sure if this is enough for a growing pup.  Which leads me to #3.  You need to feed almost twice the amount of food for growing puppies (probably to make up for the lower levels of protein).  In the end you are actually paying more since the serving size is larger for puppies; also larger serving size means more poop to scoop!  My dog is 8 months old so I might just weather out the next few months on this brand until his growth slows down then try to switch to Taste of the Wild.  I most definitely will not be getting the fish blend again, its too stinky. I may try the bison mix next.

review/summary: Hard to find excellent decaf beans on Amazon.
review/text: TLDR version:  Look elsewhere if you want great decaf beans.  These weren't even worth the price at 57% off list.<br /><br />Normal version:<br /><br />I purchased these when there was a deal a few weeks ago, and have been brewing both espresso and drip coffee with them and a caffeinated variety by the same company.  This review is for the Larry's Beans Fair Trade Organic Decaf Espresso.<br /><br />The first thing to say about Larry's Beans is that they are all packaged quite well in individual boxes which contain the air-tight bag of beans.  This makes them easy to stack in a warehouse, and also prevents warehouse employees from inadvertently slicing open the bag when unloading a crate or larger package.<br /><br />When I received the beans, I immediately fished out some freezer bags and prepared to portion out the beans.  I opened the sealed bag and the beans smelled OK; the smell wasn't overpowering but it was not what I would consider "gourmet."  It's not old or musty smelling like some of the other "gourmet" decaf bean roasters represented here on Amazon, but it's also not top shelf.<br /><br />Although the beans are evenly roasted, I would definitely not call it Espresso roast.  The roast is more reminiscent of a mild breakfast roast - medium brown, not the dark black I expect when I think of espresso.  Also, the beans are very small - clearly not a premium batch of beans.  I expect a "gourmet" bean to accurately represent the style of roast, and for the beans to be large, although uniform in size.  Neither were the case with these beans.<br /><br />When portioning the beans into 1lb freezer bags, I found that the beans really aren't oily at all.  I surmise that this has to be due to the water process used to decaffeinate the beans, although I don't know this to be a fact.  I expect a "gourmet" bean to be oily enough to leave a clear film on the inside of the freezer bags I package them in, and this didn't accomplish that feat.<br /><br />As you can see, the initial impressions of the look and smell of the beans were only mediocre, not outstanding like the price should suggest.  Now, on to the flavor.<br /><br />Fresh out of the 5lb bag, I hand-ground enough of the beans for a couple of shots of espresso.  Yes, I have a counter-mounted hand grinder that can also be used to make flour from grains!  Anyway, I ran the ground coffee through my pump espresso maker, and what came out the other side had no crema, although the shots themselves didn't taste horrible.  The flavor was reminiscent of unsweetened cocoa, with astringent, grapeskin-like qualities that struck me as quite bitter for the mild roast.<br /><br />I have since made pots of drip decaf with this bean, and combined it with a caffeinated version from Larry's Beans, and it's passable (carried by the excellent quality of the caffeinated beans, I'm sure), although still not what I would consider worth the price.  I haven't found any excellent decaf beans on Amazon, yet, so I will move on to another variety once this batch is gone.

review/text: I find Larry's decaf espresso as good or better than anything I can find in a coffee house.  Espresso quality is quite variable when it comes to decaf.  I've ordered these beans 5-6 times and never been disappointed.  I grind the beans very fine in a small counter grinder, about 2 cups at a time.  I keep coming back for more and I've always found them available on Amazon.

Everytime I try to reorder one they don't seem to carry it anymore.  That being said, I've tried a lot of decaf espressos.  Larry's has a great taste and uses a water process for deaffeination (which I prefer over the other chemical processes).  Why decaf?  Well I drink a few quad lattes a day (love the taste) and the caffeine starts getting to me.  I mix regular espresso beans with decaf espresso beans to create a half and half mixture.  I have also found the Larry's regular espresso to be a good tasting product.

review/text: The SHU strength of this cayenne is listed as being about one-third less than  the capsules I was using (90,000)but it tastes just as HOT! You can tell it is also very fresh.<br /><br />Some advice: Try to use whatever amount you take either sprinkled on food or, like I do, about an eight to one-quarter teaspoon mixed with about 8 oz of liquid. If you take the capsule form straight (which you can open up), it will shock your system when it explodes in your stomach, possibly doing harm.

We make capsules from our pepper so the nice texture is a plus. The color was a nice bright orange (old product tends to be brown). I agree that capsules can be a little stressful, if you take too many, so start with one & add another when your system is adjusted to it. I always eat a little food before & after the capsules & have very little discomfort (Actually almost never). I recommend that you do your research online to learn the best way for you to use cayenne.  We have experienced several obvious benefits.

review/summary: Fine and even texture
review/text: Ah, so many great uses for this great product. The texture and fine and smooth, very even, just like flour, but also very dry because the oil has been removed. If you want rice bran without the oil removed, don't buy packages labeled "stabilized."<br /><br />First of all, I use this to make an exfoliating face mask/scrub by making a paste using this mixed with a little bit of green tea, olive oil (or whatever carrier oil you like), and milk. I smooth a layer over my face, wait for it to dry, then jump in the shower, dampen it, and rub for about a minute before rinsing it off. The tiny grains exfoliate without being rough on the skin and it smells sooo good! (like rice :) My skin is much tighter and brighter afterwards and I put the leftovers in the fridge for another day. Plus, this is way cheaper than buying those rice bran face masks from Japan.<br /><br />I also use this as a partial substitute for flour in baking. It's very nutritious and causes my cookies to spread out a little flatter (maybe because it reacts differently to the baking soda?), but the taste of the cookies is not affected and I like crispy edged cookies.<br /><br />I also sprinkle this on white rice since this is the vitamin-packed part of the rice before the rice is processed. I sprinkle it in other dishes too, especially ones that require a little thickening. Overall this is a great product and I'd buy it again!

review/text: It's very difficult getting enough of the B vitamins from the standard American diet so I supplement my diet using brewers yeast or rice bran.  Bob's Red Mill is known for high quality health foods and the price was very good. Try a little rice bran sprinkled on your breakfast cereal or lunch salad and you'll find you have real 5-hour energy.

review/summary: Maybe rice bran is not all it's cracked up to be
review/text: You know how in China and Japan they mostly eat white rice but at the same time some really smart integrated health care professionals in America insist that brown rice would be healthier because it has more minerals, B vitamins and a lower glycemic index?<br /><br />Well, maybe that's a pile of noise.<br /><br />Maybe the people in Japan and China actually know what they're doing this time (just like pretty much every other time). Maybe the miniscule quantities of vitamins and minerals in brown rice are more than outweighed by allergens and other noxious things (like cyanide) in the bran, which help prevent baby rice grains in the wild from being devoured in the first place.<br /><br />On the other hand, I gotta say, it *does* taste good.

review/summary: Aromatic & Full of Flavor
review/text: I found the most enjoyable way to eat these is with Numi Winter Spice tea.  The flavors in the hot tea compliment the cookies perfectly!  No need to add sugar or milk to the tea.  The cookies make up for the lack of sweetener.  I love to dip these extra crunchy cookies into the hot tea & nibble at them.  It is a heavenly treat!<br /><br />The cookies are bite sized & they are hard.  The minute you open the bag your senses will be delighted by the aroma of chocolate & orange.  They do not taste bland or like "cardboard" as some cookies of this type can taste.  Overall they are a decent cookie.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that they are not 100% Organic.  This entire line of Family Recipe cookies is not 100% Organic.  Since I don't have a lot of organic options, I will settle on this brand.  It is nice to have these when I have too much work to do around the farm or it is simply too hot out to have the oven on to make my own cookies - which are the best since home made cookies can't be beat!<br /><br />I also tried their Family Recipe Ginger Snaps & they were very tasty as well with little bits of chewy ginger in them.  The Ginger Snaps are another cookie perfect with hot tea as they too are hard & small. I plan on trying the Chocolate Chocolate Chip next.

review/summary: Worst customer service ever and not durable
review/text: My brewer lasted for three uses. After three uses it no longer pumps any water. I called customer service, because I spent extra money on a commercial brewer, I can only get it fixed through a technician who has a prohibitive call queue.  I have called back a total a five times, and each time I am told that a technician will call me back. This has yet to happen over the last month that I have been trying to fix this. Had I bought a cheaper one from Walmart, this issue would have been resolved already. Do not buy this brewer. If it breaks, expect zero customer service from Keurig and to be out whatever money you have paid for it.

review/summary: I Love This Brewing System For Making Coffee, Tea, Iced Tea, and Hot Chocolate!
review/text: I've had several Keurig brewers in the past and wore each of them out with heavy use. This one is the best one I've ever had! The coffee tastes better to me. I'm not sure why. It's a tiny bit bigger than the other models, but I think it's attractive.<br /><br />In the mornings my machine is a coffee brewer. Then I brew up some tea so I can pour it over ice and I drink iced tea all afternoon. In the evenings I might have hot tea or hot chocolate or more coffee. The best thing is the variety of flavors that are available. You never have to be bored having the same one. I usually start out with Tully's Breakfast blend or maybe their House blend, then after my taste buds wake up, I switch to Italian, which can't be beat! Then there is a Pomegrante tea that makes everything smell great. Sometimes I mix several flavors of tea together just for fun.<br /><br />This is the easiest and fastest way I've found to make coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. I love it!<br /><br />Edited to say that the coffee fills from the left side of the tray. I have put a tiny bowl to the right of where the cup goes so I don't put my cup in the wrong place. Several times I put the coffee cup too far to the right, only to come back a few minutes later and find that the coffee missed the cup.

review/summary: Keurig B155 surprised me and it will surprise you..
review/text: When I first tried Keurig it was a B150 at my new office and the B130 in our affiliates office. Both has a quick and easy way of making coffee while maintaining temperature with each cup. I had used these items for a few months, only to find myself wanting one. While I find the standard models repulsive, The B150 & B155 is a elegant machine that looks modern and has a touch screen to make a dull counter top exciting.<br /><br />You get a fresh tasty cup of coffee within 20 seconds and it is fast and easy to use. I use mine 3 times a day for coffee, hot apple cider (yum) and cocoa which all taste stellar.<br /><br />I do have to say you MUST order your K cups online to get the best deal, but Dunkin Donuts is probably the best coffee that tastes like it came from the store.<br /><br />A great investment and great coffee, you can't beat it!

review/summary: A Robust Java Machine
review/text: I got hooked on K-cups at a customer's plant where I was working.  The coffee was so fresh and great tasting the I was compelled to buy this unit for my home.  It has not failed my expectations.  It has worked flawlessly since I first plugged it in.  The touch screen is a conversation piece when guests are in the kitchen because it rolls through various views of coffee beans, roasting, and the k-cup brewing cycle.  When you put a new k-cup into the holder it shows the screen to select your brew size, then all you have to do is select the size and hit the 'brew' button and you've got a superior cup of coffee.<br />Even the kids love brewing up a cup of hot cocoa.  And, if you don't like coffee or cocoa, try the chai latte (spiced black tea).  There are k-cups available that will please anyone.

review/summary: It imparts plastic taste
review/text: We bought two of these machines. The first one was put into action without running the flushing cycle, so understandably it gave off the plastic taste. But you would think that after a few months, the taste would go away.<br /><br />A few months later, the second unit was bought. This time we meticulously ran it through the flushing cycle. The plastic taste was minimized, but still there. Now after about one month of usage, the coffee it makes still tastes bad.<br /><br />We use the Green Mountain Keurig cups, so I doubt it's the coffee itself. For comparison, I went out and bought McDonald's black coffee (they use Newman's Own), and added sugar and creamer myself. The McDonald's coffee tasted much better, just pure and clean.<br /><br />For another reference point, we used to have a different model of Keurig, and that machine definitely made better coffee than this one. I wouldn't say it made great coffee, but it did not impart plastic taste.<br /><br />I have since resorted to buying my own coffee whenever possible, so it's difficult for me to give this more than one star.

review/text: These are the best olives on the planet! Not just cerignolas,, but *these* cerignolas from The shipping makes them expensive so I try to limit myself to just 4-6 a day, but its hard. They are one of my all-time favorite snacks.<br />One word of warning - they are *extremely* salty in the full-strength brine they come in, so when I transfer them out of their bag into my own container I pour off about a third and just add plain filtered water. It just takes a few hours to pull enough out of the olives to make them heavenly. I don't discount the rating because of the salt though. I just figure it keeps them in such excellent condition on their journey to me.

review/text: These pouches have a tendency to be quite expensive if you go to places like Petco or small boutiques. Our cats personally like all of the flavors that these Wellness pouches come in but we try to order the grain free ones. We don't give them the whole pouch at once and even when they stay in the pouch they don't get as crusted over and stale as when they are in the can. Feeding your cats on the pouches alone however can become rather expensive and we normally supplement the pouches with dry food.

review/summary: Princess: "Do I love this? YES!"
review/text: When Princess came to me, she was on mostly dry food. She didn't seem to interested in her food, and used to dump it into her water before eating it. Her previous foster mum suggested I get her moist food. Then started the search. I purchased cans and pouches. And she didn't seem to interested in most of them. I did find pouches she liked, but they were discontinued. So I found these, and Princess just love them!<br /><br />The thing that Princess likes is the texture. The pouch consists of a square of grain-free food and sauce. The square is about 1cm by 1 cm. The recommendation is to give one pouch per 4 pounds per day, which should be 2 pouches for my 9 pound cat. Well, I tried that, but she put on weight. So I give her 1 pouch per day, plus as much grain free dry food as she likes. She's lean and active, and loves her pouches. I pay an arm and a leg for it, but as long as my Princess is happy, I cannot complain. I've tried cans in the same brand, and she just looks at me like I am crazy. She definitely love this brand, and get different taste every day. And a happy cat makes a happy mum :)

review/text: All three of my cats love this food, this is the only food that they'll finish off in one sitting!<br /><br />My cats were mostly on Pate Style but I was frustrated because I was throwing a lot of it away because they wouldn't finish it all, so I decided to try this out. I purchased a few different flavors but they prefer Tuna the best. They'll eat the Salmon & Tuna but not with as much gusto as the regular Tuna flavor.<br /><br />My female cat who has strange ways of eating her food did not appreciate the size of the chunks so before I opened up the pouch, I squished the food so it was not in large pieces. This also helps the the gravy absorb in the food so it's not a soup. I now squeeze the pouches for all my cats, they like it better this way.<br /><br />Also, if it stays at the $28.56 price on Amazon, it's the exact same price in the stores.

I searched online to learn about a variety of product and decided that Wellness was the way to go.<br /><br />My cat isn't picky about his food per se, but he does have distinct likes and dislikes, he loves this stuff! I switched him to 1/2 cup Wellness Dry food and 1/2 pouch of Wellness Healthy Indulgence.  He always eats the gravy first and then will come back for the meat chunks but he eats everything without fail.<br /><br />The results are what have made me a convert and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. My cat's coat is incredibly soft now and he remains active, alert, and very energetic (not overly!).  The coat is really the one place I see a significant change - he had a great coat before, but after a few weeks on this Wellness combo his coat is even softer and vibrant.

review/summary: If the Princess likes it, so do I.
review/text: Princess gets a pouch of food every morning. I rotate so she doesn't have to get the same every day. She usually have three different at any given time. This was the first time I purchased Turkey and Duck. These seem to be harder to get out of the pouch than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I first shake the pouch to get everything to settle in the bottom, then I pull it open. So far, so good. But when I then turn it over, the food gets "stuck" in the pouch a bit. So I usually make sure I open the opening first and shake it a little bit around, turn it on its head, and start milking it out. That seems to work.<br /><br />The Princess seems to like it, so I will continue buying.

review/summary: The BEST food for your cats
review/text: When we adopted our cats several years ago, our vet told us it was really important to feed them wholesome food from the beginning (they were kittens at the time).  She recommended Wellness brand, so we picked up several of the flavors of both wet and dry food for the cats to try.<br /><br />Both of our cats immediately loved the "nuggets in gravy" style wet food over the more common pate style and we haven't tried a flavor that they won't eat (although they do strongly prefer the seafood flavors over chicken or turkey).  I like the fact that the ingredients are whole foods - no fillers or cheap grains.  Although not in this combination, they're foods I eat myself - salmon, cranberries, flaxseed, zucchini, etc.<br /><br />I consider this food a win-win because the cats love the taste and texture and I love that they are eating whole foods that contribute to their silky, shiny coats and general well-being.

review/summary: Best cat food ever!
review/text: My two cats love this food! In combination with the Wellness Indoor Cat dry food, I think it's the best diet you can feed an indoor cat. My brother, an animal breeder, recently told me that every pet food on the market is full of fillers, preservatives, and substandard ingredients. He changed his tune when he read the ingredients on a package of Wellness.

review/summary: Excellent choice - even for the finicky!
review/text: I decided it was time to start feeding my senior cat a wet food diet. She has a tendency to turn her nose up at most of the "healthy" choices, but she absolutely devoured this one. Several months later, she is still loving it and practically licks the bowl clean!  It has made a world of difference in her energy level, her coat is shiny and it has cut down on the amount of waste in the litter box.  The ingredients are all natural and my vet recommended this as one of the top choices of wet food for my cat.<br /><br />The food is in smaller size chunks with a LOT of gravy.  The pouch is easy to rip open, or can be cut. I highly recommend it as a healthy choice and for your finicky feline :)

review/text: My cat likes the gravy but not so much the bits.  She eats some of them but not many. Update - actually since I published this review months ago I've re-ordered several times because it has become a favorite food.  So if your cat seems disinterested at first, there is still hope she/he will decide it's pretty good after all.

review/summary: My cat's addicted!
review/text: My cat loves the tuna recipe so much, it is the only food she'll gobble down in a single sitting.  Interestingly, she doesn't to be as keen on the other flavors.<br />She seems to especially enjoy the gravy, almost slurping it down!<br />I give her one pouch a day and free-feed her dry, grain-free kibble.  She's healthy and lean, and her coat is silky and luxurious.<br />Maybe it's because I once owned a 96-pound Labrador that ate me out of house and home, but I cannot understand why people would think spending $1 and change per day to feed a pet is expensive...<br />For the price of a soda, you can feed your beloved pet a grain-free, quality cat food.  In reality, the junky, mass-marketed supermarket brands are a real waste of money, because you are paying for filler ingredients and added junk.<br />$1.20 a day is a bargain for the convenience, the quality, what it does for my cat, and how much she enjoys it. I certainly fitter away more than that each day on myself, in the way of "indulgences"!<br />I know that the economy is bad and there are certainly a lot of people who have fallen on hard times, but for those who can afford to keep a pet in the first place, the cost of higher quality food shouldn't be a deterrent.

review/text: Our vet recommended these pouches for our 2 cats to help them loose weight.  Dry food is full of carbs, and he suggested wet food since it's mostly protein and fat - what they would be eating in the wild.  Needless to say our picky felines love the food, their coats are shiny....and we'll see if they loose the extra lbs!  We've also tried other flavors of this food, but this is their fave!

review/text: Definitely healthy & tasty food.  Both my cats really like it. Grain-free, a plus for cats who get "tummy trouble" on cheap food or are just super-picky. No byproducts. BUT, it's REALLY expensive, even when compared to other Wellness produts.  The pouch has a lot of "juice," so even at the same # of ounces, Wellness grain-free canned products have more "food," and are a much better value.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I originally became a fan of pouch-based cat food with the Nutro line of pouches. However, Nutro was especially hit by the nasty recall episode from a few years back where a number of pet food manufacturers had contamination issues, and they eventually pulled their pouches. I tried a bunch of canned foods afterwards, but my cats never warmed to any of them like they did the pouches.<br /><br />Wellness came out with their "healthy indulgence" line of pouch foods not too long ago, and interestingly the packaging is pretty much identical to the Nutro products, down to the notches to facilitate tearing. I can only imagine that they are using the same manufacturing facilities as Nutro did, but hopefully with a superior product. Everything I've read about Wellness suggests that they make high-quality pet foods. My cats seem to love these as much as they did their old pouch foods. They have now been eating pouch foods almost daily for at least 6-7 years, so I don't have any major concerns about long-term health issues.<br /><br />Overall, these pouches are great. Each single pouch is one serving for one cat, so the costs do add up fast if you have multiple cats and serve this twice a day. I give dry food in the morning and the pouches at night to help conserve costs, but they always finish the Wellness pouches within a half hour, whereas the dry food often sits around unfinished all day. Another plus is that no spoons or forks need to be involved, since you just tear each pouch and shake the contents into the bowl. No mess or debates with spouses about putting cat food forks into the dishwasher with the rest of the dishes!

review/summary: Tasty, Grain-Free, and a hit with my cats
review/text: My boyfriend bought a pack as a one-off to tempt his aged kitty- who can be finicky- into eating. His Kitty was uninterested at the time, so I took it home to my little eating machine, who wolfed it down. She's been eating Wellness products almost exclusively for the past two years, and I was interested in finding a gravy-rich wet food in this line. The tuna chunks are substantial - but not too big - and are in a thick, rich gravy. I feed her a mix of 1 pouch of wet food and 1/2 cup of dry daily, and she is both happy and of normal weight. I highly recommend this food for being grain-free, as my cat has had issues with extra fiber clogging her digestive tract in the past, and free of odd, unrecognizable (and unpronounceable) ingredients.

review/summary: Really - don't bother with this!
review/text: A real waste of $$$ - Don't know what I was expecting...the product's own PR only makes vague claims for renewed health after drinking this over 2 days.<br />Didn't bring about any sort of "cleanse" (as in colonic) for me; don't feel any better (or worse); bloating not reduced; energy level still low.<br />Does, indeed, taste horrible but I actually got used to it - it was only for 2 days! Very bitter with a sort of stale oil smell/taste, which might be from the acai since the fluid contains no oil products.<br />The only Maybe Possible good thing is that it keeps you on a schedule, making you very aware of when you're supposed to drink your "cocktail" and what you may have eaten since the last drink...subconciously keeps you a bit more honest on your diet??<br />It didn't harm me, didn't give me gas or headaches, didn't interrupt my sleep or make me jittery - but the same could be said for a lot of low-cal food items (H2O, anyone?).<br />Stick to Vitaminwaters, Lean Cuisines and more exercise!

They taste great and nice treats for kids as well. Summer candy they ain't, and the wax can melt unless shipped with an ice pack. The downside is the shipping price.

I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days, they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis, they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they don't have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient.

review/text: I have been buying Marge's vegan products for a while now in Whole Foods.  When I made the decision to become a vegan, it didn't take long for me to start to miss desserts that had the real stuff.  The taste and texture weren't the same, until I found Marge's.  Their vegan products taste better than the real thing.  Their carrot cake is better than any other that I have had before.  I also like that they use non-GMO oils and organic sweeteners.  It takes the guilt out of giving my kids sweet treats every now and then, and they love eating them. I have purchased their cookies and breads many times and given them as family, friend and client gifts, but I am so excited that I can now order them on Amazon and Marge's will do the work by wrapping and shipping everything for me.  If you are looking for the perfect gift for anyone, vegan or not, Marge's is definitely the answer.

review/text: Not the best gummy rings out there. They are very good though. If you are a hater of sweet don't get them ;). I myself have little to complain about. Huge gummy ring fan. Buy them and enjoy!

review/summary: melted alien blob
review/text: I ordered these along with some of the sour bears to try from this Albanese brand.  I received a box of melted candy that was unrecognizable. It was warm still in Arizona in September, but this was something you would expect to happen to chocolate candy but not to gummi rings or bears.  Be warned if you order this brand in warm months you may open the box to find a scary looking surprise. This has never happened to me with the Haribo brand so I will stick to those from now on.  Amazon did refund the price, they are great about that if you call them up and whine a little.

review/text: This stuff is so tasty, especially the caramel flavor. So easy to make, too. Hard to believe something this good comes from a powdered mix.

review/summary: If You're Gonna Liver....
review/text: Please eat Organic Grass Fed Liver products. They contain the nourishing benefits that make liver worth eating. I had not eaten liver in decades because I didn't want to eat the regular super market variety, but after finding a product not laced with antibiotics, I gave it a try. Very tasty.

review/summary: bad shipping=bad food
review/text: The actual Chestnut Cream itself was wonderful. It is a favorite of my mother's from her home country of France. The problem is not with the product, but with the shipping. The first time I ordered it for her, all six cans were so dented in the box that we were scared to open them. The one piece of packing material,a completely deflated ballon, did not keep the cans from rolling around in a box way to large for them. Amazon did resend us the product at Amazon's expense (best customer service ever!), but once again the bag was nearly flat and the can were very damaged...except one and that one was very tasty though it cost $26. My advice don't buy can goods through the mail.

review/summary: perfectly creamy chestnuts
review/text: I use this fab tasting cream for my prize winning Chocolate Chestnut Torte and I have absolutely no complaints about this product.  I received my package quickly and without damage.<br />I highly recommend Minerve chestnut cream as it is smooth, not at all gritty, blends well and is not too sweet.<br />Great in the ice cream maker for chestnut gelato!
