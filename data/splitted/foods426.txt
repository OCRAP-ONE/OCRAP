review/summary: Very Nice, best green tea I've tasted so far
review/text: This is the best-tasting out of the 5-6 green teas I've brewed so far, but also most expensive. NO stewed cabbage or stem flavors.  Not sure if it is 4 times better tasting than my next favaorite (that's 1/4 price of this.)  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q7RMLA/ref=oss_product

review/summary: Easy, quick, and great tasting capsules
review/text: I bought the Dolce Gusto machine in 2008, and have been an avid fan of the machine and the capsules ever since.<br />While I do have a couple pointers (not quite complaints, but advice to make your Dolce Gusto experience better) that pertain to the machine itself -- and thus the final coffee product -- I feel the capsules themselves are not at fault for any of the machine's problems.<br />After many days of getting used to the machine, I've found that loosely following the recommended milliliter measurements  on the boxes is a good start, and from there it's up to you. Personally, I do just the recommended amount of milk and then pour the espresso until I see the tiniest hint of transparency in the flow. From there I wait anywhere from half a minute to a few minutes (the longer you wait, the more espresso left in the capsule makes it's way to the bottom ready to get the last flush of hot water...but at the same time, the more the foam melts into the coffee), depending on what other busy morning activities I've gotten myself into while preparing the drink, and then push another few seconds worth of espresso out of the capsule. Does this make a world of difference in strength? I doubt it...but it gives me just that much darker of a drink and it makes me feel like I'm getting the most bang for my buck.<br />Ofcourse, the fact that I can get that much more espresso out of the capsule by waiting a bit isn't necessarily all the capsule's fault, but it is truly my only caveat (I also wonder if it's possible to make recyclable capsules...). Either way, unless I've really overdone the amounts of milk or espresso (or haven't gotten back to the machine in time to turn it off), getting a 'watered-down' cappuccino is not possible and, in my opinion, purely an 'operator problem' (see tip above).<br />Also something to note: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee and the final product shouldn't be any more than 35mL. The instructions on the package tell you to pour about 40mL (and there is exactly 8g of espresso in the capsule). In other words, if you overdo the espresso capsule, you'll be getting a noticeably watered down espresso (as for the whole cappuccino, I usually can't tell if I've overdone it a touch).<br />Guests have always commented on the excellent look (use clear glasses for quite the show), feel, and taste of the foam and milk. I have to agree that compared to using other capsule-based machines where one has to purchase an extra milk-frother (and deal with the clean-up, supplies, etc), this system easily produces a comparable (at least) milk and foam experience, with very little hassle (if any).<br /><br />When it comes to flavors, there's been a long-standing tie between Cappuccino and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O">Latte Macchiato</a> in my household. We tend to always have a supply of Cappuccino around with the occasional box of Macchiatto every month or two. Cappuccino is definitely a favorite. Top notch. Never had a problem with a bad after-taste, or at least nothing but the great taste of good espresso.<br />For those who like to know where their coffee comes from: the milk is from France and the coffee capsules are from England (although the actual 100% ground and roasted arabica beans themselves, I don't know). Also, there's 8g of ground coffee in the espresso capsules (the Latte Macchiato has less -- in fact, the Macchiato box recommends 50mL of espresso for a capsule that contains 6.5g...in other words, the amount of espresso that you'd find in a fairly small single shot with the amount of water reserved for a small double shot...perhaps one of the reasons I tend to prefer the Cappuccino).<br /><br />And ofcourse, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the subscribe and save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through subscribe and save), AND factoring in the 10 award points you get with every box (with which you can redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 7 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br />And since I'm a money-saving statistics addict, I'm especially happy about the fact that the online rewards program keeps track of all the points you've ever recorded (thus telling me how many boxes I've ever purchased). This helps me calc. how much money I've saved in total in comparison to, say, Starbucks.<br />All in all, if you're not quite willing to shell out major bucks for a real espresso machine, and have limited counter-space to begin with, the Dolce Gusto machine is an easy choice (they just released new and improved versions, too). **And, as of early October '10, they've revamped their boxes, giving them a classier, more matte-like finish (along with a recycle symbol on the bottom) and a cleaner look in terms of pictures and text. Great improvement to the design, and a fun, refreshing face-lift.**<br /><br />In terms of capsules, the Cappuccino is a solid choice -- a staple in my cabinet.

review/summary: Great Cappuccino! Easy to Make, Fine-tune to your taste
review/text: The cappuccino and the Latte Macchiato are where the Dolce Gusto machine really shines. On the cappuccino, I get a great cup of cappuccino with perfect foam, perfect flavor. I did not expect such quality when I got the machine. The plain espresso & coffee lived up to those expectations; the cappuccino and macchiato blew them away.<br /><br />I have begun to fine-tune the drink to my flavor preference. A little less milk, a little more espresso for some extra strength. Or for a little later in the afternoon, when I want a lighter beverage, I can do more milk less espresso. I like the free that Dolce Gusto gives to make me feel like a barista and have some control over my drink.<br /><br />The cost, since each beverage takes 2 pods, is about a dollar apiece. A bargain, considering the great taste, convenience, and ease of preparation.

review/summary: Totally Opposite Experience
review/text: All I can say is that I've had the complete opposite experience of the only other reviewer so far... the Dolce Gusto Cappuccino we've made with our machine has been excellent and has not had any of the chemical taste that the other reviewer mentioned.  I don't know why our experiences are so divergent, but we are very happy with our unit and with all of the Nescafe Dolce Gusto capsules we've tried thus far.

review/summary: Frothy Cappuccino, No Waiting
review/text: The Cappuccino is a close very close 2nd place as my favorite drink from the Dolce Gusto. (The Chococino is my favorite, because, well, it's got chocolate.) The cappuccino is a rich frothy beverage with just the right coffee kick. I also like not having to wait around for it.<br /><br />I was curious about what was in the coffee capsules so I actually cut one open and, yes, that's real coffee, not powered "instant" coffee.<br /><br />One thing to note about the size of the drinks. The Dolce Gusto Cappuccino is an 8.2 oz drink. In Starbucks' world, this is a "short" drink, which is 8 oz., not a "tall" drink, which is 12 oz. Several years ago, Starbucks started selling customers a "tall" drink when they ordered a small drink, instead of the traditional small drink a "short".

review/summary: Our favorite Dolce Gusto flavor so far
review/text: My wife and I just recently purchased the Dolce Gusto machine and we were very curious about the cappuccino flavor. Since I grew up in Germany, I am very familiar with a typical european cappuccino taste and I had high expectations.<br />I think Dolce Gusto hit this one out of the park. With a little addition of sugar and experimentation of the milk to coffee ratio this capsule can make a delicious cup of cappuccino in about 30 seconds. We are very pleased and can't wait for our free Mocha capsules.

review/summary: Got my husband into "fancy coffee"
review/text: I love the quality and taste of the Dolce Gusto Cappuccino capsules. I recently bought this machine and I love making the different coffee drinks. My husband was formerly not a "fancy coffee" drinker, but these cappuccino capsules have converted him. The milk capsule is perfectly frothed and foamy, and the coffee capsule is a really nice, rich coffee that smells wonderful! I just add some sugar (his preference), stir a second, and top it off with some cinnamon. Because he likes a weaker coffee, I let it brew a few seconds more & fill up his really super-large mugs. Nice. If you don't like your coffee super sweet it's not necessary to add sugar - the milk capsules already have a hint of sweetness to them.<br /><br />The capsules are easy to use, don't make a mess and don't mess the machine. The coffee is brewed in the capsule itself, so there's no leakage to clean up, even though you're using a milk product. The machine came with the capsule bin (which I line with a small plastic bag so I don't have to ever wash it). I simply dump the used capsules into the bin as I use them, then dump the bin bag when it gets full.<br /><br />The only negative is the price. They certainly could be cheaper, but I find it's a pretty good price for a wonderful cappuccino.

review/summary: Very good, especially for a convenience product
review/text: I thought this flavor was very good. It might be my second favorite after the Chococino. I don't add milk or sugar to mine, but just drink it as it comes out of the machine. I do put a little more coffee in the cup...and a little more foam, I just eyeball it. The milky-type beverages are really not my favorite way to drink coffee...I am more of a black coffee/espresso drinker, but these are a nice change. The Nescafe machine makes it worthwhile for someone like me (who wouldn't invest in a big espresso/cappuccino machine) to enjoy these types of coffees at home for myself and for guests.

review/summary: Foamy Deliciousness
review/text: My first choice in coffee is American style, black.  But it's tough to resist a sweet, creamy, rich coffee drink.  Dolce Gusto Cappuccino delivers on all those points.  No, this Cappuccino is not in a league with one made from the very best, most expensive beans, freshly ground.  But against most home machines or stove top contrivances using readily available beans, this cappuccino more than holds it's own.<br /><br />It is creamy, foamy, and mildly sweet.  Which brings up my only complaint with this drink.  I enjoy it more when I add a bit of sugar or simple syrup to the bottom of the cup, before brewing.  Then a slow stir with small spoon is enough to infuse the whole cup with sweetness.

review/summary: My favorite nescafe dolce flavor
review/text: This is my favorite type of cap for the dolce gusto system.  It's fairly versatile and stands up well to our homemade flavor shots as well as an added shot of espresso.  The macchiato may be a bit more flavorful by default, but it doesn't hold up well to these other scenarios.  I love this stuff with a liberal squirt of mint syrup (equal parts sugar & water boiled, then add a tea bag full of peppermint and steep for a while).

review/summary: Just not very good!
review/text: If you enjoy making cappuccino's with your Dolce Gusto, I would suggest just buying the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Espresso, 16-Servings (Pack of 3)</a> and heating/frothing your own milk. The milk pod just didn't have a nice flavor in my opinion. Perhaps my pod was heat damaged, but it tasted sour. Unfortunately, I had to dump it down the sink because it really was that terrible and couldn't be saved.<br /><br />Since Nescafe states that the dark pod is espresso, I would be confident ordering a box of the espresso pods and frothing 1% milk with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G9N94E">BonJour Primo Latte Frother, Rechargeable Includes Electric Base</a>. I use this all the time to make cappuccino's at home and they are far better in flavor than this product.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the milk pods are supposed to be identical between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI36">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Chococino, 8-Servings (Pack of 3)</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Latte Macchiato, 8-Servings (Pack of 3)</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI22">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Cappuccino, 8-Servings (Pack of 3)</a>. Unfortunately for me, the Cappuccino milk pods were awful tasting compared to the milk pods for the other products. I just assume that my box was heat damaged, resulting in an undesirable flavor. Your experience might be different.

review/summary: Great Cappuccino
review/text: I really like this cappuccino.  It is very tasty.  We add a little Torani flavoring to ours.  The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because the Skinny version is better, less calories.<br /><br />This cappuccino is better than any K-Cup.  It's like going to Starbucks, but at home.

review/summary: Addicted to my Nescafe Dulce Gusto
review/text: Love all the Dulce Gustos but not crazy about hot choc. Cappuccino & iced Cap are best! Sipping a hot one while I speak! Love latte, too, but not vanilla latte. Dark Roast is my favorite "daily." Thank heavens Amazon offers it and much more affordable prices than anyone else - trust me, I've researched. Best price is on subscription, and so much fun to receive. Great packing and speed - always get before projected date. It's almost affordable! But it's part of my "champagne taste" condition! I'll try peach tea - yum - next summer.

review/text: We love dolce gusto cappucino, the espresso flavor is pure and the milk capsule is perfect.  Truly people  would think that you steamed the milk in the steamer..I purchase dolce gusto "only" from amazon.  Forget ordering from the Dolce Gusto Co. or Bed Bath and Beyond, you pay way too much money.  I use the subscribe order, very easy and saves me money.

Still, you can't beat the convenience of the coffee and the convenience of the delivery, which ensures that we never run out.  Note:  very little difference between the macchiato and the cappuccino. Nescafe, when will you make chai for the Dolce Gusto system?

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that this made a frothy cup of cappuccino, all from a capsule. It wasn't as strong as I had hoped, but if you play around with the amount of water used, you can make it stronger.<br /><br />I gave it four starts because having froth in your cappuccino is a critical component, a key ingredient. And,I've never had such froth without using a steamer for my milk or a hand pumped frother.

review/text: After about a year of subscribing to this product (Nescafe Dolce Gusto Cappuccino), my wife started to complain about the flavor is becoming lighter and lighter. I don't normally use this product, but I have to agree with her after I tasted it. Does this have to do with the gas price going up? I don't know, maybe there is a connection. These days, if a product does not go up on price, something got to go down. Sorry, I have to cancel my subscription.

review/summary: Great Tasting Coffee
review/text: The coffee is great tasting but is expensive in my book. If Nestle hadn't sent me the machine for free I wouldn't have bought it. It leaks and is not a great machine for an office. Our office doesn't like it because you have to keep going to the bathroom to refill it with water because it only holds two cups worth of water. It does make a hot cup of coffee in a very quick time though.

review/summary: Gas Station "Cappuccino"
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>I am more of an espresso/americano guy, but every now and then I really love a good cappuccino. This beverage tastes like the "Cappuccino" you would get out of a gas station machine or a vending machine. The milk has a slightly weird taste and it is sweetened! Why not let customers add sugar to taste rather than over sweeten the product? The drink is not strong or bold and as a little on the watery side when made according to the included instructions. It leaves you feeling really full and heavy not like a true cappuccino you would find in a local coffee shop. If you really want a cappuccino and have one of these machines, I think you'd be a lot better pulling an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA">Espresso</a> shot and adding your own fresh milk (yes, that does mean you'll need to froth it!).<br /><br />Note regarding video: the reason the saucer is cracked is due to bad product packaging for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA21Q0">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Machine</a>. This is how it arrived to me.

review/summary: Disappointed, tastes like coffee creamer
review/text: I like my espresso drinks. I wouldn't say I am an expert but I have at least one mocha (whole milk, half choc) daily from Kaldis, Starbucks or my new thing is making it on my office DeLonghi 32Bar Pump Espresso machine.<br />I wanted to like the Dolce Gusto Cappuccino, I really did. I wanted the no mess option for my home kitchen. It would save me money, it would save me time. So I read the reviews and I purchased it after serious consideration.<br />I am disappointed. All I could taste when I drank it, was a sort of powdered milk taste - it reminded me of coffee creamer which I never drink (the last time was stuck waiting for a car service at Midas three or four years ago). So if you really like your espresso and froth, this will not cut it. If you were having a party and your guests were not foodies, or wanted coffee in the morning in a rush, or if you don't mind the taste of coffee creamer, then this is not the worst espresso drink I have ever had. It compares to an average restuarant that serves this type of drink BUT does [not] compare to a coffee house despite the claims on the box.<br />See my review on the Cafe Lungo option if you want to know what it tastes like when you remove the milk capsule as a factor...

review/summary: Middle of the road
review/text: I would not rate this as my least favorite of the available flavors available for the Dolce Gusto coffee machine, but somewhere in the middle overall.  We do not drink more than a cup of coffee in a given day, but some of us do like frou-frou coffee now and then.<br /><br />I found that leaving the milk out made it have a more acceptable taste and flavor, otherwise it seemed to have a sight aftertaste.  I personally am not a cappuccino/espresso expert by any means, so I am not sure if that is normal or not.  I actually prefer my coffee served black, with no sugar, creamer/milk, so I am probably a little more biased when it comes to rating something like this.

review/summary: Try them first
review/text: Everyone's tastes are different. With that said, I would definitely recommend trying these first.  I tried Nescafe cappuccino pods (along with some other flavors) in the machine I bought that uses these pods.  Really wanted to like them but they were AWFUL.  Bitter, synthetic--like something from a vending machine.  The cappuccino maker has been returned to Amazon; unfortunately, the pods are a grocery item so not eligible for return.  I have two boxes--50 dollars' worth--sitting in the box they arrived in--feel like I put fifty bucks into my office shredder. Bottom line is, should have tried them before ordering any equipment/pods off the internet. Save your cash--try them first!

review/summary: Green Tea with Jasmine, Nothing Else!
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea. Perfect!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip."<br /><br />It sounds quite romantic, and this is a romantic tea, unusual and delicious. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

Then while at the Whole Foods on the other side of town, bought some fresh ground honey peanut butter!  I had to hide these pretzels because everyone was eating them!  Saying they were the BEST they had ever had!  They truly ARE wonderful!

review/summary: Best GF Pretzel
review/text: I want to thank everyone who currently has a review for this product on Amazon; because of you I sought these out today and I am currently enjoying them.  I was suffering from a lack of crunchy, salty snacks that were also healthy and gluten free.  These pretzels are so good that all my GF haters that live with me love them too!  Unfortunately it only comes in an 8 oz. size bag.  Nutritional facts: 30g (about 20 sticks) is a serving, with 120 calories, 1.5g fat, 330mg sodium, 2g dietary fiber, sugars less than 1g, protein less than 1g. No bad aftertaste, truly tastes like a pretzel, they are crunchier than regular pretzel sticks. Found these @ Giant Food for $2 a bag (healthfood aisle). Ordering from the Snyder's of Hanover website would have cost me $3.51 a bag with s&h, and they were even more expensive on Amazon.

review/summary: Crispy perfection!
review/text: I just purchased a bag of these at a local health food store. They are fabulous! Extra crispy, lightly salted, perfecto! My husband who is not gluten free loved them too. Said he couldn't tell the difference from regular. I too paid half the price only $3.49. Would be nice if Amazon could bring us a "by the case" value price for these.

review/summary: Awesome Pretzels for Celiacs
review/text: I've been a pretzel lover since I was little and after being diagnosed with Celiacs was very disappointed at the prospect of never having my beloved pretzels again.  Until, that is, I discovered these at my local grocery store.  I am so happy to report that they taste exactly like a regular pretzel (they are a little bigger then standard stick pretzels but that makes them more hearty)  These are fantastic and a staple in my house.  I frequently catch my other family members snacking on these even though I keep probably 4-5 bags of standard pretzels in the house at all times.  These are just fantastic!

review/summary: better than "regular"!!!
review/text: I am lucky that I am *not* gluten intolerant but for health reasons I'm trying to limit my gluten intake. This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I've tried and like Snyder's non-GF pretzels in many of the different varieties like Butter Snaps, Pumpernickle, and regular Sticks and Twists.<br /><br />Of ALL the pretzels I've tied , these are the BEST.<br /><br />They are crispy and a little harder than the regular sticks; they are a little less salty than the regular kinds as well with just a bare hint of sweetness. They taste what I'd call very homemade in a way I can't exactly put my finger on, but definitely not a run of the mill taste.<br /><br />For comparison, I've tried the Glutino GF Pretzels which are also VERY good but at generally a much higher price per bag. They are pretty much on par with quality of flavor even though the tastes are very different. The Synder's brand is definitely something special.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: They taste like pretzels!
review/text: They're a little harder to bite into than regular pretzels, but they still have all of the taste!  However, it kind of stinks that the only way to buy them on Amazon (thus far) is in bulk, and even with the 36 dollar price tag, S&H added an additional 10 dollars, making it roughly 4 bucks for an 8 oz bag.  That isn't on par with regular pretzels insofar as price is concerned.  But they still are on par with regular pretzels as far as taste goes.

review/summary: Slightly fruity overtones, a nice tea
review/text: I've been working my way through the Octavia organic black tea collection.  The Ancient Yunnan is the third one I've tried, and it is quite nice.  I found it to have somewhat fruity overtones, which isn't really what I'm looking for in my black tea -- that's why I give it a 4, just because its not really my favorite flavor.  The price was great (I think this was the most economical Octavia organic black tea), quality of the tea is excellent, and I definitely like the tin that Octavia uses for their teas.  I think I'll try Irish Breakfast next...

review/summary: Great for small dogs--one pouch a day
review/text: I have a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs around 10 lbs at the most. I have mostly fed her Mighty Dog in the can. She recently had to have almost all of her teeth extracted except for 2. She had a hard time eating the Mighty Dog because it is all chunked together like Spam. Even when I mashed it up, she had trouble eating it and scraping it out of her bowl.<br /><br />I started feeding her Pedigree Senior in the pouches. She likes it and where it had a little gravy in it it made it easier for her to eat. For the most part, it slides right out of the pouch although sometimes some of the food gets stuck in the little pocket at the bottom.<br /><br />One pouch a day is plenty for her. She loves it. We tried the new beef flavor with gravy and she actually likes it more than the Lamb and Rice but the beef flavor gives her diarhea really badly. She has never gotten diarhea from any other dog food so after I feed her the case I am switching back to this variety.<br /><br />This fills her up, is easy to eat, is quick and convenient for me to give her, and it seems to be really easy on her stomach.<br /><br />Highly recommend this for any small dogs. Grade A from me.

review/summary: Better pouch design needed
review/text: I have a 10 y/o chihuahua and she really likes this. It is little tiny cubes of dog food mixed with rice. She has lost most of her teeth yet she is able to eat this easily. The cubes are easier to eat then the typical wet dog food that is in a can and then you have to mash up--she can grab onto the cubes easily.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that the pouches are designed in a way that makes some of the dog food stick to the bottom of the pouch. The bottom is concave so it is like a little pocket that traps food.<br /><br />But I would recommend this for anyone with a small dog who is getting up in years. Especially if you have a dog w/ dental problems or who has lost teeth. My dog weighs about 10 lbs and one of these pouches a day along with a dog treat is plenty enough for her.

review/summary: Convenient and the four-legged one loves it.
review/text: Our older Tibetan Terrier has been losing weight recently, although our other two dogs happily maintain their size on dry food.  The vet suggested that due to her advanced years, our TT might need canned food which is easier to eat.  Pedigree Healthy Maturity in the pouch is the right size for a meal, and has been part of returning her to a healthy weight.  She considers it a treat, and becomes very excited when my husband opens the pouch and pours it out for her.  Getting these pouches by the case through Amazon is cost effective and extremely convenient, we'll be purchasing more.

review/text: I got this to add to an older dog's daily dry food and to entice my father's very spoiled Chihuahua to eat actual dog food. The Chihuahua has been eating people food for a couple of years and as a result regards dry food as poison. After three days of offereing this Pedigree morsels mixed with some dry food, Miss Picky is now eating both the dry and the canned food happily. Can't ask for much more than that. Oh and it doesn't have that funky odor so many canned foods are afflicted with.

I recommend it for any older dog that needs to put on a little weight and get the nourishment to keep up their energy.

Ours will--including shoes, cardboard boxes, electrical cords, and our clothing (not that we put these things in front of him; he tracks them down). We got Pedigree Little Champions Healthy Maturity Morsels in Sauce with Lamb & Rice because our senior dog, who is medium fussy, seems to like lamb and rice meaty loaf, but it's not always available. The morsels are small, but she still isn't interested. The puppy, on the other hand, seems to think that this stuff is the dog's bow-wow.

Each has 260 calories, 11 grams of fat, 4 grams of fiber, 9 grams of sugar, and 7 grams of protein.<br />It is really delicious as everyone before me has said.

review/summary: Caution, these are not real vanilla beans
review/text: While you might think these are real vanilla beans from their flavor, I want to assure you that these are jelly beans, not the real thing. The difference is that you can eat these.<br /><br />They really give a full flavored vanilla taste, it reminds me of hand cranked vanilla ice cream. I close my eyes and can remember hot summer days with grandma and grandpa and the ice cream maker you all took turns cranking. It was hard work, but so worth it. Fortunately, I can enjoy these without the tiniest bit of work!<br /><br />I originally received a complimentary package of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a>. Since I have the fortune of being the only one in my house to eat jelly beans, I am savoring each flavor and my latest has been this one. This gives me a chance to focus on the flavor, and I must admit that I enjoy each one of the vanilla ones even more as I anticipate the flavor. It starts out soft, then increases. These aren't for eating in handfuls for a sugar high, these are honestly delightfully vanilla.<br /><br />David is the creator of the original Jelly Belly and when he re-entered the field of candy-making, he set out to make something even better. It is my opinion that he has achieved his goal, and I am very excited to see what flavors he comes up with next!

review/summary: Very Natural Tasting - Highly Recommended
review/text: These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet "Vanilla Bean" jelly beans have a very natural vanilla flavor and are one of my favorites. These are also excellent when paired with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007J6KLAW">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Root Beer Jelly Beans</a>.<br /><br />This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous "Jelly Belly" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> to review since my family loves jelly beans.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Great Quality, happy dog
review/text: We have a 1.5 year old Shar-pei/Pitbull mix rescue.  She came to us with a ton of allergy and stomach issues.  She was so sad as she had hot spots, swollen eyes, missing fur and irregular bowel movements.  Well we started her first on a bag of Precise Pork and Garbanzo Grain Free and it worked great for her.  Then I started hearing about Horizon Legacy, did my own research and decided to make a switch (mainly due to the much higher protein content).  Could not be happier.  She is on her second 28.7lb bag and she is thriving.  Her coat looks and smells great.  No more hot spots, and the ones she does get seem to appear and dry out the same day.  Being in Texas we cannot avoid the allergy issue entirely during allergy season but I cannot say enough good things about this dog food. Does not seem to be well known in my area as it is hard to find.  Made in Canada by a small family owned company.  Like other independently owned and run brands like Precise and Stella and Chewys their ingredients are locally sourced and these brands are never found on the pet food recall lists that are released.<br /><br />The price is very high, but you get what you pay for.  If your dog is sensitive to allergies like mine then this is worth a try.

review/summary: Fantastic Dog Food
review/text: Great ingredients, completely grain and gluten free.  This is the Bentley of dog kibbles.  My dog has severe allergies, other high end foods have not been pure enough for him.  Even BARF and other alternative diets have not worked.  We do a mixture of this kibble and home cooked, and it has saved his life.  I cannot recommend this food enough!  I recommend it to everyone!

review/summary: Zesty
review/text: I usually buy orange and lemon zest for cooking, when I don't make my own. I decided to get this for a new toothpaste recipe I picked up. Yeah, that sounds strange, but if you make your own toothpaste you don't have to worry about how much fluoride you are getting in it, and it is probably one-eighth the cost of commercially prepared products.<br />I decided if I was getting fluoride in tap water, I didn't need it in my toothpaste also. And now I am not sure I need it at all. It sure didn't seem to prevent cavities for me. So, since I can't find non-fluoridated toothpaste under $6 a tube at the store, I am going to be going for the Zesty life. Their lemon zest is great also!

review/summary: Corn that is comparable to other brands...
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040PZ20O">Libby's Creamy Style Corn, 8.5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />This is good creamed corn to serve at mealtime or to add to recipes...I like to add a small can or half a large can to my cornbread and adjust the liquid called for...I bake the bread as usual and it comes out great...The corn really enhances the flavor and is tasty in other cornmeal recipes...Whole kernel corn will work as well but the creamed corn is better...MMMMMM!  I like having the creamed corn on hand altho I don't use it as often as other canned vegetables...It's flavorful and a good buy for me with Amazon Prime...

review/summary: 8.5oz Can Is A Rare Size
review/text: The 8.5oz size is perfect for my collection.  It is hard to come across Libby's in this size.  The 12 pack is great, but if you're buying from Amazon to eat the corn I'd suggest the larger size - its a better value.  If you're just buying to put in the pantry this size is a great addition to your collection!

review/summary: Cream Style Corn
review/text: My primary attraction for this product is the small can.  The corn is of average quality, but it better suits the need of a person preparing meals for one.  The quantity is about right for making a small pan of 'Southwestern' style corn bread. The cans come shrink wrapped on a corrugated 'flat' that makes storage easy.
