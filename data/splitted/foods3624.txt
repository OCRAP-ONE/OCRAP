review/summary: this is gross!
review/text: I puchased this out of curiosity, & to try it once.  I will never buy this again.  It has a funky taste, like tap water & I HATE tap water, it also tastes as tho there's lead or murcury in it.  I will stick to my bottled water--which is CLEAR, CRISP, CLEAN---what water should be.

review/summary: Swamp Water
review/text: So I am drinking this water with my family right now and I am seriously concerned that we are all about to die.  The amount of fulvic acid that some people are considering good for them makes my anus feel like it is about to explode about 30 minutes after drinking a bottle. That being said, I am considering ordering a case for my next cult suicide.  (Yes, Next) Now, on the subject of "Enjoy the Dark Side" I find that even comparing the god awful taste of this water to something as mild as the sith (compared to the water of course) is just insulting. Also, on the subject of my grammar that last sentance, it's possibly a side effect of the water's terribly written website, and the chemicals from all of the decaying plant matter that makes up 90% of the bottle. Now, on to that suicide.

review/summary: fulvic acid is dangerous
review/text: Producers of BLK have recently changed their bottler (and water source), removing the "spring water" from the label.  If these people have mixed fulvic acid with any municipal source containing chlorine or fluoride, it could be carcinogenic.  Please do your homework on fulvic/humic acids mixing with chlorine and flouride before you ingest this.  And do not use it if you are undergoing any therapy (chemo, etc.) that compromises your immune system.

review/summary: Don't believe the hype!!
review/text: Unless you are very gullible and easily conned into trying something new based on false advertising claims you won't even bother to try this fancy bottled water with black plant scum added to it. Listen...<br /><br />"So, black water marketers have taken the sciencey angle to target the new age and organic folks and the alternative medicine subscribers. All bases covered! But wait, they also appeal to real housewives. Jacqueline Laurita on Real Housewives of New Jersey says, "Scientists called it [fulvic acid] the miracle molecule because it's so small." She added that drinking blk. water would make your hair, nails, and skin glow and could also help with hangovers. Wow! I bet it cleans my car too. What doesn't it do?<br /><br />Black water has a dark side, for sure. It's a gimmick. Once you learn the sales pitch used to market useless dietary supplements or overpriced, overhyped food stuffs, you can begin to understand sciencey market-speak pretty easily. There is much of it in the organic aisle of the supermarket.<br /><br />I can't conclude that any of us needs fulvic/humic acid supplements, and there currently is no evidence I have found to support that the "miracle" fulvic acid does anything to benefit your health. I would predict that the oddness of the black water products and the price, combined with no observable benefits to the consumer, will likely result in this fad fading away. But give them a prize for their stylish, sciencey black marketing."

review/summary: Blk Water, pretty good actually
review/text: I happened upon this water at my health food grocery after working out this evening.  I drank half the bottle before looking down and realizing that the black was not decorative packaging but actually the color of the water!  It doesn't taste like plain water, but not so unlike plain water that you think you are drinking something else...it tastes like water with a little extra mineral in it and it is not sparkling, by the way.<br />I'll have to say I was surprised to find myself liking it.  I had a mild sore throat (cold maybe coming on?) and a painful cold sore starting in my mouth.  The blk water made the area a little numb/tingling (like hydrogen peroxide does when put on a cut to disinfect) at first and then...after a minute or so the cold sore didn't hurt and my throat didn't either anymore.  I'm not one for miracle cures, etc, but this made me feel pretty good.<br />I don't know anything about Fulvic Acid, so I looked it up and it seems people are pitching it as the new "superfood" supplement; that said it's hard to find much factual information on how exactly it is helpful or not for humans.

review/text: It's hard to believe people sat in a room and thought this would be a good idea. It's a terrible idea peddled as modern day snake oil. Look at the price, over $2.29 a bottle. It's black and psychologically nasty looking. People can say it looks like coffee all they want, but coffee smells like coffee and this is supposed to be water. Water is meant to be clear, pure and cleansing. This product fails on every level. I'm sure the positive reviews are friends and family. I would expect to see this as a joke product at Spencer's gifts. Avoid it.

review/text: I tasted it. . .tastes kind of metallic like, not favorable to me. I am not bothered by the black color of the water but I am bothered by WHY it's black. Fulvic acid is found in the poorly drained parts of the humus in swamps, SOOO why would I drink this? It has great health properties for the body but during the separation the Fulvic acid looses much of what Humic acid has that is better for the body. . .I just cannot drink soiled cleaned swamp water. . .it can be green or purple with sparkles in it and I will not do it. I am sure they extract the Fulvic acid from aquatic humus which is mosty FA anyway but still. . . .I have lived 30 good years on this planet, eating my fruits and veggies, exercising and such and have had no problems. . .just because something is marketed as being good for you doesn't mean that it is for every one. . if you like it, kudos, if you don't, kudos. . .If indeed I want fulvic acid and the benefits of humic acid and humus in general, there is a swamp by my school which I am sure has enough humus for me to consume. . . .

review/summary: Doesn't taste bad at all!  These other people are crazy
review/text: I work at a grocery store and we just barely started carrying the blk water.  After seeing several people buying it the past couple weeks, I decided I had to get one and try it.  I was totally expecting it to have some kind of bitter taste or something just because of how black the water was.  I have to say though, it doesn't taste bad at all--it tastes just like tap water.  It has a very slight metallic taste to it if you try to pick a flavor out, but other than that it's not anymore noticeable than the water you get out of the faucet (and we have pretty good water in our city).  I don't know what kind of water these other reviewers were drinking because their descriptions of how awful and nasty the blk water is are way exaggerated.  I think they were going for more of a shock factor than being realistic.

review/summary: Not as bad as some say but a little confusing
review/text: I drank a bottle of blk in the dark so that the color wouldn't influence my opinion. First thing I noticed was a slightly bitter taste. It wasn't so bad and I drank most of a 16.9 oz bottle with no problem. There was a slight after taste as well. If the health benefits of this drink are real, I think they need to do something with the formula to make it more appealing to a larger mass of people. I like sparkling mineral water and I drink it because it contains those trace minerals that some bottled waters lack, and because I can still get some bubbles and not have all the sugar found in soda. I'm not 100% sure of the health benefits. Maybe offering a sparking version of this with some natural flavor like lemon would make this more appealing. I can understand the aversion that some people have. Dark, like a cola, yet a little bitter like hard water. It's a little confusing to the senses.

review/text: I bought it at my local grocery store as I was looking for a particular coconut water and I came across this as I know alkaline water is suppose to be better for you than just filtered water. So I picked it up and was scared to drink it because I was afraid it would have some sort of taste to it. I have drank water with charcoal before and so I thought it might taste like that but it is purely tasteless. It taste just like plain water. I haven't done much research yet on fulvic trace minerals so I can't speak too much on that and their website is launching in 42 days as I write this. I would drink it again and research the benefits. The color is off putting and it is very mental as to why people say it has a taste and they can't drank it or maybe I am just used to drinking alkaline, mineral enhanced water, I don't know. I'll buy it again too.

It smells like an old penny that has been at the bottom of your purse. So, I grinned and took a sip. It has a thick and oddly slimy consistency. It doesn't even TASTE like water.

review/summary: Like Water, But Better! Love At First Sip!
review/text: First of all, I'm the type of person who wants to try everything! Some of my favorite foods are what other people won't even touch. Anyway, I heard about BLK water a long time ago and have been wanting to try it since I found out about it. I actually found it at a local health foods store and was so excited that I bought a few bottles to try out. These bottles were stored at room temperature, but when I took my first sip, it was actually cool. I have no need to refrigerate this water because it quenches my thirst just fine.<br /><br />When I opened my first bottle I took a sniff to see if it smelled metallic or dirty, but I could smell absolutely nothing. And I really don't know why all these reviews say there's a horrible metal aftertaste or that they'd rather drink car oils. Yes, this water is black, but so are a bunch of sodas, and those are completely terrible for you! I'll bet that if you took a drink of BLK blindfolded you wouldn't notice any difference in the purity of the taste of this vs any other water. As for those that preach that there are no health benefits to this water, at least there are no risks. I've seen some questions on other sites regarding the color of urine after drinking BLK and I am going to be flat out honest. I can drink a few bottles of regular water and my urine will still be a pale yellow, but after just one bottle of BLK, my urine is very near clear.<br /><br />As for comparing other bottled waters, I'd have to say this is the freshest water I've tasted. Other bottled waters I've tasted have a strange chlorinated taste to it and make my mouth a little dry except for maybe FIJI, but even FIJI doesn't taste cool when stored at room temperature. When I was in my college class I had finished up my bottle of BLK and went to refill at the water fountain that I always fill my empty cups and bottles with and THAT made me want to gag. After having BLK, I really noticed the taste of the city's tap. It tasted strongly of metals and chlorine. Usually, after having any other bottled water, I don't notice a difference when switching to tap. BLK has made me realize that the city's water is contaminated with all sorts of disgusting stuff!<br /><br />All these other reviewers who say that they'd much rather sip on motor oil obviously have never drank anything this healthy and aren't used to its pure taste. The fact that this water is black should not scare you into thinking BLK is worse than fuel. I'm more scared of the awful chemicals in regular tap!

review/summary: Overpriced and nothing special
review/text: I gave this water a 2star because, while the black color didn't bother me as much as some people. I tried it to see if it made any difference in my energy or helped with a health condition. I can honestly say it made no difference whatsoever. So that is why I gave it the 2stars. It is very expensive water, for doing nothing for me. Hope it helps out some other people. But, wanted to be truthful. Did nothing for me, to spend that kind of money on water.

review/summary: Best water on market
review/text: I had no idea this water was black, I thought it was just the packaging and as I was driving had no idea until I looked down, shocked to see that the plastic bottle was indeed transparent. So, completely unbiased, I thought that the water tasted just like another alkaline water ('Alka Pure') which is in the same price bracket. I have no idea as to the veracity of claims fulvic minerals are good for you or not but the taste of this water (and the cool fact that it is indeed black) put it at the top of my list for expensive bottled water. No idea what people are talking about that the taste is 'salty' or weird, it obviously has a slightly metallic taste because of the mineral content which I vastly prefer over the calcium-softness or chorine-tinged waters available by tap or cheap mass production. Hope that common sense will prevail over the overwhelmingly negative reviews this product seems to get; if people can look past the black (which I think is its chief selling point!) then I think consumers will ultimately champion this water.

review/summary: Best tasting bottled water I've ever had.
review/text: If you want to really taste water, drink it at room temperature. Drinking water cold deadens your taste buds.<br />Besides drinking water directly from a spring, this is the best tasting water I've ever had. I drink it all the time.<br /><br />One critical thing to note:<br />Recently I noticed that the labels on the bottles at the grocery store changed from "spring water" to "filtered water".<br />The stuff in the new (filtered water) labels does not taste as good. I hope they put it back the way it was.

review/summary: Shocker! Tastes just like water.
review/text: I read some of the other reviews and I just don't get it. I could not detect any grittiness or aftertaste. It tasted just like plain water. I do not know the full benefits of fulvic acid, but I intend to try more of this. After all, I'm from New Jersey. So, "blk" looks like I just scooped up a bottle of water directly from one of our polluted rivers. I intend to drink it on hikes while friends and relatives are watching just so I can elicit some shock value. Very cool, novel idea. Downside: It's a little pricey.

review/summary: From an actual purchaser of the product!
review/text: I ordered the blk water about a month ago but was afraid to try it!  I finally opened the box and stocked the fridge with it.  A few days later, I cracked open my first bottle and took my chances.  I gotta say, this was good water.  It tasted like regular water with NO discernable aftertase (closer to Dasani than Ice Mountain which, I think, has a NASTY aftertaste).  I've read the reviews here about an oily or muddy texture or flavor and honestly, I don't know what those people are talking about.  I've got a pretty sensitive palate and neither me nor anyone in my family detected any residual mouth feel.  My only gripe was the bottles looked pretty beat up. It's a nice heavy plastic bottle with a rich sheen to it, but my bottles were quite scratched up -- especially around the top curve.  It just cheapened the feel for me.  Since I have to order the product from Amazon -- at $55 a case, with S&H, I'm not sure I'll be reordering. If I could find it at a retailer here in Chicagoland, I'd definitely repurchase, because it's so cool looking -- and could make a really fun cocktail.

I wish the fact that this is an export version would be mentioned in the product description.

review/summary: Tasty, filling, but only four servings per box.
review/text: I am not on a gluten free diet. However, I find gluten free foods more filling. And so, I gave these crackers a try, after coming across them in my grocery store. I like the original and cheddar flavours the best (the cheddar flavour is very delicate).I find the vegetable variety to taste more herby then "vegetably" (is that a word? ;o) ).<br /><br />1) I have not experienced the breakage problem some mention. Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum! They scoop well once you get a hang of it (they are flaky and will break more often then regular crackers would in the same situation).<br />3) The box is made of 100% recycled material, for those to whom this matters.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: There is a warning on the label that says they may contain traces of soy, milk, and sesame, in case anyone is alergic. Also, they do contain eggs.

review/text: It's great to have a choice of flavors when it comes to gluten free crackers.  For the longest time, I could only find plain or onion.  Now, Glutino makes a multigrain, a cheddar, the original flavor, and this vegetable flavor.  We've tried all of them, and while this is our least favorite, it's still good.  They are much different from a saltine or butter cracker, much more starchy tasting, but the kids don't seem to mind.  I would like to see them improve the packaging so there is less breakage.

review/text: These have the texture of a ritz cracker. Thy are strong enough to hold cheese, be dipped, use for appetizers, and any other use you can think of. The flavor is mildly herb-like, and reminds me of a hearty cracker. The taste does not overpower the cracker, so it can be paired with any type of food seamlessly. The box has two separate bags inside of it, which is good for keeping the crackers fresh. But around here, the crackers never last more than a day or two. I highly recommend these crackers for those with gluten tolerance problems. Even our GF family members love them!

But once I bit into one, it did not satisfy my expectations. It tasted like an herby, pepper cracker. I couldn't even finish one cracker. But other members of my family liked them, and others think them so, so. I like the cheddar flavor, but now I am hesitant to try any of the other flavors. Also there is so much corn in them! If you look at the ingredients, the first one listed is Corn Starch. Being allergic to corn I can only have these crackers in small amounts. I think these crackers might taste better with some tomato sauce, but I prefer the cheddar flavor and I suggest you buy that flavor and skip this flavor! :(

review/text: I picked up a couple of these while I was visiting my brother in LA. When I took my first bite, I thought, "Hey, these kind of taste like a ritz cracker! Cool!"<br /><br />The second and third cracker though, I noticed a really starchy, floury taste coming through. I looked at the ingredients. Corn starch was the first ingredient.<br /><br />I tend not to like gluten free products made mostly from corn starch. They are light, sure, but kind of flavourless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.<br /><br />Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it's an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.<br /><br />Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that's why it gets used a lot.<br /><br />If you liked white flour, starchy foods before you went gluten free you might like these. If you prefer whole grains or even actual flour (not just the starch) I would try something else. I like Christie's multigrain crackers or brown rice thins.

review/summary: Best gluten free crackers
review/text: I've tried many gluten free crackers and the ones by Glutino are without a doubt the best ones.  They are tasty, crisp and thick enough to hold up under cheese and fruit. They are a bit pricey for the small amount of product, but well worth it.  I love the two bag packaging, keeping them fresh longer.

review/summary: The only GF bread that tastes like real bread, IMHO
review/text: Okay, after 6 years gluten free and trying every GF food product I can find, these little rolls are one of the only REALLY good GF bread products I have encountered. They are easy to prepare (8 min in my toaster oven works perfect-o)and they taste like real bread -- not dry crumbly and flavorless like most GF breads.<br />My only wish is that Schar made them in the size of hoagie (sub) rolls with sesame seeds on top so that I could make a real sub sandwich again. (Are you listening Schar?)<br />I used to do all the GF bread mixes from scratch in my bread machine, and some are pretty decent, but these little rolls are WAY better. In fact, they taste much better than any of Schar's other breads -- weird, I know, but try them and you will see.

review/text: These rolls are great.  Bake them and then add some butter.  Who needs wheat, anyway?  They are not too dry or too hard.  They are just right.  I am going with an egg sandwich tomorrow morning.<br /><br />The downside is that they are pricey in the store ($1.00 per roll).  It's hard to believe they really need to be priced like that as it is a very simple product.

review/summary: Great Multi-Purpose Roll
review/text: Most GF bread that I've tried is not very palatable to me for various reasons.  If you've tried it, you probably already know what I mean.  Not so with these little rolls, they're are actually tasty!  They come 4 in a plastic pouch, not compartmented, just all in there together.  Once opened, the extra's (if there are any) keep well in the fridge.  Each roll is on average 3 inches square, and around 2 inches thick.  Fairly light density.  Not pre-sliced.  Soft, porous interior.  Lightly browned top and bottom.  They come lightly dusted on the outside with GF flour.  Texture is similar to wheat bread.  Taste is light, mildly yeasty, and not overly sweet.  This roll is good as a dinner roll, small burger bun, small sandwich roll, etc.  Unopened, they are shelf stable.  The last order that I placed with Schar, I received in mid October 2011, with a "best before" date of March 5, 2012.  The rolls are parbaked (pre-baked, but you complete the baking with 8-10 minutes in a 400 degree oven), but they are good to me right out of the package.  Schar also makes parbaked sub rolls and baguettes.  Hope you enjoy these as much as I have!

review/summary: gf family
review/text: my son has dairy, egg, wheat allergy - Dr. Schar ciabatta rolls are UNBELIEVEABLE - taste like regular bread - par-baked so moist when toasted - by far the best gf bread (and we have tried them all) - the beautiful thing is that they are egg free - generally don't get bread (or any gf baked items) that taste this good with the fine texture that do not have eggs.  Although they don't specifically say egg-free, they do not include it in the recipe.  for those with egg allergies - just note that many of their products do contain egg.  I agree with another reviewer about the high cost - very expensive for few items - sometimes it makes me sad that someone has to suffer the actual allergy in itself - and then have to get whammed with high cost of food - but until more quality competition rivals - this is what it is...  I am thankful that some quality products do exist today...

review/summary: Truly tastes like regular bread!!!
review/text: I will start by saying I don't have to eat Gluten Free, but I try many, many things because of family members that do.  Because I eat both I am a tough critic on the bad GF tasting products.  This is absolutely wonderful bread.  Shar makes 3 versions of this bread that I have seen at my local regular grocery stores; Ciabatta rolls, baguettes and sub rolls.  I have personally had the Ciabatta and the baguettes.  These are by far the best GF rolls I have had and they taste amazingly similar to gluten containing bread.  I will mention that the baguettes don't get crusty/crunchy on the outside (althought next time I will try a warm water brush before they go into the oven)but still slice a piece of the baguette add brie and you have a piece of heavan!  Please note that these products are Par -Baked and they are different from  the other Shar variety of shelf stable bread and the Parbaked are much better.  What a great tasty option for the GF crowd!!!

review/summary: Surprisingly pleasing
review/text: I am a pretty regular coffee drinker and have used Kcups for almost two years now and was extremely skeptical of the half-caff Kcups when I received them as a gift because I personally do not see the point of drinking coffee without the caffeine.  That being said, after having a long day and needing a little pick-me-up late at night and fearing the late-night caffeine insomnia, I broke down and tried the half-caff. I was and still am very pleased with the flavor and level of caffeine of this product even though I typically prefer a stronger brew.  It has a typical medium roast flavor that is uneventful and can appeal to most coffee drinkers that are not too picky in their tastes.  There is very little aftertaste and I have not had any issues going to sleep after drinking this beverage later at night as I have had with other blends.

review/text: Put about 6 lbs. of chicken breast or pork roast in a crockpot, add about 2 tbl of Walkerswood, and slow cook for 8 hours.  Drain the liquid off THROUGH A STRAINER and set liquid aside.  Dump the strainer contents back into the meat.  Use two forks and shred meat barbeque style.  Add about 1-3 tbls of Walkerswood (depending on your personal heat index) and mix well, adding enough liquid back to keep it very moist.  Put in an airtight container and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Serve it, reheated, on buns, add a bit of cole slaw if you like, and it will disappear much quicker than you want it to.<br />Also, try a tablespoon in homemade chile and spaghetti sauce!

review/summary: The best for decades!
review/text: Back in the 70's I was at a bachelor party and one of the guests brought jerk chicken. I had never heard of it, but one bite and I was hooked! I spent years trying to duplicate that flavor, buying various brands and even making my own from recipes I found online - dozens of attempts. Most were pretty good in their own ways, but nothing really special.<br /><br />Finally I stumbled on a brand that I hadn't tried, Walkerswood, and BINGO, that was it! The flavor had remained in my memory for at least 10 years. This is truly THE BOMB!<br /><br />Use about 1 Tbsp. / lb. of meat for mild heat; 3 Tbsp. / lb. for some real fun; more if you're a heat freak. The best, most authentic way to prepare jerk is to smoke it on a charcoal grill (sorry, gas-grillers) and use smoking wood like hickory, applewood, etc.

This jerk seasoning is FANTASTIC!!!<br /><br />It's got good heat and does not need anything added. I put rub 2 or 3 tablespoons of it all over a whole chicken and then roast it in my Showtime rotisserie and it is excellent. The chicken skin even gets somewhat crispy despite the wetness of the seasoning. This stuff is outstanding.

I have used this on all types of chicken and some other meats, I would not reccomend this for fish,unless you are going to pan sear the fish, fish is too delicate for this, try their marinade instead. This seasonig is not for the faint of heart, it is very hot and spicy just the way i like it. Try this only if you like your food hot and spicy, the seasoning works very well on the grill.

review/text: Bust out the napkins, grab yourself a beer, and buckle your seat belts cause this stuff is a proper<br />authentic flamefest of Jamaican jerk heat. You can put it on straight, or cut it with a little olive<br />oil, but I've found it best to marinate chicken or pork tenderloins for at least 24 hours before cooking for optimum results.<br /><br />Its a little messy cause you really have to rub this stuff in and make sure you turn/shake your marinade bag every few hour to ensure an even distribution of this wondermous stuff. If you're not using rubber gloves, make sure you wash your hands and I wouldn't plan on rubbing your eyes or doing anything else to sensitive body parts for a while. haw haw<br /><br />This stuff is the best, followed closely by Grace Jerk Seasoning but Walkerswood doesn't turn your chicken green like the Grace rub does. 5 Pods

review/text: when in jamica years ago i ate jerk pork or chicken everyday i loved it and brought one jar of walkerswood home with me.  when my jar was empty i went to see what i could find at different stores. the ingredients in the sauces i did not like did not even have similar ingredients to walkerswood.  while this product is full of flavor it is not overly spicy. 1 tablespoon will work for a pound of meat. the jar can be used many times.<br />enjoy

review/summary: Great for grilling!!!
review/text: This stuff is wonderful!  Great spicy flavor!  We found it origianally in Jamacia and continue to order it and pass it on to our friends.  I mainly use it for marinading meat that I grill but I'm sure that it has a lot of other uses.  Use it sparingly...alittle goes a long way.  Often I will marinade a cut up chicken with about a small table spoon of this stuff.  I usually use some cheap marinade or salad dressing as a medium since this is a paste.  Or you can rub it on.  Either way, it is great!  Two small jars of this stuff will last you all year.

review/summary: Walkerswood is THE BEST!!!
review/text: Walkerswood Jerk seasoning is by far the best out of the jerk seasonings that I used. What works best for me is depending on the amount of meat your cooking, one teaspoon of Jerk Seasoning and about 1/4 cup of Walkerswood Jerk barbecue sauce, stir them together and put on your meat and marinate overnight. If you put it on the grill, MAN!!! spicy and perfect!!!

review/summary: Fast Delivery...Great Product!
review/text: I fell in love with the Walkerswod Jamaican Jerk Seasoning years ago and up until 2 years ago, I was able to purchase this product from my local grocery store. Then one day, POOF!, it was gone. I hunted day and night, but to no avail.<br /><br />I tried various other products but there was no comparison to the original Walkerswood. I recently searched for it online and luckily Amazon.com carried it. The delivery was fast and the product is better than I can remember. Thanks Amazon.com!

review/summary: The Best!!
review/text: I have never been to Jamaica, but a good friend who spent some time there was getting very frustrated looking for a jerk in U.S. that matched that of the jerk in Jamaica.....until he found Walkerswood. He introduced it to my wife and I, and we haven't stopped using ot since!<br /><br />It goes great on everything, and has just the right balance of spice & sweet! Jerk lovers that haven't tried it are seriously missing out.
