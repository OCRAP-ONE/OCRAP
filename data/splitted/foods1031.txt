review/summary: Delicious alternative to traditional fried ramen noodles
review/text: After being somewhat disappointed with the "Spring vegetable" version of this soup line from Annie Chun's, I was expecting more of the same with this flavor - but boy, was I pleasantly surprised! The soup base is a delicious and savory broth which is not spicy, and the noodles are not fried unlike traditional ramen noodles. They come vacuum sealed and already cooked, and its easy to prepare. It comes with a sauce packet and the noodle packet. The noodles are a perfect consistency in my opinion.<br /><br />This is an excellent alternative to regular ramen, is very low in fat, and the sodium content is still less then many soups and a lot less then many of the prepackaged ramen noodles out there. (41% of your daily sodium, which for any prepackaged soup or meal is very reasonable) This version is not vegetarian unlike the vegetable flavor, and the flavor really shines through. Its a mix of pork, chicken, and oyster stock and its excellent. Dont be scared of the oyster - it has no fishy flavor or scent to it whatsoever. It tastes largely like a soy sauce base and somewhat similar to the Udon soup bowl, but better in my opinion.<br /><br />Adding some scallions, vegetables and some tofu or meat to this soup would make it more filling and very delicious. A dash of chili powder or hot sauce would be nice too.<br /><br />Regarding the price, id say each one is probably not worth more then $1.75 a piece. I saw it on amazon on sale at 80 cents each which was a great deal. Some of the third party sellers really overcharge for this stuff so keep an eye out at your local grocery store, or maybe amazon will keep them in stock at a reasonable price.<br /><br />5/5 stars!<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />NOODLES: WATER, WHEAT FLOUR, TAPIOCA STARCH, SALT, WHEAT GLUTEN, LACTIC ACID, ACETIC ACID, RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), SOUP BASE: CONCENTRATED PORK STOCK (PORK STOCK, SALT), NATURALLY BREWED SOY SAUCE (WATER, WHEAT, SOYBEANS, SALT), WATER, CANE SYRUP*, CONCENTRATED CHICKEN STOCK (CHICKEN STOCK, SALT), CORN STARCH, GINGER (GINGER, WATER, CITRIC ACID), SHIITAKE MUSHROOM POWDER (SHIITAKE MUSHROOM, DEXTRIN, SALT, WHEAT FLOUR, YEAST EXTRACT), YEAST EXTRACT, SALT, GINGER*, GARLIC*, ONION*, OYSTER EXTRACT POWDER (OYSTERS, MALTODEXTRIN, SALT, SUGAR, SOY SAUCE [FERMENTED SOYBEANS, WHEAT, SALT]), WHITE PEPPER. *DEHYDRATED<br /><br />PRODUCT MANUFACTURED IN A FACILITY THAT USES, SOY, MILK, PEANUTS, TREE NUTS, EGGS, FISH AND SHELLFISH.

review/text: I had high hopes for this as I really like dragonwell tea. Sadly, this did not live up to my expectations. Perhaps it was old (purchaced as part of Amazon's grocery clearance)and had lost its flavor, as the cup it makes is drinkable, but bland and uninteresting, but all three Tao of Tea products I purchaced disappointed me. If you keep your expectations low, it's an OK tea.

review/summary: Part of my breast cancer fighting diet:
review/text: I was diagnosed in July of 2010 with breast cancer and had a nearly baseball sized tumor removed from my left breast on August 4, 2010.  Of course, a vital part of my anti-cancer regimen included discontinuing drinking cow's milk which contains hormones fed the cows to increase their milk production.  I drink some organic goat's milk which doesn't contain those harmful hormones, but I have found that another delicious alternative is this brand of soy milk.  If you want something that tastes like milk, drink goat's milk, because no brand of soy milk I have ever tried tastes like milk.  However, this organic vanilla soy milk sweetened only with evaporated cane juice is really delicious and very satisfying because of its high quality protein content with the complete amino acid profile.  This variety also doesn't contain the oils sometimes added for a richer consistency which this soy milk doesn't need.  It tastes just great without those oils.<br /><br />As far as the packaging and condition upon arrival are concerned, mine has always arrived in perfect condition.  I have never personally had any problem with Amazon's packing and shipping for anything I have ever ordered from them.

review/summary: This is great stuff!
review/text: Pacific Natural Foods Select Soy Non-Dairy Beverage is quite good.  I confess that I buy this through Amazon.com mainly to stock up for winter.  I don't have a car and winters can be long, bitter cold and icy which makes walking over a mile to the store to buy more soy milk a bit hazardous.  Being able to buy a 12 package box is not only cheaper than what local stores charge for same size container, but it's great to have my soy milk delivered right to my door.  I am lactose intolerant which is a good thing.  I have seen many research articles showing that Oriental women who for the most part avoid dairy foods and using soy milk and other soy products have very low rates of breast cancer and other types of cancer seen only in women.  I eat soy yogurt, soy whipping cream {just like Redi-Whip}and the soy milk is great for making chai lattes at home instead of paying an extra fee to Starbucks for requesting soy milk.  I do not like soy milk in coffee or tea, but Coffee Mate is lactose free so...  I like being able to store my soy milk in a cabinet since it is time to open a carton of it.

review/text: The photo and description is slightly misleading, I think.

There is a tiny bit of gravy, but overall I think pat&eacute; tends to be drier, so I think the "Gravy Variey Pack" title is misleading.<br /><br />My cats don't really care for this; they will eat a couple bites, but not the whole can. They prefer meaty, chunky canned food. I'll feed the rest of the opened pack to the neighborhood stray and donate the sealed pack to a shelter.<br /><br />Other than that, the shipping was fine - no problems with the quality of the product.

Top them warm with your favorite premium ice cream and you'll know what they mean on the label by "decadent." I just tried the "G" brand that's better known for bar chocolate, and they are in the trash. The label said they were Ultimate. Not so...the DH Double Fudge IS!

I like to cut it into 6 slices and freeze them in a container.  I suck on 1 or 2 in the evening as a splendid treat; lasting longer because it's frozen.  In addition, if your watching your weight you can still indulge.  Each slice is only 1 Weight Watcher point; and well worth it!<br /><br />If I could rate it a 10 I would.

review/summary: One of the best candy bars ever made!
review/text: I live in a small town, so we don't get this candy bar.  Went to Sam's in Salina,Ks. and got a box, while we were there.  Simply Caramel Milky Way is fantastic, best candy bar i've had in years!  Only eat one every few days, or you might get a tad BIG.  Love it!!  Try it chilled.

review/summary: Soft, chewy caramel with a milky chocolate shell
review/text: When I tried these for the first time I was immediately overwhelmed with the soft caramel and the creamy milk chocolate covering! These are so "bad" I wish I hadn't found out how wonderfully good they are. I can take a bite, and savor it for awhile, and then another bite a little later. I try to make one last all day, but on occasion I have opened a second one! Thank you for thinking of us milk chocolate and soft caramel lovers, and doing such a bang up job of putting them together! YUMMERS!

review/summary: Milky Way Simply Caramel Bar 1.91 oz.
review/text: This candy bar is yummy I belief.  I bought this candy bar at a local drug store chain during their 3 for $2 deal.<br /><br />It has the perfect consistency of milk chocolate and the caramel is real and delicious.  Unlike most candies I've tasted lately, the caramel is perfection.  It is chewy and smooth.<br /><br />I purchased several varieties of Milky Way, French vanilla, simply caramel, and midnight dark.<br /><br />The candy bar is a blend of firm rich caramel and delicious milk chocolate.  A serving size is one-1.91 oz candy bar, and each serving has 250 cal, 11 g fat, 8 g sat fat, 31 g sugar, 2 g protein, 5 mg cholest and 60 mg sodium.<br /><br />This candy bar is produced by Mars Chocolate North America, LLC Hackettstown, NJ.<br /><br />The ingredients are milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk, chocolate, lactoses, milkfat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor) corn syrup, sugar, hydogenated palm kernnel oil and palm oil, skim milk, milkfat, less than 2% lactose, salt, artificial flavor, and may contain egg.<br /><br />The wrapper design is very appealing and inviting.  The bar is exactly as pictured.<br /><br />The packing also comes with an expiration date.  I like this because it prevents vendors from selling the product  beyond it product expiration date.

review/text: About a year or so ago, Mars test marketed a bitesize Milky Way Caramel ... it was fabulous.  Then they took it off the market.  When this candy bar was announced I jumped at the chance to buy it.  Sadly they changed the product to candy bar size and in the process changed the texture of the caramel and the chocolate coating is way to thick.  Disappointed with the product, will not purchase it again.

review/text: My father has always had a thing for Banana Laffy Taffy but not the other flavors...a couple of years ago we couldn't find it anymore except in the mixed packs...not even at our local wearhouse store...so when I found this I decided to give it a shot...it was as fresh as the day it was made...we now have a source for all the Banana goodness my dad could ever want...it made for a great gift from Christmas because for once he could guess what he was getting...If your giving it as a gift be sure to put it in a sealed plastic bag or two before wrapping or the person you are giving it to will be able to tell what it is from the smell.

review/summary: Little over priced
review/text: I used to buy these all the time for my taffy addicted mother at our local 7-11, but they stopped carrying it a while ago.  So it's nice to see this product on amazon, however, compared to the 7-11 price, the price here just seems inflated.  At 7-11 it was 4 ropes for $1 but increased to 3 for $1 later on.  That would put 24 at $6 or 24 at $8.  $12.60 is a little too much.<br /><br />The price for the 96 pack is much better though:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZ9Y2G">Wonka Laffy Taffy Banana Rope, 0.81-Ounce Packages (Pack of 96)</a><br /><br />$19.44 for 96 puts it at $.20 per rope, much better than over $.50 per rope with the 24 pack.<br /><br />-2 stars for pricing.

review/summary: Old Enough to Crunch
review/text: I felt like the information about this product was a little misleading, once it arrived.  Maybe it ships as 5 pounds, but it's just over a pound of product in actuality.  I'm glad it shipped free, because the individual pieces were marked "3/99cents....which makes the $9.49 price slightly MORE than retail.<br /><br />Then when I tried one, it was crunchy, which tells me this is not fresh product.  Still edible?  Absolutely.  Still the Laffy Taffy banana flavor I like?  Absolutely, but I won't be buying this again.  I live in Alaska, and I can buy over-priced candy right here at home.

review/summary: Normally nummy product, horrible seller
review/text: I purchased this product for my dad who loves these things, but he was immediately displeased. They tasted old and were hard. Since they were marked individually as 3 for 99 cents, I'm assuming that they were put out for sale and what weren't purchased at a physical location were sold here on Amazon. The fact that there were only 21 in a package supposed to contain 24 only adds to that assumption. I will still need to purchase more banana Laffy Taffy to appease the father, but never again from this seller.

review/text: I purchased this product to use in an espresso pot de creme recipe and have ended up enjoying glass after glass of delicious iced lattes. They are simple to make and delicious. That said, the product is expensive if you do the math, though it is arguably less expensive than a latte at Starbucks or elsewhere. I like the fact that it is decaf and it is full bodied and full flavored. I highly recommend it. And by the way, the pot de cremes were otherworldly -very rich in coffee flavor despite using a decaf product.

review/text: My dogs are crazy about these bones! For treats, nothing makes them happier. This is the only edible dog bone they take awhile to chew. All the others they devour in under 1 minute. They chew at this bone for some time and then I take it away to save for the next day chewing. My theory is they release stress when they chew. I noticed my havanese girl has a lot less nervous tension after chewing on the N-bone. Typically, she licks herself all day and all night long. She has slowed down dramatically on the licking and I think these bones amongst other things have played a part in that. She sinks restfully into my lap after a chewing session where before I could feel her body was tense.

They are safe, digestible, and do no splinter like real bones do, however, you should still keep an eye on your pet when they are chewing them.

review/text: It's been a long time since such a new and delicious flavor combination has captured my attention, but Pomegranate Tootsie Pops have my tastebuds singing a song of praise.  So out of the ordinary and completely satisfying.  One pop does it all.  Bring them on soon!

review/text: These tootsie pops are absolutely the best flavor ever !  They are not too sugary sweet, (like the watermelon ones are) and have a pretty true flavor.  I love them and order them every time they're available !  Yum-yum !

review/text: I would have given 5 stars but only gave 4 due to it's availability.  I don't like it when companies make a good product, but tease the customers with only limited stock.<br />This is a good candy.  I was in a grocery store buying candy in bulk.  I swear in that whole entire bin of tootsie pops there were only like two pomegranate.  I was taken by the color of the wrapper which I wasn't familiar with.  I bought both of them, and they were the best ones.<br />I also like the blueberry ones as well that seem to come out around Halloween. The original flavors are kind of played out, and I'm a little tired of them.

review/text: These are the best! I wish the company would care enough about their customers to make more of them.  You would think since so many people keep requesting them that they would do something about it.  Actually, when a company doesn't honor the many requests for them to make them again, it really turns me off to keep supporting the company. So, I just won't buy their products any longer. Too bad, but it is the only way to let them know we mean buisness.

review/summary: The BEST Tootsie Pop EVER MADE!
review/text: I went to Sam's club and bought a bag of assorted 5 1/3 lb. Child's Playtime Candy (assorted Tootsie candies the smidgees, pops, and ugh! Dots) I saw the wrapper and we thought they had a printing error with the color overlay. I tried it- it was like awesomeness in pop!. I wanted no other- it was sweet and fruity and not in an artificial way and it didn't taste like medicine (orange & grape) Now I don't know if that flavor is directly pomegranate but I am willing to trade all my chocolate candy, which I LOVE, just to get another pop. If you find it do not share!

review/text: I tried Stoats bars at a Scottish themed race a couple of years ago. I love the taste and flavors. They are hard to find so I was really glad that Amazon carried them... that was until they arrived. I opened the plastic wrapped box of 12 to find only 9 bars!! I purchased a box of 12. I did not know that the product I was getting was a previously opened, partially "used" product. I was not willing to return and pay for shipping, but I will not be purchasing this product through Amazon again.

review/text: I have not purchased this from Amazon, though if the delivery is the same as the other experiences I've had in the past decade or so, I'm sure it is fine.<br /><br />I have purchased these in my local grocery store, and they're fantastic.  Each section is individually vacuum-sealed.  They do come with the skin, and some bones, but bones add flavour.  I use mine to make soup, as well as red beans and rice.  Simmer them for a couple of hours, then the meat falls off the bones and shreds.  Not too salty, but very tasty.  In the winter when I do lots of soup making, I'll use a couple of these a week.  I've also used the ham steaks, and they are good as well.

Since I'm limited to decaf only once or twice a week, I want to be sure that what I'm drinking is special.  This really wasn't it.  So far, I've been happiest with Kicking Horse and Starbuck's Sumatra decaf, neither of which, unfortunately, is organic.  My search continues.

review/text: I fell in love with Kona coffee while in Hawaii years ago and have only been able to find 10% Kona coffee. For me coffee is a delicacy and I try to keep my caffeine consumption down. I have mixed this 1/2 and 1/2 with regular Kona coffee Hawaii Roasters medium roast <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000V8IOE">Hawaii Roasters 100% Kona Coffee, Medium Roast, Whole Bean, 16-Ounce Bag</a>  and also combined the above with Columbian to get a 50-50 mix (This is expensive coffee)and it is terrific. Not being a coffee connoisseur I don't know how one would describe it, but it has a mellow flavor that is fairly light bodied.<br />I would buy it again.

I do not taste artichoke really at all. I only taste vingar really. What a shame and a waste of money. I tried 2 cans and let my mom finish them off. Well i actually made her take them home but she tossed them. Do not even buy even for 6 cans for $5. If you get these for free well it helps you live but you will not enjoy the taste.

review/text: I can't stand the pre-packaged jerky that isn't homsemade. So it's been years since I've had real jerky that can satisfy my need. I was getting a craving so I started researching online about making my own but I wanted some NOW. Purchasing jerky online is risky considering you never know what you're really getting. This company got high reviews on Yelp.com so I decide to try them out. And I couldn't wait to open that bag and get a taste. It was so hard to share. I ended up purchasing more online to test out the other flavors and hopefully I'll make a trip to the actually location this summer. Overall a delicious home taste of real jerky.

Even my mother likes it and she never likes these nutrition type of bars.  Now she will finally snack a little healthier!<br />I never buy anything online in this quantity after only one initial purchase, so that should tell you,,,and I bought QTY 2.  I love the fact that they are easier on your teeth.  They are not hard, they are soft.  The only other type of nutrition bars I liked before were the KIND bars, and these blow KIND BARS away!!  I will use this as a healthy snack.  The only thing bad about these is the sugar.  For diabetics since you should not go over 30 grams of sugar in one serving, this is all you can get, as they are 31grams per bar.

review/text: I bought these primarily as a breakfast bar rather than as a snack food, but they can be used as both. These taste wholesome. I do very much enjoy the taste, I have really savored the taste on every bar. There is not cloying sweetness masking everything else and a very wholesome taste.<br /><br />I also really like the texture. In size these are small bars. But they eat larger than their size. They have a good amount of (pleasant) chewiness to them and the overall texture encourages you to eat slowly. Overall very tasty, good nutrition compared to other breakfast/snack bars, recommended.
