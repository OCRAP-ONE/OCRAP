review/summary: Easy to feed and seems to work
review/text: I've got a large overweight lab who's getting older and starting to have some hip problems.<br />We've given him baby aspirin and potassium gluconate which helps take the edge off.<br /><br />Since we've been adding the Motion Powder to his food, we haven't seen any limping.  That's a good thing.<br /><br />You just pour some of the green powder over the food.  Apparently the taste is okay because there's no problem with him eating it.  You cannot mix it however because it makes it's way to the bottom of the bowl and sticks.<br /><br />Seems to me this is a pretty good product.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF

review/summary: Put the step back in my senior dog
review/text: I have given this to my senior (10+) Shepherd/beagle mix for several weeks now and noticed a definite improvement in the way she is moving.  She has an old ACL injury that has previously made it difficult for her to get up stairs or jump on a chair (yes, she is spoiled).  I mix it with her food at night and it either tastes good, or has little taste, as she is a bit finicky and has had no problem eating it.  She is definitely stepping more lively.  When this jar is gone, I will buy some more.

review/summary: Worth a try for older dogs
review/text: I have a 75lb, 10 year old Doberman-Weimaraner mix. He's been having slight joint issues that I've noticed lately. He's stiff walking around, having a bit of difficulty with the stairs & getting into the car.<br /><br />The main draw for me was the Glucosamine. I've been looking for a product safe to give a dog for the while and liked the sound of GreenDog. I've been sprinkling 1 teaspoon on his food once a day for the past two weeks. (The directions list a bit more for his size, but I'd rather err on the side of caution.) It's difficult to say how effective a product is from only two weeks of use, but he doesn't seem to mind it on his food. He doesn't go crazy for it either; rather he seems to not mind either way.<br /><br />I was very surprised by the very herb-y smell! I almost hesitated to give it to him (it certainly smells more like human food than dog food) & took another look at the ingredients.<br />The ingredients listed:<br />Gluosamine HCI (shellfish source)<br />Proprietary Organic Antioxidant Blend (organic algae meal, organic alfalfa)<br />Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)<br />Proprietary Joint Comfort Blend (Meadowsweet, Bromelain, Stinging Nettle tops, Ginger, Tumeric<br />Green Lipped Mussel Extract<br />Proprietary Ocean-source Omega Blend<br />(Wild salmon, cod, tuna oil)<br />Inactive ingredients (Cinnamon, cloves, natural sweet salmon flavor, organic flax, silica, sprouted barley malt)<br /><br />He's seemed a bit more playful lately. Though I'm not positive this was a result of the GreenDog Motion Powder I'm certainly not ruling it out. Overall, I will recommend this to friends with older dogs. I do encourage anyone to consult their veterinarian of course. If he shows improvement I'm more than happy to order more of the Motion Powder.

review/summary: Nutritionally Sound
review/text: I received this product in return for writing a review.<br /><br />I appreciated the ingredients of this formulation, which are great for overall health as well as bone/joint health.  I am not a nutrition expert but I am somewhat knowledgeable and though the nutritional requirements might be different in some ways, dogs are mammals.<br /><br />One reviewer stated that it doesn't work well with dry food and I wholeheartedly agree.  It falls to the bottom rapidly.<br /><br />Now, I feed my dogs organic dog food (since they could eat solid food and they are 12 and 11.  My dogs love vegetables, so I conducted a test.  I dusted a vegetable with the powder.  Yorkie #1 didn't know what to think and spit the veggie out but immediately after "contemplating" the taste and she returned to broccoli and ate the entire piece. Yorkie #2 didn't pause once she got her broccoli with the powder.<br /><br />Next, I offered two identically sized broccoli pieces one dusted with the powder and one without powder.  Yorkie #1 ate the coated one first.  Yorkie #2 went for the uncoated piece first.  Considering that they are a bit picky but absolutely love fruits and vegetables, if they didn't want to eat this food, I believe both would leave the coated piece behind.<br /><br />I do believe that this is not "candy" but has some appeal.<br /><br />However, that said, it doesn't coat even wet vegetables well.<br /><br />I would consider buying the drops for regular use but I would definitely need to observe a noticeable improvement in their well being to justify the cost.

review/summary: A Healthier Alternative For Your Dog's Joints
review/text: My dog is getting old and is just starting to have some  difficulties with his hips.  I've tried other products for dogs containing glucosamine, but wasn't very happy about the animal products in them, because I know too much about where those animal products come from and how they're processed, and prefer not to feed them to my dog. (One reviewer of this product, wishing for a chicken or beef flavor, asked, "What kind of dog eats salmon?" The answer: mine, every day.  He loves it,and for twelve years old he's pretty darn healthy.)<br /><br />Unlike some of the dogs mentioned in other reviews, my dog loves the flavor of this.  The ingredients are exceptionally well thought out--they're not fillers.  For example, ginger and turmeric are known to have anti-inflammatory properties, but dogs may not particularly like them in their raw form. Omega-3 fatty acids are also effective.<br /><br />Does it help?  After two weeks, I'd say maybe; since my dog doesn't have a major problem, any change wouldn't likely be dramatic, but he doesn't seem quite so creaky.<br /><br />For a larger dog, the product, while reasonably priced considering the ingredients, can get a little pricey if you expect to use it consistently, and I believe with this type of supplement that's what you'll have to do if you want to get results and keep them. This 150-gram size will only last a few weeks. But I haven't found a better product of this type.

review/summary: Not the greatest :\
review/text: I disliked the packaging and lack of information on the product itself and had to go hunting around the internet to find more information on how to administer/feed it to my dog. Powders are generally inconvenient and this powder is no exception. If they made it in a chew or tablet it would be easier to administer and less messy. Purely on the sake of time, I won't continue to feed it to my dog on a regular basis. I'm all about preventative care (as he is still somewhat young) but the hassle of the powder isn't worth my time.

review/summary: get the pills if you feed your dog dry dog food
review/text: I can't tell if this works or not, so I'm giving it three stars for the fact that I have to review it, but it's the wrong type to feed my dog who eats dry dog food. It doesn't cling, it falls to the bottom of the bowl and she picks through her food as she's an oldie and nibbles at her food. I could switch to wet food to get her to eat it, but I'm just going to go back to the pills. The glucosamine pills and the doggy cox2 inhibitor she takes have changed her life. She's old, so that's saying something. If you feed your dog canned/wet food this might be a good choice, but if it's dry food and they don't wolf it down, it defeats the purpose. Wish I could say more.But my final thought on this is that something in the product description should recommend this for wet dog food.

review/summary: 157 pound Mammoth Lab got joyfully giddy at first taste
review/text: To say Doogan likes this product is an understatement.  It must have been the salmon flavor but we had 157 pounds of happy nose, happy feet and happy tail when GreenDog naturals Healthy Motion Powder was added to the food dish.  Our Vet said that with a dog this big, who is getting up there in years, the addition of Glucosamine to the diet is a good way to insure ease of motion to the old joints.  Of course the prospect of giving a dog a medication always instills terror in the hearts of well meaning pet owners.  Giving medicine to an animal that has the power to pick you up and carry you off to the next county can be quite a feat - but - "HE LIKES IT" - yes, he really, really likes it.<br /><br />The only reason that this product did not get a 5 star rating is that upon opening the box the label fell off & got tangled with the packaging & torn.  This is not a good thing when you need to read the instructions and safety information.<br /><br />All in all I'd say this was a 2 thumbs up product but since dogs do not have thumbs it will get the 2 tails up award.

review/summary: Visible difference in our dog's comfort
review/text: We have an 8 year old Great Pyrenees who was showing signs of age, especially when she had to sit down. She sat down very slowly and carefully because of hip/back leg pain. We've used the chewable tables in the past and sometimes these wouldn't be eaten, even though they were hidden in the food. The powder has wored much better as we can mix it in more thoroughly. As far as effectiveness, our dog seems to be more active and more able to use her back legs/hip for getting up and down. She seems more youthful, so this is definintely worth a try.

review/text: I like this, our dog likes it on her food also.  She seems to eat her meals more readily with this stuff sprinkled on.  It has good, quality ingredients.<br /><br />However, the only reason I give it four stars is it makes a bit of a mess.  Opening and closing the container, there's no way to keep the powder from sticking to the sides, the lid, etc.  It gets on the counter, on the floor, and I try to keep it as neat as possible!  For the hassle, it loses a star.  I think I'd prefer a chewable variety.  Those are easier, with less mess.<br /><br />But other than that, my dog likes it, so that's what matters most!

review/text: My 2-year old dog was born with a malformed ball & socket in her hip.  As a result, she has a hard time standing up after running and playing.  Eventually this will become hip displacia.  Our vet recommended we start her on a glucosamine supplement.  I tried giving her this supplement but she's not too crazy about it.  I mix it in her food but I can tell she doesn't really like it.  I don't care for the STRONG cinnamon smell so maybe that is off-putting to her.  I will continue to give it to her in the hopes that it will help her but I really wish the smell was different.

Perhaps this product actually works, I can't tell, because whenever I put it in her food, she won't touch it.  I supppose if it came in another flavor I would have had better luck, but she just wouldn't try it.  If she won't eat it, I can hardly see if it works!<br /><br />Oh well.

review/text: My dog is very picky about her food, treats, etc.  Other powdered medicines sprinkled on her food she generally refuses to eat.  However, this one is an exception.  Either she doesn't know it's there or doesn't mind it/the taste.<br /><br />This does seem to help her mobility as well, but I also supplement this with glucosomine treats and food containing some glucosomine, so I'm not sure how much of an impact it really has.  It definitely doesn't have any adverse effects on her mobility or diet, so based on her taking to the powder and its perceived effects, I'd recommend this to prospective buyers.

review/summary: Far less than advertised.
review/text: The packaging claims that the 150g jar of powder is a 30-60 day supply; however, for my 40-pound dog it only lasted 10 days. This is partly because the packaging instructs you to double the dose for the first 4-6 weeks; however, even if I had not been doubling the dose it would only have last 20 days -- and it's supposed to be used on dogs more than twice my dog's size. If you have a dog over 75 pounds and want to double the dose as recommended, you'll be through with the jar in five days!<br /><br />In the little time before the jar ran out I did not notice any difference in my dog's joint discomfort.<br /><br />On the plus side, I suppose, there's the fact that she really loved the taste.

review/summary: Great joint supplement - good price
review/text: our older dog has been on joint supplements for several years - and they work. When I saw this one, I figured why not give it a try.<br /><br />The supplement is in a powder form and it is easily mixable into our dehydrated raw food diet for the dogs.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- easy to mix into raw/dehydrated dog food (see below on cons)<br />- plenty of supplement for the price - 60 doses for smaller (below 25lb) dogs and 30 doses for larger.<br />- MADE IN THE USA - no worries about contaminated products from overseas!<br />- apparently tastes good to the dogs<br />- ingredients list is there to see and all the 'good' joint stuff is present.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- If you feed kibble, the powder could potentially cause issues depending on whether or not your dog is willing to lick it all up.<br /><br />Overall I like the product and the price point is good for the amount you receive.

review/summary: Get the tablets
review/text: Our Pomeranian has become increasingly less mobile over the years, and I have been looking for something to help him get up-and-at-um. Within three weeks of using Healthy Motion, I could see a slight difference in our pup's willingness to move around and, when he does get up, he remains standing for longer than he has been lately. In other words, I think this product is actually working; which is great! I could not be more pleased to see our dog act a bit younger.<br /><br />The issue that I have with this product is not the formula, it is the powder form. The powder tends to sift down to the bottom of the food bowl and make a sticky paste. This paste seems to unfailingly attach itself to our dog's nose and then to anything in our home that our dog sniffs...which is everything. Beyond this, while our dog loved the flavor at first, after a few days he began to eat around the powder. This required some more inventive application measures to ensure ingestion.<br /><br />The formula works and I will buy it in the future. However, I will be buying the chewable tablets, as opposed to the powder, and have to recommend that anyone else do the same if your dog is still able to chew a tablet.

review/summary: My chocolate lab sure likes it
review/text: I don't normally pay a lot of attention to canine supplements, however as my Chocolate Labrador Maggie, is hitting middle age, it is something that I am starting to pay more attention to. I would hope that using a supplement for joints now will help avoid any issues later.<br /><br />The Healthy Motion Powder is one of those that is easy to add to her food. She eats Orijen kibble with a very small amount of canned food added for excitement. The Green Dog Naturals powder is sprinkled on top of each meal (I feed her in the AM & PM) I was a little concerned that since her food is dry, and the supplement is a powder, that not being able to "hide" it in the food would be an issue. Not at all; she loves the flavor and eats it almost like it is a condiment.<br /><br />She has shown no signs of joint problems at her current age, so obviously it is difficult to say for sure that the product is beneficial to her at this time. There are however, a lot of glucosimine joint supplements on the market, so if you are considering one, I would certainly take a good look at this product.

review/summary: Dog LIkes it
review/text: I have a senior shepherd who takes glucasomine.  Of late, she has been spitting out her pills no matter how well hidden.  She'll disassemble a pill pocket, lick off canned food, even extricate them from peanut butter and cream cheese.  I was gong to grind them into a powder but was afraid she would reject her food if she didn't like the flavor (or noticed what I wasa doing).  So I figured I would give this product a try.<br /><br />The canister contains a green powder that smells like  pumpkin pie spice. One tablespoon contains 500 mg of glucasomine and 250 mg MSM.  It also contains spirulina, green lipped mussel extract, an ocean sourced omega blend and a joint comfort blend which includes ginger, tumeric, bromelain, stinging nettles and meadowsweet.  Ina ctive ingredients incude cinnamon, cloves, natural sweet salmon flavoring, organic flax, siica and sprouted barley malt.  Dosage ranges from 1 teaspoon for dogs under ten pouns to 2 tablespoons for dogs over 75 pounds.  The product should be refrigerated after opening and it is suggested that the recommended dosage be doubled the first four to six weeks.<br /><br />So far my german sherpherd seems to like it and getting it down is the biggest part of the battle.  I like the committment to using organic ingredients where possible and also the usage of recycled materials for the container. It is too early to tell whether this product is equal to or superior to the previous supplement.  However it smells good and is easy to use.  It is a bit pricey per serving, espeically if your dog is large and I wish they included a little scoop.<br /><br />I think that natural supplements are preferrable to pharmaceuticals.  I take glucasomine myself and have benefitted. My dog, like most older GSDS, has arthritis and the glucasomine seems to keep her mobile and active. This product gets plusses for palatability,ingredients and ease of use.  I will be buying it again.

review/summary: Great for older dogs !
review/text: The formulation for GreenDog Naturals Healthy Motion Powder is a perfect formulation for aiding in ease of joint movement for older dogs, or as a preventative for younger dogs. We use this every day for both old and younger dogs. They enjoy the taste and it is good for them. In the past we have had some older dogs with real hip problems, after a while, this combination of ingredients will make a real difference and allow the old dogs to become more supple.

review/summary: Gave My Dogs an Extra Boost in Their Steps
review/text: I have a ten-ish (I think he was older then what the adoption place said he was) Chihuahua who I like to joke sleeps twenty-three hours a day, getting up to eat and go for bi-daily walks which he rarely has problems trotting along for except for when the temperature drops below freezing.  I also have a five year old poodle mix that is fairly active.  As directed, I sprinkled the recommended dosage (about a teaspoon each) on their dinners and both ate it up with no hesitation.  The powder has a nice cinnamon type smell to it.  Almost instantly I noticed both dogs have a bit more energy than usual post dinner, roaming around and engaging me in a game of tug before their nightly naps.  In all, I used up one can in about a month and a half using it daily at dinner for both my dogs.

review/summary: NO CRAP fillers or junk ingredients AND Made in USA
review/text: One jar is a 30-60 day supply for your dog. 60 days if your dog is 25lbs or less. The instructions give weight ranges from dogs under 10lbs to over 75lbs. It says for maximum benefit to double usage the first 4-6 weeks. For freshness after opening, keep in the refrigerator. No fillers, sugar, artificial colors, preservatives, sodium, wheat, corn or soy.<br /><br />This powder comes in a plastic jar that is halfway full -- not sure if it settled during shipping but it's always a disappointment to open something (like potato chip bags) and find it's not quite full. Despite my initial impression, it seems that this is a really good product. It  is made by the same company that makes the vitamins that I take myself.<br /><br />My dog didn't seem to interested in it -- he sniffed it and walked away and then came back later and ate his food. It says it's salmon flavor but it smells a little chocolate-y to me.<br /><br />I've used other treat type supplements and my dog gets really gassy. I'm hoping this is more gentle on his stomach. I'll update after we've used this product for a while.

review/summary: Green Glucoasamine Product To Support Dog's Joints
review/text: My family has an eight year old Yorkie who has experienced significant joint problems in both his shoulders and hips.  He is used to eating glucosamine treats to help alleviate these issues but these treats have to be broken in to several pieces for him because of his small size (6 pounds).  This "motion" powder can be sprinkled on the dog's food and a teaspoonful is the serving size for small dogs (under ten pounds).  A disadvantage to me of this product is it has to be refrigerated after opening and our dog's eating area is a long way from the kitchen.  Our dog did readily eat the stuff when mixed with his regular food but I think he still prefers the glucosamine he has been receiving in the forms of treats for the last few years.

review/text: GreenDog Naturals is a quality source of highly effective joint maintenance ingredients.  First, they are organic, which is extremely important to me.  I don't want to give my dog products that are grown using pesticides and junk soil filled with manufactured fertilizers.  I appreciate the care that GreenDog Naturals put into this aspect.  Also, I love the ingredients as a whole.  I use most of them myself and as a massage therapist, recommend these same ingredients to my clients.  It has a great Ocean-sourced Omega blend of wild salmon, cod and tuna.  Antioxidants of algae and spirulina with alfalfa  as well as Glucosamine HCI.  There is some cinnamon, clove and flax for digestion and inflammation reduction as well as bromelain and stinging nettle.  Love this stuff.  A tsp. for my 28 lb French Bulldog mixed with his fresh food and he is set to go!  A+ stuff!!

review/text: My husband has celiac disease meaning he must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet and that means no crackers with wheat.  These are his favorite gluten-free rice crackers.  Almond Nut Thins, Smokehouse, Wheat Free, Gluten Free, 4.25 oz. The smokehouse adds alot of flavor which he really enjoys and misses in most other rice crackers.  Personally I prefer their cheese flavored rice crackers.  It's not always easy to find the smokehouse flavor locally which is why I ordered online.  I was pleased that the crackers were fresh and the use by date is 7 months down the road.

review/text: If you look at the reviews you'll see that the general consensus is that this is not a favorite flavor.  The smokehouse flavor is very subtle and might even seem dull to some people. If you like a bolder taste, consider the cheddar cheese or barbeque flavors.  That said, these Smokehouse crackers are just as crispy and they might be a good base for a dip or cheese spread.  The crispiness is one of the key features of these crackers - whatever the flavor!

You simply cannot beat this cracker for mouth feel if you like plenty of snap, and the flavor of all of these various Nut-Thins crackers is sublime. They are wonderful with dips, but they are so delicious, I actually prefer to eat them plain.<br /><br />At only 8 calories per cracker, Nut-Thins compare favorably to the Snyder mini pretzels I mentioned, which are 5 calories each.

Obviously will not be reordering again. Try another brand or a local bakery. For the money, they will probably be better.

review/summary: Delicious Hot & Sweet Mustard
review/text: I first had Beaver Brand mustard in Las Vegas at the Wynn hotel. The deli mustard was spicy and delicious.  My favorite kind of mustard, however, is sweet and hot, and Beaver Brand delivers with theirs. It has a great horseradish-style kick and is nice and sweet, a perfect mustard for turkey or ham sandwiches and all manners of hot dogs and bratwurst.  It's not as versatile as some mustards, like a good Dijon, but that's the nature of the flavor profile.<br /><br />I will say that it is not a mustard you slather on heavily. I shared with some family and one family member put it all over like it was a regular mustard, and not long after he was tearing up. If you get a lot at once, it will feel like your sinuses have exploded. In a good way. Just a great mustard.

Use it in moderation the first time, just to get a feel for the spiciness level.  Then adjust later as needed.<br /><br />I love it on brats, kielbasa, knockwurst, hot dogs, burgers, and I use it in marinades for chicken (mix with some lemon juice, oil, and a little minced garlic) or for grilling salmon (thin with a little oil, then brush on the salmon and grill).<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the Beaver line of sandwich spreads/mustards/etc.  This one is near the top of my list.

review/summary: Family is hooked on this mustard
review/text: Roast Turkey, Pastrami, Corned Beef and Roast Beef sandwiches, all with Swiss Cheese and sliced tomato are a daily happening in our household. For years we used, Grey Poupon mustard. We tried the Beaver brand HONEY Mustard and really liked it so decided to give this, the Sweet Hot Mustard a try. We LOVE IT. We try to minimize the Mayo for fat purposes so mustard is our condiment of choice.<br /><br />Personally, what I like about this mustard is that the "hot" doesn't keep your mouth burning long after the bite. You get the heat, then you're okay, It's not going to make sweat beads on your forehead.<br /><br />We still love Grey Poupon and this is not a true substitute for it. It's a completely different flavor. But if you're into mustard, go buy a bottle of this from your local grocer. Then, if you want to stock up you can always come back to Amazon for the six pack which may save you a few cents per bottle.<br /><br />If you don't like the heat - try the Beaver Brand Honey Mustard. It's really good too.<br /><br />Enjoy

review/summary: A wonderful premium tea
review/text: Yes, you are right.  This tea is expensive.  It is also quite marvelous.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I was impressed with the packaging of this tea.  The tea comes packed in the correct kind of tin, with both outer and inner tightly fitting lids.  When one pops out the inner lid, one is instantly rewarded with a waft of the wonderful scent of jasmine.  Ah..... Heaven.  Or, if not Heaven, at least a tropical garden at twilight.<br /><br />Now what's this? you might ask.  This doesn't smell like the jasmine tea from the local Chinese takeout place.  Yep.  It sure doesn't.  That's because this is The Real Deal.  This tea is made up of whole baby tea leaves ("white tea") and whole jasmine flowers.  No raggedy bits and pieces of leaves and twigs were to be found anywhere.  No jasmine "flavoring."  No bitter aftertaste.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm.....<br /><br />I carefully prepared the tea according to directions - one tablespoon of tea leaves per 8 oz. of water heated to 185 degrees.  The directions said to steep the tea from four to five minutes, which seemed excessive to me, as I didn't want bitter tea.  But in a real test, one must follow the directions, so I let the tea infuser sit in the water for a full five minutes.  And I was rewarded.  This is an utterly delightful tea, completely lacking the bitterness that can be associated with green teas.  This tea is wonderful "as is" - no sweetener or milk should be added, in my opinion.<br /><br />The directions also stated that one tablespoon can be steeped "multiple times." Well, how many times is "multiple?"  Good question.  The first cup steeped was delightfully aromatic.  The second cup less so, but still good.  The third cup was rather pedestrian, the fourth cup just bland.  Not bitter, not awful, just bland.  I didn't try a fifth round of steeping.  This is a tea best suited for someone who is going to want more than one cup of tea within a fairly short time span - if that is you, you will find there is a lot of bang for the buck with this product.<br /><br />All in all, I find this tea to be just wonderful.

review/summary: The good stuff...
review/text: I could use this space to tell you all about how wonderful this tea tastes and about how healthy it is but I see that other reviewers have done a great job of that.  I do not write food-tasting columns for a living so I shall not be more dramatic than just simply stating that this tea is soothing and easy to drink.  We all can use the antioxidants, so drink up!<br />  Quick facts:  ALL Tea comes from the very same plant.<br />White tea is fast-dried.<br />Green tea is roasted in an oven or pan.<br />Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing.<br />  Now, 'Silver Needle' white tea is the best. It is picked between March 15 and April 10 when it is not raining and only using undamaged and unopened buds.<br />  Yes people, this is ARTISAN tea.<br />The fact that it coms mixed with Jasmine flowers makes it smell great.<br /><br />  ~Gan bei!

review/text: I've purchased a lot of premium loose leaf teas, and I was hoping this would be the same according to their glowing description. What I found are a lot of twigs, and sub-par leafs in this product.<br /><br />The flavor is enhanced by the Jasmine flavor, but without that, I am not sure there would be much body to it. It's not awful, just disappointing.<br /><br />I will keep buying my premium teas from more reputable sources.

review/summary: Jasmine White Rishi Tea.
review/text: This tea doesnt disappoint whatsoever,If you like jasmine green pearl or jasmine green tea from Rishi you will love this white jasmine tea.<br />Rishi is known for its Sencha. I might add that the teas that Amazon posts for sale are not the only teas the company sells.<br />If you go on line or call the company ( calling the company is better ) you can find out about their prize winning sencha and other teas.<br />I must warn you they are very expensive.$$$$$<br />If you are invested in this area of tea making which I am then please people check your water temp. ( 175 degrees or a drop less ) and for some teas, "time them to taste".<br />That means for some you will be in the water for less than three min, and for some more than three.<br />Remember the basket of dry leaves does not go into the water until the temp drops to 175 degrees. Pay attention or you will end up cooking the leaves rather than steeping them. Thanks and have a great day.

review/summary: Multiple steepings of delicious tea & Gluten-free
review/text: I love this tea!  I don't feel it is more expensive than other white teas because I get so many steepings from it that taste great.  Most other teas, I am lucky if I get 3 or 4 steepings with the 4th being weak.  I can re-steep these needles all day long and each steeping tastes as good as the first for me.  I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5X826">Medelco 12-Cup Glass Stovetop Whistling Kettle</a> and often throw out the first steeping if I don't feel like caffeine that day as most caffeine goes into the first steeping whereas all the healthy benefits are evenly distributed throughout many steepings.  After heating the purified water to 185�F in my Medelco 12-Cup Glass Stovetop Whistling Kettle, I pour a little hot water into my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N2XMTG">Primula Personal Glass Tea Mug</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4KMM8">Teas Etc 12-Ounce Glass Brew Mug with Glass Brew Basket and Lid</a>, then add 1 1/2 tablespoons of Rishi Tea Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea, add 185�F water, and steep for 4-5 minutes.  If I want caffeine that day, I enjoy the first steep right away!  If I don't want caffeine that day or it is already evening or for whatever reason, I throw out the first steep and start my second steep right away for me to enjoy my first cup soon!  Also, sometimes instead of throwing out the first steep, I will save for cooking vegetables or other cooking as this tea adds delicious flavors and healthy benefits.  This is one of my favorite teas!<br /><br />All of Rishi's teas are gluten free and are processed in Milwaukee in a gluten free facility.

review/text: I keep trying white teas every chance I get... but this is the one I always come back to and order every month.  It's a very calming tea.  My coworker kids me that it should be a work expense because it helps that much.  It seems much fresher than other teas I've had as well.  As a heads up, silver needle white tea, unlike other types of white tea, seem to had longer steep times.  I can't recommend this tea enough.

review/text: A deliciously packaged and prepared white tea, Silver Needle Jasmine.<br /><br />This loose leaf tea makes a delicious fresh tea.  Like many fresh loose leaf white teas, it creates a deliciously mild taste, which paired with the Jasmine of this offering is quite soothing.  The tea's true flavors are enjoyed, when the tea is not brewed past the recommended time.  White tea is particularly delicate, so take care when brewing.<br /><br />Overall, I was quite impressed by this offering, and I'm certain to try Rishi's other varieties as well as this one again. Great packaging too.

review/summary: A Wonderful White Tea
review/text: Open the outer lid of Rishi's White Tea and the wonderful scent of jasmine hits you.  Open the inner lid and you can tell that you're dealing with an excellent quality tea leaf.  The aroma fills the room as you steep this white tea, which contains nothing but white tealeaves and jasmine flowers.  There is no need to add anything to enhance the tea, it's wonderful as is.<br /><br />Despite being considered a "weaker" tea than most due to its low caffeine levels and high concentration of antioxidants, I'd say that the flavor of this tea is what makes it "stronger" than most others.<br /><br />I am a big fan of coffee, so my experience with tea is limited.  However, I do know that I enjoy Rishi's White Tea and their Earl Grey, and I plan to try more of their teas in the near future.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This is a wonderfully flagrant tea with beautiful loose leaves and jasmine flowers.  It's comforting to not have to prebrew non-organic teas to rinse off pesticide residues.  My maternal grandparents grew tea in the hillsides of Taiwan, and I can tell you that tea leaves are not washed after harvest.<br /><br />The balls of tea can be left in my tea pot all day without turning bitter.  It is also significantly lower tar than darker teas like dragonwell or oolong.  I only have to scrub out my tea mug every two weeks instead of every other day.  The value is also decent- 5 balls will brew a 12 oz cup.<br /><br />The caffeine level is also significantly lower (or higher quality) than most of the white teas that I've tried.  No insomnia with this tea.<br /><br />Rishi should make a 10 ounce can to provide consumers a better value.  Frequent tea drinkers like myself will finish 1 can a month.

review/text: This is the most fragrant jasmine tea I've ever experienced. I usually add sugar to my tea and after adding my usual amount to a cup brewed from Rishi's Silver Needle Jasmine, I was surprised at how very sweet it tasted, so I'll probably be drinking this brand unsweetened from now on and enjoying it that way. And the fragrance! Beautiful, floral without being too perfumey. I love it. I also liked how this tea did not seem to get that oxidized bitterness after standing in the pot for a while, the second cups remained as good tasting as the first had been. Definitely recommended!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: This tea is so delicious, so fragrant, that for the first time, I choose to drink a hot tea without sweetener of any kind. I usually use honey or splenda, but they just destroyed the delicate essence of this lovely tea. It really is sweet and fragrant enough without any embellishment.<br /><br />I usually drink Numi teas. I have many varieties, and I love them. But this tea is especially lovely. From the long, thin white tea leaves to the jasmine blossom petals, what a treat for the eyes, nose, and palate. The fragrance hits you as soon as you open the container and lasts throughout the cup. I followed the directions and steeped the tea as suggested. The first cup was heavenly, the second brew delicious, but the third was a bit weak. It was never bitter, never harsh, and never "too green."<br /><br />Yes, it's expensive, but it is organic, hand-picked, authentic, whole white tea leaves and whole jasmine petals. A little goes a long way. I guess it all comes down to what your passion is and what you can afford. I do hope I can afford this in the future, and I am tempted to try other varieties as i finish my Numi stash.

review/summary: rating will depend on if you like jasmine teas
review/text: When I saw this tea offered in the Vine newsletter, I quickly clicked "send"...not for myself, but for my daughter, who has a penchant for white and jasmine teas.  This one seemed made for her.  Turns out it was, and here's what she had to say:<br /><br />"...good flavor for a white tea, smooth and soft, the jasmine is a light flavor with a relaxing aroma.  Not overpowering like some teas.  Note: make sure not to steep for too long or use too much tea for one cup otherwise it will give a strong and bitter taste."<br /><br />To be fair to the product, the star rating we gave it is my daughter's opinion.<br /><br />I do need to caution folks, if you are more of a unflavored tea kind of person, this tea will probably NOT be, well, your cup of tea.  I found the aroma of the tea itself, even before steeping, to be sickly sweet and overwhelming.  If you don't know if you like jasmine teas, don't order this one in bulk - you may regret it.  If you are a jasmine aficionado, than this one will please your palate.

review/summary: fragrant, mellow and what fresh tea should taste like
review/text: I was very excited to try this tea as I am a bit of a tea freak from green tea to the steeper oolong tea.  I loved the fresh fragrant of the tea and it did not have a bitter taste if the leaves are steeped too long.  Generous heap of tea and immediate off the boil water are a must to get the best out of the tea experience.  Also, i would confirm that you do need to allow the tea to brew for 5 minutes before drinking.  I normally like to steep the tea leaves several times, and in this case, I would suggest putting a few new leaves in.<br /><br />the tea leaves are neither diced nor sliced; and that I believe helps to keep the integrity of the flavor whole.  This is a genuinely good quality product.<br /><br />I am keen to buy this for family to try as some tea smells better than it taste; not the case of this rishi jasmine tea. This is going to great after a good meal to help with the digestion.

review/text: I read that tea is the only consumable that is not washed before it is packaged, so it is all the more important that it be organic. This tea is organic, and whole tea, so you get the best buds, not the leftover scraps that often go into teabags, and it tastes like it. You have to be careful to make it according to the instructions--too hot water or too long a steep will make the tea too astringent, but if you follow the instructions to the letter, you will be in bliss. The delicate hint of jasmine and the refined white tea flavor are for savoring, not gulping with General Tso's. So soothing and relaxing...ahhhhh--have some with your next bath!

review/text: If you like Jasmine tea this is a must have. Our family loves Jasmine tea and everyone who has tried this thinks this is a winner. It is expensive, but you can seep it multiple times (2-3), so that cuts down on cost.<br />The tin this can comes in is adorable (great for a gift) and gives the feeling of Zen. The lids are tightly fitting so as to keep light and moisture out and flavor in.<br />The advantage of this tea is that it is made white tea, so it avoids the bitterness of green tea. Also, it has more antioxidants and less caffeine.  The flavor is spectacular and so much better then what you get at your local Chinese take-out<br /><br />For those who are concerned it is certified organic and kosher. We will continue to order Rishi tea.

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: I am very familiar with Rishi teas, though I'd never before sampled their Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea. This is one of the best white teas I've ever tried, and I've tried quite a few. Upon opening the container, you get a faint, intoxicating jasmine fragrance. This is an organic product with organic tea and jasmine blossoms. It's a delicate tea that for me needs no sweeteners whatsoever. It lacks bitterness, and it has a faint and very pleasing herbal/floral taste and aroma. The directions call for a steeping time of 4 to 5 minutes. I tried both, and prefer the 4-minute steeping time, which for me gives the tea a more subtle and "mysterious" flavor. It's actually a very sensual drinking experience! As is typical of white teas, they are very low in caffein, and high in antioxidants. I'm a big fan of all types of tea, and this silver needle jasmine white ranks as one of my favorites. Strongly recommended!

review/text: What an aesthetically designed tin. Nice outer lid, with an inner lid that opens and closes with a "pop" so you know it seals, but doesn't break your nails to remove it. The first thing for your senses is the delicate but fabulous aroma wafting up. A very pure jasmine unlike any of the more common jasmine teas that are for sale. Feel it with your fingers. Long, fine leaves. Almost twiggy as though you're feeling the real thing, before it's been processed into oblivion.<br /><br />Steep it following directions (or to taste) and sip...what a delight! Absolutely no bitterness, from initial taste to aftertaste. Just delicious. And I found the second cup steeped with the same tablespoon as satisfying as the first. A real test is to let it go cold. A lovely flavor hot or cold. If tea can be beautiful, Rishi's Organic Silver Needle Jasmine White Tea is a thing of beauty.

This is a wonderful light tea that can be infused at least twice (I seem to get three mugs out of a heaping teaspoon).  You'll steep this a bit longer than green tea but it's really good stuff and relaxing.  The green pearl jasmine is much more flowery and fragrant and I like it as well as the silver needle but it's not as subtle.

review/summary: A poets tea, fine silver needle tea
review/text: An excellent tea  a bit more boldly flavored than a lot of silver needle teas. Quite smooth without any harsh after taste or acidic edge.  Packaging is excellent with an inner cap that prevents spillage and can double as a measure.<br /> The jasmine flavor is very fine  not too much but definitely present. There were not  any actual jasmine flowers in my tin.<br /><br />Jasmine scented  silver needle tea  is traditional for poets,lovers and  casual afternoons and this version is quite  suitable for those romantic traditions as well as being a pretty good all occasion and special occasion tea.  Good for three steepings with the second being the strongest. This tea will not work for tea leaf reading because the leaves are all whole long needles.<br /><br /> I like  this alone and with many different foods including clam chowder,  tea cakes, Chinese and Japanese food. It makes a fine smoke for a jasmine tea smoked chicken dish too. I plan to try it for a tea smoked trout recipe I have too.<br /> I probably committed heresy  when I sweetened it, but I really ,really liked it with sugar and it was even better with honey. I did not try it with lemon or milk. The was also quite good as an iced tea though that is not a standard use for silver needle tea.<br />These leaves float for quite a while so using them with a strainer or  filter might be a good idea  if you would rather not get an occasional tea leaf in your mouth.

review/text: I really like the Rishi brand of teas and the Silver Needle Jasmine does not disappoint. It's a nice subtle tea that is good for mornings or evenings. I like Rishi's packaging and think that the tins of teas would be perfect in a gift basket -- I'd like to receive them as a gift!<br /><br />Also, it's nice that this tea is organic -- that's a big plus in my book.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Certified Organic. Certified Kosher. Made with 100% organic white tea leaves and 100% organic jasmine flowers. Highest quality. Exquisite white tea leaves blended with beautiful organic jasmine flowers. When the time grows close, each day the patron or patronesse of each tea estate will go into the tea gardens to check. Then, one morning, it is decided that the 'pluckers' with the keenest eyes and most nimble fingers will be sent to begin harvesting the most precious of the 'first flush' of the season from the tops of the mature & most energenic tea bushes. Once upon a time, not so long ago, I had begun the look at marketing ultra premium tea around the world with one of my very good friends from India. We met in Hong Kong. The venture didn't go ahead, but wonderful memories and some tea knowledge remain. Rishi is an ancient sacred word from India which means 'seer.' The Vedas were written long ago by the first Rishis, most of whose names are not even recorded. [Received one 1.9oz (54g) can of this tea at no cost through the Vine program.] This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.

The whole leaves unfurl beautifully to a lovely fresh green while brewing. The aroma is so fresh and inviting (a light airy jasmine, not a heavy heady jasmine) and the tea is smooth and soothing.

review/summary: Very Fragrant Tea
review/text: This tea comes in a can with two covers that preserves the tea well.  The tea is loose and looks like dried pine needles.  Using very hot water and a small amount of tea in an infuser, it produces a very fragrant, naturally sweet cup of tea.  I didn't have any acidic upset like I sometimes do after drinking tea.  The tea smells so good,<br />you just want to hold a cup up to your nose and breathe in the aroma.  I think it would be excellent for colds or sinus because it is so fragrant.  My only complaint is that the tea is so fragrant that it reminds me of perfume and can be overwhelming.  A small amount goes a long way.

review/summary: Tea's rich, inspirational tradition
review/text: Tea is a winter drink for me, so I decided to try this Rishi Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea offered on Vine. It came in a pretty and functional little double-capped canister and welcomed me with its rich herbal aroma. The leaves are "withered" and look quite unprocessed and natural. I followed the directions -- one tablespoon in my little tea ball, bring water to a rolling boil and then cool a bit, steep 5 minutes -- and brewed a cup to enjoy on a blustery cold afternoon instead of my usual coffee.<br /><br />Rishi imports tea that is certified organic and fair trade. The company was founded on a basis of social responsibility and sustainability, to offer consumers fine single variety teas direct from their origin. This white tea -- very low in caffeine and high in antioxidants -- originates in China's Fujian province and is infused with jasmine flowers for a subtle fragrant product. My cup of tea had a light, slightly floral flavor with no trace of harshness, and as directed by the package, I used the same tablespoon of tea to brew a second cup and enjoyed it just as much.<br /><br />I choose fair trade coffee whenever possible, but haven't explored the "artisan tea" world. This Rishi Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea is very appealing and I know I'll enjoy it -- and now I'm eager to try some of their other varieties. Produced organically and sustainably, it's not just a cup of tea but a link to ancient knowledge and traditions.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2008

review/summary: A Delicate Fragrance
review/text: White tea is so delicate one can easily overbrew resulting in a bitter after taste. Jasmine in teas can often overwhelm the flavor and end up tasting more like cologne than a cup of tea.<br /><br />The folks at Rishi clearly know their teas and how to blend them. This is the best jasmine tea I have ever encountered. I love tea, all kinds of tea and drink it every day, for more years than a lady cares to reveal.<br /><br />The high quality of the long leaf is impressive. The jasmine is just right, a subtle fragrance that enhances the brew and does not overpower it. It would be easy to enjoy many cups a day and reap the health benefits of white tea thereby.<br /><br />I don't know what it will retail for, but if it is reasonably priced I will certainly be a future purchaser. The fact that is is organic and fair trade is a win/win.<br /><br />Recommended for those who appreciate a quality tea.

review/summary: nice flavor and aroma
review/text: I'll confess that I'm more of a coffee fan than a tea fan, but I do enjoy tea on occasion.  This Rishi Tea with a jasmine flavor/aroma is very nice.  After brewing for approximately five minutes in my cup, I sipped the tea and was immediately impressed by the jasmine fragrance.  At first taste, I was a bit surprised that the tea did not seem to be particularly strong even though I had brewed it according to the manufacturer's instructions, but after getting halfway through my cup I realized that the strength was just right for my taste.  I finished my first cup quickly and made another using the same leaves in a teaball and the second cup was just as good as the first -- mellow, slightly sweet, and very satisfying.  I would have made a third but I had to leave for work; the manufacturer indicates that a teaspoon can make several cups of tea.

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: The first thing I noticed about this tea was the divine scent: flowery, but subtle.<br /><br />The canister is designed with an inner lid, and looks as if it will keep the tea super fresh for a very long time.<br /><br />Apparently, white tea has the least caffeine of the three types: black, with the most, green, with the next highest level, and white.  I happen to be sensitive to caffeine, so this was welcome news.  After having a cup that brewed for over five minutes I felt absolutely no buzz.<br /><br />For those of you who care about this sort of thing, white tea is known for having a very high level of antioxidants.<br /><br />Truly delicious and unique, it tasted  like a more complex version of jasmine tea.  There's a slightly dry after-taste, but it was pleasant and made me think it would be ideal paired with unctuous foods.<br /><br />In an experimental state of mind, I made myself an open-faced sandwich on German black bread (the whole grain kind) with herring-artichoke heart salad in a mustard dill dressing garnished with sliced avocado.  The tea was simply perfect with my lunch.  The dryish aftertaste complimented the richness of the herring and avocado.  It made me think this would be fantastic with sushi, and more interesting than the usual green tea offered in restaurants.<br /><br />For dessert I tried pairing it with two types of chocolate: Dagoba's lemon ginger (68% cacao) and Lindt's Excellence Madagascar (65% cacao).  The former was not such a successful match because the lemon competed with the jasmine; too much bitterness, I think.  But, Lindt's Madagascar was made for this tea.  The fruitiness of the chocolate against the floral flavors, and that dry finish as a counterpoint to the richness of the Lindt, was just heavenly.

review/summary: Aromatic and pleasantly flavored
review/text: I look for a nice aroma in Jasmine tea. That's what really gets it for me. This one did the job. Delicate flavor, not bitter. Jasmine, and a lot of white teas, need to steep for a few minutes, but sometimes it goes bitter. Not the case with Rishi Organic Silve Needle Jasmine. The aroma is heavenly--delicate and unmistakably jasmine. Floral, perfumey, but not overpowering.<br /><br />I love loose teas. The problem with most is that they're pulverized and you get the icky crumbs that slip right through your tea ball or sieve. This is whole needle and is quite chunky. None got thru my strainer. That alone gets a nice rating. The tea is fresh looking and lightly aromatic before you brew. Nice light color after brewing. All in all, nice taste, nice look, nice size, nice aroma. A winner in my book.<br /><br />The can is attractive and has a tightly fitting lid. Nice generous supply and not a bad price. This one is a keeper. I'll buy it in the future!

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: I have been a long-time fan of Rishi Tea.  They are a company that has a far superior product to most tea found on the market today.  For years, I have ordered excellent teas, handpicked most of the time, from specific regions where only the best of its kind can be grown.  This White Tea (called Silver Needle here) is the first blush, the very first tiny leaves to come out in the spring and they have exceptionally light and delicate flavor.  The Jasmine flowers mixed in are just in the right proportion.  I am not usually a fan of Jasmine Tea.  Normally the only thing you can taste or smell is the Jasmine overpowering your senses.  This is not the case with this tea.  The mix is masterfully blended to give enough Jasmine without overpowering the delicate taste of newly leafed tea.  I hope AMAZON.COM continues to offer these outstanding products from this special company.  I have never tasted a RISHI Tea that I didn't like.  Silver Needle Jasmine is no exception.  If you are looking for a special tea to enjoy on a cool night, this is the one.

review/summary: Good overall
review/text: This loose leaf tea was a little bit stronger than I had expected from a white tea.  The aroma of the dry leaves is soft and once prepared, the aroma is still very mild.  Surprisingly, the flavor is strong and grassy - much more than I had expected based on the smell. It definitely tastes very earthy and organic.  I wasn't a huge fan of this particular blend. The jasmine was a little too flowery and overpowering for me - but if you absolutely love jasmine, this is the tea for you!<br /><br />The tea is very high quality, meticulously packed while still being easy enough to open.  The brewing instructions really do offer the best flavor - although I'd stay closer to 4 minutes than 5 or it gets bitter quickly.  Also, be sure the water temperature is 185 degrees when steeping. While I personally wouldn't purchase this blend again, I am definitely going to look into other flavors by this same tea company - the quality is fantastic.

review/summary: White tea with a smooth flavor and hints of jasmine
review/text: I am a big loose leaf tea drinker, although normally I drink green teas.  I love jasmine tea, so I was excited when I got to try this product through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />The tea is nicely packaged.  It comes with an outside seal as well as a metal insert that can be reused to keep the tea fresh.<br /><br />For each teaspoon of tea you use, you can get a couple steeps out of it.  I wouldn't use a teaspoon for more than a couple cups of tea though; it starts to get a bit weak.  Although, this is not Oolong tea, so I am impressed you can get a couple steeps out of it.<br /><br />The tea has a faint delicate jasmine odor to it.  I was impressed with how smooth the tea tasted.  There was no hint of bitterness and the tea rolls smoothly around your mouth and down your throat.  The hint of jasmine is perfect.  It is a subtle hint that I have come to associate with high quality teas; such as when I get hand rolled green tea jasmine pearls of tea.<br /><br />All in all I am very happy with this tea and would buy it again.  Some people have commented on the cost.  All I have to say is some of the loose leaf teas you buy at Teavana (especially their hand rolled green with jasmine) is much more expensive than this tea.  Additionally this is an organic tea, which probably costs more to produce.<br /><br />I have a little bit of trouble buying teas online because I like to see and smell them first.  Given the quality of this Rishi tea, I would be comfortable buying other Rishi teas online.<br /><br />A great tea!

review/summary: Olfactory heaven!
review/text: Are you an occasional tea drinker?  Do you buy the inexpensive off the shelf teas?  If so, don't try this tea because you'll never be happy with a tea bag again.  Rishi Silver Needle Jasmine Loose tea comes in a nice tin with an inner lid to keep the tea leaves fresh.  I opened the tin and immediately my nose was in heaven.  The jasmine scent was light and sweet and absolutely beautiful.  I practically skipped to the tea pot so I could heat the water.  I was making two cups so I measured two tablespoons of tea into the infuser and, after making sure the water was just the right temperature poured it through the leaves.  I allowed the tea to steep for 4 minutes and then poured the tea.  Once again my nose was in heaven and my mouth was not far behind.  The tea has a light, slightly fruity, jasmine flavor.  Because it is white tea it is not as tanic as other teas. It's smooth and soothing and refreshing. I can never go back to the off the shelf tea bags.  I can't wait to try other varieties of Rishi tea.

review/text: The Rishi Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Tea was delicate, flavorful, and left the hint of a wonderful after taste.  I'd classify it as an affordable luxury.  Many loose teas I've used in the past have left noticeable debris in bottom of the cup, but this did not happen with this tea.  The product actually appears to be pine needles.  I've had many good jasmine teas at Chinese restaurants over the years, but this tea beat them all.  The other thing I enjoyed:  the fragrance when opening the lid of the can.  Knowing the health benefits of green and white tea is a bonus.<br /><br />This tea would make a great impression as a housewarming gift or something to take for a dinner hostess.

review/text: Simply thrilled with the ingredients:  100% organic white tealeaves, 100% organic jasmine flowers.  No "natural" flavors and whatnot!  This is a very mild tea with a perfumey taste due to the smell jasmine flowers.  Thankfully it is not overpowering.  Some jasmine teas make me think I'm drinking a bottle of perfume!<br />I over brewed this (like 20 min) it tasted fine.  No bitterness.  The jasmine didn't become overpowering.  Because I overbrew, I don't reuse the tea, but you can if you brew it the recommend time of 4-5 min.  This makes the tea last that much longer!<br />The leaves are packed right up to the top of the tin & they are beautiful!  Long & slightly twisted green colored leaves with white velvet fuzz on them.  No broken up little pieces that are almost dust that some tea companies like to call loose leave or full leaf.<br />If you enjoy jasmine in your foods, you are sure to be pleased.  You can double your pleasure knowing you are consuming something clean, not loaded with pesticides & chemicals that are concentrated on non organic teas.  Who wants a "nice" cuppa chemicals?

review/summary: Delicately, Deliciously White
review/text: Before reviewing this product, some background about white tea might be helpful. I've been a serious student of tea for a few years now, so my intention is not to be pompous but rather to share what I've learned so that you can enjoy your tea to its fullest potential.<br />White tea is Chinese in origin, single-varietal, and the least processed of any tea. Once picked, it's allowed to dry naturally (preferably quickly, by sunlight) under careful observation--period. Because of this, it is extremely high in tea polyphenols and antioxidants, both of which are thought to contain health-promoting properties (it's believed by some that white tea is even more healthful than green). It tends to be rather delicate in flavor (depending on the grade) and has none of the grassy quality typically found in green teas (some find it easier on the stomach as well). The concept of merely drying the leaves has caught on because "white" tea is now being produced in other countries. And while the best of these are superb (Imperial Silver Tips from Darjeeling and Antler's d'Amour from Africa are personal favorites), they cannot in fact be considered true white tea, which must by definition be produced from Fujian's Da Bai Hao bush. I think of these other teas as "white-processed" rather than white.<br />The best scented teas are not perfumed chemically; rather, tea is combined with fresh blossoms (jasmine in this case) and allowed to absorb the fragrance over the course of several days, with new blossoms being added over the course of the infusion period. This is the method by which Rishi's teas are scented.<br />Now to be strictly accurate, Organic Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea isn't Silver Needle (Yin Zhen), which consists only of buds and is the highest grade of white tea. There are a fair amount of leaves to be found which makes me think this is closer to Bai Mu Dan (Preferred Peony), the grade just below Silver Needles). Regardless, it's nice tea with a lovely jasmine aroma (BTW, the Chinese drink jasmine tea to relieve respiratory distress). What follows is the best way to enjoy it.<br />White teas are usually brewed at lower temperatures that are similar to those used for green tea; however, the consensus among vendors seems to be that somewhat higher temperatures--185� - 190� F--are best for scented whites. I recommend halving Rishi's suggested brewing time and reducing the leaf a bit--2 teaspoons in 6 - 8 oz. of water for two or so minutes. Please take the time to warm your brewing vessel with boiling water, then heating the dry leaf in it covered for a minute or so after discarding the water used for warming. I also recommend brewing uncovered so that the tea doesn't "cook." (I've prepared a video review of the Bodum Canteen that demonstrate this, but my friend's husband has yet to code it so that I can finally post it). You'll end up with three good infusions of the same leaf, after which it can be soaked covered in about 6 oz. of water overnight in the fridge for a nice, light beverage. A lot of bang for the buck!<br />This is lovely tea, plus it comes in a reusable canister that's both practical and attractive. It's not as fine as my cherished Yin Zhu Silver Dragon Pearls (also white, not Rishi), nor do I like it as much as Rishi's green Dragon Pearls (which I reviewed some time ago, not for Vine), but I'm guessing that if bought on Amazon, it will be a good buy (it's unavailable at the time of this writing). In fact, I insist that my parents drink tea every day, and this is one I buy for them. Rishi carries some very good tea and this one is no exception. It's an excellent introduction to both jasmine and white tea, and the spiffy packaging makes it appropriate for gift-giving as well (in fact, it's the perfect size for a stocking-stuffer). Another very enjoyable Rishi offering.

review/summary: Rishi Silver Needle Jasmine - how do I love thee?
review/text: Let me count the ways!  ;)<br /><br />First, I love the tins.  When you open it up, you KNOW you are getting tea that has been properly stored!  And I love the specific brewing instructions.  If you're going to do it - do it the right way!<br /><br />Second, the aroma wafting out of the opened tin is intoxicating.  I LOVE Jasmine tea - or at least I thought I did - but I've never tasted any as delicate yet flavorful as this one.<br /><br />Third, I love that you can get more than one serving from a spoonful of leaves.  It makes the fact that this tea is somewhat expensive "easier to swallow" if you will.<br /><br />And fourth, I love that this lovely beverage can stand on its own, no further accoutrement necessary - hot or iced it's just delicious on its own.<br /><br />I like to use a French press, which is probably totally unorthodox but it works very nicely to make a good cuppa for me.<br /><br />This tea definitely goes on my "must have" list of teas - which is quite long - but I think this will be at or near the top of the list from now on.
