review/text: Wow!! This just may be my new favorite cereal! This version of Corn Flakes has a real bite to it. It maintains it's crunch all the way through the bowl. It may not be as "healthy" as other cereals but, for me, it's all about the taste. Annd this one has it!!

review/summary: Crunchy Nut Cereal
review/text: This cereal tastes wonderful.  It's vitamin and mineral enriched.  However, there are major drawbacks.<br /><br />It has almost 2.5 teaspoons of sugar in 3/4 cup of cereal with 1/2 cup of fat-free milk, and very little fiber.  A partial list of ingredients is as follows:  First is corn; 2nd sugar; 3rd peanuts; 4th honey; 5th malt flavoring; 6th molasses; 7th salt; 8th corn syrup.  The remaining 15 are colorings, vitamins, minerals, and wheat starch.  It has 20 grams of carbohydrates and  the milk adds another 6 for a total of 26 carbs.<br /><br />I would never consider this as part of a healthful diet for a child or adult.

review/text: Let's cut to the chase.  This is Kellogg's Nut & Honey Crunch dressed in a new box.<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />It tastes good (dry or covered in milk).<br />It stays pretty crunchy down to the last bite.<br />It smells honey nutty.<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />It leaves an aftertaste in your mouth.<br />It's not a healthy cereal.<br /><br />The first 6 ingredients go like this: Milled Corn, Sugar, Peanuts, Honey, Malt Flavoring, Molasses<br /><br />That's a lot of sweetness!  So, I eat it as an after dinner snack/desert.<br /><br />In the end, me and my sweet tooth like it!<br /><br />NOTE: According to the coupon on the side of the box, they are also coming out with "Roasted Nut & Honey".  I'm not sure how different that will taste but something to be on the look out for.<br /><br />Search "80's Nut & Honey Crunch Cereal Commercial" on YouTube for the reference to my title.

review/summary: Cracker Jack in cereal form?
review/text: My first thought upon opening this box was, "Whoa, this smells just like a box of Cracker Jack."<br /><br />And it did. Nutty with caramel and honey. Wasn't sure how that would taste, even thought maybe it might be a bit gross, but nope ... it was a good tasting cereal.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is nothing out of the ordinary or special -- you've tasted this before -- but it's good. Regular cereal flakes slathered in sugary honey, a light dosing of nuts, and VERY crunchy. If you remember Nut & Honey cereal, you'll know this one.

review/summary: Tasty, but very sweet
review/text: Like it's counterpart Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, Crunchy Nut Golden Honey is sweet and crunchy with a nutty flavor.  This version is in a flake form, which gives a different texture than the O's shape of the other.  The taste is similar, but somehow this one seemed sweeter to me.  The nutty flavor is good, and for a minute I recognized the taste from a childhood memory.  I had to think about it for a while, and then I remembered-- this tastes like the peanut brittle that my mother used to make when I was growing up!  While it doesn't have the same sugar levels as peanut brittle, it's peanutty sweet.  It also stays crunchy in milk.  I really liked it, but it's not something I'd buy for my kids.  They'd take one bite and never want to have regular (healthier) bran flakes again!

review/summary: Awww, Nuts!
review/text: Supposedly, Crunchy Nut has been available in England for quite some time and Kellogg's finally decided to bring it over to US shores.  Kellogg's used to make "Nut & Honey Crunch", though it was discontinued a while ago. Like Crunchy Nut, they came in both flakes and "Os" versions. I have fond memories of eating Nut & Honey Crunch in the 80s, and missed it when it was discontinued. Remember the "Nothin' Honey" commercials? ;)<br /><br />Well, if you want to relive those days, give Crunchy Nut a try. To the best of my taste buds' recollection, the crunch and flavor are nearly identical. There is the sweet tang of the honey coating and satisfying texture of the peanut-sprinkled corn flakes. The flavor is comparable to frosted flakes, but with honey and nut flavors. It holds up well in milk, retaining it's crunch down to the last bite. Comparing ingredients and nutritional information from their respective boxes shows that they match up pretty closely there as well, though the serving size for N&H is 2/3 cup and for CN it is 3/4 cup. If anything, ounce for ounce, Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Flakes looks a little healthier for you than Nut & Honey Crunch.<br /><br />That's not to say it truly healthy though. Sure, it is fortified with the usual assortment of vitamins and when eaten with milk you fill even more of your daily nutritional requirements. However, it is still laden with sugar, honey,molasses and High Fructose Corn Syrup. My taste buds must have changed a bit since the 80s because it is almost too sweet for me. Blame it on a steady diet of low sugar cereals over recent years. I would have a hard time eating this regularly first thing in the morning. Instead, I mimic a habit of my father's and eat a small bowl of it in place of dessert. You could even mix it with other cereals that contain less sugar (as my dad would do).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Crunch Nut tastes great on it's own, and if you have a sugar/crunch craving, it hits the spot. It even makes a good breading base for fried chicken. I just no longer have quite the sweet tooth I once did. I give Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Flakes fives stars for flavor, mouth-feel and craving satisfaction. One star comes off for health impact though. If you decide to give it a try, I would shop around a little. Current 3rd party vendor prices are ludicrous. A much better deal can probably be found at your local grocer.

review/summary: YUM!!!
review/text: This cereal is some kind of awesome.  I usually eat Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds, and this is every bit as good and maybe a little better.<br /><br />It's basically corn flakes coated in honey with chopped nuts.  Doesn't sound thrilling but it has a great flavor.<br /><br />It stays crispy in milk only for a few minutes before getting a little soggy, but I prefer a softer cereal anyway.  The thing that really stands out for me is the honey taste even more so than the nut taste.  It still is a great combination though.  I think they really hit a home run with this cereal and I'll probably buy more.<br /><br />This can also be eaten dry, as a snack, it tastes good on it's own with no milk too.  I think I may have found a new favorite cereal!  At 120 calories per serving, it fits into my diet as well.

review/summary: Yummy but is it healthy?
review/text: If Frosted Flakes and Cracker Jack got together and had a baby, they would call it Crunchy Nut Cornflakes.  This cereal tastes great - it gets the thumbs up from my son who enjoys cereal enough he spends his allowance on buying boxes of his favorites.  Unfortunately, the reason it tastes so good is the high sugar content, which is why I am not giving it a rave review.  I whole-heartedly believe that one should not start the day with "dessert".  My own breakfast usually consists of oatmeal made with milk and NO sugar.  When my kids were little I refused to buy dessert cereals and even now that they are older, I encourage good eating habits.<br /><br />Cornflakes (plain) are one cereal I've never minded them eating and I thought this would be "cornflakes with a zing".  But, while they added in the honey and nut flavors, they also added in a bunch of sugar (it's the second ingredient listed on the box!) so rather than feel good about serving it, it's a cereal that I would reserve for a treat.<br /><br />So for a rating, here's my thought process.  Tastes great and good for you would be a 5.  Tastes bad and bad for you would be a 1.  Tastes great but not good for you then, would have to go somewhere in the middle.  So I've given this a 3.

review/text: Nut 'n Honey is back! This was my favorite cereal in the 80's. They took it off the market, brought it back as Honey Nut Cornflakes, took it away again, and now brought it back. I don't know why they didn't revive the old name - it was a lot more memorable. Kellogg, please don't take it away, again.<br /><br />This is a very sweet cereal. It's closer to Frosted Flakes than Honey Bunches of Oats. Because it's sugar glazed it holds its crunch for the entire bowl. And the remaining milk is delicious to slurp!

review/summary: Here's what the family says...
review/text: Overall, I would definitely recommend you try this one. It's a familiar flavor, but somehow different. It stays crunchy in milk. And it's appealing to all ages.<br /><br />Although criticized by others for sweetness, at 11 grams per serving, it's less than the typically sweet cereals. It has bits of nuts that aren't distinguishable flavor-wise by themselves, but add to the overall flavor. To me it's almost bittersweet because of the molasses undertones.<br /><br />My teenagers love it. In fact, my 15 year old saw the picture of this cereal while I'm reviewing it and told me "hey, I love that cereal."<br /><br />My husband didn't love it. But I'm sure he would eat it if he was hungry. He's generally very picky.<br /><br />I will be buying it again for my family. (Vine gave me one for free, but everyone ate it before I could get a bowl, so I bought a couple more boxes). There's another "Os" version that is good as well.

review/text: This cereal is pretty good, though it really tastes a lot like Honey Bunches of Oats and, consequently isn't really a new market in the cereal industry.  I gave it three stars because in addition to the lack of originality I had hoped for, I found it a bit sweet for my tastes.  My two kids, however, liked it - neither is overly accustomed to sweet cereals so maybe I am overly sensitive to the sweetness in this box.<br /><br />If you like Honey Bunches of Oats, you will probably like this (though this one has slightly less crunch to it).  As I said, it is "okay" but I probably won't purchase it again unless maybe I have a great coupon.

review/summary: No Need to Belabor the Point ...
review/text: ...these are REALLY good. I love cold cereal (okay, I also love hot cereal) and sometimes nothing hits the spot like a bowl of corn flakes. I usually like the plain ones (A&P's house brand, which I suspect is made by Nestl&eacute;, is a favorite) and add my own sugar but I couldn't resist trying Kellogg's Crunchy Nut flakes when they were offered and I'm glad I did. They're sweet without being cloying, somehow manage to stay crisp in the bowl (maybe the glaze works like armor?), and the peanut presence (crunch/flavor) was a unique and tasty addition. Granted, this isn't going to appeal to the health-conscious crowd but for what it is--mainstream cold cereal--it's very satisfying and well worth sampling if you like cornflakes and peanuts. And BTW, it makes for nice snacking out of hand without the milk, too. :)

review/summary: cracker jack "candy in a box" cereal...very little nutritional value
review/text: This is basically glazed cornflakes (instead of frosted, which is powdery-looking) with a hint of peanut sprinkled atop. The glaze has a nice caramel-molasses flavor that is maybe a little too sweet for me, but fine for other people, and mixed with the subtle peanut flavor, it really does taste like just like Cracker Jack. All it's missing is the prize!<br />Nutritionally, like many other candy-in-a-box cereals, this one isn't so great, with only 2% of your daily value in fiber (less than 1g), 11g of sugars, and 9% of your daily value in carbs (26g). Fortified with some vitamins, it has a slight nutritional value of 10% vitamins A, C, and D, 0% calcium, and 25% Iron, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, B6, Folic Acid, and B12, but if it's vitamins you wanted in the first place, you'd probably look elsewhere.<br />It's a nice snack if you like Cracker Jack, but I wouldn't call it a wholesome breakfast food.

review/text: An old favourite, that is finally going to be available in the US.<br /><br />This cereal is very much a Frosted Flakes type cornflake with a hint of honey flavour and shredded peanuts in the glaze. The peanut is very finely shredded and a roughly the size of finely-shredded coconut.  This small size enables it to be evenly distributed onto the cornflakes with the glaze.  The overall effect is a tasty honey-scented sweet cornflake that is extra crunchy and slightly peanuty. [See photos above]<br /><br />However, my SO was quite disappointed when opening the bag to not find whole, half or at least long pieces of crushed peanut, although there was a strong peanut scent. He had expected a nut & cornflake version of Raisin Bran.

Because of the sugar coating, it stays crunchy longer than some flake cereals. It's sweeter than I'd like, but the statistics are quite good, even so. 120 calories with only 1 gram of fat per serving. On the negative side, there are 11 grams of sugar and less than one gram of fiber. I often mix sweet cereals with others and this one would be a good choice for that. This is a very tasty new cereal for Kellogg's that I'm happy to recommend.

It appears that they covered the flakes with a mixture of sugar and nut dust and that's about all the nuts you're going to get in this cereal.  Unless they forgot to put the nuts in my box, you won't be finding any in yours either.<br /><br />Thumbs down because the last thing we need is another sugary cereal, because it's not new as the box implies, and because there are no nuts in it.

review/summary: Crunchy? Yes.  Nutty? Eh.
review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy nut cereal consists of Cornflakes that have been doused in a honey-sugar combo and sprinkled with very small pieces of chopped peanuts. They taste exactly like they sound -- a mostly honey-flavored variation of Cornflakes. In other words, they taste a lot like Frosted Flakes. The peanuts add very little taste-wise, and the pieces are so small that I can't imagine they contribute much in terms of protein (a serving size has 2 grams of protein). Crunchy Nut is fine but not really very distinctive.

review/summary: Can't really taste the nuts
review/text: Don't get me wrong, the cereal tastes "good"--in a bowl, or on its own; it's just that I couldn't really taste any peanuts.  No, I don't think the product is mislabeled (peanuts are the third most prevalent ingredient), just that the pieces of nuts are so small, and the honey so at the forefront of the taste that the peanut taste is completely overpowered.  (I only remember one bite that I thought I tasted something.)<br /><br />Is this a bad thing? Maybe not.  If they added a bunch more peanuts the caloric and fat content would go through the roof, and, as it stands now it has the same calories as a regular sugar cereal --don't let the name fool you-- it is every bit as sugary as Frosted Flakes.  You just can't see it because the honey is transparent.<br /><br />The cereal is also pretty sweet tasting... maybe too much for me, as I was expecting more of a Chex mix type cereal with very mildly sweet taste and nuts.  Sugar, however, is the second most prevalent ingredient, and honey, molasses, and high fructose corn syrup are in there, too.  Not a healthy cereal, per se, but not terribly unhealthy, either.  Decent but not great.  I think I would have liked it better if they doubled the nuts and cut the sugar in half.

review/text: No mushy flakes here, these keep their crunch to the bottom of the bowl.  They're  much more substantial tasting than corn flakes, and with the addition of fruit, I believe they make a healthy breakfast, DESPITE the sugar they contain. (They contain 11g of sugar, by the way, which is less than some bran cereals with raisins.)<br /><br />A side note: a few years ago, I read a study that said kids and adults who use unsweetened cereals actually end up eating more sugar, because they add so much of their own from the sugar bowl.<br /><br />Back to the taste: I didn't find anything particularly "nutty" tasting about the flakes. I could see the small, peanut flecks on each flake, but the taste didn't come through. Still, that didn't detract from the product at all, for me.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed these very much, and would recommend giving them a try.

Sweet, but not too sweet.  At least not for me!<br /><br />I stopped eating regular corn flakes years ago because it was so bland tasting and because it got milk-logged and mushy in the bowl. This Crunchy Nut cereal did not do that. I truly liked it and it will be on my shelf as a breakfast food and/or a late night snack!<br /><br />I would give it a try!

review/summary: Sweet - SWEET,  Cereal
review/text: This was a sweet - exceedingly sweet cereal which in truth is just cornflakes with a few peanut crumbs glazed onto the flakes.  Thye do not hold up well to milk and go soggy very fast.  My 6 and 9 year old thought thay made a great treat but I would NEVER consider this nutrition.  At a guess sugar makes up 35-40% of product. 26 carbs a serving.<br /><br />Save yourself the money - the nuts are not tastable so buy cornflakes -a much better buy for weight and pour on all the sugar you want if that is what you are after - same result better savings.

review/summary: Yummy in a not too peanuty way
review/text: I'm not a peanut maniac, so it was with trepidation that I opened up the box. An almost overpowering smell hit me at once, something that a peanut lover would appreciate but someone who was kind of on the fence about it would not. Suffice to say, the end product wasn't too peanutcentric. It's actually a perfect balance of sweetness and peanut taste without any huge peanut chunks. This isn't the most original cereal in the world as I'm sure there has to have been at least two or three that are similar to this. Still, I'd recommend this one to anyone looking for a cereal that fits perfectly in between a healthier type of cereal and some chocolate sugar frosted bomb atrocity that would have your kids and probably you bouncing off the wall like some speed freak on a bender. Fans of Corn Flakes, Honey Nut Cheerios and Oh's! cereals would do well to search this product out.

review/summary: Breakfast is new again!
review/text: This answers my need at breakfast to have something tasty and at the same time good for me.<br /><br />I love corn flakes but always needed to put sugar on them for a little extra flavor.  This cereal takes care of that.  The honey, malt, molasses, and best of all, peanuts combine for a terrific and satisfying bowl of goodness.<br /><br />It even tastes good enough to eat without milk, but tastes great with milk and added fruit, bananas being one of my favorites.<br /><br />Push away from the drive-up window and have a bowl of this in the morning - tastes good, and better for you!

review/summary: Crunchy and Sweet -  REAL Sweet
review/text: This is a pretty good tasting cereal but it is sweet beyond all get-out.  It is so sweet that it completely overpowers the nut flavors.  I get just a hint of malt through the sweetness.<br /><br />The best plan is to eat this with a cup of coffee by your side so you can take a sip every now and then to counteract the sugar and honey taste.<br /><br />11 grams of sugar doesn't seem like much, but when the company adds in honey plus molasses it hits the taste buds with sledgehammer subtleness.  Give it a try if you like sweet.<br /><br />AD2

review/summary: Crunchy Nut? Just sweet cornflakes!
review/text: I had pictured these cereals quite differently than what it really is. I am quite disappointed to find that:<br /><br />1) nuts are only peanuts<br />2) I need magnifying glass to see the real peanuts<br />3) cereal is very sweet<br />4) a bowl of cereal and milk is not at all filling<br /><br />There is so much sugar (honey) that the flakes glisten. It is as crunchy as Kellog's corn flakes. They don't get soggy as quickly though - probably the sugar coating delays the process.<br /><br />Serving size is 3/4 cup and has 120 calories, 2% fat, 7% sodium, and 11g sugars. Ingredients (in order) are corn, sugar, peanuts, honey, and so on. As you can see there is more sugar than peanuts!<br /><br />In contrast, regular Kellog corn flakes serving size is 1 cup and has 100 calories, 0 fat, 8% sodium and 2g sugars.<br /><br />We will definitely not buy these cereals.

review/summary: WAY too sweet: Like eating Cracker Jacks with milk
review/text: I'm giving this more than one star only because eating Cracker Jacks in a bowl with milk may sound like heaven to you. Personally, I think this cereal is wayyyyyyyyyy too sweet. Here are the ingreds. in order of highest content:<br /><br />1. Milled corn (think Cracker Jacks)<br />2. Sugar (ditto)<br />3. Peanuts (ditto)<br />4. Honey (more sugar)<br />5. Malt flavoring<br />6. Molasses (more sugar)<br />7. Salt<br />8. High Fructose Corn Syrup (you know . . . sugar)<br /><br />It is deceptive because it says it only contains 11 g of sugar per serving. However, a serving is only 3/4 cup. I actually measured this out today, and trust me, I will be looking for something else (a doughnut?!!!) in about an hour, and if you stick with the serving size, you will be, too.  3/4 cup is probably about 6 spoonfuls. And then you're done.<br /><br />This is so much like candy I can actually feel it cementing itself to my teeth. So if you give this to your kids, make sure they brush brush brush (and floss).<br /><br />They've managed to fortify this with some vitamins (although not a whole lot), so is this better than skipping breakfast? Probably. But could/should you find a healthier alternative? Definitely.

review/summary: Decadently Delicious
review/text: Tasty, addictive, sweet -- new Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut cereal is delicious breakfast food, but it isn't a health food. The front of the box does not say it is. The description is  "golden flakes of corn drizzled with honey and topped with real peanuts." (That word "real" seems unnecessary.)<br /><br />It is obvious that the Kellogg people know how good it is. Here's what the back of the package says: "With the perfect blend of sweet and nutty in every crunchy bite, Kellogg's Crunch Nut Cereal is so delicious you won't want to wait until tomorrow to eat it. Luckily, you don't have to. It's morning somewhere."<br /><br />I like it as a topping on my healthy oatmeal.

review/summary: It's Morning Somewhere: Better Eating Than Reading
review/text: When I first saw the jacket photo of this book, I was intrigued by the subtitle/teaser line "It's Morning Somewhere."  A pensive, philosophical, thought-provoking line.  So imagine my disappointment when the package arrived, and there was no book anywhere to be found... instead, the box was nearly full of what appeared to be sweet-smelling packing flakes.<br /><br />After also fruitlessly searching for any instruction manual for the product, I was trying to decide what to do next when my daughter came in, gave me a withering look as only a teenager can, and (indicating the picture on the front of the box, showing the packing flakes in a bowl with milk) suggested I just try EATING some.<br /><br />To my astonishment, this proved very successful.  The flakes had a sweet, nutty taste rather like my grandmother's peanut brittle from when I was a kid.  The peanutty taste was not really overpowering, and while they WERE noticeably sweet, the sweetness was also not excessive.  While I like peanuts and peanut butter, peanut-flavored items like peanut butter cookies are not my personal favorite.  Even so, I enjoyed the sweet-nuttiness of this stuff enough to have another bowl or two over the next few days, with just as good results.  I think anyone who particularly enjoys peanut-flavored confections (peanut cookies, peanut candies) would enjoy this product even more than I did.<br /><br />I might also mention that I only got to have a total of two or three bowls of the interesting flakes myself, because my wife and kids proceeded to devour them with great enthusiasm, declaring them yummy.

review/summary: Crunchy? Maybe. Nutty? Nope.
review/text: I am in awe of the reviewers who were able to see - much less taste - the nuts in Kellogg's Golden Honey Nut Crunchy Nut cereal.  They must have far better palates than I do, because to me these taste exactly like Frosted Flakes, if Frosted Flakes used honey.  Were I blindfolded, I wouldn't be able to tell you that there were supposed to be nuts in this cereal at all.  In fact, a blindfold wouldn't be needed given how tiny the peanut pieces are. For a cereal that has the word "nut" in it's name twice, I expected more.<br /><br />Overall, this cereal is fine.  Frosted Flakes (its closest cousin) are the sweet sibling of Corn Flakes, one of the most classic cereals out there.  It's hard to go totally wrong with that type of lineage. Still, it's hardly nutty, and given that's its claim to fame, I can't recommend it.

review/summary: Definitely a new one of my favorites
review/text: I tried this cereal from Amazon and got hooked pretty instantly.  It's got a lot of crunch and doesn't get soggy as similar cereals, and it's on the sweeter end of "adult" cereals but isn't too sweet.  I can buy this to settle my urge for a more sugary cereal normally marketed to children, and not face embarrassment at the checkout stand when the cashier asks about my kids and I give them a sort of, "whaaaaaaat?!" look and demand a paternity test.<br /><br />It also has a nice honey flavor instead of fake-fruit or fake-chocolate.  It might be fake-honey too but at least it tastes more like the real deal.  There are a good ratio of nuts to flakes so there shouldn't be any major disappointment there.  How much more can I say about a breakfast cereal?  It's good!  It's good enough to add to your rotation.

I haven't found one yet that rate 5 stars, but I'd say <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044CPA28">Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut</a> came pretty darn close.<br /><br />With it having "crunchy" in the title, I expected it to hold up a little longer under milk.  And while it did seem to stay crunchy longer than similar types, it just didn't quite live up to the expectations associated with its name.<br /><br />The nut clusters are smaller than other like cereals, but it did not distract from the taste.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that Kellogg's Crunchy Nut will find it's way onto my shopping list quite regularly.

review/text: I'm not too adventurous with my cereal choices, but I was drawn to this when I saw it at the grocery, and picked it up from Amazon.  It reminds me of Frosted Flakes, though a bit crunchier, and with a nuttier honey taste.  Like Frosted Flakes, it gets soggy fast in milk, so I tried to pour small bowls (and go back for more if I wanted it).<br /><br />We have continued to purchase this product, and it generally gets eaten right away.  I guess that's a good thing, but it's pretty sweet, so it may not be the "healthiest" choice out there.  Check the nutrition info and judge for yourself, I guess.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend you give it a try, if you like Frosted Flakes, or nutty cereals, or just enjoy trying something new.  (There is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CYLW7A">Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, 10.8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> variety, but we haven't tried that one yet...)

After my first taste, I realized it was a bit too sweet for breakfast.  But it does make a pretty good snack!  So, maybe not great for breakfast, but definitely better than munching on more fattening foods throughout the day.  Perhaps not what Kelloggs originally wanted as a marketing plan for this product, but I bet it would work: "Snack on Crunchy Oat!"

review/summary: Best for those who love honey.
review/text: They are ok. We (me and the family) were not as wild about them as we thought we might be at first. They definitely are crunchy, I will give them that.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because they are basically just corn flakes with a new twist on the taste. They do a nice job of distributing the nuts throughout. They are able to get the peanuts into each bite because they seem to stick to the corn flakes, which makes sense. If it was any other way, they would just sink to the bottom of the box.<br /><br />I prefer the taste of the frosted corn flakes a bit more over the honey. I guess it's just a different kind of sweetness. But I believe that for those who's favorite cereals are ones with honey flavors in them, they should try this out, since I think they would be perfect for them!

While it doesn't appear to be especially good for you, it is at least average as far as calories and nutritious content goes.  I tried the same cereal that comes in "O" shapes and did not like it at all.  In the flake form though - hands down the tastiest cold cereal I've had in a long time.

review/summary: Sweet, almost too much so
review/text: This new cereal by Kellogg's is comparable to Honey Bunches of Oats in shape and texture.  While not off-putting, this cereal takes a sweetness flavor to the max.  Some will find it too much; others might enjoy it.  Also, I'm kind of surprised Kellogg's used high fructose corn syrup in a new cereal, given the current stigma of that additive.  This flavor is okay, but I recommend the Roasted Honey Nut first.

review/summary: More Crunchy than Nutty
review/text: This is sweeter honey coated version of Kelloggs Cornflakes,  It was more sweet than nutty,  you get very little nutty taste, it is overwhemled by the honey coating.  It would be great if it had more nuts since it will help increase the "Crunchy" texture.  It does not stay Crunchy long, like regular cornflakes it becomes very soluble after three minutes.<br /><br />I would recommend eating it with any unsweetened milk, or you will be getting an extremely sweetened concentrated milk when you finish the cereal.  I like drinking the left over milk and it was just gaggingly sweet when you use vanilla or chocolate milk.  I tried it with Fat free, 1%, 2%, chocolate and whole cow's milk.  I also tried it with Soy Milk (vanilla, unsweetened, chocolate), Rice drink (vanilla and Plain), and Almond milk (vanilla, chocolate, and Plain).  It tastes the best with plain almond milk, you get a better nutty flavor and the honey coating mixes well with the milk.<br /><br />Plain dry "Crunchy Nut" cereal makes me cough so I think it would be hard to make this into a portable dry snack. I would definitely recommend this cereal to a sugar junkie, but the honey coating is too sweet for me.

review/summary: Very sweet cereal
review/text: This is a good cereal, but relatively high in sugar. Of course my girls enjoyed it because it is sweet. Taste and consistency similar to frosted corn flakes. It is, after all, toasted cornflakes -- of course with nuts. If you like sweet cereals and don't mind the extra calories of the higher sugar, the taste is good. If you are looking for a lower sugar alternative, good old Product 19 from Kellogs is far healthier. If you are looking for flakes and nuts I would recommend one of higher fiber alternatives like Kirkland Signature Cinnamon Pecan which is also available on Amazon.

review/text: My kids really enjoy this cereal probably because it so sweet. If you have had Nut & Honey Crunch, it tastes very similar.<br />The image on the box shows each piece coated in nut flakes, far from accurate! You will find a few nut flakes on most of the corn flakes, some with none at all.<br />The cereal stays crunchy for a decent amount of time in milk and is very satisfying to eat.<br /><br />I have't tried them but I imagine these would be a good coating for adding crunch to foods that can handle a sweet flavor. Perhaps over salmon, chicken, sweet potato casserole, etc.

review/text: Our family liked Kellogg's crunchy nut cereal very much for that extra crunchy feeling with a coating of nuts on the top and it was not too sweet. It was tasty like the other kellogg's brand cereals even more crunchy than their own cereals. Kids can eat as a morning cereal or as a snack even. I wish they had mixed some other nuts, other flavors or dried nuts to even taste more good. I think anyone would like this cereal. Its worth trying once and see if you like it too.

review/text: I really liked Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Cereal. It has a nice honey taste, but isn't overpoweringly sweet like Frosted Flakes. At the risk of repeating the obvious, it has a sweet nutty taste and is nicely crunchy. It makes for a very satisfying breakfast.<br /><br />I usually don't bother with milk in my cereal, but I tried a bowl and it was great. Some cereals get soggy very fast, but this one stayed crunchy long enough for me to finish the bowl.<br /><br />I was hoping to have a few more bowls so I could write a more detailed review, but my wife and kids polished off the box too quickly. That in itself is an endorsement. :)

review/text: I really enjoyed this cereal and am looking forward to buying more.  They're corn flakes with a hint of honey and roasted nut sweetness and crunchiness.  I had also tried the Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey, the ones shaped like 'O's and that had much more of a roasted peanut taste which wasn't what I was looking for in a cereal, although if you're a real peanut lover it would be right up your alley.  For just a bit of honey/roasted nut taste I highly recommend the flakes.

review/summary: how nutty and sweet do you want to be?
review/text: After hearing that this cereal has been a long-time favorite in England, I was eager to give it a try.<br /><br />Kellogg's Crunchy Nut - Golden Honey Nut does have a lot of flavor in every bite - you can taste the honey and nuts, in good balance. Make no mistake, this may not be the full-on sugar taste of Frosted Flakes, but this is a sweet-tasting cereal.<br /><br />I was surprised to read afterwards that the nuts are actually peanuts, because there certainly isn't a strong peanut flavor. But people with peanut allergies be warned!<br /><br />I'm one who likes my cereal a bit healthier and less-sweet, though. If you compare this to plain, unsweetened Cheerios, at the same 3/4-cup serving size you're getting 50% more calories (120 vs. 80). It would take 3 teaspoons of sugar to equal that with the Cheerios!<br /><br />Although it stays crispy, Kellogg's Crunchy Nut does get soggy fairly quickly, which is not my taste.<br /><br />So I guess the question is - when choosing your first meal of the day - how nutty and sweet do you want to be?

review/summary: A wonderful, crispy and flavorful breakfast treat
review/text: This product isn't anything like I thought... it is so much better.  I had anticipated a heavy peanut flavor, but it appears that the peanut honey coating is there to help keep the cereal crispy in milk for a longer period of time.  No sugar is required as the honey gives you just the right amount of sweetness.  The flakes stay nice and crispy for the entire eating process (unless you are playing in-between or working the morning crossword puzzle).  The taste combination is fantastic.  I remember a similar product from some years back, also made by Kellogs that was named something like "Nut and Honey".  While they were similar, this product doesn't have the heavy nut of the heavy honey flavor from the older product.  Instead, it provides a very smooth mix that makes for a very pleasant breakfast experience.  I recommend this product.

review/summary: A Payday Bar for Breakfast
review/text: My girls love trying out new breakfast cereals, and we go through three to five boxes of cold cereal each week.  They were excited about this one, since it smells sooo yummy.  But the first bowls that I poured went uneaten (I was a good sport and choked mine down) and they've never reached for it again.  I'm personally surprised that Kellog's thought a cereal covered in peanuts would be a good idea in this day & age, what with fatal peanut allergies springing up everywhere. That's not my problem, though.  My problem is simply that the cereal is not good.  It is horrifyingly sickly-sweet!  Although the flakes do stay crispy in milk for a good long time (this might be part of the problem... a little bland mushiness would be welcome), this cereal is too sweet to stomach.  And the aftertaste is no improvement.  As my 7 year old daughter remarked, very accurately, "It smells better than it tastes."  This box of cereal tastes exactly like a Payday bar.  Maybe there's an audience out there of people who were already going to eat candy for breakfast, but I would rather not.  Skip this one.

But I'm pretty sure that this is that old cereal, repackaged.<br /><br />And since I loved that cereal, I really liked this.

review/summary: Crispy, sweet cereal with a nutty taste
review/text: I have always loved sweet cereals growing up. As an adult, I still have a kid-like love for certain cereals. Frosted Flakes, however, was not on my checklist of cereals that I loved growing up. Kellogs now introduces Crunchy Nut, which, in my opinion is a modified version of Frosted Flakes which add nut bits onto the flakes. So if you love Frosted Flakes, there is no reason why you would not like this brand of cereal. Stay crunchy in milk and sweetens the milk as you go. There is nothing entirely new or original here, but its tasty and you wont be disappointed.

review/summary: Sweet - Very, Very Sweet
review/text: Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal doesn't come packaged as a kids' breakfast item, but it sure was a hit with the under-10 crowd in my house.  One bowl revealed the reason why:  it bears a striking resemblance to Frosted Flakes.  The crunchy nut aspect of the cereal comes from tiny nut bits on the flakes themselves, not from any sort of separate clusters.  For that reason, their appearance is actually hit-or-miss from bite to bite.  However, that sweetness is in every spoonful, and if you're not searching for a lot of that flavor, then this may not be the cereal for you.  It's strange to me that the box gives the impression of a wholesome, possibly even healthy cereal and yet the taste is pure kids' Saturday morning treat.

review/summary: High School Favorite Makes a Comeback in Disguise
review/text: In high school I found my perfect cereal. It was sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth, it sated my desire for cornflakes and, as an added bonus, it had peanuts. That cereal was called Nut & Honey Crunch. I used to buy it in bulk and sometimes, when I felt like mixing things up a bit I'd add some Rice Chex.<br /><br />And all of a sudden Nut & Honey Crunch was no longer on the grocery store shelves. I missed it. Then this came along and I decided to give it a shot. The first time I tasted it, Nut & Honey Crunch came to mind moments before I did a little happy dance. It has fewer peanuts and is not as sweet, but it's close and gives me a similar flavor when I mix it with Rice Chex.<br /><br />Since I prefer my cereal a bit on the squishier side, I like to let it sit for about 5 minutes first to soften up the flakes and flavor the milk (yes, I'm a slurp the milk from the bowl kinda gal), but it still stayed relatively crunchy while I ate.<br /><br />Now, if you're watching your caloric intake or are trying to maintain a healthy diet, I'd be more inclined to call this cereal dessert rather than a wholesome nutritious breakfast, so it should definitely be consumed in moderation.<br /><br />Note: Watch the price because it may be (much) more cost effective to purchase directly from the grocer.

review/summary: Sweet & crunchy, but not a great breakfast cereal
review/text: I like cold breakfast cereal and usually have four to five different boxes in the kitchen cabinet most of the time.  I also like the flavor of peanuts, so I figured this product would be worth trying.<br /><br />The flakes reminded me of Kellogg's Frosted Flakes -- very crisp, very sweet.  I tried it with milk for the first time for breakfast. I found the flavor of peanuts at breakfast was not very enjoyable.  The next day, I tried eating some as a snack, right out of the box.  It was in the late afternoon.  As a snack at this time of day, the product was far more enjoyable.  I also tried it sprinkled on vanilla ice cream, which was good.<br /><br />The combination of ultra sweetness and peanuts didn't work for me early in the morning.  But thinking of it as a snack and using it apart from its traditional intent, I found it tasty and satisfying.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Though not a picky eater at all, I am fairly choosy when it comes to my cereal. I like low calories and sugar, high protein and fiber, and a great taste. For a sweetened cereal (great for a dessert at night) 11g of sugar isn't too high. It's not fabulous, but not horrible either. There are 120 calories in a serving...again, not bad, but the serving size is only 3/4 of a cup, rather than the 1 cup most cereals measure by. Protein and fiber are almost non-existent. The taste, however, is fantastic!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the cereal in moderation or for a dessert rather than the main source of breakfast. It probably won't keep you or the kids full for very long because of the lack of protein and fiber.<br /><br />If you're looking for a suggestion of a delicious cereal that's also good for you, I would try the Kashi GoLean Crisp in Toasted Berry Crumble. 9grams of protein, 8grams of fiber, and 10grams of sugar per serving. And very yummy! Amazon sells that by the 4pack as well.

review/text: The last time Kellogg's attempted a "honey nut" cornflake I was not impressed.  While the flavor was good the flakes were extremely "crunchy", bordering on hard.  I had to let them soak a bit before the texture would be acceptable.  They were not the "Frosted Flakes" with a honey nut flavor I was expecting.<br /><br />"Cruncy Nut" is what I expected the first time.  The smell of honey hits your nose every time the package is opened.  The flavor is moderately strong honey with a hint of nut on a flake that is crunchy but *not* hard.  The texture is very similar to "Frosted Flakes" and the crunch holds up in milk similarly to "Frosted Flakes".<br /><br />This one's earned a regular place on my cereal shelf.

review/text: This cereal has a good flavor, reminiscent of nuts and honey.  There is also an underlying flavor of malt and molasses.  However, it is much too sweet for my tastes.  Perhaps if it was sweetened simply with the honey and not the additional high fructose corn syrup, I would have liked it better.<br /><br />A box of cereal is typically eaten within 4 or 5 days in my home.  However, this one is still half full after 3 weeks because no one in the family likes it.  If you are a fan of very sweet cereals, you would probably like it much better than my family and I did.

review/summary: Sweet, Peanuty, Corn Flakes
review/text: If you like peanut flavor with your sweetened corn flakes, you will probably like this cereal.  They are sweet (too sweet for me) but not overly sugared; a 31 g serving has 11 g of sugar.  There are more sugary cereals on the market than this one.  This cereal contains High Fructose Corn Syrup, sugar, molasses & honey.  A smorgasbord of sweeteners!<br /><br />The peanuts bits are very small of course - I wouldn't expect whole peanuts if they're going to be stuck to the flakes.  They do add a nice peanut flavor & texture.<br /><br />It stays crisp just slightly longer than regular corn flakes.  I actually like that they become soggy because I prefer soggy cereal...I know, it's weird.<br /><br />I would only buy this cereal to top off my unsweetened shredded wheat - it adds a little interest to a plain bowl of cereal but it's too much sugar for my taste to eat a whole serving of this cereal alone.  But if you like a sweeter cereal & peanuts, you will probably like this just fine.

And besides the usual suspects, it can be surprisingly difficult to find a tasty cereal that isn't loaded with sugar. So, when I saw this one, I thought we would give it a try (not being privy to the ingredient list beforehand).<br /><br />The flavor is really good - I don't find it overly sweet, and there is a definite overall nut flavor. It tastes delicious both with milk and straight out of the hand. It doesn't appear to get soggy overly fast, which is a huge criteria for me. My husband said he finds it a bit too sweet (he prefers Corn Flakes), and my daughter (who is 4) ate about 3 bites before asking for something else.<br /><br />However, what absolutely ensures that I will not be buying this cereal in the future, is the ingredient list. Out of the first 8 ingredients, 4 of them are a form of sugar. This is how it reads:<br /><br />"Milled corn, sugar, peanuts, honey, malt flavoring, molasses, salt, high fructose corn syrup...."<br /><br />I attempt to avoid HFCS whenever I can - I'm not of the "it's completely evil" mindset, but I believe that it's hard to have moderation when it is in absolutely EVERYTHING. And with 3 other kinds of sugars, where is the need? 11g of sugar in one 3/4 cup serving of cereal is far too much - both for me, and for my children. So, while I really enjoyed the flavor, once this box is gone there will be no repeat purchases.

review/summary: Too sweet, not as nutty as it would seem, but still tasty
review/text: I enjoyed the cereal despite the fact that it felt too sweet, and was not nearly as nutty as I expected, given the name and the picture on the box.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Too sweet, it seems a bit too much, every bite is quite sweet. And though I think most cereals go over the top with sugar, I thought this one might be a little less so. To my surprise it was sweeter than most of the ones I eat.<br />- I love peanuts. The cereal promised lots of nut crunch. It was not to be, it doesn't have that many, and the honey/sweet flavor over powers the nut flavor, so you just get a hint of peanut flavor. It tastes more just like a honey cereal.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- The picture (like every other cereal box cover) is misleading. You get about 20% -at best- of nuts it portrays<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Overall the flavor is good (your mileage may vary), and it is nice and crunchy.<br /><br />1 star off due to the sweetness, and another star off due to it not being/tasting as nutty despite all the advertising pointing that way. You may still enjoy it - I did - but it did not live to the expectations and I am unsure I would buy it again.

review/summary: YUMMY!
review/text: I think this is an older recipe of cereal that I used to love and then it was all of a sudden gone from the shelves.  I was so happy to see it again and my family loves it.  It's cornflakes with a sweet coating and peanut pieces on the flakes.  Not too sweet which I'm happy about and really delicious!

review/summary: Pretty yummy!
review/text: I could smell the nuts right when I opened the box of cereal.  It smelled quite tasty.  The cereal itself is also pretty yummy, not too sweet not to NOT sweet and just nutty enough.  The only thing that would make it better is it it stayed crunchy in the milk longer, but most cereals have this problem.  The flakes are small, just the right size.  I would definitely buy this again!

review/summary: Tasty & sweet, so good!
review/text: I've always liked Kellogg's cereals, so Crunchy Nut was an easy choice for my breakfast needs.<br /><br />First impressions:<br /><br />I could smell the peanuts as I opened the box, so I knew I'd be in for some tasty goodness! I tried a couple of the flakes before the milk was added and it had the same texture and taste as Frosted Flakes. These were a little crunchier because of the peanuts.<br /><br />Taste:<br /><br />Once the milk was added, that's when the taste kicked into overdrive. The milk released the honey drizzle flavor, so each bite was sweet, crunchy, and delicious. Strangely enough, the peanuts felt like more of an aftertaste, even though you can clearly see them on the flakes (see the picture I uploaded in Customer Images).<br /><br />This is one of those cereals you have to eat fast, since the milk saturates the flakes pretty quickly. However, there is a plus - when there's no more flakes to eat and you get to the leftover milk, there's a swirl of honey flavor mixed in to make it extra sweet for your taste buds.<br /><br />Conclusion?<br /><br />This cereal isn't going to meet any daily nutritional requirements (you'd need 4 bowls to get the nutritional value in one bowl of T....umm, another cereal!), but it is definitely a yummy way to start your morning.<br /><br />I think of them as Frosted Flakes for a new millennium.<br />Definitely recommended!

review/summary: I like it, but family LOVES it.
review/text: This cereal is very sweet and very crunchy - almost too crunchy. It reminds me of Bit O' Honey candy in cereal form, and with a peanuty flavor additive. I really like honey and just about all nuts so I was anxious to try this. If you like them too, then you won't be disappointed. I just thought both flavors were a little too intense and it was defintely too crunchy, almost hard. My husband doesn't mind soggy cereal and I questioned if this would get soggy. I watched one morning as he did his normal routine of pouring milk on his cereal and putting the dogs out in the backyard.  He made coffee, situated the newspaper on the table, and let the dogs in.  When he finally started eating, I could hear his lound crunching all the way in the living room.

review/summary: Jamaica Ginger ????
review/text: My Jamaican ginger arrived before time - very prompt delivery. My only complaint is that this did not taste like Jamaican ginger.  The Jamaican ginger that I purchased in NYC several years back had a rich robust flavor and was a little darker in color.  This ginger had a light color and tasted no different than the regular ginger you could purchase in any vitamin store.  Very disappointing.

review/text: Yes the packaging was different than they show on the advertisement but, the flavor was outstanding. I've had several types of pista over the years and this one is fresh and good tasting. Very hard to get Indian Sweets here in the St.Louis area, and this company will get my repeat business! Lightning fast shipping and quality products. I was very pleasantly pleased. The taste was a bit "mild" (IE: Not strongly nut flavored) but yet very good as well, not at all to "mushy" or hard.<br />Warmly,<br />Jackie

review/summary: Excellent flour!
review/text: I've purchased this flour from Amazon in order to make pita bread. It's wonderful!  Atta flour is ground finer than other whole wheat flours and so gives excellent results.  I also use it to make no-knead bread, and the loaves are turning out lovely.<br /><br />Also, I've successfully substituted it for unbleached all-purpose flour in pancakes, and muffins with excellent results. Only difference is that the batter seems to see rise and bubble up when it sits but I just stir back together to smooth it before pouring/scooping into trays, and it bakes and rises beautifully.  I'm still experimenting with it and will try it with cakes next.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />UPDATE: I noticed a little later that the flour was sent to me past its "better if used by" date of December 27, 2009.  My item was shipped to me on January 30, 2010.  Amazon's customer service was wonderful, and I received a prompt full refund from them since they couldn't guarantee that an immediate replacement from the seller would not have the same problem.  Unfortunately, I could not change my positive review of the seller (India Connect) to outline the problem and express my displeasure at being sent a food item past it's "better if used by" date.<br /><br />Of course I realize that flour does not immediately expire, and thankfully I had it stored in the fridge. So, even though we used it when we first got it with no ill effect, it is a matter of principal that I was sold TWENTY POUNDS of flour past its "better if used by" date. That's just wrong. So I wanted to give fair warning to anyone who might want to order this item (Sujata Chakki Atta flour, 320-ounce bag, from India Connect).<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for taking care of this.

review/summary: Wonderful bread!
review/text: I bought this bread elsewhere a while ago, on a chance. I'd recently started playing around with baking breads on a stone, instead of in the bread machine. I'd done the latter for many years, and, while we enjoy the fresh-baked breads, the similarity of their crusts made me try oven baking. (Partly helped by learning that a $2-3 unglazed tile makes a great baking stone without spending big bucks.) This was going to be just for some "cheating", avoiding putting together the necessary ingredients for a more complex bread like this 10-grain one. We were surprised and delighted with the results! Not only did the bread taste great, it consists of all-natural and organic ingredients. I was sorry to see that the store we bought it from didn't have any more when we returned, but had a few other varieties with which we've had similar success. The 10-grain one was still our favorite.

review/summary: Good formula, less spit up
review/text: Our baby girl was a preemie and I was unable to breastfeed.  We started with the Neosure Enfamil and once she could switch to a "normal" formula, we went to Enfamil Gentlease.  Our little girl spit up violently with about three feedings per day, with spit up coming out her nose and spewing from her mouth.  A friend recommended Gerber so I read some reviews and called and talked to their very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  They sent a free sample and once we slowly switched her to the Gerber, her spit up reduced considerably.  She's a much happier baby.<br />Also, I like the packaging of the 23 oz, easy to level the scoop and two ways to store the scoop inside.

review/text: We tried Enfamil, then Similac, then Gerber Good Start Protect for our baby and she seems to like this one the best. However, it does tend to get little clumps when mixing but they go away if you shake it hard and let it sit for 5 minutes before giving to the baby. Also, she gets some gas from time to time but she was a gassy baby from the beginning. Overall, I would say it's working well for us so far!

review/summary: Good with Gerber
review/text: I really like this product. My son spits up much less than he did on either Gentlease or Similac Sensitive.  It also mixes up really easily. The simlilac used to gross me out because of all the particulate matter floating about after stirring.<br /><br />I actually quite like the container. The little blue arc area on the left hand side of the opening is actually an additional holder for the scoop. You just set the scoop itself into and it holds it upright.  It works beautifully and is much easier to use than trying to snap it into the top of the lid.<br /><br />I like the little lip on the edge of the container. It works great for leveling out the scoop to make sure I have the correct amount of formula.  Yes, it does make it harder to get the dregs of the formula out at the end of the day but in this case, Ill take the lip anyday to use for leveling.

review/text: It is likely that each child reacts differently to each formula. Our infant does the best with Good Start.<br /><br />Regarding the new container, we really like the fact that it is square and has a lip. This allows you to scoop and scrape the top of the scooper all in one motion. As for the "circle" in the corner, it holds the scoop!!  I don't know about other people, but I don't like people reaching in the formula with their hands to dig out the scoop.  Nice touch.

review/summary: Love Gerber Good Start Protect
review/text: We switched our baby to Gerber Good Start Protect from Enfamil Newborn when he was experiencing moderate digestive discomfort. He was spitting up quite a bit of formula after every feeding, passing lots of gas, and was just really fussy. Since he's been on Gerber Good Start, his digestive problems have noticeably lessened and he is not as fussy when it comes to eating. As far as the new packaging goes, I love it! I feel it is much more sanitary storing the scoop in the lid. Then you are not contaminating the entire can of formula like it used to be when you had to fish the scoop out of the powder with your fingers. Also, the scoop has a nice wide handle so it is easy to hold onto. When I am down to the last scoop, whatever I have left remaining, which is basically nothing, I just pour into the new canister of formula I am opening next. Not a big deal at all. This formula is more expensive when compared to the other major name brand formulas. Especially since I can buy the other brands at Costco or Sam's Club at a significant discount and they accept the formula checks that the companies send too. However, my son likes it and seems to be doing well on it so to me it is worth the price. FYI- For those that heat up their baby formula, this formula contains probiotics which is compromised when the formula is heated above 100 degrees. So if you heat up your bottles, the benefits of the probiotics are gone. The Gerber Good Start Gentle formula does not have the probiotics if you still would like to use the Good Start brand. I hear great things about that formula as well, though I have not used it myself.

We had such a bad experience with the "Gentle" version of this formula that I was skeptical to try this. But I was very pleasantly surprised by this "Protect" version. No constipation, no throwing up, no spitting the bottle out - just lots of good BMs, happy tummies, and empty bottles.

review/summary: Pleased.
review/text: My husband and I really like the idea the 100% whey protein and corn syrup isn't one of the first ingredients as it is in the other formulas. I also really like the scoop they give. It is more narrow and conducive for dumping into the regular width bottles. My only complaint is that sometimes it doesn't shake up as well as I would like, leaving some clumps. However, we shake it up really well and usually put it in the fridge for the next feeding. After warming it up for the feeding and another quick shake, the clumps are usually gone. The good thing is that the formula doesn't stay bubbly after shaking like the Similac did for us.
