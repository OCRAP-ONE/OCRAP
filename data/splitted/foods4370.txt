review/summary: Delicious and (almost) foolproof to make
review/text: Yes, I know. It seems a bit ridiculous to complain about making Mexican rice - either truly homemade or even the ones in the box. It only takes about 20 minutes. But, usually we're chopping lettuce, shredding cheese, getting everything ready and I forget the rice and it burns. So we bought one of these packets. I admit I was skeptical, but we thought it tasted great. Of course it will taste differently than homemade rice. And no, being a prepared product, it is not going to be the healthiest of choices. But we make most of our meals from scatch so I don't feel guilty about using a prepared product here and there.<br /><br />We've had this rice with tacos, enchiladas, rotel chicken tortilla stack, mexican lasagna, stuffed burritos, and on top of supreme nachos. My only warning is be sure to tear the bag. I was in a hurry one night and put a  bag in and about 40 seconds later, I heard a big BOOM and it had exploded inside the microwave. Sure enough, I'd forgotten to tear the corner open. But for its ease of making, no pots to clean afterwards and how quickly it's ready to eat, I gave it 5-stars.

review/summary: Tea for the Christmas Season
review/text: The Nutcracker Sweet tea is perfect for the holidays; unlike some other "holiday themed" teas that I've tried, this one isn't just a regular unflavored tea with holiday packaging.  Rather, Nutcracker Sweet is a truly holiday tea.  It has hints of cinnamon and nut and while it's hard to describe, it tastes like what you'd expect a Christmas tea to taste like, wrapping up the flavors of the season in a hot tea;  I'd highly recommend it.  Turn on some Christmas music, heat up a cup of this tea and sit by the fireplace or Christmas tree, hard to beat that.

review/summary: Amazing Flavor
review/text: Whoever created this spice blend did an amazing job because it's a cinnamon, vanilla heaven!<br /><br />I don't like to drink caffeinated teas, but this is worth the exception.<br /><br />It tastes great with vanilla soymilk, too.  So decadent.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more!  I bought it during the summer because I got a craving for it (it's good any time of year) and it's especially wonderful during the holidays.<br /><br />I steep it for an hour, then reheat it-- not because the tea is weak-- I just do that with all my teas because I like them super strong.

review/text: This review is from: Celestial Seasonings Nutcracker Sweet, Christmas Black Tea, 20 Count Teabagss (Pack of 6) (Grocery)<br /><br />This tea is delicious either hot or cold. Its aroma is so wonderful and soothing that it would be worth brewing even if you didn't drink it.<br /><br />So many of us want this year-round that I wish Amazon would make it available through Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />If only Celestial Seasonings would ALSO make a decaff version of this tea, I could enjoy it in the evening as well. (I'm super-sensitive to caffeine). But at least this "regular" version is a great start to my day.<br /><br />I agree that you can find this tea at a much better price elsewhere on Amazon.  I don't know why this particular source is so over-priced.<br /><br />Since I sometimes have trouble finding Nutcracker Sweet at a reasonable price, I occasionally "stretch" it by brewing it thus: 1 bag of Nutcracker Sweet + 1 bag of PG Tips + 3 cups of boiling water. The two teas complement each other very nicely.<br /><br />When it's iced, sweetened with Xylitol (which dissolves best while the tea is still warm), and laced with a bit of milk or Half & Half, it satisfies me more than most desserts. I even know some people who add a drop of Irish Cream....

review/text: My favorite winter tea!  I taste cinnamon and vanilla among other flavors in this sweet, rich tea, so perfect for a cozy evening. Problem is, I have been thwarted at buying it locally although the stores carry other Celestial Seasonings teas at $3.50. I have bought Nutcracker Sweet online thru Amazon before for a reasonable price, nowhere near the current $10 or $15, so I intend to conserve my last box and wait.  I can learn to do without it.  I...can...learn....

review/text: Unfortunately, I had to send my Dolce Gusto Machine in for repair (or replacement) so I am currently on hold. Since I used it for "almost two months" before it quit working, I can tell you that I had a chance to try  all the "hot" flavors that Nescafe Dolce Gusto offers and I totally enjoyed each of them. I am not crazy about real strong coffee so the "mild" is perfect for everyday.  Although, on days when I needed a little extra jolt, I would drink the regular strength Caffe Lungo.  I am anxious to get my machine back so I can, once again, enjoy the wonderful variety of coffees and hot chocolate available.

review/summary: Excellent rice cereal with fruit
review/text: Because of mutliple food allergies I seek out simple breakfast cereals with minimal added ingredients.  For a sweetened rice cereal with added fruit, this is an excellent choice. It is low in fat and low in sodium and of course gluten free with 120 calories, 100 mg sodium, and 1 g fiber per 1 cup serving.  The cereal itself has a nice crunchy texture.  I eat mine with Rice Dream rice milk and thoroughly enjoy the dried fruit pieces.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3C6">Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice with Mixed Berries, Gluten Free, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Ingredients:  organic brown rice, organic brown rice syrup, honey, freeze dried blueberries, freeze dried raspberries, freeze dried strawberries, sea salt, natural flavor.<br /><br />I have been purchasing this prodcut from Amazon.com for several years and their packaging and shipping of this product has improved so there is little crushing of the cereal boxes in shipment now (some of my early shipment configurations left the boxes distressed).  Amazon's price is hard to beat and the service is always fast and reliable.

I like chewy berries in my cereal, not extreme dried to the point of crunch/dissolve and they were a touch sour on some and overpowering in taste.  Yuck.  The sweetness was so miniscule I ended up adding more sugar.  Really wasn't for me and just my personal opinion.

When you have to eat gluten free, it's not always easy to find foods that are appealing to the palate. This cereal fits the bill though! I love the 3 varieties of berries & the crispy rice that keeps its crispiness after adding milk. I also appreciate the low calorie, low fat, low everything that I want it to be low in. It doesn't even have sugar! It has honey & brown rice syrup instead. (I have a cane sugar allergy) I will definitely continue to purchase this product because it is so good.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I have sensitive digestion and rice cereals work best for me. I like that this is made from brown rice and doesn't have any "garbage" in it, e.g., high fructose corn syrup. With the dried fruit already in it, I don't need to add anything other than milk - the flavor is very good. Purchasing through the Subscribe and Save program results in a significant savings over the grocery store price. My only complaint is that it's not very filling, so I find myself munching on a protein bar mid-morning.

review/text: Eating Gluten Free can be a challenge, however, this cereal is a great product and it's GF!  It's similar to rice crispies, but has dried fruit in it.  It's great for breakfast and even a light snack.  I am going to try making rice crispy treats with this.  I'm sure it will taste yummy.

review/summary: Not too bad!
review/text: The Crispy Brown Rice Cereal with Mixed Berries isn't too bad!  I would say it is pretty similar to regular (non-gluten free) Rice Krispies in that it gets soggy in milk pretty quickly but, it is pretty yummy as long as you eat it right after you add the milk.  I made "rice krispy treats" with them & they were good.  The berries added a little something extra to it.  Even people who don't need to eat gluten-free said they were good.

review/summary: Delicious, If Not Nutritious
review/text: I love this cereal!  Like others, I've also tried just about every gluten-free cereal out there, and this is quite possibly my favorite.  I love Gorilla Munch but often find it too sweet and coarse, so this is a wonderful counterbalance to that.  The berries add a nice touch, though I do love the plain Crispy Brown Rice as well.<br /><br />My only issue is that, like many gluten-free cereals, Erewhon doesn't seem to have given much thought to fortifying their cereal with the extra nutrients that those of us with celiac disease so desperately need.  However, I admit that I'll gladly take supplements if it means having food that doesn't taste like cardboard, so Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice with Mixed Berries will continue to be a morning staple in my home.<br /><br />Also, as a side note for fellow dairy-intolerant celiac patients, this cereal does very well with soy milk.  It doesn't get soggy and it retains its pleasant crispy crackling sound even as you eat.

review/summary: Tasty but lacking in nutrional value
review/text: Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice with Mixed Berries is a tasty treat of a breakfast cereal. If you like rice crispies, you'll probably like this. The only flaw that I found was that the cereal is lacking in nutritional value. Compare this nutrition label to something like Total Raisin Bran and you'll see what I mean. The other problem I had was that the cereal tends to stick together in clumps in the box so you have to break it up first.<br /><br />If you examine the label you will see that it is mostly empty carbs.  If you require a gluten free diet, I suggest Quinoa flakes with fresh berries on top instead. It has better nutritional value.

review/text: We've made the switch from Sojo's (oat based) to Honest Kitchen. We've got two dogs 40lbs & 61lbs so these 10lb boxes of food don't last too long. Also it doesn't mix the same as the other flavors (chicken, fish, plain), maybe because the beef flavor is almost a powder comparatively. Anyways, the dogs slop it up just the same. We add other vitamins and nutrients in with the mix so they get the broad spectrum. We also add a 1/4 cup of regular kibble (Blue Buffalo) just to make it go a little farther and bigger in their stomach so they're aren't whining for food in a couple hours.<br /><br />We also buy from a local shop because their price is spot on, plus it's good to help the local places.

The food was gobbled up quickly, but unfortunately didn't have much affect on the allergies over time.  We've since switched to another food for the next several months, and will hope to see a change.  But Honest Kitchen is good food, human grade quality (but made for dogs) - and the ratings with most dog food rating companies show this food is very highly rated.

review/summary: Super Slaw really is super
review/text: My mother always made a sweet, milky slaw that was the only coleslaw I ever liked.  One night she stayed up until 2 a.m. trying to recreate the recipe so that I, who can't make anything without a recipe, could make it the same way.  I didn't have the heart to tell her that I had found a mix that tasted just like hers...McCormick's Produce Partners Super Slaw Mix.  The only change I make to the recipe is to add 4-5 T of sugar instead of 1.  Also, I often add an extra bag of coleslaw the next day to any leftovers to make them last longer and to soak up some of the delicious liquid.  I love this stuff and hope it continues to be made forever.  Try it; you'll love it too, I'm sure!

Used non-fat sour cream instead of mayo, used less sugar, added paprika, shredded onion, etc.  Hubby's favorite was using 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 mayo, apple cider vinegar and adding shredded apples to the mix. This is a great basic mix! When I could not get it anymore, I called all over the country & found the distributor and ordered 24 packs.  Now they are all gone and I thought I'd try the internet before resorting to my previous way.

review/text: When shopping for cereal, what are you looking? Do you look for catchy name, pretty picture or bigger box? Don't judge your cereal by the box - start reading labels. You might find that some cereals are loaded with sugar and other stuff you can't pronounce. But how much time are you willing to spend on reading labels in the cereal isle? General Mills made the label reading process easy.  They now have a white check on some cereal boxes. Is it still the same old cereal? Now every cereal with the white check has more whole grain than any other single ingredient with the same great taste. You will see "whole grain" as a part of the first ingredient on the ingredient list, indicating that whole grain is the first and most prevalent ingredient.<br /><br />When it comes to taste, my kids cannot  get enough of it. They obviously love searching for lucky charms in their bowls, and the love the taste. I have no other choice, I have to buy it again<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005G2FCD2">General Mills Lucky Charms Bonus Pack, 46-Ounce</a>

review/text: This was one of my favorite cereals as a child.  Probably should have been a treat to have once in a while rather than breakfast if you consider many of the ingredients that have always been a part of this cereal.  However, since the mid-1990s, our food supply has contained progressively more and more genetically modified foods (unbenounced to the public), and this cereal more than likely contains a fair amount of something that is arguably much harder on our bodies than food colors and preservatives, genetically modified corn.  The U.S. produces and consumes the majority of GMOs worldwide.  Europe banned them from their food supply in 2001.  We do not hear much about them because many of the big U.S. food conglomerates such as General Mills do not source organic or non-gmo ingredients and they sponsor our media, t.v., newspapers and magazines.  Please read about GMOs, the studies that have been done, and the health risks for you and your family.  Here is a great article from Natural News:<br /><br />[...]

I got ripped off.<br /><br />As pointed out by the other reviews of this product, what is pictured in NOT what is being sold. I've never known Amazon to allow this type of shenanigans, much less silently consent to them after more than one customer complained.<br /><br />Yes, I received a completely different product than the one shown and described. This IS NOT Log Cabin syrup. It is a knock-off. The price seemed compelling -- and now I know why. Like the other reviewer wrote, "I should have read the other reviews first."<br /><br />I've become a bit complacent about that, frankly, because I've so completely learned to trust "my Amazon" to vet the products they sell. Heads up, Amazon, your "slip" is showing. I know you always intended to become the "Wal-Mart of the internet" . . . but don't ACTUALLY turn into them, okay?<br /><br />Sign me,<br /><br />A bit disillusioned

review/text: As far as store bought soups go, this stuff is really good.<br /><br />It doesn't have "that flavor" that you get with pretty much all canned soups. You know what I'm talking about. The "meh" flavor.<br /><br />This stuff is actually pretty good.<br /><br />I'll buy it again.

review/summary: OK flavor, weird texture, excellent nutrition
review/text: This soup has a decent flavor, of split peas and potatoes. It is however, a bit too salty for me, but I'm not a fan of salt anyways. The texture is the worst part, and can almost be described as 'gelatinous'. The soup is thickened with a bit too much Potato and corn Starch. I like thick soups, but prefer if it isn't goopy.<br /><br />The best part of this soup is the nutrition. It contains a whopping 14g of protein per box! And only 200 calories (100 per serving)!! Because of this alone, it is my favorite lunch at work, and can last me until dinner without being high in calories. I will continue purchasing this.

Of course, the whole "melt in your mouth, not in your hand" thing, a lie.  But a catchy lie.<br /><br />I like the candies but stopped buying them when my son was a year old because he almost choked on one.  Now that he's 19... well, it's time to return to my favorites!  Ok, I could've returned earlier, I'm pretty sure he knows to chew his food now.  M&Ms are a good old standard for the candy bowl!  Hardly worth buying online, unfortunately, considering the shipping charges, but if you can find free shipping or get a deal on that, go for it.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough
review/text: This tastes just like chocolate chip cookie dough.  I don't know how they do it, but they make the Larabars taste exactly like whatever it is.<br /><br />I don't remember if I read it on their website, or if a customer service rep told me, but they said, concerning the chocolate chip cookie dough Larabar, the the peanut butter chocolate chip Larabar, and the chocolate chip brownie Larabar, that they are vegan, but they aren't allowed to print 'vegan' on these three just in case some cross-mixing from milk or other non-vegan products got on these, or something like that.  Anyway, I had never tried these three (until now) because I was under the impression that they were not vegan, but after I was explained how and why they do not print 'vegan' on these, then I decided to try these three.  I decided they were vegan enough for me.  I guess it depends on the vegan to make that decision whether or not they want to try these three, depending on the possible mix-up or cross-up of certain ingredients.  Anyway, I tried these three flavors, and they were really good.<br /><br />Other than that, these Larabars are like the other flavors of Larabars, in the sense that they are healthy, convenient, soy-free, etc.  I love Larabars.  Highly recommended if you like these type of bars.

review/summary: Best Cat Food Ever
review/text: I bought this food when I first adopted my cat. I strayed from the brand once, and purchased Purina cat food. The difference in my cat was night and day. With Blue, she had a gorgeous coat and the litter box was not scary at all. When she was on Purina for a few weeks, her coat lost its luster and her litter box - well, let's just say it wasn't pretty. We will never buy anything else again. The value of this product is amazing - yes, it's expensive, but your cat will eat less, look better, and be much happier. You will too!

review/summary: Excellent cat food - and NO corn!
review/text: I've been feeding this cat food to my beloved cats for over 3 years now. I only wish I discovered it long before that. If you have a cat that is sensitive to corn, and  corn meal - this is the proper food for your cat. It goes a long way, too. You will find out, that your cat does not spend its entire waking time in the food bowl. My two cats eat about 1/2 cup a day. Not "per cat". Together. They have beautiful fur coats, healthy eyes and lots of energy (for a cat). I know Blue Spa Select is expensive. However, if the cats eat much less of it, it goes much longer way. Overall, I don't think I spend more on cat food now. I spend about the same, or maybe even less than what I was spending buying Purina brand, or for that matter Science Diet (which is mostly corn, anyway).

review/summary: The dog loves it
review/text: I have an 8 month old bull terrier mix, and she goes through everything in about 30 minutes. So far she has spent about 2 hours on it and only the brown color has come off. Kong is usually the only thing that will hold up for about a week. The problem with Kong is that, she is still a puppy, and some of them are too hard and if you are not watching her she will eat the plastic.<br /><br />I first seen these available at the local pet store for about 25 bucks and that was a little pricey since I was not sure if it would hold up. After reading some reviews and searching amazon I settled for this one. The product came exactly as it was described. AND it came a day early!<br /><br />I am not sure how long it will last, but I will say this, I don't think I have ever seen my dog as happy as when she got the antler and started to go to town on it. When I take it away from her she starts to cry as if I took her own leg away from her! If it lasts a month, it is money well spent and I will buy more in the future.<br /><br />Thanks for the great service Jen!

review/summary: good seaweed but somewhat messy to eat
review/text: If you like dried seaweed, you will probably like this.  Food is highly subjective, so I'll limit this review to things that might not be obvious from the item description.  It is slightly sweet (about the same as barbeque potato chips) and has sesame seeds mixed in.  The packages contain shredded seaweed strips which are similar in size to cross-cut shredded paper; this should not be problematic to eat at home but if you want something to snack on while driving, traveling, etc., I would recommend the salty (no sugar) version which comes in 3inx1.5in sheets.

Anyway this delicious salty sweet snack is in little shreds like big sawdust and basically is as inelegant to eat in front of another person as onion soup au gratin on a first date. HOWEVER. I love it. Maybe the best weird vegetarian kind of sweet snack I have ever tried. TONS of packaging, that is kind of non-green but it does keep the product pristine and CRISP. WORTH EVERY CENT.

review/summary: Good Seaweed Snack!
review/text: This seaweed snack is slightly salty and slightly sweet. A very balanced combination of the two. They, being seaweed, are a little bit fishy-tasting, but not any worse than a piece of nori paper on your sushi. The only issue I have with the snack is that the pieces are truly crumbles. They come in a small dish, which keeps them contained, so they aren't too messy. I just grab little pinches of them and put them into my mouth.... sort of like eating popcorn (but smaller). They also look oily, but really aren't. The flavor is good and clean tasting. I will definitely continue purchasing this item.

Seaweed lovers, this snack is sweet and salty and the seaweed "strength" of flavor is not overwhelming. In other words you wont feel like you just licked a dried out sardine.LOL.<br /><br />I eat it right out of the package with a spoon. It's really light and crispy and looks a bit like dried tea leaves. It's coated with seseme oil as well. Sometimes I sprinkle it over a rice dish and add some ginger and raw cashews! Sooooo yummy, ya just GOT to try it!<br /><br />After you eat sea's gift nori you feel satified and very healthy.<br />I went ahead and got an Amazon subscription because I have thyroid issues and this is not only a delicious snack to me, but it is a necessary suppliment.<br /><br />Awsome w/crackers too!

review/text: I liked mixing this shredded seaweed with rice, or just eating plain which can be really messy, that is, until I bit down on something really hard.  It turned out to be a tiny bone or shell of some sort, and now I can't bring myself to eat the other packages because I'm too squeamish!  It is really good though.  I tried the Roasted and Sea Salted flavor and had the entire case devoured in three days...they are addictive, and I can inspect them for foreign objects a lot easier because instead of being shredded like this product, they are made into small sheets.
