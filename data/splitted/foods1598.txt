review/summary: bad beef
review/text: I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.

review/summary: Cheaper at Walmart
review/text: Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.

review/summary: Delicious jerky
review/text: This is probably the best mass-produced beef jerky on the market.  It isn't too tough or dry like cheaper brands, isn't too sweet or spicy either.  Only problem is that as a snack I feel it isn't overly healthy.  (It has MSG, sodium nitrite and a lot of sodium).  However it is a low-fat, high-protein food, and very tasty.

review/summary: Great
review/text: I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car. I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind. I am all for natural products that they enjoy!

review/text: I have had this on order for about a total of 8 bags. I first had a good experience and what seemed like a quality jerky and continued to keep it ordered on my subscribe and save account. The next 2 bags were awful. There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening. I had meant to cancel this subscription but remembered after I was shipped another pack of two. Maybe they'll be better but I haven't been eager to to open them. Roll of the dice, I guess.

review/text: This is my second order of Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack from Amazon due to lower price than other stores and I hit the jackpot.  You can see the pictures I upload for this product.  It has mold all over, which even can be seen from outside the bag.  Unfortunately I did not see it and put one in my mouth.  Few seconds afterward, the taste was so strange and my friend, who was about to eat, stop me from swallowing.  Try for yourself, but please be careful.

review/text: I love this beef jerky and so I looked everywhere for it, and had trouble finding it readily. So when I found this product on subscription on Amazon, I was more than thrilled to subscribe. That was two months ago. I've now cancelled my subscription. Why you ask? The unopened packages of the beef jerky were hard as a rock and were tasteless as a result. I don't know what Amazon does to receive the jerkys so cheap thereby giving the customers the 15% discount, but I'd rather pay more and get them off retail and enjoy every piece.. I am very disappointed at the result and won't re-subscribe again.

review/text: I bought eight packs. Seven of those, I hope, were in good condition. One of them looks darker and has mold on it. I didn't notice that after I ate two pieces... That was disgusting!! It says on the package the jerky will be good until 2013. I guess the company is wrong.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon CS. After 5 minute they decides to give me refund. This is probably all that Amazon can do, but I will not buy any kind of food/snacks on Amazon anymore. And I will not buy any Jack Links product on line or in store. Their quality control is really doubtable.<br /><br />MOLD ON JERKY!! Be aware!

The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.<br /><br />Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use).

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: I buy a lot of stuff online and only write a review if something was very good or very bad.<br /><br />I honestly have to say that Jack Link's Jerky is the best jerky I have ever eaten (I've even bought some from a meat market before).  I have tried several of their flavors and all have been good.  The Sweet & Hot could be a little hotter, IMO, but it is still awesome and my favorite of theirs.  Besides the different flavors being good, what really sets Jack Link's apart from every other jerky I've tried is the quality of the meat itself.  The meat has the perfect amount of moisture, making it able to actually bite a piece in half without having to gnaw on it for 20 minutes.  While other brands aren't very consistent, particularly Pemmican, which I used to think was the best available, Jack Link's is very consistent with the quality of each piece.  Most brands usually have a mix of perfect pieces, dry pieces, and way too thick pieces.  Not Jack Link's, I've yet to get a dry piece, or one that was way too thick.<br /><br />The several people that I have "turned on to" Jack Link's would fully agree with me about this review.  We've actually spoke about how amazed we are with it.<br /><br />Walmart is the place that I first found it, and they are always out of stock of it.  So I turned to Amazon and was able to find it for roughly the same price when you factor in shipping.<br /><br />BTW, the package of ten 1.5 ounce bags is nice if you are like me and tend to just keep eating until it is gone.  :)  Also, each 1.5 ounce bag has about 25 grams of protein.  So if you are on a workout program, it makes a nice way to get extra 25 grams of protein with very little fat into your diet.

review/summary: By Far The Best Jack Links!
review/text: I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.<br /><br />This is the best deal I've found by far, select delivery 1 time a month for 16 bucks and sit back and wait for your jerky!<br /><br />Now on to the flavor, I usually buy the peppered Jack Links for the touch of spice.  Recently I found the A1 steak jerky, and its fantastic!  It seems like its more dry, like the homemade jerky I remember from my grandparents.  I find the most of the flavors to be to moist, and salty.<br /><br />If your a fan of jerky, and the taste of A1 sauce, you will enjoy this product, use amazons subscription option and save another 15%, excellent deal when compared to store purchasing.

review/summary: Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy
review/text: I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.

review/text: I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them.

review/summary: Very Convenient
review/text: Love Jack Links, so I was thrilled to see these easy to grab individually wrapped packages on Amazon with the Subscribe and Save option.  I have a son in college so I have them sent to him. It is pricier than going to a warehouse store and buying in bulk but you are paying for the convenience of the 100 calorie packs.  I have them in my pantry at home also, and my 2 adult daughters use them for their lunches also. I would have given 5 stars if the price was a bit lower.

review/summary: The Best of Jack Links brands in the 'hot factor category'
review/text: The Peppered brand is my favorite of the 'hot' options from Jack Links beef jerky.  It is on the pricey side, but I subscribe to it anyways currently.  I've tried the Jalepeno brand but, it is not as 'hot' as the Peppered brand -but I still make room for both.<br /><br />Again back to the price... it's on the high side.  Which compels me to eventually research more about making my own beef jerky and then make it closer to what I'm looking for - scorching hot!  Something that includes cayenne, habaneros and the like for a taste to remember!

review/summary: If you like Jerky this is the best deal I could find
review/text: I know its not the healthiest snack, but there's nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It's even cheaper if you add it as a "subscription" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!!

This is also the best flavor based on the other ones I have tried.  in their line-up. I have tried several of them, and this is the best. As long as I can keep getting this flavor, I will keep sticking choices. This is the best beef Jerky I have ever had. I have been eatting it for years now, and another positive is that it is made in Wisconsin. My only wish is that you could buy this stuff in better quanitity discounts. The small bags are nice for day trips, but it would nice to be able to buy in larger bags for additional discounts.

Some of the slices are a bit thin and tough, so personally I like the peppered jerky that is sold at Aldi's grocery stores, but if you don't have an Aldi's in your area, Jack Link's makes a good product, with a nice jerky/peppery taste. Yum.

review/summary: Wish They Were in China
review/text: I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same. Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes.

review/text: The wonderful flavor of Jalapeno's in this zip locked bag fills the air once it is opened. I originally purchased this package of Jack Link for snacking but found myself munching until the entire bag is empty. I first across them on store shelfs in Toledo, Ohio and have not been able to find them in any stores in the Fort Worth,Texas area (until my only other source amazon.com). I love the flavor of the Jalapeno and it is spiced just right. Jack Link is great but Carne Seca is one of the best.

Some of them are pretty good (especially Golden Valley products) but overall none are better than Jack Links. Reliably you get tender, tasty and fresh jerky. I like their original flavor the best. It's not too salty, too sweet, or too hard. It's 'just right' in my opinion.

This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.

review/summary: Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH
review/text: I'm normally rather "meh" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.

review/summary: Great summer beverage!
review/text: This pina colada is the first Lt. Blender's product that I've tried, but it won't be the last!  I love the concept of the freezable pouch.  In the past, there have been times where I have wanted a frozen drink but did not feel like going through the process of shaving ice, cleaning out the blender, etc.  Now this is no longer an issue.  I can freeze it in advance and take it to parties, or I can keep the whole pouch for myself and have a drink ready anytime I want.  Not to mention that the results are always consistent, unlike blender versions where your results may vary unless you measure every time.<br /><br />These drinks are best consumed soon after freezing.  I left my pouch in the freezer, and it was nice and slushy the first day, but on the 2nd day it was considerably more solid.  This was easily remedied by running warm water on the outside of the bag for a couple of minutes.  But don't try to manually break up the frozen product, as I initially tried to do.  I ended up making a tiny hole near the top of the pouch.<br /><br />Note: I did use 2 cups of rum rather than the 1.5 cups that was suggested.  I also used coconut rum and added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice to my bag (substitute for some water, not added to the water).  The end result tasted as good as a drink made from fresh pineapple and real cream.  It was very tasty and I look forward to trying some of the other flavors.  I'm glad Amazon has them in stock with free shipping.  This is the best price I have found online.

review/summary: Pina Colada In A Bag
review/text: If you like Pina Colada's, you'll love this product. I found it by mistake and have been using it ever since. You add rum (I use Malibu for the coconut flavor) to the rum line. Then add water to the water line, shake and freeze. I make about 2 or 3 bags in advance and leave them in the freezer. When guests come over it takes about an hour or two and the drinks are ready. I only wish I could buy this product locally.

review/summary: Great to cook with!
review/text: Went to Sam's Club and they had a taste testing of this and 5 other flovors. I bought a few bags and began experimenting in the kitchen. The Pina Colada Mix makes awesome tasting coconut shrimp!<br /><br />I just roll the shrimp around in a mixture of almond flour and pina colada powder after coating it with raw egg. Then I pan fry in coconut oil. SOOOOO GOOD!!!<br /><br />Another yummy version is steamed shrimp and a pina colada dipping sauce that I make with the mix, coconut and water (you can add a splash of pinapple juice in it too).<br /><br />I also plan on soaking the shrimp in coconut rum and then frying it Pina colada batter!<br /><br />Try it with chicken also! The Sangria version is fun to experiment with too!<br /><br />NOTE: I also agree with others that drink this beverage, virgin or alcohol, and say, "this is just as good as you can get anywhere"!

review/summary: This stuff is great!
review/text: I was having a cookout for about 25 family and friends and was looking for something that was easy to fix and that I could possibly make ahead of time, since most of the people who were coming for our party enjoy pina coladas I decided to try these mixes after reading the reviews. The order was not scheduled to arrive until the day before the party but I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived two days ahead of schedule.  I purchased some coconut rum (two large bottles) and some pineapple juice ( two large cans ) after reading one of the other reviewers comments.  The first bag I made I went exactly by the instructions on the bag ( 13 oz. of rum )and when it came time for the water I substituted half of the water with pineapple juice. I taste tested this first batch and boy was it yummy!, but I did feel that I could be more daring with the rum without going overboard.  On the next bag ( I did four bags altogether ) I used 16 oz. of rum and continued to use the same half water and half pineapple juice mix for the rest of the bag.  This was,for me, the right amount of alcohol, not overboard but it definately had a nice little kick. I made the third bag the same way.  The last bag I made virgin style since we have family and friends who would rather not drink but still enjoy the taste of a pina colada.  On the virgin batch I used more pineapple juice instead of the half and half substitution since I thought the people drinking it would enjoy the fruity taste. When all was said and done I had only used one large bottle of coconut rum ( there was still some left in the bottle ) for the three bags that had alcohol and all of the two cans of pineapple juice on the total four bags.  I and some friends who came early to help me set everything up for the party decided to taste test the mix before everyone else arrived. The taste was so much more than I expected.  It was creamy with a very coconutty ( Is that a word? ) flavor and tasted as good as anything I had ever gotten out at a restaurant or bar. My four bags were the hit of the party and everyone complimented me on the great taste.  ( Just a note, I got those little cocktail swords and some fresh pineapple and used those to garnish the cups) I will definately be ordering more of these mixes next time I have a party.

Though most delicious spirited drinks are, this mix is just exceptionally loaded. (At least 500 calories, most likely more, per glass.) Watch out if you are watching your weight.<br /><br />You can mix to taste, and it stores in the freezer well. Enjoy but know each drink requires an hour on the treadmill.... I will stick to a crisp, summer glass of wine.

review/summary: Best Margarita Mix
review/text: I found this product in a grocery store approximately 3 years ago.  It is the best mix that I have found and everyone that trys my margarita says it is the best one they have ever tasted and wants the 'recipe'. I like the fact that even though it is a powder mix, it is all-natural. I travel to the beach quite a bit and have found that is easy to cart in a cooler (no glass) and just pour over ice.  It is also good blended with strawberries or mango puree.  When I make mine, I follow the instructions including using Triple Sec but I usually mix 2 or 3 tequilas (white and gold)and add a little Gran Marnier or Cuantro.  It is great to have it mixed up, ready to go in the refrigerator.  You can also freeze it in the bag and 'squeeze' out for a fast slushy drink.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I was at Samsclub recently and bought a mixed 3 pack of the Strawberry daiquiri and 2 margaritas. This is the best invention ever. I am delighted to have found it on Amazon.com. For gift ideas or a party pack, please, please consider making 3 packs mix of different flavors like pina colada, margaritas, and either the daiquiri or mojito, it would be amazing. I will definitely will be purchasing different packs to mix for gifts as well as keep it on hand for parties. Another great idea would also be to make a gift version that would include the sugar/salt mix to rim the glasses for margaritas.<br /><br />I would also like to add that I loved that the water and booze portions are perfect. I followed the directions to a T. We froze ours and even after using it had some left and kept it in the freezer. A perfect frozen margarita even after being kept 2 days in the freezer and taken out several times. On top of that it never got watery, like the ones you order at a restaurant. I still can't get over how amazing this product is. Keep up the good work!

I hate the sickening-sweet flavor of other margarita mixes, way too much sweetener.  I plan to order more of these pouches and give some away as gifts!  I'm so glad Amazon carried this and other Lt.

This is a very tasty product, very well done, easy to mix and freeze and serve. Now that I have found it on Amazon I have been exposed to all the other products made under the Lt.

For best results use good products (BYOB, there is no alcohol in these, just great mixers), then be careful, because they are so good it would be easy to overdo. I recommend sharing with your friends, or people you want to get friendly with. Plan ahead if you want frozen drinks, it can take six to eight hours to freeze, well worth the wait.

review/summary: Pretty Good Margarita, some drawbacks
review/text: First off, I love the taste and texture of the ultimate product of this mix.  I also appreciated the novelty of the bag concept and had no problems with the instructions.  That being said, I'm going to stick with a blender and liquid mix for most situations.  The bag concept would be great for picnics (beach or no) provided you had exactly six hours to leave it in the freezer before you left.  Otherwise the stuff is a huge pain to get out of the bag in a fashion even vaguely resembling an actual margarita.  Left in the freezer longer than the allotted time and and the stuff freezes into a pretty solid block.  I also thought the proportions listed on the bag to be a little off, my personal preference has you adding a little more tequila and the triplesec is definitely a required component (not optional, as the bag puts it).<br /><br />It's a product worth trying once, in any event.

review/text: I love Chicago style popcorn (that perfect balance of cheese and caramel) and go to great lengths to get "the good stuff".  It is hard to get the perfect Chicago style but I am so pleased to have found KuKuRuZa and love the fact that Amazon will drop it off right at my doorstep!<br /><br />Finding a high quality Chicago style corn has always been a bit of a challenge.  The holiday season always brings the obligatory bucket of three flavors but the popcorn is not fresh and doesn't make my taste buds dance..  Occasionally I order from the other website (starts with a G) but it is so expensive it is hard to justify more than once a year.  Even less often I will trek out of my way to the mall and get a bag mixed up but it is a pain to fight the crowds.<br /><br />This popcorn was amazing!  The cheese was nice and cheesy and the caramel was light and crispy.  There was a 50/50 ratio which is typical but I like my popcorn a little saltier and tend to like 2 parts cheese to 1 part caramel but the kid and the husband picked up the slack and helped to finish the caramel that I left behind.  I will definitely order this popcorn again!  Perhaps next time I will add in an extra bag of cheddar and create my own mix.

review/text: This popcorn is delicious.  The combination of cheddar popcorn and carmel popcorn is a taste sensation.  A movie night with this popcorn is one to remember.

review/summary: left oil in the grinder
review/text: I bought this as a gift for my dad who loves irish cream coffee but doesn't want to use the flavored creamer (he's diabetic).  He told me he liked the flavor but it left a horrible oily ring in his grinder and when he added fresh cream to the coffee it made the cream curdle.  He said when he uses non dairy powder creamer he doesn't have that problem.  He said he wouldn't buy it again because of the oil and the curdling of cream in the coffee but he did like the flavor...it has just the right amount of irish cream flavor for his liking.
