review/summary: Starbucks goodies for a much better price
review/text: I spend way too much money at Starbucks.  I'm practically their biggest fan, and they certainly get a nice chunk of my paycheck each month.  So I was ecstatic when I saw that Tazo had released the chai latte concentrate for regular consumers to purchase.  I've been getting my packs at Target for $4 regular, $2-3 on sale, but I may need to buy in bulk here on Amazon.<br /><br />I love that Tazo offers an organic version of this concentrate since that certainly isn't an option at Starbucks.  I can't tell a difference between this product and what is served at Starbucks, but I order my chai latte with no water, so it may need to be watered down a little if you like your chai a little less spicy.  I'm also a little heavy handed on the mix versus milk, but that's something else that this product lets you control rather easily.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the box says the concentrate only lasts a couple of days in the refrigerator after opening.  I'm not always going to have a chai latte in the morning, so I have to carefully plan when I'm going to open one to avoid waste.

review/summary: A Wonderful Tea, but a Better Store Buy
review/text: I gave this tea five stars for the tea itself--the price listed here, however, is another matter.  But, for the tea itself, here's what I have to say:  I am not particularly handy when it comes to anything kitchen-ey so making my own lattes is out of the question, but I have the Mr. Coffe Cafe Latte machine which has a 'heat and foam' setting that is perfect for making chai lattes.  I bought it for this purpose, actually, since I don't drink caffe lattes.  Anyhoo, when experimenting with teas to try and make an economical cup that rivals Starbucks, I first tried the regular Tazo Chai.  The flavor just didn't seem as full as with this Tazo Organic Chai, however, and I think this is the closest you're going to get to a Starbucks Chai Latte at home.  The only downside to this PARTICULAR version of the Tazo Organic Chai that comes in a pack of 6 is that, at least in all the stores around me including Tom Thumb, Whole Foods, and Starbucks itself, the Tazo Organic Chai Concentrate is less than $5.00 a package.  At the price it is listed for here, you'd be better off getting in your car and making a run for the store since the price, divided by 6, comes out to almost seven bucks a box.

review/summary: Not that good
review/text: I really love chai tea and after going to different places and trying a lot of different kinds, this one just does not hold up with the rest. Yes, it's easy and quick to make, but the flavor of the spices just is not there. If you want a subtle version of what a real chai tea is, then this is a great choice.

review/text: Tazo tea and Stash teas are my favorite but this is the best chai blend out there. It's smooth and creamy and I'm so addicted to it hot, iced, mornings, evenings. Amazon is the best because the first time I purchased the 6 pack, one box was damaged and had leaked all over everything (including the shipping box). I emailed customer service and they credited my account for the damaged box. I'm not sure I'll buy bulk chai from anywhere else now!

review/summary: Great deal, but a little fragile
review/text: These are the best price hooves I've seen, so I would buy them again. They came well packaged in a zipper bag so you can keep them well stored, and they are large in size and nice quality overall. However, they are the thinnest hooves I've bought over the years, so they are destroyed more quickly than thicker hooves. I can hear my 40lb dog breaking the sides in the first few bites, but it still takes hours and sometime days for her to chew a hoof down to the half-dollar sized piece that I throw out to prevent her from swallowing it. I prefer the thicker ones that take more time to chew. There is another seller on Amazon who offers thicker walled hooves, so I would consider buying those next time instead. Still, these are very good, and I would recommend them and will not hesitate to buy them again.

review/summary: Decent, but not a replacement for Starburst Twizzlers
review/text: Some of you may remember the Starburst Twizzlers that were sold years ago, but were discontinued. They don't sound like much, being the typical candy brand-merge product, but trust me, they were. I remembered the absolutely incredible taste of them (one of the, if not the best-tasting candies ever made...each twist was bursting with flavor) but not the name, so I got some Rainbow Twists hoping that they were the same.<br /><br />They're not. These twists come nowhere close to tasting as good as the Starburst Twizzlers did, although they do grow on you some. I thought all of the flavors tasted interesting ("waxy" would be a good description), although not everyone will enjoy them.<br /><br />Bottom line: these are ok. I personally liked them, but they are definitely not suited for everyone's taste. Why oh why did they discontinue Starburst Twizzlers?

The consistency is nothing like normal Twizzlers which tend to be firm - these are on the mushy side.<br /><br />If you're going to be bad and eat junk food like this at least it should taste good.

review/text: We really enjoyed this cereal. It is hard to find any cereal that is not overloaded with sugar, let alone one that is gluten-free. This cereal meets both needs. It is sweetened only with fruit juice and has a crunch that lasts. Additionally, the price is great!<br /><br />The only reason I don't give it five stars is because it is a little plain. That can be nice, if you like to add things like fresh or dried fruit, or if you like to use it in baking. But, if you're in a hurry or don't want to mess with "doctoring it up", it is not really flavorful. I didn't mind it, but I could see how others would find it too plain.

review/summary: Very good - nice variety, too (with one significant negative though)
review/text: I reserve 5-star ratings for the best of the best, so a 4-star rating on this product is still way up there.  It's good, different, and certainly a nice change of pace for someone "stuck" with a gluten-free diet.  I don't quite "get" the comparison to Grape Nuts that another reviewer made.  I used to love Grape Nuts too - in my BC days ("Before Celiac").  But this just doesn't seem all that similar to me other than it's about the same size and initially hard.  I don't find a similarity in taste at all.  Still, the taste is very good, and with it soaking up your milk (or whatever else you put on cereal) for a few minutes, it "sogs" up nicely if you don't like crunchy.<br /><br />The one negative for me was that it came in a clear plastic bag with NO label.  I honestly thought foods sold to the public had to have labels showing content, expiration date, etc.  There was no such thing with this - it was just in a plastic bulk bag.  It wasn't even sealed - just tied shut at the top (that's becoming a very uncomfortable safety item with food).  I'm going to leave the product rating at 4 stars, but base that on the food itself - it's quite good.  Just be aware you won't be getting a "pretty" box with nutrition label and ingredients on it.  (Is that even legal these days?)

review/summary: Perky's Crunchy Rice Cereal
review/text: This is my favorite gluten-free cereal. It used to be called "nutty rice" and now it is "crunchy rice" but it's the same thing. I have eaten it for over two years and I really appreciate being able to buy in bulk. It's also great to have it arrive at the door and with free shipping as well.

review/text: Perky's nutty, crunch cereal is quite good and not sweet. Great for gluten free diets. Add some fruit for kids. It blends well with puffed rice, corn flakes and other gluten-free options available through Amazon.<br />Stays crunchy in milk and definitely feels like eating nuts but is nut free. Quite an interesting cereal.

review/text: I first tried Perky's Nutty Rice looking for an alternative for Grape Nuts, my old favorite, which contains yeast.  It has become my new favorite cold cereal, and I like it even more. I like adding fresh fruit for the nutrition, as well as the flavor.  It's also great with nuts, dried fruit, and/or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NGRRV6">Nutiva - Organic Hemp Seeds 10oz</a>.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Like everyone already said it is good stuff. No doubt about it. Stays crunchy. Great for a snack, cereal, pie crust, or any other kind of crust, or breading for baked chicken. So very versatile.<br /><br />Price wise it comes out to $3.378 per 16oz. If you kind find a box of cereal in the 16oz size, then you could compare the price. However usually cereal boxes come in 11-14 oz. So taking that into consideration it is a good price. Not great but good, because when cereal like gluten free chex goes on sale then the price for chex is better. (if you are price conscious).<br /><br />But you got to look at the ingredients too. And choose what you are looking for in a food item.

review/summary: Taste like candy not fruit
review/text: I was very disappointed with these fruit rolls. I am a big fan of the Mariani fruit rolls (also available on Amazon), but thought I'd give these a try for variety. They are no where near as good as the Marianis. They don't taste like raspberry at all. Its just a sickeningly sweet candy flavor (and I normally LOVE candy!). The consistency is very tough and plastic-y, making them hard to chew. I strongly recommend buying the Mariani fruit rolls instead of these. The Marianis are even cheaper!

review/text: I had previously found the flavor of jasmine teas disappointing.  This tea, however, was delightful.  The scent of jasmine flowers was intoxicating, and the flavor was light and fruity.  I discovered it recently in a great Asian restaurant while on vacation and kept the envelope the tea bag came in, determined to find it.  I will be keeping it in stock in my kitchen and in my office at work.  Great for lunch, afternoon tea, or in the evening while reviewing the events of the day.  Highly recommended!

review/text: I have fond memories of growing alfalfa sprouts as a kid. I had no idea that you even could sprout all these until recently. I eat pretty healthy -lots of organic and natural foods. A friend showed me this kit and I bought it right away! I've already sprouted the bean salad mix, alfalfa and peas. So far I love it. It is fun and easy to grow them and the best part is eating them! I think the alfalfa tastes better than store bought by far! It is organic and no worries of something "icky" being on them like in the store. I also got this kit quickly and well packed. Everything is labeled and in resealable bags. Very happy! Whenever I finally eat all these I'll be back for more.

review/text: Hot? No. Getting into a black car in Southern California in the middle of summer is hot. A Starbucks Venti Latte is hot. A steam sauna is hot.<br /><br />This is a hospital trip short of simultaneously gargling with lye while grilling your lips on a cast-iron Weber barbeque. A full twenty minutes after I had taken less than 1/4" of a pretzel stick coated in this satanic baby batter, my tongue was searing with a rabid and vicious intensity. The cup of hot drip coffee in my hand? Tried to put out the burn with it. Couldn't even FEEL the coffee touch my tongue.<br /><br />A light smoky flavor? Are you kidding me? I couldn't taste anything for over an hour. If the sauce has any measurable flavor it is instantly destroyed by the brain-melting heat. There is no reason to ever buy this. Ever. What could you possibly do with it? Put a drop in a five-gallon pot of chili? Four pounds of taco meat? Seriously.<br /><br />I could imagine doctors prescribing this as the herbal equivalent of Plan B. It would kill any disease, parasite, or unwanted fetus it came in contact with.<br /><br />But yeah, it was pretty good.

review/summary: Hot..Insanely Hot.
review/text: I would say the flavor is at first reminiscent of steak sauce..that's what it reminded me of anyway. So the flavor of this sauce could be better. But the heat from the Jolokia peppers really shines through. Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce honestly brings the heat and the pain so i would recommend it be used sparingly. The heat from just a taste of this sauce actually builds up and becomes hotter than the initial burn so prepare for it, but if you like it hot like me then i certainly recommend buying a bottle.

review/text: I love this sauce!  I have quite a collection of hot sauces including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DIX2M">Blair's After Death</a>, Dave's Insanity, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033P2RN2">Satan's Blood</a>.  This sauce is by far my favorite for every-day use.  It has excellent flavor and plenty of heat.  Blair's After Death is a close second, but it is not as hot and sometimes adds too much flavor for the same amount of heat.  This sauce is hot enough to really brighten up a dish without adding overwhelming flavor, but the flavor that it does add is very yummy, subtle, and complex.  It is very economical since a few drops tends to be enough for a burrito (even for a 'pepper head').  If you think that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS">Tabasco</a> just tastes like flavored vinegar, you enjoy food that 'bites back' and causes some pain, and you love complex and subtle flavors and aromas, then you should definitely try this sauce.

review/text: I got addicted to heat several years ago and started my extreme heat loving with Mad Dog 357 (350,000 scoville units). That sauce was super hot! Then went to the silver edition (750,000 scoville units). Woah! This ghost pepper sauce is not near as hot as those unless you add a little more. You can get the same heat from this non-extract as you can the extract! It is a really awesome hot sauce! It is much more practical in every day spicing up of foods since it doesn't have to be cut with something.<br /><br />This is a fantastic hot sauce!

review/summary: Great Taste for a Great Burn
review/text: This sauce really does pack a punch. I always considered myself to have a high heat tolerance, but this stuff really puts it to the test! The primary culprit is obviously the Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper), but Ashley Foods added some Habanero and Peri Peri peppers for good measure.<br /><br />This also contains evaporated cane juice which adds a sweetness that is almost fruity or reminiscent of BBQ sauce. Combine all this with the garlic, vinegar, and other spices and you have an exceptional combination that briefly offers you a wonderful taste, and then it steals your soul with a raging inferno of hellfire.<br /><br />If you're looking for something really hot that actually has good flavor as well, then this is the best bet for your money. You could always go with something like pure capsaicin, but you'd be missing out on good flavor.<br /><br />The price might seem steep for a 5 fl ounces, but you likely won't be going through this bottle as quickly as you would some tabasco sauce.

review/text: Mad Dog .357 is the big dog of jolokia sauces. Like Dave's, this is an extract sauce, and also like Dave's, it's really hotter than it needs to be. It has a much better flavor than Dave's--no big trick--with more smoky notes. The thickness is similar to old school Heinz ketchup, but good things come to those who wait. If you want a really, really hot sauce that's going to burn your lips, your mouth, and everything afterwards, it hits the spot. If you're looking for something good to lightly perk up your food or give you a little sweat, try something else. If you want your food to fight back, this is a pretty good bet.

review/summary: One of my favorite hot sauces
review/text: My friend got me two bottles of this for Christmas, from my wishlist.  I honestly expected this to possibly be too hot for even myself to do much more than use a couple of drops to heat up a pot of chili.  As it turns out, I do not find this that insanely hot -- not nearly as hot as the reviews make it sound. Am I that hardcore?<br /><br />This is a very delicious hot sauce with a sweet almost bbq like flavor. It's amazing on burgers, chicken, mixed with ketcup or bbq sauce, mixed with taco/burrito seasoning to spice it up a bit or added to a pot of chili.  Generally, I would not recommend this sauce with rice, as it has a fairly strong and sweet flavor, but it is very good on meat in general.<br /><br />I already have used most of one bottle, and I will definitely be keeping this in stock.

review/summary: Ok sauce, Bad taste
review/text: Well, The sauce is not the hottest thing in the world, but it is fairly hot. However the taste is garbage, it IS reminiscent of BBQ sauce, however the rest tastes like veggie oil.<br /><br />Overall a pretty damn good sauce, but if your looking for a hot sauce with a good flavor try Daves insanity or Blairs ultra death 20/20.

review/summary: Incredibly delicious tea
review/text: This tea is unlike any other I have ever tasted. It is incredibly rich with flavors of orange, cinnamon, clove, and an almost honey like sweetness. Amazingly there is no sugar, the flavor is all from the natural oils of the ingredients used. The natural oil content is so high the bags are actually somewhat damp with it, and you will literally get the taste on your fingers picking up a bag to drop in a cup or mug.<br /><br />Thankfully the bags come sealed in a foil bag. You will want to put this bag in an airtight glass container, such as a Pyrex dish, and store it in the fridge to prolong the shelf life of these volatile oils to really get your money's worth.<br /><br />You may wish to check out this listing as well as the price is currently better and Prime eligible: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029KOVO">MarketSpice Teabags, box of 24 (Market Spice Tea)</a>

review/summary: Malty Breakfast.
review/text: Given that it was a Scotsman -- a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale -- who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea" (and given that Drysdale's creation would soon come to be (mis)appropriated by tea houses south of the border, who proceeded to add the word "English" to its name), it seems only fitting that the Scots should have their own version of breakfast tea, too, after all. Even stronger than the already potent English Breakfast blend, this particular one is made to match not only the traditionally heavy English but even the Scottish breakfast, which like the English variety includes pork, sausages and eggs, but is amplified by that so distinctly Caledonian culinary creation: haggis (to most of the rest of the world, a classic case of "acquired taste" at best). A blend of primarily Indian teas, Scottish Breakfast contains a particularly high percentage of Assam, which with its malty flavor ideally complements the soft Scottish mountain waters ... as well as Scotland's famous single malt whiskies, the "water of life" ("uisgue beatha") likewise coming from the areas where those same mountain waters are flowing.<br /><br />Due to its strength, Scottish Breakfast tea maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. As an everyday "work horse" and early morning pick-me-up it is easily as good as (if not better than) its more famous sibling from south of the border, or any kind of coffee. Enjoy!

review/summary: It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This....
review/text: I would never have known about these killer chocolatey treats if my mother hadn't bought a whole crate of them in a fit of nostalgia a couple months back (they were her favorites when she was a kid in the '60s).  After trying one, my world was forever changed.  The ingenius combination of chocolate, marshmallow fluff, and just a little shaved coconut seems simple enough, but only Boyer's Mallo Cups taste anything like this...earth-shatteringly good.  My initial pleasant shock led me to explore more obscure candy that isn't widely availible in my region.  I'll never again restrict myself to the much better known but markedly lower in quality candy behemoths who dwarf the Boyers, Pearsons, Neccos, Atkinsons, and Annabelles of the world.

review/text: What  can I say? I don't have the foggiest. I bought Mallo Cups for my wife. She ate these when she was a teen and she hadn't seen them in stores for many years and since we live in Vegas things that melt very easily are usually not sold in the local stores. Using my computer I found a source now that they are back in production and ordered a couple of boxes. I had to do it during the colder months and they survived shipment very well. Once they arrived they were kept in the refridgerator because that is the only way to keep from melting big time during our 110+ summer days. Needless to say I had one happy wife because now she could have her favorite candy whenever she wanted.<br /><br />If she is happy so am I, so on that basis I give them a 5 star rating.

review/summary: Best packaged candy ever made.
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer in that the large candy companies just can't compete when it comes to one thing: quality.  How would they?  They're in the business of mass production.  That's why this small-town, small-batch-made candy is the best you'll ever taste out of a package.  It makes the other candy companies pale in comparison.  Being from Ohio, I also grew up on Mallo cups but found it hard to find in DC/Northern Virginia, though it's at some Mom and Pop convenient marts in the country.  Still, now that I can purchase online, I plan to dole it out to friends and family to get them hooked and then tell them how to order themselves so that this company never goes out of business.  At least not if I can help it.  You won't regret trying this product if you never have.
