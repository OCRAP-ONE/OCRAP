review/text: I cannot eat this - it has glycerin in it.  All these good qualities it claims it has  - these are not any good when it has glycerin in it.  A little bad ruins the whole bag of what would have been good.<br /><br />And the bag claims to be "clusters".  It is really crumbly - I see no clusters.<br /><br />A waste.  I will try to find somebody who will want to eat this.

review/summary: Taste great but made my stomach hurt
review/text: First of all I want to start by saying that the Vanilla Blueberry flavor is very good! I love that it has the omega's, fiber, and protein and can be eaten as a snack without milk and makes for a great healthy meal with milk. I really did love the flavor and tried the product several times but I did have stomache pains afterwards every time I ate it no matter how much or little I had. Maybe there is something in it that only my body can not tolerate. Such a shame too since I love granola of any kind and this one in particular seems very healhy for you. Wish I could keep eating it.

review/summary: Tasty and Crunchy
review/text: I tried two varieties, the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters and the Cinnamon Oat Clusters, both with Flax Seeds.<br /><br />The package, which weighs 11 oz., advises that you can eat the product as a snack on the go, sprinkled over yogurt, or in a bowl with milk.  The serving size is one third of a cup.  The vanilla blueberry variety contains 120 calories, and the cinnamon variety has 130 calories, with 30 calories coming from fat.<br /><br />The package also advertises that there are 5 grams of fiber, and 750mg. Omega-3 in each serving.  The clusters contain 100 per cent whole grains, including amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat.  The product is low glycemic, without refined sugars, non GMO, and contains no saturated fat, or trans fat, is cholesterol free and very low sodium.<br /><br />The clusters are gluten free.  The back of the package notes that the product contains soy, and is made in a facility that uses peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds.<br /><br />The clusters vary in size from one grain of one of the ingredients to clumps three quarters of an inch in diameter..  They aren't hard to break apart, so this isn't really a problem, except maybe if you are trying to sprinkle them from the package onto yogurt.  You might want to pre-crumble the larger pieces before trying this.<br /><br />Eating them on yogurt was my preferred use for the vanilla blueberry clusters.  There was something about the flavor of this variety that I didn't immediately like, eaten out of hand.  I can't explain what it was, maybe too sweet?  I have to say, though, that although this was my initial reaction, the flavor sort of grew on me later.  Mixing the clusters in blueberry or other fruit-flavored yogurt masked whatever it was I didn't like and added a nice crunch.<br /><br />Eating the clusters over yogurt wasn't my favorite use of the cinnamon flavor.  This is just personal preference, because I don't want a cinnamon flavor added to my fruit-flavored yogurt.  If you think you would like this flavor combination, or if you eat vanilla or plain yogurt, then eating these with yogurt might work for you.  Like the vanilla variety, these would add a nice crunch to balance the smoothness of the yogurt.<br /><br />I liked eating the cinnamon clusters out of hand more so than the vanilla blueberry flavor.  Again, personal preference.  I  sprinkled both varieties (separately) over Special K cereal in a bowl with milk.  They added flavor,  but at 130 calories per one-third cup serving for cinnamon, and 120 calories per one-third cup for the vanilla, it would be easy to go overboard on calories if you ate these alone for breakfast.<br /><br />All in all, I liked this product.  It was tasty and crunchy.  Although maintaining a "healthy weight" is mentioned on the package, they are not especially low calorie, so portion size has to be watched.  If I see them in the grocery store, I will very likely buy them.

review/summary: Good snacking!
review/text: I was excited to receive this item because I eat healthy and I love blueberries. I have to say this bag didn't last long. I opened it up just to try it at first, snack for awhile while watching TV. Half a bag later I had to make myself put it away. The next day I tried it on top of vanilla yogurt with a little honey and it was great. If you're looking for a good versatile, healthy snack, give it a try. My only complaints--which other reviewers have also noted--is that there aren't enough blueberries, and the clusters aren't quite as large as pictured (which is probably the old "settling during shipping" issue). All in all, I really enjoyed it and will try it again.

review/text: I enjoy healthy snacks; Larabars, Kind products, and such, I consume them all. While browsing, I stumbled upon this and I ordered it thinking, "well, I will give it a try." I was thoroughly pleased. Now, before I go too overboard with praise, after trying the product, I do wish that it was a little bit more clustered together, but other than that, it's great. I highly recommend this product; it is very filling, similar to eating trail mix, but with a different texture. Order some!

review/summary: WOW! This granola is awesome!
review/text: I have been on a granola kick recently and have gone through about 5 different brands of granola and about twice as many flavors. This granola is my favorite out of all the different kinds I have tried.<br /><br />The texture is really great! Those dried blueberries and nice and chewy and also give it an amazing taste, while the grain and oats are super crispy and crunchy. This stuff almost seems like a lot of work to chew, because it has so much crunch and chewiness, which is exactly why I love it so much! If you are watching your weight or calorie intake, eating foods that take more work to chew are great because they actually make you feel more full and you spend more time eating a smaller amount.<br /><br />The flavor is delicious, you can taste the different grains and the berries, with a hint of vanilla and just the perfect amount of sweetness.<br /><br />The calories in this granola compared to other kinds is really low, but it tastes better than other granolas!<br /><br />Great stuff, I will be ordering more soon.

review/summary: Good Tasting, Crunchy Granola
review/text: I've been on a granola with greek yogurt kick lately and as a Celiac, I have been trying all the GF granolas I can find. So far my favorite has been the buckwheat & millet granola by Emco that I found at Grocery Outlet one time but I can't seem to find out where to purchase it. My second favorite so far has been the Kind Vanilla Blueberry flavored granola. It is crunchy, which is a must for me. It has some clusters but not many. It has a good flavor and doesn't taste burnt like the Bakery on Main Fiber Power Cinnamon and Raisin Granola I tried. Overall, this is good granola as the flavor is good and the texture is right. It is also a healthier granola. There are two reasons why this granola is only 4 stars instead of 5: 1) Price - I can really only afford to be spending $3.50/12 oz bag for granola, times are hard and gluten free food in general is not cheap; 2) Clusters - there just aren't enough clusters, which are my favorite part of granola, to satisfy me.

review/text: These are great!  Very tasty and filling.  Believe me when I say I am not a health nut and have only just started trying to add these kinds of healthy things into my diet and I am not kidding when I say these are great tasting.  I didn't give 5 stars as I didn't like the taste of some of the blueberries, they have a funny aftertaste.  The good thing is there isn't that many floating around in there so they are easy to avoid.  I eat a handful plane as my brunch snack, but can easily see that they would taste great in oatmeal, yogurt or as a cereal.  I can't wait to try the other flavors and other KIND products.

review/text: I was looking for a healthier snack when I happened upon the Kind Healthy Grains Dark Chocolate and Cranberry here on Amazon.  Because the reviews were good, I decided to give it a try - but quite honestly I wasn't sure if I'd like it since I don't usually like healthy / whole grain types of things (with the taste and texture of cardboard)... But these are different!<br /><br />Each bite has both a hint of cranberry & dark chocolate - not super sweet, but enough to curb my insatiable sweet tooth!  And, in terms of texture, it's more like eating Grape Nuts cereal.<br /><br />Now, every night, instead of eating a bunch of junk food, I find myself actually wanting this snack - it has quickly become my new favorite!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend Kind Healthy Grains Dark Chocolate and Cranberry to anyone looking for a healthier way to snack!

However I have found the Bear Naked products (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CROPGG">Bear Naked Fit Vanilla Almond Crunch Granola, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>) to have higher protein, and better flavor, so try both and decide for yourself.

review/summary: Great snack, wish there are more blueberries
review/text: As a snack this Kind Health Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds is really good. The cluster size means it is more substantial than normal granola. Although you don't really need any milk to eat it, it does keep its crunch quite well even in milk. I like the blueberry taste and it is natural (some other brands taste like medicine syrup to me), but it is perhaps a touch too subtle. For the somewhat steep price, I would expect more blueberry.

review/summary: Great combination of nutrition and taste.
review/text: I'm a healthy food eater and a big label reader, so I was excited to try these Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds.  The best trait about these clusters is that they are great tasting while still being healthy.  The thought of flax seeds may make some people frown with disgust, but you will not be able to taste them.  I enjoyed them directly from the bag, and also as cereal.  I think they would taste terrific mixed in with some Greek yogurt as well.<br /><br />Each serving has 5 grams of fiber and 16 grams of whole grains, which is a nice bonus.  The only negative is that you might want to stay away if you are a hard-core calorie counter, as each one-third cup contains 120 calories.

review/text: Overall, Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat clusters with Flax Seeds Granola has a very satisfying crunch while also being flavorful and healthy.  The granola clusters are nicely sized without being too "crumbly" or too hard.  They give a nice satisfying crunch even after sitting in milk for a bit and are a great accompaniment to yogurt.  I only wish that the cinnamon was a bit stronger in flavor, but the overall balance of flavors is quite satisfactory.<br /><br />What I like best is that you feel satisfied after eating a serving of this granola and are not hungry within the next hour or two like you are with some other granola brands.

review/text: Cinnamon Oat Clusters:<br />This was yummy plain but fabulous with milk. I think I used almond milk. It is a bit on the sweet side, so I'd not want to eat it every day, but as a treat it's perfect and I enjoyed it very much. The abundance of large clusters make it easy to just eat it dry out of the bag, too.<br /><br />Vanilla Blueberry Clusters:<br />This was less exciting to me, although still okay, and it was marginally less sweet than the cinnamon one. I guess it had more of a cardboard taste. I was expecting something more fruity and there are no dried blueberries at all, just some blueberry puree mixed in.

review/text: This two reviews, one each for two different flavors of KIND HEALTHY GRAIN CLUSTERS.<br /><br />The first review is for KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS and is rated at FOUR STARS ****.<br /><br />Pretty Tasty<br /><br />I am always looking for healthy, low fat, good tasting breakfast cereals so I thought that I would give KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS a try.  And, you know what?  I was pleasantly surprised.  In a bowl, with nonfat milk, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS is a tasty, healthy breakfast for both my husband and me.  And guess what else?  Our kids, ages 6 and 14, like it, too!<br /><br />For those who care about such things, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS has 5 grams of fiber (always a plus); 750 mg of Omega-3; is gluten free, all natural, and low glycemic; has no refined sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, or cholesterol; and is very low sodium.  It is 100% whole grain cereal, made up of amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds.  1/3 of a cup is about 120 calories.  (However, 1/3 of a cup seems a bit small to me...)<br /><br />As I said, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS VANILLA BLUEBERRY CLUSTERS makes a nice, light breakfast for my entire family.  And my kids like it with vanilla yogurt and fruit, too, which makes a nice snack that even a mom can approve of.<br /><br />The second review is for KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS and is rated at THREE STARS ***.<br /><br />Not Bad<br /><br />I am always looking for healthy, low fat, good tasting breakfast cereals so I thought that I would give KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS a try. And, overall, it wasn't too bad. Not my favorite of the KIND HEALTHY GRAINS brand, but definitely edible. In a bowl, with nonfat milk, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS is an acceptable, healthy breakfast for both my husband and me.<br /><br />For those who care about such things, KIND HEALTHY GRAINS CINNAMON OAT CLUSTERS has 5 grams of fiber (always a plus); 750 mg of Omega-3; is gluten free, all natural, and low glycemic; has no refined sugars, saturated fats, trans fats, or cholesterol; and is very low sodium.

My kids did not care for it, but that did not surprise me. I have added raisons, cranberrys, strawberries, etc to, and that helps a lot, but still, it is not my favorite, as compared to other KIND HEALTHY GRAINS choices.

review/text: Gone are the days that cold pizza washed down by soda is a good idea for starting the day.  I've gotten older and need to watch all those tricky levels to make sure that I can maintain my health.  It makes sense to eat healthy, but sometimes you need motivation to bypass the tempting "unhealthy" foods and eat right.  This product can certainly help.  It's crunchy and very flavorful with a nutty taste enhanced by a light, natural cinnamon taste.  I eat this with plain or vanilla yogurt and maybe a little fruit to start the day and can feel good about starting the day with a healthy choice.  I also note that I look forward to the meal, a true sign of a good product.<br />The only negative side is that this is very pricey.  I appreciate the high standard of quality of the ingredients, but I gotta say that I can put something together from the bulk bins at Whole Foods at a small fraction of the price.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy, and perfect for vegans ~
review/text: So despite this saying low-glycemic, it actually does have sugar, though much less than other brands (5g per serving). It is also mostly gluten (wheat gluten) free.  The grains are oats, quinoa, amaranth, millet, and buckwheat. The flavor is mild and tastes more natural than other brands, none of that super artificial flavor. It is great on yogurt (I use plain soy yogurt and add real fruit, granola, and a dash of chia seed).  It is also great in almond milk as a cereal (again, I'm vegan here).  It's tasty as a snack.  The nutritional info and ingredients are below:<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />&lt; Serving Size: 1/3 cup (29g); Servings Per Package: About 11 ><br /><br />&lt; Calories 120; Calories from Fat 30; Total Fat 3g; Saturated Fat 0g; Trans Fat 0g; Cholesterol 0mg; Sodium 20mg; Total Carbohydrates 22g; Dietary Fiber 5g; Sugar 5g; Protein 3g ><br /><br />&lt; Ingredients: Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, gluten free oat flour, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, vanilla extract, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate), citrus fiber, citrus pectin ><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />***On a note about packaging.  Vine voices received one bag in a manila envelope.  This is NOT how the product is shipped to paying customers.  Paying customers receive three bags in a rigid box with those plastic air pockets to cushion the bags.  Vine voices were also shipped bags that had minor defects: packaging defects, or lack of whole clusters (which were further broken down due to the cheaper vine shipping).<br /><br />So please bear with the reviews that complain about the packaging and lack of clusters (if they are Vine Voice reviews), this is not the case from paying customers (which I have since bought the three pack of other flavors).<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Also: amazon won't let me review the cinnamon flavor separately... only one review per item... odd.  But I got both flavors from Vine.  Here are the ingredients and nutritional info from the cinnamon (from the Kind website):<br /><br />Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds<br />Ingredients : Whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), evaporated cane juice, flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, molasses, cinnamon, sea salt, Vitamin E (D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate).<br />Vitamins and Minerals : Vitamin A (0% DV), Vitamin C (0%DV), Calcium (2% DV), Iron (6% DV)<br />Serving Size : 1/3 cup(29g)<br />Calories : 130<br />Fat Calories : 30<br />Total Fat : 3.5g<br />Saturated Fat : 0g<br />Trans Fat : 0g<br />Cholesterol : 0mg<br />Sodium : 20mg<br />Potassium :<br />Total Carb : 22g<br />Dietary Fiber : 5g<br />Sugars : 6g<br />Protein : 3g<br /><br />Both flavors were good, and I have been steadily purchasing these flavors and others ever since trying them.

review/text: Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters taste excellent and can either be eaten on their own or mixed with yogurt.<br /><br />The clusters, though, never left me full, and I found it really easy to eat a lot of them without realizing it. 1/3 cup has 120 calories, so it's very easy for this to become a high caloric snack.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that the number one thing Kind boasts about the product is that it has 5g of fiber. There are a lot of other ways to get more fiber with fewer calories. For example, 1/4 cup of kidney beans contains 14g of fiber (56% DV) and is only 70 calories.<br /><br />So I'd recommend the clusters, but you'll probably want to eat them with a measuring cup.

review/summary: More of a Tasty Topping vs. a Breakfast Option
review/text: Kind Healthy Grains never calls itself a cereal, which is probably a good thing. While it packs a lot of nutrition to start your day, two factors hold it back from being your new go-to item in the morning.  First, the taste is decent, but it works much more as an add-in like granola.  When mixed with yogurt or fruit, it does a great job of adding texture while not overpowering the other flavors.  Second, when you see for yourself how small each bag is, you realize how expensive of a product this is.  So even if you fell in love with the taste, most 99%ers would be hard-pressed to budget a bowl of it each morning.  If you're feeding a family of four, you'd be ordering more just about every other day.<br /><br />Our family was already familiar with the Kind bars and we really like them.  They come with most of the nutrition benefits but neither of the drawbacks that I outlined above.  We'll be sticking with them instead.

review/text: The bulk granola normally available in most stores has limited types of grains and many use dairy in the ingredients, which is bad news for those allergic to dairy or who don't want dairy as part of a lifestyle choice.<br /><br />At first glance, yes, it is just another granola.<br /><br />Then I looked at the ingredients and was impressed with amaranth, quinoa, oates, millet and buckwheat.<br /><br />Also it held its crunchiness really well in soy milk, coconut milk, etc.<br /><br />When eating it like a cereal the dried blueberries became a little chewy, but the rest of the cereal remained crunchy.<br /><br />A great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />The blueberry flavor was strong, but the vanilla was hard to find when eating it as a snack. When put into milk, the vanilla seemed to come to life a bit more.<br /><br />The good quantity of fiber made me feel full for a good amount of time.<br /><br />The item is just sweet enough without being too sweet, thanks to cane juice and molasses.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />1/3 cup gives you one serving at 130 calories with 3g fat, 22g Carbs (5g Sugars and 5g Dietary fiber), plus 3g protein. There are approximately 11 servings in one bag. As healthy alternative to a fiber/grain bar as a pick-me up in the afternoon, use this snack instead.

review/summary: If you get it in the mail, the clusters will be broken down...
review/text: I got this bag in the mail and the first thing I noticed is that these clusters were more like tiny cereal bits, which I assume is being bounced around in the mail.  Second, my bag came with a hole in it, which I guess didn't affect the overall quality of the clusters. I feel these are two things a consumer needs to know about buying this item via the mail.  Other than that, the taste of the blend is pretty good.  I had it by itself, with milk and as a topping on my oatmeal and it tasted very good.  The fruit flavor is natural and sweet with the vanilla taste warm and inviting underneath.  All the ingredients are pretty wholesome for the most part, except for cane sugar, but at least that is a natural, non-processed sugar.  I feel the packs are overpriced for what they are.  My boyfriend and I ate the pack I got very fast, to account for how good the product is.  But we do make similar clusters as a snack in our home for a lot cheaper.  The Kind comes out to about 50 cents an ounce and I can make a great deal more of a honey/almond/fruit clusters for that much.  Even if I added flax seed and quinoa.  But needless to say, I really like the product a lot and if I had the money to spend $5.38 for a pack, I would.  It just is a bit high in price for my meager budget!

review/summary: Really good
review/text: This KIND healthy grains vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds granola is really good. The blueberry is subtle enough that it doesn't overpower the flavor, and the sugar is sweet, but not overly sweet. Plus it is not high-fructose corn syrup or anything like that, it is just regular cane sugar juice and vanilla extract. In fact, all of the ingredients in this are just regular ol' stuff that you've most likely heard of. It's printed right on the front of the package: "ingredients you can see & pronounce," and they mean it. Not only are the ingredients all just regular food, but you really can see all of them when you eat it. This stuff isn't coated in anything special to hide what it is, and it's not all ground up or anything into little pieces...it's all just right there and if you wanted to you could probably pick out all the different grains and stuff in it (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa, flax seeds). All this results in a granola/cereal that you can feel good about eating because there isn't anything weird in it; it's all natural ingredients and you can see what it is you're eating. There are supposed to be 11 servings within each package (each serving is 1/3 cup). I probably had between two and three servings when I'd be eating this for breakfast and it was plenty. It is pretty filling and I'm a big guy. Recommended if you are a fan of eating granola or clusters for breakfast or snacks!

review/summary: Tastes good but not sure what to do with powdered granola.
review/text: Pros: I appreciate that these grains are healthy and high in fiber.  It's also good that they are all natural, gluten-free, without GMO.  Nice sugar to fiber ratio.  Not too sweet.  Would be great as a yogurt topper if I ate much yogurt.<br /><br />Cons: The bag says clusters, but what I received was closer to powder.  There may have been a handful of clusters in the entire bag.  If they had been clusters, they would have made better snacks for the grandchildren.  What I had instead were granola sprinkles.  The cinnamon flavor was okay.  Also, the granola has a nutty, oily smell.  It isn't bad, per se, just unusual.  Too expensive in my opinion.<br /><br />I think I would like to try the blueberry and the peanut butter.

review/summary: Oxymoron?
review/text: While I consider the term "healthy grains" to be an oxymoron, this is perhaps one of the most healthy cereals being sold.<br /><br />The "clusters" are fairly small but still reasonable to eat with your fingers dry if you don't wish to eat this like a typical cereal in a bowl with a liquid poured on it.<br /><br />The sugar to fiber ratio is excellent (1:1).<br /><br />The grains are "good" grains (no wheat).  And while "evaporated cane juice" may not be a "refined sugar" it is still sugar, but in a small enough amount to be reasonable (as a guideline I try to consume at least as much fiber than sugar).<br /><br />The taste is good.  The texture is good.<br /><br />The "blueberry" is "blueberry puree" and gives just a hint of blueberry flavor.<br /><br />All in all a decent product, even though I advise against consuming grains.  For healthy eaters, these make a nice "change of pace".

review/text: Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds (which give you omega-3 fatty acids) are absolutely delicious! There're good for you, too; we all need flax and grains in our diet and so this is a preferable snack compared to small candy treats or even those tiny cake treats that have way too much sugar and empty carbs.<br /><br />My package came tightly closed and the product was fresh; that helped it to taste really good!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product; it is a healthy snack and it's great for people on the go.

review/summary: KIND of okay, actually
review/text: I'm a granola eater, big time. Bars, trail mix, thins, cookies, whatever, put granola in it, I'll eat it. I'd never had the opportunity to try the KIND brand, so I was glad to give this stuff a try. Right out of the package, I liked the cinnamon-sugar aroma and flavor, and I found the granola itself to be crunchy and tasty, without being overly sweet, cloying, or cereal-like. With the various seeds and quinoa mixed in, this was more like trail mix or cereal than clusters, but I didn't especially have a problem with it. I've heard flax seeds are healthy for you and I'd never had them before. For the most part, I'm okay with them, but some of the seeds don't break apart easily once they are in your mouth, and I had more than a few husks and hulls get stuck between my teeth and gums. Personally, I wasn't too happy about that, but other than that, taste was decent, texture was good, (this does make a nice texture enhancer in yogurt), and it appears to be higher protein and lower calorie than your average granola. So, this KIND snack is nothing outstanding and nothing terribly bad, earning a middle-of-the-road rating as an average-but-not-special product.

review/summary: Addictively good!
review/text: I love granola; the only thing that prevents me from eating it more often is the unfortunately high calorie/fat content.  Happily, these KIND Healthy Grains are actually quite reasonable--IF you are able to stick a single serving size, that is! ;)  One 1/3 cup serving (there are 11 per generous-sized bag, but it's still easy to overdo it) is only 120 calories, 3 grams of fat, and 5 grams (just 1 teaspoon!) of sugar.  There are also a bunch of healthy things in there:  5 grams of fiber, 3 grams of protein, and 750 mg Omega-3.  Oh, and it's 100% whole grains and gluten-free, too!<br /><br />But the best part is that these grains tastes great!  There is a very strong vanilla flavor--I liked that this tasted natural, not artificial.  The blueberry flavor was more subtle, but it was detectable.  You could also see the flax seeds, although this was not necessarily a good thing (our digestive system can't process whole flax, so we lose the benefit unless the flax is ground).  Finally, I liked that as the name suggests, these grains actually WERE in large clusters, as least for about the first half of the bag (the second half were more broken up).<br /><br />Overall, I definitely enjoyed this product, and I think it's worth purchasing.

review/summary: Goodie, goodie
review/text: I was happy to find this item available on Vine to try it out.<br /><br />First off, it tastes good. Just imagine the gentle taste of vanella mixed with blueberries, it makes me hungry just thinking about it.<br /><br />I enjoy a bowl of cold cereal for breakfast and have my favorites. My choices have remained the same and sometimes I want a change. What has added to the taste of the cereals that I like is to sprinkle these healthy grains on top of the cereal.<br /><br />Important to note is that:<br />this is all natural<br />it is cholesterol free<br />no saturated fat<br />no trans fats<br />very low sodium.<br /><br />I also enjoy a snac while watching TV. Some of those snacks haven't been the healthy kind so being able to use these healthy grains as a TV snack has been an added bonus.

review/summary: Kind Review
review/text: This is the second flavor of this "Kind Healthy Grains" product I have reviewed for Amazon Vine, and again I must ask, what causes a food producer to avoid describing what appears to be granola as, well, granola?<br /><br />It makes me think of high-end audio receivers.  When their price soars above $1,000, they suddenly become "ampli-tuners," which apparently is a more palatable description to golden-eared audiophiles.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the negative implication of granola might be -- perhaps excess fat or high price.  This product eliminates the excess fat but unfortunately embraces the high price.<br /><br />As with the vanilla-blueberry flavor, these "cinnamon oat clusters" are made of amarinth, quinoa, oats, millet, buckwheat, and flax seeds.  I don't see frankincense or myrrh listed, but at more than $5 for an 11-ounce package, they might be included.<br /><br />At any rate, these "clusters" are very tasty right out of the package.  Or you can eat them as cereal with milk or sprinkled on yogurt.<br /><br />So if you like granola but want to minimize your fat intake -- and you can afford the healthy cash outlay -- you might enjoy these "healthy grains."

review/summary: Yummy Sugary Fiber
review/text: "Ingredients you can see & prounounce..."  Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.<br /><br />From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff "on-the-go!" as the package copy boldly exhorts.<br /><br />To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.<br /><br />First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.<br /><br />So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.<br /><br />I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.<br /><br />Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOWJQE">Equal</a> over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.<br /><br />Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.<br /><br />Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no "refined sugars" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for "sugar," like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.<br /><br />Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.  But, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317EA46">Kashi</a> cereals, it's a bit too concentrated and a bit too spendy.

review/summary: Not bad at all
review/text: I ordered a bag and it works just fine on Greek yogurt.  It's light, not too sweet, and adds a good something to a yogurt product.<br /><br />The next day I had this product with skim milk.  It's not bad for breakfast.  Lots of granola products are very dry.  For some reason this product isn't dry at all and is fairly good.<br /><br />Now, I knocked off a star for the flax seed.  I'm not used to that seed and it left a different taste.  The oats, blueberries, and brown sugar was pleasant.  The flax is different, not bad, but different.<br /><br />Still, this is a good product and I will buy more.

review/summary: Decent, but didn't blow me away. Nom nom nom...
review/text: I like all kinds of granola. I like natural foods. I like things with fiber and anything that moves along the intestinal contents, well bonus!<br /><br />This has a good taste, but a weird smell. It does indeed have an oily smell (maybe the omega 3?). Couldn't really place what the smell was, but it's not one I'm used to. The product tastes really good though. I ate it both dry and in milk. It's delicious in 1% milk. Dry, it's OK - mine wasn't very cluster-y, so it was kinda hard to eat with just your hands.<br /><br />I like all the textures and flavors. It has just a hint of sweetness, but the sugar taste isn't overwhelming. Millet isn't something I'm used to seeing in my food, but it was good! My pet parakeets and cockatiel eat millet, so I let them try some, too.<br /><br />The price would probably steer me away from this product. It's good, but it doesn't stand out moreso than other granolas I've tried, taste-wise. I like it, but not enough to be buying it on a regular basis.

review/text: This is a lightly sweet, lightly flavored cluster oat cereal.  My husband likes granola so he tried to eat this cereal dry.  He said there wasn't much flavor to it when eaten that way.  It does taste better with milk.  There are clusters of oats and berries.  If you like sweet cereals, you will probably have to add sugar.  This is a very healthy cereal, though, high in fiber, omega 3 and gluten free.

review/text: I'm always a little wary of "health" food since a lot just doesn't taste good (at least, in my opinion), but these Cinnamon Oat Clusters were fantastic.  I snacked on them plain, but also ate them like cereal.  They don't get soggy in milk.  One thing though, which I think was related to my mailman cramming the package in my mailbox, there weren't many clusters (which is why I ended up eating this like cereal).  The resealable plastic bag is great for keeping them fresh, but not so great for protection during shipping.

review/text: I like the versatility of this granola pack. It's light enough to go on cereal or yogurt, but could also be a standalone snack. It tastes pretty good. The blueberries aren't full sized, or even like raisins, but rather like those preserved fruits you get in some types of cereals. It's still good, but I wouldn't recommend the pack if you're only buying it for the blueberry flavor. Another nice feature is that these grains are a bit softer than traditional granola, so it's not as crunchy to chew. Overall, not a bad choice to spice up your yogurt.

It's also great eaten out of hand, but has a slight cereal-out-of-the-box quality.<br /><br />I don't get punched in the face with vanilla, but the vanilla I do get feels more authentic than a lot of snack foods. It's not an artisinal creation, by any means, but this is a new type of off-the-shelf snack food that hearkens back to real food made by real people. The ingredients are down to earth and the flavors deliver on the promise. This is good munching.

review/summary: Very tasty, fairly healthy, so-so value
review/text: I'll get the ugly out of the way first.  The 11 oz bag is rather small -- not much bigger than your hand.  It contains 11 1oz servings of 1/3 cup.  I could easily eat 1/2 a bag without really trying.  They are not really clusters as pictured, but crumbs like in a typical oat cereal.<br /><br />I don't have any special dietary requirements, but I do mind pretty carefully what I eat, so here's my review:<br /><br />Very tasty.  Much better than expected.  A little on the sweet side.  The cinnamon was not overpowering.  Very versatile as well.  You can eat it loose as a snack (although a bit messy the further down you get in the bag since there are few "clusters" -- more crumbs and dust).  You can also put it over yogurt or other dessert, or eat it with milk as a cereal.<br /><br />Nutritionally, I really like that it has whole grains which give it a nice texture, but not too hard to chew.  Refreshing compared to all those heavily processed foods out there.  Here are the Nutrition Facts per 1/3 cup 1oz serving:<br /><br />Calories: 130<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3.5g<br />Saturated/Trans: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 20mg<br />Total Carb: 22g<br />Dietary Fiber: 5g<br />Sugars: 6g<br />Protein: 3g<br />Basically trace/minimal amounts of vitamins/everything else<br /><br />My "reference" cereal is GoLean Original which is 140 calories for 1 cup serving.  Compared to this, the GoLean has 13g of protein and 10g of fiber while being 3x the volume.  The Kind clusters do have more whole grains 16g (versus 8g) and 720mg of omega-3, so it is still fairly healthy, especially if considered a snack in its small portion size.<br /><br />The list price of over $100 is a joke.  Amazon's price in the mid-teens is fair, but it would be a lot more palatable if it was cheaper or with a subscribe-and-save.  The packaging seems to be trying to promote the KIND movement by the KIND CEO which I found as a weak sell and possibly only contributing to its higher price.

review/summary: Healthy AND tasty. Wow.
review/text: I'm happy to report that someone has finally figured out how to create a healthy snack that also tastes good. Once I opened the package, I literally could not keep my hand out of this bag of healthy grains. Composed of 100% whole grains and fruit, this snack is low in fat, high in fiber, and quite versatile. It tastes great by itself, mixed into yogurt, sprinkled over a fruit salad, or eaten with milk much like conventional cereal. Plus, a little goes a long way--it won't take much to fill you up. I'm pretty sure I have a new favorite snack!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I just received this through my Vine request and although I am not a granola person, this is really delicious! It has just the right amount of sweetness that it could curb your craving for sweets, but also satisfy a snack urge. At 16.56 for 3 bags, it seems like a good price, at 16.56 for 3 bags for all natural, a very good price. I love the blueberries in this, they are soft not overly chewy like some dehydrated fruits. My only complaint is I would like more blueberries in this. Will definitely purchase!

review/summary: Rancid Product, Will Avoid KIND products
review/text: The Bag I received had a rancid ingredient in it. The Exp. date was 8/29/2012. Something made it through quality control. It is a product I would try again, though. There is a good ratio of protein to sugars. The bite I did have was mildly sweet, which I prefer.<br /><br />Update: I contacted the company about the product and provided the exp. date and batch information. They believe it could be due to storage and handling of the product. From the way I received the product I could see that as a possibility. When I get more information I will add that to my review.<br /><br />Update 11/28/11: Looks like customer service is either overworked or inept. I am guessing the later. As mentioned above, I sent a short email with the date and batch number. The response I received back asked for that information. I gave my address and after confirming a post-paid envelope was coming, I responded three weeks later saying I never received it. I received a response back saying he mailed it on 11/4. I emailed him my address on 11/7. I have no way to contact the CEO, so maybe the company is inept as well.<br /><br />Update 12/8/11: The customer service rep sent me another bag to try. Mind you, he is fully aware I am reviewing this product on amazon. The second product was slightly stale tasting. The clusters ranged from granola type flakes all the way to a 2x3 inch chunk. The taste varied by cluster the first one I had was bland, the second sweet and excessive with the cinnamon. Basically, this product should have never passed quality control. The only positive I can say is they communicated.<br /><br />I must recommend avoiding KIND snacks. A companies product is only as good as its organization in my opinion.

review/summary: Powdery
review/text: Clusters? I didn't get any clusters. A couple of residual clumps, but thanks to insufficient packaging, all I got was essentially a bag of powder.<br /><br />I'd attribute part of that to Amazon choosing to send me the single bag in nothing more substantial than a bubble mailer, but the factory packaging should be air-tight, and have enough air (well, nitrogen to keep it fresh) to survive a trip from Seattle to northwest Oregon. I could mail a bag of potato chips (of most major brands) and the chips ought to survive the trip intact.<br /><br />The powder tastes okay. But crushed that much, I can't really consider this a snack anymore. I am very disappointed.<br /><br />Maybe I'll try some from the grocery store where I can make sure it's not already crushed, and then transport it myself in a suitable fashion, but even if it turns out to be good, I can't recommend buying it from Amazon unless they find a better way to ship it than a bubble mailer. I can't believe anyone could have thought that was a good idea!

review/text: I love blueberries (fresh blueberries are very tasty and very healthy), and I love blueberry flavor. So when these arrived I was expecting something very tasty. However for me, these clusters tasted like they were a bit old. I like that these clusters are not very sweet, and that they contain whole grains, flax seeds and oats (very healthy), and fiber. But I just did not find them very tasty.<br /><br />Overall this makes for an average nice snack

review/summary: It's Good Granola
review/text: While the label may describe this product as cinnamon oat clusters, my meat-eating palate recognizes this as granola.  I happen to like granola, so that's not a bad thing, and I recognize that the words cinnamon oat clusters carries with it significantly more cachet than does the word 'granola.'  My review of this treat - First the Good:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*  Taste - This is good-tasting stuff and happens also to be good for you.  While it does have some sugars added, it is in the form of evaporated cane juice and molasses and it seems to me there is just a pinch of it, adding only a hint of sweetness which is not overpowering.  Sugars weigh in at 6g per serving.  The grains are tasty, fresh, and crunchy.<br /><br />*  Simple Ingredients - This is important to me, as I prefer to be able to pronounce the names on the ingredients list.  This is packed with grains:  oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa.  Other ingredients include flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, molasses, cinnamon, sea salt, and vitamin E in the form of D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate.  OK, so I could pronounce most of it<br /><br />*  Fiber - As you would suspect of this kind of food, it is all about fiber:  fully 5g of dietary fiber according to the label, per 1/3 cup serving.  That's pretty good, in my book.<br /><br />*  Satisfying - This reviewer prefers this for breakfast, either with milk or mixed in with fruit yogurt, and it keeps me full and satisfied through lunch.  It is healthy and filling.<br /><br />Mixed:<br /><br />*  Aroma - The aroma of this is much like the aroma of most bags of grain:  earthy and slightly musty smelling.  That's not a bad thing.  It's just that this reviewer does not find it particularly mouth-watering.  There is the faintest hint of cinnamon, but to me it smells much like a sack of brown rice or like most of the granola I've ever eaten.<br /><br />*  Feel Good Message - I've got mixed feelings about this.  Ordinarily, the packaging or the company of a product doesn't get a mention when I'm reviewing a product - it's always about my experience with the product itself.  In this case, however, the product is inextricably tied to a message from the company:  KIND LLC.  I am always appreciative of companies whose founders or owners direct the company toward social or environmental good and indeed I am drawn towards those products that also contribute towards causes I believe in.  At the same time, I understand that companies' primary aim is to make profit and a feel good message becomes part of the marketing campaign; I believe that doing good comes from one's character and upbringing, not what one sees on the bottom of a product's packaging.  In this case it is 'Kinding Mission #99...'  Does this affect my rating?  No, but this reviewer thinks it is worth a mention.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br /><br />I enjoyed this product and found it to be tasty, fresh, and healthy.  Yet I struggled with my rating, wanting to give it between three and four stars - ultimately giving it the benefit of the doubt at four.  Why?  Because as tasty as this was, it was still no more tasty or healthy or fresh as many other granola that I have tried, including the very best I've had:  that made in my very own oven.  So basically, despite the message of kindness toward others and the earth, at the end of the day it is just granola.<br /><br />A quick word about bias, as that enters into any review where preference comes into play.  I am neither vegan nor exclusive carnivore.  While I like eating meat, I don't eat it for every meal and endeavor to replace as much of it as I can on a regular basis with fresh vegetables and grains.  While I like this product, it seems to me that it is seeking a niche in a crowded market, where granola is basically a commodity.  As such, value needs to be considered with competing products that are basically equivalent.  I mention this because there is so much excellent healthy granola out there, so price should be considered when shopping.

I tried the maple walnut and didn't have any problems with those. When trying the vanilla clusters on the other hand though I noticed that there was a weird smell and taste. Is hard to describe but it has an old and stale taste/smell. I checked the expiration date and it is set for June 21 2013. I won't be buying these going forward as It has totally put me off.

review/summary: Feh
review/text: I've got nothing new to say here; I'll just pile on with the rest.<br />The texture is ... friable. It's loose granular granola. The clusters have de-clustered. This doesn't bother me.<br />The acrid aroma does bother me. It smells like a drying oil portrait. In other words, like rancid linseed. This odor accompanies each spoonful down your gullet. If you care about healthy-eating things, you wonder about the oxidative-stress, anti-health effects of rancid fats as you finish your bowl, because this stuff is expensive and there's no way you're gonna waste it, free radicals or not.<br />Several have commented on the price. Note that it's gluten-free. If you had to eat gluten-free all the time (and I do), you'd be accustomed to this kind of gouging: $6 loaves of bread, $7 frozen pizzas, and now, $6, 11-oz bags (that's about 3 or 4 bowls IRL) of gluten-free granola. "Gluten-free," translated into English, means "Give me your money."  Celiacs' diets are limited to what's available, and a lot of it isn't very satisfying.<br />Fortunately there are many other less expensive and less rancid tasting cereals/granolas available.<br />Because I feel sort of bad for KIND, I will say here that I like their nut- and fruit-based bars very much.<br />[You may or may not be interested in the following: Oats by themselves are gluten-free. However, commercial oats sold on the world market are extensively contaminated with gluten-containing wheat, rye and barley, and are therefore not suitable for a gluten-free diet - this includes grocery store oatmeal and products made with oats. However, in the past 8 or so years, oats have been grown in dedicated fields using scanned seeds, and the crop tested for gluten. These are known in the celiac world as "gluten-free oats." These GF oats cost about five times as much as regular oats, and are the type used in KIND, friable, cinnamon-linseed granola.]

This was a nice find as it tastes good and is a healthy alternative to super sugary breakfast cereals.  There are only 6g of sugar in a serving (1/3 cup) which is great! The flax seeds provide omega-3s, which seems to be quite the buzz word among the foods folks these days.  I haven't had this with yogurt, but would imagine that it would be quite good.  Be sure to not make the mistake I did and think it would also be a good dry snack to keep in my desk... it's just too messy without a bowl a spoon.  I would recommend it!

review/summary: Yes, really! The sensory experience of sugar cookies. :-)
review/text: A slightly vegetable-tasting herbal tea, the main ingredients of milk thistle and roasted barley recreate the smell and flavor of cookie dough, bringing to mind the scent of plain white flour. With the addition of orange peel and vanilla, the flour-like scent of the milk thistle and barley becomes a touch sweeter, and like magic you have the sensory impression of warm sugar cookies. The scent is much more convincing than the flavor, which is not going to confuse anyone: it's herbal tea and tastes like herbal tea and not at all like cookies. But the magic is still there. I'm sure children will be amazed to experience water and a tea bag painting such fun sensory pictures. Ordinarily I would never add cream and sugar to herbal tea, but the cookieness (is that a word? cookieosity?) of the tea tempted me to do it, and the result was actually quite pleasant. This is not a tea I would drink outside of the season, but it's a warm and whimsical tea to share with children and friends.

No, there is no texture of a sugar cookie, however the taste does have a definite effect on your, as one rater noted, senses. If you enjoy sugar cookies, but would like a calorie free treat perhaps this is for you.

review/text: I haven't had these mints since my wife and I lived in Florida back in our college days over a decade ago.  She used to love them.  I recently purchased them here on Amazon and served them after dinner one night and the taste brought us back to when we first met.  We fell in love all over again; with each other, and with the mints.  These mints are magical and if you're looking to rekindle a long lost love with your special someone, look no further than these!! (sorry but I can't guarantee this will happen for you)

review/summary: Great tasting cappucino in a convenience can
review/text: This is cappuccino in an 8.45 oz can, just a bit more than a regular 12 oz soda can. You won't get the, "You got milk mustache" or some cute latte art, but you can really taste a nice combination of strong coffee flavor and milk - tastes great. 100 calories.<br /><br />The milk comes from rBST free cows (I first had to Google it to know what it means), meaning no injection with artificial hormones to increase production of milk. RBST is already banned in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, etc., but not in the US yet.<br /><br />Not better than the hot cappuccino served with the traditional atmosphere, but if you need to run, you can just grab one and throw it in you bag.<br /><br />Product of Denmark.

review/summary: illy issimo cappuccino
review/text: Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

review/summary: These Chips Have It All
review/text: Gluten-free, vegan, and they taste outstanding. These are multi-grain, lightly salted, triangle-shaped chips.<br /><br />They are:<br />* Non-GMO<br />* 100% Organic<br />* Loaded with Omega 3's<br />* No synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers<br />* No trans fats or high fructose corn syrup<br />* No artifical flavors, colors or preservatives<br />* Because they're vegan they naturally have No Cholesterol (cholesterol only comes from animal products)<br /><br />They have a wonderful crunch. And unlike many snacks, after you eat a handful of them, you feel satiated. With 18 whole grains per serving, I encourage the entire family to snack on these chips often. This is by far the best tasting snack chip on the market. I don't know how they managed to make a chip that takes so good and is so good for you at the same time.

review/summary: The Best Hurricane Mix You Will Ever Have
review/text: When I went to Mardi gras 2008 I discovered this amazing drink concoction at Pat O'Brien's on Bourbon St. We drank these every day we were there (5 days) & couldn't get enough of them. If you like fruity drinks you will love these. When I was talking to the bartender I asked him what liquor I should put in this mix. He suggested either Bacardi 151 or Myers dark rum or a little mix of both. I highly suggest this mix it truly is the best & brings me back to bourbon st every time I drink one!

review/summary: As Great as the Pure Vanilla
review/text: We as a population are so lucky to have so many different tastes and flavors.  One of those tastes and flavors is Nielsen-Massey Pure Almond Extract.  I is on a par as Nielsen-Massey Pure Vanilla Extract and frankly I cannot tell any difference between the two in terms of quality.  Each has characteristics that make any cooking or baking the best possible.  Sure I can buy imitation flavors and I will see and taste the difference between the real and imitation.  A recent Almond Pound Cake was ingested so fast at a desert fair the folks wanted more.  I have found that any Nielsen-Massey (N-M)flavor is consistently fantastic and never overstated.  Some flavors cannot be detected because they disappear when cooked but not so with N-M.  This set of flavors is a must have when the time comes.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Truly Tasty and LOW SODIUM
review/text: My entire extended family loves this product.  Our house is on a low sodium diet, and it can be very hard to come up with savory (as opposed to "sweet") meal ideas that are worth eating (especially for those NOT on the low sodium diet)!  While it's a tasty sauce on it's own, we like to dilute it with water & slow cook a hunk of lean pork in it.  Serve it with some oven roasted peppers over rice and it's a great, easy, "wow" meal.  We like it so much that I make large batches of the pork & freeze it in bags for whenever we want a quick but very yummy & healthy meal!  Central Market carries it for $9/bottle, so that is the "local price comparison" you can use to see if it's worth ordering.  Fewer stores are carrying it, though.

It has a thicker, richer, & creamier texture than regular clover honey and it has a stronger, more distinct flavor.  It's great in tea and on cornbread, but I also sometimes just savor a small spoonful just by itself. Delicious!

review/summary: Excellent honey that is good for you
review/text: I bought this New Zealand Rewarewa honey over a decade ago at Trader Joe's. It was delicious but, also seemed to help with a health issue too.<br />Then, as usual, Trader Joe's stopped selling it after only a few months. I searched for it on the web but, could not find it. I gave up.<br />Recently I was reading about a book about the power of honey for good health. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312629818">The Honey Trail: In Pursuit of Liquid Gold and Vanishing Bees</a> So I searched again and, great! You can buy the honey online now.<br />It is still great tasting honey and, I do feel better with about a tablespoon of the stuff in the morning on my oatmeal or in some tea.<br />The 3 pack is great and the cheapest way to buy it. Hopefully they will consider selling a larger container someday.

review/summary: Halo Grain Free Dry Cat Food
review/text: I recently took in a beautiful stray cat and named him Stashu.  We also have a dog and 2 parakeets.  All of our animals eat healthy, really good food and are well cared for.  I want all of my pets to live a long healthy life.  Our dog has been eating Halo dry dog food and does very well on it.  I decided to try the Halo brand for my cat Stashu and he loves it!!!!  I feed him both the dry and wet Halo cat food.  I am very pleased that this product is Grain Free since felines do NOT eat grains, they are carnivores.  Stashu has stopped "Tooting" all the time since he has been eating this food.  This is a very healthy food for cats (in addition to adding the Halo can food as well).  I highly recommend this product.  Its all natural - just read the ingredients.

review/text: My cat loves this brand of cat food. She is lackluster about the other Halo brands- and she's tried them all. As soon as I put this in the bowl she came running. My cat is 15 years old and doesn't eat a lot. I want to insure that what she DOES eat is of high quality. Finally, a grain-free food that she will eat! Also ,the price isn't bad either- it could cost more. She wasn't a fan of Avoderm, but she visits her food bowl frequently now. I can hear her crunching on it right now actually.<br /><br />I only wish that this came in larger bags. I free feed her this along with the occasional 1/2 can of wet cat food.

review/summary: Good, Healthy product
review/text: I've been using Halo cat food for a few years.  I started with their regular Spot's Stew, but when they came out with the grain-free version, I switched over.  My two girls (8 yrs old) just had their yearly checkup and are very healthy.  They're a little pudgy, but they're indoor-outdoor cats, so they do eat a few things "on the run" - I would prefer they didn't, but they were feral kittens and the hunting instinct is very strong.<br />They also get a little of the Halo Pat&eacute; wet food with their evening meal.  The new Pat&eacute; is very nice and the cats love it.<br />This is a very nice product and I have no need to try another.  Some other reviewers (for the reg product) also report that the litter box doesn't smell (or at least is not as bad) when their cats are on this product - I can't attest to that since my cats are outside a lot, although one of my cats used the "emergency" litter box and I didn't know it for a couple of days - no odor at all.<br />If you read the Halo labels, you'll see what a great product it is - certainly much better than other brands with all the fillers they use.<br />They have never had to recall any of their products, unlike many other brands.

review/summary: Disappointed in the one sold on Amazon... it's not the same as the grocery store version.
review/text: Original review:  I must be a freak because I really like this granola, and can't stand some of the other gluten-free granolas that get much better ratings here on Amazon.  I don't know why I like it, but even though the berry flavor tastes a bit artificial, I like its tangy semi-sweetness a lot better than the awful "maple" and "apple cinnamon" ones that I've tried.  I think those taste even more fake, and much too sweet.  I guess I am not a fan of eating a lot of sugar on my cereal, and this one tastes less sweet than some of the others.  I guess it's really a matter of personal taste.  I'm going against the crowd on this one... I just ordered a 6-pack.<br /><br />Oct. 5 2010<br />I have to change my review.  I ordered six of these, but what I received is NOT the same product that I've been buying in my local grocery store.  Either they've changed it to make it worse, or Amazon is selling old stock and the one in the grocery store is the "improved" version.  Plus I got heartburn big time from this one, and never had it before from the grocery store item.  I didn't like it at all... am donating the remaining 5 packages to a homeless shelter or a gluten intolerant friend.  Two stars now.

review/text: The product was shipped in a very timely fashion, considering it was the Christmas holidays.  The sugar cubes are delicious and so much better than processed white sugar.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: Try this stuff!  The taste is amazing...especially in coffee and tea. It is unrefined...meaning you do not get the 5 added chemicals in it that you injest w/white refined table sugar.  You also get the natural minerals already found in pure raw sugar cane.  Check out www.becomenatural.com for all the wonderful benefits this product has to offer!  You'll love it!

review/summary: Beats bottled water by a long shot
review/text: We started drinking the 16 oz. Snapple in the 12 pack, which isn't offered in Amazon choices. I loved it because it was not only super low in calories at 160 per bottle, but it tastes great. I'll bet we go through 6 or 8 bottles a day year round. I like the lemon, and my life loves the peach, and this year they came out with a diet version in peach that sports just 24 calories per bottle, and tastes great. Almost anything that is diet usually tastes "off" somehow, but I actually like the Snapple taste. I figure I save about 500 - 600 calories a day in the warm weather. Even though I buy two cases at a time, I sometimes run out and have to make a Snapple run.
