review/summary: Not limited to hot beverage
review/text: The Prince of Peace Instant Ginger Honey Crystals originally didn't impress me because the first ingredient was cane sugar, followed by honey and then ginger.  Because we don't drink many sweet beverages, the 70 calories and 17 sugar grams seemed outrageous.  We also were not thrilled with the biblical proverbs imprinted on the packaging.  After opening the first pouch, however, our family was hooked on the spicy sweet crystals.  Each pouch contains 12 grams of ginger and it is very, very spicy, just what we like around here.  We empty a packet into a little jar and always have some accessible in the kitchen.  I use a little binder clip on a packet in my bag when traveling, so I can slip a few crystals on my tongue even when there's no water available.  I add this to white or green tea, mix it in my chai and add no other sweetener, sprinkle it on yogurt, fruit and fiber cereal in the morning, and even have used it to tone down an overly spicy seafood stew I made last week.  I don't know how, but throwing in about a half teaspoon worked a miracle.  The hot beverage is great when we're nauseous or just feeling less than perfect, and when chilled, is a perfect complement to one of those clear beverages we may drink for relaxation.  If you like ginger, think about taking a break from the ginger chews/candy and try these little delectable crystals instead.

review/summary: Spicy and satisfying, but not the best
review/text: The packets make an easy and quick way to make a spicy and sweet ginger tea. However, I prefer using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029JDDE">Ting Ting Jahe Ginger Candy (5.25oz)</a> to make my tea. Every packet has 17g of sugar, yet doesn't taste as sweet as Ting Ting Jahe in my opinion, which has only 3g per piece of candy. I also think that Ting Ting Jahe has a cleaner ginger flavor, but isnt as spicy as this product. This product also takes up more space and isnt as good a value as ting ting jahe. If you are looking for the quickest way to make a drink, these packets are the way to go. However, if you are willing to stir around the ginger candies until they dissolve, the ting ting jahe candies make a much better tasting drink, with less sugar and a cleaner finish. Plus, you can eat them as regular candies if you wish!

review/summary: Not Very Good
review/text: I got this because I am pregnant and experiencing nausea.  I had never had anything like this, so I was not aware of what it would be like.  I did read the reviews and most people seemed to really like this product, so I gave it a try.  I did not like it!  It is very spicy, which to me did not seem fitting for a drink.  I was only able to get down half a glass of this.  If you are pregnant and looking for something to ease your morning sickness, try ginger tea instead.  I got some lemon ginger tea... it is very good!  Also try ginger hard candies.  I got some of those as well.  If you are just a lover of all things ginger, go ahead and try it!

review/summary: The best out of Three
review/text: These are a very crunchy cookie with a creamy center.  The cookie part crumbles into many bits.  There is no neat way to eat them.  I even tried putting a bowl under me.  This method catches a lot of the mess, but not all of it.  If you don't have something under you, you will spill tons of crumbs all over.  It is rather ridiculous & frustrating.<br /><br />The flavor is very good! Out of the 3 cookie flavors I've tried, I like these the best. As for their other cookies, I have tried their fig cookies & their chocolate cream filled. The chocolate cream suffers the same overly messy crumbs as these cookies do & has an odd flavor.  The fig have very little taste & the cookie is soft.  So soft, that it falls apart in your hand before you can even take a bite!<br /><br />While the ingredients are mostly good there is room for improvement: organic soy flour, NON organic soy lecithin (GMO anyone?), inulin & natural vanilla flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients as per the box are as follows:  organic cane sugar, organic palm fruit oil, organic rice flour, organic sunflower oil, organic tapioca starch, organic potato starch, organic eggs, organic soy flour, organic rice starch, organic rice syrup, organic nonfat dry milk, organic cocoa, organic arabic gum, organic egg yolks, leavening (monocalcium phosphate, baking soda), salt, inulin, soy lecithin, natural vanilla flavor, guar gum.<br /><br />Since there are so few organic gluten free options that taste good these are a better choice than many.  I like Pamela's for example, but they only contain some organic ingredients - hopefully Pamela's changes that.<br /><br />At this point, I have satisfied my curiosity in the Jovial line & am not likely to purchase any more of their products.  I think I'll be sticking with my old stand by; organic milk chocolate covered raisins.  They are delicious, totally organic & not the least bit messy!

review/summary: My Chihuahua died of Melamine poisoning after eating a chicken chew
review/text: My Chihuahua, Chiquita, loved those Hartz chicken chews and it never occurred to me that she would one day die as a result of eating those chicken chews.  I used to give her those chews a few times a week throughout her entire life, then one day when she was 15 years old she got real sick right after I had given her one of those chicken chews, and she was lethargic.  I took her to the vet and they said she had developed Kidney Failure.  That was the beginning of the end for her.  The results were from the Hartz chicken chew that I had given her...and it was Melamine Poisoning.  In back of the Hartz package it says, "Made in China."  If you are reading this, you may want to read the following website from the FDA:<br />[...]<br />Chiquita died from Kidney Failure, and all it took was one Hartz chicken chew that had Melamine to destroy her kidneys...and it came from China.  (I trusted the Hartz product that I bought, and Chiquita trusted me.)

More depth and more 'fire' than that so if you like really bland drinks, this isn't for you. It has enough of a kick to it to be interesting. Best ginger beer I have tasted.<br />Try it with a small amount of ribena (blackcurrant cordial) or be more safe and stick with the UK lime cordial, but either makes for a great alternative to alcohol - don't even miss alcohol with a 'ginger beer and blackcurrant', try it - you won't be disappointed.<br />But it does have a good recipe for an alcohol drink on the back!

review/text: I hosted a Moscow Mule party last year.  During that party, we tried several different brands of ginger beer (Fever Tree, Gosling's, Sioux City, and Cock 'n Bull).  Of those four brands, Cock 'n Bull was the unanimous choice of all of my guests at the party.  That vote includes drinking it straight and drinking it as a mixer in the Moscow Mule.  It has a distinct ginger punch that is lacking in the other brands (a punch that is needed to stand up to the fresh lime juice in the Moscow Mule), yet it is palatable enough to be served on its own.  This is a great mixer, and a great soda.

There is a little heat from the ginger that follows and is a nice contrast to the sweetness.  It is hotter than a Barr's Ginger Beer but not as fiery as a Fever Tree.  All in all worth a try.  My favorite GB is the Fever Tree Ginger Beer.  It is both very fiery and not overly sweet so it mixes well with other drinks without making them overly sweet.  I will however probably purchase Cock n Bull again.

review/summary: These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful.
review/text: These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce).<br />The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later.<br />If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack.

review/summary: Maybe too delicious?
review/text: Snyder's Honey Mustard & Onion Prezel Pieces might very well hold the title for most delicious non-candy snack item.  A large bag rarely lasts a day in my house, which isn't a good thing when they're pretty caloric.  They're so delicious you just want to stuff a whole handful in your mouth and slowly suck the flavor out of them, crunching on the remains as you look like a mad squirrel.<br /><br />I would go as far as to say that you could eat these every day and not get tired of them.  I would replace every meal of the day with these things if I wasn't afriad of them giving me heart disease.<br /><br />Try them once and you'll be hooked.  I have tried the other flavors since some stores run discounts, none of the other flavors were anywhere near as good as the Honey Mustard & Onion.  Buttermillk Ranch is ok, but you can't top Cool Ranch Doritos.  Cheddar Cheese wasn't good at all, and Buffalo Wing was hard to eat (flavor makes your hands all nasty).

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V3BM">Snyder's of Hanover Hot Buffalo Wing Pretzel Pieces, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> If you like pretzels, buffalo wings, heat and salt you will love these.  They are a product that actually delivers on their promises.  They are hot and spicy, but not in the bland heat just to say they are spicy of so many other products.  These have the heat and the vinegar tang of actual buffalo chicken wings.  I love them.  Unfortunately they don't last long at our house.  Once a bag is opened they are gone as the burst of heat you get from them is addictive. The only downside aside from the speed at which they get eaten is the orange fingers you get from them.  But that is a small price to pay for entrance into flavor heaven.

Everybody I know who has tasted them raves about the flavor.  I don't think you could have found a better combination of flavors to add to a pretzel.  I've tried Hanover's other flavors but they don't come near this all time favorite.  I did have to stop buying and eating them because of health reasons, but when I did eat them, I would not be without any in  my house.

review/text: These taste great and they are my snacking weakness! however, they get on my nerves because the non-uniformaly shaped pieces exhibit the brazil nut effect where granular particles of similar/equal density tend to be on top aka the larger pretzel pieces tend to be in the first handful but as you eat more the smaller ones are always on the bottom of the bag no matter what you do. frustrating but unavoidable. just be aware.<br /><br />snyder should get a better pretzel chipper machine or whatever they use and keep the size consistent! if it works for potato chips why can't it work for pretzel???

I agree with this claim, my family agrees with this claim, my son's family agrees with this claim; as a matter of fact, everyone I've shared these pretzels with agrees with this claim.<br /><br />These are hard, sourdough pretzel pieces.  I'd guess the average size is 1/2" x 3/4" - 1"  of all different shapes because they are randomly broken. I ordered these using Amazon's subscribe & save program which brings the price down to less than I'd pay in the supermarket. Twelve packages are a lot. I share them with my family & friends.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />1 oz. or approx 1/3 cup serving = 130 calories<br />Total fat 6g<br />~Saturated fat 3.5g<br />~Trans fat & Cholesterol 0<br />Sodium 260 mg (11% of your daily value)<br />Total Carbs 18g<br />~Fiber less than 1g<br />~Sugars less than 1g<br />Protein 2g<br />Vitamin A, C, & Calcium 0<br />Iron & Niacin each 6%<br />Riboflavin 8%<br />Thiamin 10%<br />Folate 20%<br /><br />I can't really describe the flavor so I thought I'd list some of the ingredients which make up the 'burst of flavor.'

Random bags yield random results, the first pretzel in your mouth is an awesome experience, for the most part.<br /><br />But, for crying out loud, why do they have to add an YEAR'S WORTH OF SALT in one friggin bag?!! It's not consistent, sometimes you get lucky with the top portion of the bag when it's not all that salty, but by the end of one bag, you do get the feeling that you have consumed an ocean's salt content. Why this idiocy? When all one craves for is the taste of spicy jalapeno? The sucker that I am, I eat the first couple of pretzel pieces and then throw the whole bag away, it's serious sodium poisoning if you do consume the whole bag.

review/text: Snyder's of Hanover makes good pretzels (Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite), but these are just not appetizing at all.  "Hot Buffalo Wing" gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce.  So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel.  They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they aren't as bad as just cheddar cheese.  Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's.  If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible.  If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion.  Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color.  Also, if you consumed an entire 10 oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming 1400 calories.  I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do.  Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones.

review/text: I don't know how many people will know to actually look for Dorothy Lynch salad dressing unless they've lived in the midwest or have heard about it through family or been in the midwest to try it.  I'm from Nebraska and we didn't go without this salad dressing.  They would even have it on the buffet's.  My Aunt just brought me some down from Iowa and I had forgotten just how much I loved it. Some would think that it's like a french style dressing, and yes you see it advertised as that.  But Dorothy Lynch is so much better. It has a sweet taste with a little tang and is good with any salad or as a marinate.

review/text: Like one of the other review, I discovered Dorthy Lynch when I was in Nebraska. I worked at local pizza place, Valentinos Pizza, when I was attending the U of Nebraska. It was so good! Make eating a salad taste so great.<br /><br />Well its been30 years since I was burning my arms in the pizza ovens, and I live in Indiana and Dorthy Lynch isn't offered here. I would love for it to be available through Amazon. It costs a small fortune to buy it through the company.<br /><br />If you are passing through Omaha or Lincoln, stop in at a local grocery store pick a few bottles. You won't be sorry!

review/text: We are using this blue cornmeal for cornbread and it is very delicious. It has kind of a nutty taste and a more substantial texture than yellow or white cornmeal-based cornbread. After eating the standard cornbread for years we are delighted with the change. We now alternate between them for variety. Since we ordered 10 pounds, as soon as the blue cornmeal arrived we put it in a plastic bag and stored it in the freezer.

review/summary: Freakin' delicious.
review/text: This stuff is gooooooood. I don't know what more to say about the flavor. It's cherry pomegranate. It's sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. And it's much, much less expensive on Amazon than in my local supermarket. This product comes in a pack of 4, as it says, which means four bottles, each containing 10 quarts worth of powder. Each packet of powder makes 2 quarts, so while it's easy to make it in one-gallon batches like I do, it's not as easy to make it in 1-quart batches, since measuring out half of one packet would be annoying. So, two quart intervals is the standard measurement for these packets.

review/text: After trying every cake mix around to accommodate my son's numerous allergies, this one not only fits the bill but it is really delicious.  It is rich with tasty chocolate and is plenty light, unlike so many other GF products.  The leavening is already included, so there is no fussing with egg-replacer--all that is needed is water and the oil of your choice.  This is one cake that the entire party likes! Highly recommended!  Also check out all of the other Cravings Place products--all are terrific.
