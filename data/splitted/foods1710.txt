review/summary: Good Tasty Treats
review/text: These are nice, small treats that my dog enjoys very much. Only reason that it gets 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the "great for training" call on the box. As one reviewer already said, these really aren't very good for training. They are too big to work well - the dog looses focus and they are too crunch to cut up and use in smaller bits. However, with that being said, my dog loves these! I'll continue to pick them up as general treats or as a big treat at the end of a training session.

review/summary: Our Dogs Love Them
review/text: Our dogs love the basted gravy bones by milkbone.  The only problem is they are not readily available to buy in the stores!  Most biscuits they eat leave little "land mines" all over the carpet.  Not these bones, I don't think the crumbs even hit the ground before they are lapped back up by our Boxer and Parsons' Russell!

review/text: We got these for my fiances lab (my lab too thru him) and we use them as occasional treats and for training purposes. For some reason, I thought they'd be bigger than they were, but I'm okay with the size that they are. I read that some people had bugs in their boxes, no bugs here!! Thank goodness!! She likes these treats, but she also eats deer poop in the backyard and anything on the floor, sooo I can't guarantee that the taste is great, but if she eats them, then that's all that matters! LoL. As humans, we'll never know, and I'm not trying them!

review/summary: My dog says bleh
review/text: I've never found a dog biscuit my little Maltese likes so I knew I was taking a chance. Still,  I'm VERY disappointed that there are no returns for the 11 unopened boxes.  I wouldn't try them if you have a finicky dog or a small eater. They are bland. There's no tasty smell, I mean nothing. The cardboard box smells as appetizing. I realize my dog is hard to please so I won't blame it all on MilkBone. He's not a big eater and has never been a chewer (never chewed on furniture, shoes etc) so although he won't grab ANY bone, he does enjoy them. Most beef bones are too large but he crunches lamb or pork rib bones up completely.  There must be SOME kind of biscuit to keep a small eater's teeth healthy.

(the Mexican decaf looks like ground cinnamon) This would be a good one to start with if you haven't tried Larry's before.

review/summary: Better than any non-GF pasta I've ever tried
review/text: I bought the first pack of this for a ridiculous price at a local health food store for the sake of at least TRYING to find a gluten-free pasta that doesn't taste like chalk or corn starch.  This is NOT the typical GF pasta.  It does have a flavor slightly different from "regular" pasta, but it's divine (better than what I can recall of wheat pasta) and has yet to compete with any of the sauces I've paired with it.  As well, unlike all the corn OR rice pastas I've tried, it cooks cleanly.  No poofs of starch boil-over or sticky texture.  I was delighted to see this on Subscribe and Save.  As much as I like to support local food shops, Amazon's S&S is one of the only ways I can afford to live as my diet requires.

review/text: First, I think this has an odd product assortment. I don't understand the popcorn mixed with the pretzels and the cookies. Other than the chocolate drizzle on the popcorn it does not seem like they all fit together.<br /><br />The main issue is that the calorie portions are not the same for all three. the popcorn is 130 calorie count while the other 2 are 100.<br /><br />So that is why I knocked off one star.<br /><br />The pretzels are the real prize in this assortment.<br /><br />They arrived fresh, and even though it has been very hot and humid the chocolate did not come melted.. So Nabisco really knows how to make a product.

review/summary: A must-have staple in my kitchen
review/text: Glace de Viande Gold in a classic brown stock reduction. It can be reconstituted into a full flavored stock by using 1 part glace to 20 parts water. The stock is great for moistening stuffing, making soups or making a jus for dipping. The flavor is much more complex and professional tasting than other prepared stocks and broths found in most grocery stores.<br /><br />A glace is traditionally made by reducing stock veal stock for 8-12 hours until it has the consistency of a thick syrup. To bring this product to the consistency of a classic glace add 1 part de Viande Gold to 3 parts water. I use the glace for adding flavor to sauces when I don't want any extra thickening agent. If I want the flavor of a glace but also want it to help hold a sauce together I use More than Gourmet's Demi-Glace Gold which is pretty much the same thing but it contains a roux.<br /><br />These products last for months in the frig so I purchase these in the 16 oz. tubs. For some of the glaces and stock reductions that I use less frequently I purchase the 1.5 oz. pucks. They are made using classic recipes and are the real deal. I keep 8-10 different varieties on hand in my kitchen and would not want to think about cooking without them.

This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!

review/summary: Liv-r licious!
review/text: My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more! No limit on liver dusted treats!<br /><br />Two paws up for this stuff!

review/summary: Excellent Product and Made in U.S.A.
review/text: My three very finicky dogs love this product, and I like the way I can cut them up into small pieces for training.  There is only one ingredient in this: liver, all sourced within the United States, so I feel confident and safe giving this to my dogs.  I buy this on a regular basis.  It's priced better than any pet supply store I've seen, even the larger chains.  Qualifies for free shipping, which is also nice.

review/summary: Dogs love them!
review/text: My dogs love these... either straight up, or crumbled on food they would otherwise not eat.  They don't get sick of them and almost never ever reject them.  They do quite often reject other treats, and certainly after a while of the same other treats.  But then tend to always enjoy these. In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!

review/text: My dogs have been eating liver treats for years.  We also use the treats for training.  The treats are 50% crude protein so you are getting a high quality treat.  Just make sure your dog has enough water since the treats make  my dogs thirsty.

review/summary: Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried, Best Part Of Rudy's Day
review/text: I was intially introduced to Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats at my veterinarian's office.  Rudy, our Jack Russell Terrior, usually not all that interested in dog treats, responded like I'd never seen before!<br /><br />I bought a couple of cans (they are pretty pricey), but gave them to him sparingly. The tricks he'd do for the Pro-Treats were really entertaining.  Now, Rudy has to take meds. for his glaucoma and thank heavens I found the large size here which is a good value, so he not only takes his medicine, but gives great tricks in return each day! He's a happy camper, despite the loss of sight in one eye.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a><br /><br />Rudy says, "They are the best part of my day!"  We think so too!  ~ CJ

You get tons!! in the 14 ounce bucket and my little dog is in love.

review/summary: Great training treats!
review/text: Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!<br /><br />Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best dog treats
review/text: I have a 2 1/2 year old black lab and these are her favorite treats! They are the best for training, my dog will do just about anything to get one of these treats. Even my 3 month old black lab puppy goes running to his kennel when I tell him to go to bed because he knows that a liver treat is coming his way. Since they are sliced small a large container of these will last a while. The only complaint I have is that my dog loves these so much that if she knows shes getting one she starts to drool, and she's not a drooler... So I gotta toss one to her quick!!

review/summary: Like Candy for Your Dog
review/text: Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q">Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.<br /><br />Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love.

review/summary: Dogs, Cats, Ferrets all love this
review/text: I wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animals.<br />This is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all 4 legged beings in my home!<br />It does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain. Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.<br />It is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.<br />I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.<br />NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like.

Now that a month has passed by, she now knows: Sit, Stay, Down, Paw, & SPEAK! My bucket is almost empty as it only lasted for about a month but was worth every penny as ive read malamutes are very stubborn quite dogs. I gave some to my 2 poodles where they gobbled it down and were begging for more. These treats are highly recommended, plus the liver cubes can be further broken down into quadrants. A+++ product

review/summary: dogs LOVE it--  best treat for rewards and training
review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%

review/summary: Be careful! Dogs LOVE IT!
review/text: When you first give them out, be careful, you might just draw back a nub! Our oldest dog was very nonchalant about her treats. We just about had to beg her to eat them. NOT THESE. She went nuts over these and looked forward to them every night. The vet said I should give her liver to build her red blood cells up. It helped buy us a little longer with her I think. Now the other 2 dogs are addicted to them also! It is a HEALTHY treat that they love. They would eat the whole tub in one sitting if I would let them! It has no awful liver smell either!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: These liver treats are great for training. We adopted a German Shepherd puppy and have been using these to teach her basic commands. She goes bananas for these and learned very quickly even though she's a VERY stubborn pup. Since she's still small I cut the large cubes into thirds or quarters(she doesn't know and doesn't mind)to make our training sessions go further since it's recommended that you give only a few treats a day to avoid digestion problems. Also, compared to other liver treats on the market, this brand only uses 100% beef liver, no preservatives, fillers, or other stuff your dog doesn't need. The treats also keep indefinitely in the container if kept in a cool, dry place. The 21 oz. bucket is the most economical buy. We've had our pup 2+ months and the bucket is still mostly full. (Psst! - KV Pet Supply has the best online price- $24.99 for a 21oz. container) Highly recommended!

review/text: This is one product that my welsh terrier can eat. Sophie has food alergies so I have to be very careful in what I feed her. My other dog Oscar, also gets these treats and loves them. He has no food alergies. This product is just simple ingredients, no additives, and that is what my dogs need.

review/text: I have been feeding my greyhounds these treats for years.  My hounds can be a little finicky, but they love these treats.  They are expensive, relative to other biscuits, but I find they are a good addition to their diet.  The treats are easy on the teeth.  Since they are protein treat, be careful not to overindulge your pet on a regular basis.  They are great treats to take on walks as you can stuff them in your pocket easily.  I have found prices can vary from vendor to vendor, so shop around.

review/text: I use these as a training treat when I am working with my two dogs. My dogs were getting bored of the same ol' treats even though I tried to give them a wide variety. This one BY FAR is their favorite, and I like it because its all natural with no preservatives. Some of the pieces are pretty big, but easily broken with your finger nail. If you carry some around in your pocket like I do when I'm working with them, watch out - you will have the neighborhood dogs wanting a treat too.  :) The price here is quite good also. It is definitly worth a try!

review/summary: NO waste at all ----  great for training  ----  all dogs love liver treats
review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%

review/summary: Size inconsistent, needs water
review/text: My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first.

review/summary: Great for travel, but too expensive, too much prep
review/text: These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.<br /><br />I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze-dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently. But I figure if I have to prep something, it might as well be something cheap!

review/summary: Two paws up!
review/text: My dog goes bonkers for these treats! They seem to be crazy delicious. Some of the pieces are so small, Lulu doesn't have to chew them; she seems to swallow them whole. I wonder how she even tastes them! But she must, because she whines and acts like a obnoxious brat every time I go near the bucket.<br /><br />I like that the treats don't have any additives. They really stink, though, and the smell stays on your fingers. The smell and the price are the only downsides. Also, I wish the container said how many calories the treats have so I could compare them to other natural treats like Fruitables. The vet said Lulu is getting fat (to which I replied "Yo momma is fat!") and that we should start watching her calories.<br /><br />If you're curious about the consistency of the size of the pieces, please see the photos I posted. There's some variation in size, and when I tip the bucket, I see more crumbly pieces at the bottom, but I don't foresee Lulu turning her nose up at them!
