review/summary: Bizarre pricing.  Order the small cans..
review/text: The large cans are 8 cents an ounce MORE than the small ones.<br /><br />It's a great product.  It's definately in the top 10% of canned foods in terms of quality, most cats like it (there is no food all cats like), and this is a reasonably affordable way to mix some duck into the rotation rather than just feeding turkey and chicken over and over.<br /><br />But there's just no reason to mess with big cans when the smaller ones are so much cheaper by the ounce.  The little ones are more flexible and for most people you won't have to put leftovers in the fridge.<br /><br />If your particular feeding schedule makes these convenient for you...ignore me :)  I'm just talking about most people.

review/summary: Meow Mix Dry Cat Food
review/text: This is the dry food of choice for the two 'senior' cats that I own.  Works well for the 'Hairball Control'.  If the dry food runs out, you really notice how good it works.  I feed canned food in the morning and the dry food is available at all other times.  The two cats are now 11 years old, sleek and healthy.  Why change.  Amazon has the larger bags not generally available where I live.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: good for hairball control
review/text: I have a 15 year old gray short hair kitty who is prone vomiting hairballs.  Anyone who has been awakened at night with the sound of a cat throwing up a hairball or has found one staining their nice wood floor in the morning knows how annoying this can be. Not to mention how stressful for the poor cat.  The Meow Mix hairball formula seems to help a whole lot with her problem.  I've tried giving her a wide variety of other dry food, some supposedly very healthy and expensive, but I always go back to this product because it works.  I vary her diet with wet food twice a day and let her nibble on the dry food when she wants.  She looks terrific.  My other cat is 13 and eats the same diet, she is also very healthy.

I use this in every recipe I have that calls for soy and it the best base for teriyaki sauce I have found.

review/summary: Best Teriyaki Sauce and Easy Cooking
review/text: I'm originally from China but I don't really cook. This is the best teriyaki sauce I could find here in the US. Both my hubby (American) and my 7-year-old son love this. It's so easy - I usually use pork chops (am sure you can use other meat), just lightly fry the meat and add sauce to simmer (cover and turn heat to low). You'll have to simmer the meat for at least 20 minutes though. I got this from Costco but they don't carry this anymore. I'll have to order from Amazon now since I couldn't find anything better than this. Highly recommend to anyone who loves Chinese.

review/summary: With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
review/text: It should come as no surprise to anybody reading this review that bacon has a well deserved, and nearly cult like following.  Whether it be a highfalutin' cut of pancetta or some good ol' American pork belly bacon, that entire family of cured meats garners a lot of love.  It is with a heavy heart that I can not in good faith continue believing bacon makes everything better, for jerky has on this day sullied that Utopian meat dream.<br /><br />Generally as I approach a new food item I'm openly forgiving of its appearance based on the old adage of not judging a book by its cover.  Looking at this vacuum pressed mass of grease and what only vaguely represents bacon in a nearly cartoon like sense of thinking about it, the very foundation of my foodie philosophies faltered.  This stuff looks repulsive, there's really no kind or candy-coated way about it.  The meaty bits have the look of rancid meat and the generous slabs of fat look almost marshmallow-like.  To say it was an unapproachable off-shoot of bacon as you know it would be putting it kindly.<br /><br />The smell is about what you'd expect, oily aromas and heavy spicing.  This remains as possibly the least offensive attribute to this product short of the cheerful pig on the sticker attempting to assure you that nothing but porky bliss lie herein. Oh you jolly pig, your insidious smile will forever haunt me.<br /><br />Taste.  Taste can me a lot of things to a lot of people.  Some people swear there is a right and a wrong as to what makes food good but I have no qualms with somebody that prefers a McDouble to a juicy steakhouse burger.  Different strokes for different folks I say.  Alas the taste of this product, I have unequivocally deduced, is wrong by all standards.  Knowing full well some people love to eat bugs, gristle, brains, and all manner of foods one wouldn't suspect could be edible, let alone enjoyed, I find it impossibly difficult to imagine there could be a soul alive whom would find satisfaction in the experience that is Bacon Freak's Bacon Jerky.  The meat has the texture of marrow mixed with space ice cream and the fat goes down like one could imagine snacking on packing peanuts would be like.  Granted the texture alone could probably be saved in capable hands but the overwhelming blend of spices which I can only closely describe as being that of a gritty cut of smoked fish puts this experience to rest.<br /><br />At this juncture you'd hope for the end but bacon jerky likes to hang out a while and make itself at home in your mouth for substantial amount of time.  Almost worse than the initial undertaking is the trials and tribulations of aftertaste you will have to endure.  With a taste that floats between regurgitating brisket and a bad case of salad dressing acid reflux, you will beg for nothing short of the sweet release of death.  Attempting to wash the sin out of you mouth with a selection of beverages only added new layers of head-spinning nausea to what had already become the most regrettable thing I had eaten in living memory.<br /><br />Don't do it.  My fellow man/woman I can not wish this on another soul.  This gift will be laughed about but not loved.  As a personal challenge, or fulfillment of bacon loyalty, this will only leave you as a remorseful husk of a person who's perfect image of bacon will be besmirched.  Having read this should you choose to pass this on to an enemy then you are truly diabolical, a foe not to be meddled with in the future to be certain.  You have been warned.

review/summary: Great Cat Food For Those Kitties With A Sensitive Tummy
review/text: I used to feed both of my cats a different brand name cat food that was supposed to be for those kitties with sensitive tummies, and it was okay, but this Pinnacle cat food has the other brand beat hands down.<br /><br />We have been feeding our cats this food for about a year now and we have been having a lot fewer instances of upset tummies compared to the incidents we were having prior to switching over to this brand of cat food.<br /><br />Both of our cats love it even though only one of them has a sensitive tummy issue. Initially, it took a couple of weeks of mixing the old cat food with the new Pinnacle cat food and then slowly eliminated the old cat food until they were just eating the new Pinnacle cat food. Now my cat will stick his head in the bowl and eat a hole to the bottom before working his way around the edges of the bowl. Quite funny to watch actually! Ha Ha Ha<br /><br />My other cat is a strange one indeed, he will get a mouthful of food and then walk a couple of steps away from the bowl, drop the food onto the ground and the proceed to eat it from the ground. Not quite sure what is going on with that.<br /><br />Anyhow, I would highly recommend this brand of cat food for your kitty if he or she has a sensitive tummy. And don't worry about the price; it is an investment in the health of your furry four-legged children, as all of us good parents know. And if you haven't already purchased one of these for your kitty <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000L3XYZ4">Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain</a>, be sure and do so, it is the absolute best cat water fountain on the market at this time.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover

review/summary: Amazing food for cats with sensitive digestive system
review/text: My ten month old cat was switched from dry kitten food to dry adult food (Science Diet) He immediately developed bloody diahhrea. I took him to the vet. She gave him a clean bill of health and guessed it might be a dietary problem. I tried him on a few different brands of dry food,  most containing corn or brewer's rice and chicken. No Improvement in his condition. I then found Pinnacle dry cat food. I noticed no corn or rice in this food. I fed it to my cat and it was amazing. Within 12 hours his diahhrea was gone. If your cat has a sensitive system, I would strongly urge you to try the Pinnacle dry cat food. It is a bit expensive, but worth every penny for the health and well being of your cat.

review/text: We have two cats and we were feeding them with "Advanced Pet Diets Select Choice" food but unfortunately it was discontinued so we had to research for another great product. We were recommended this cat food by several people who know what the ingredients suppose to be in it and because this food is made by the same company so we expected same quality.When we got it and opened the bag we noticed different smell (not very pleasant ) and that this food is very dry( the old one was kinda oily ) and both cats didn't like it at all, sometime they don't even want to come and eat it even they are hungry. Now we will have to donate this food to the pet shelter but we learn the lesson, the only way to find the right food is not just by reading the ingredients but buying samples and give them to the pets.

review/text: I'm so impressed by Pinnacle that I'm trying out some of their wet food such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKFVC">Pinnacle Chicken & Tuna Formula Cat Food - 24 5.5-Ounce Cans</a>.  It's tough to evaluate the health of the food when I'm not a vet, but it seems to have decent ingredients: the first two ingredients are Chicken Meal and Chicken, versus Friskies where you have to go three ingredients in to get to chicken by-product meal, and way down the list to even get to something with the word "meat" in it (meat and bone meal).<br /><br />At least as importantly, my cats eat it.  I won't say that they love it the same way they love the Friskies: I can harass Purina for their ingredients, but I don't think anything healthy will really ever match Friskies for taste!  I guess it's sort of like hot dogs versus a chicken breast on whole wheat bread with low-fat mayonaisse.  But I'd rather keep my little kitties around for as long as I can, even if the food doesn't taste all that great.

review/text: This coffee touts itself as being "bold" and I would agree the flavor is rich and strong, but the coffee is also smooth and doesn't require cream to tone down the acidity - as Starbucks coffees often do.

A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)

review/summary: The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?
review/text: I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago.

And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Kitty Junk Food
review/text: We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.

Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.

It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: All By-Product & Corn -- Don't Waste Your Money!
review/text: I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>

review/summary: Good Pantry Staple - but it has it's limitations
review/text: When I was very young I tried using this exceedingly dry cheese to make a sauce and I don't advise it.  As I recall, it never did blend in smoothly and the result was rather grainy.  Small grains but grainy lumps nonetheless. (Poor hubby- lol).<br /><br />But as something to keep in the pantry or fridge to throw on top of spaghetti, garlic toast, a salad, or into meatloaf at the last minute, it's great.<br /><br />Three and a half Stars.  Kraft Parmesan Cheese has it's place in the kitchen.  Not so much as a source of Alfredo sauce, but rather as a condiment.<br /><br />Reasonably priced.  Long shelf life means you have a fall back position if your block Parmesan has gone too moldy.  Unlike some brands there are no `fillers'.  Only two preservatives; one to preserve flavor, the other to prevent caking.

review/summary: Very Good Parmesan for Addition to Pasta, Salad or Pizza
review/text: Parmesan cheese has been a favorite of mine since I was a small child.  The first parmesan cheese I tried, and my long-time favorite, remains Kraft parmesan cheese.  While freshly grated parmesan cheese from a deli can have a better flavor, given that many of us do not have access to such a deli, Kraft parmesan is a very good general purpose parmesan cheese.<br /><br />Parmesan cheese is one of the oldest of Italian cheeses, developed, surprise, in the town of Parma.  Kraft grated parmesan cheese was first introduced in 1945, and remains a consumer favorite.<br /><br />When Kraft parmesan is first opened, the smell somehow makes you feel a slight bite and also makes your mouth water.  The taste Kraft parmesan brings to sphaghetti, pizza, salad, or any other suitable food is wonderful, adding a tang that makes the food flavor more interesting.  I strongly recommend that you try to keep this cheese as short a period of time as possible to keep it as fresh as possible.  By doing so, you will enjoy Kraft parmesan each time you use it.

review/summary: A Different Perspective
review/text: In reading the three reviews written thus far, I more fully appreciate the reasons why voters of the United States elected George W. Bush to serve a second term as President of their country.<br /><br />We like what is familar and often lack exposure to options and the set of skills needed to guide us in developing discriminating taste.  Nostalgia governs our feelings about food.  When I was growing up cheese-like particles in cardboard cylinders were the only alternative to orange squares of individually wrapped processed cheese.  Thus, I was content to shake the stuff on top of my bowls of Campbell's soup.  Life was fine.  Even better when the surface where the powdery substance fell was pizza or spaghetti.  It offered an interesting textural contrast and proved a relatively inexpensive source for sodium.<br /><br />Then as I grew up and the world changed along with me.  I met people who spoke different languages and visited and lived in their countries.  I learned the difference between the processed and highly industrialized foods I grew up eating and the kinds of fresh produce I could find on a market street in France or a piazza in front of a church in Italy.  After becoming comfortable inside foreign supermarkets, I explored small cheese shops, bakeries, charcuteries and butcher's stores.  Back home, brave, determined souls with more vision than I began businesses, farms and urban markets that translated what is good about European artisanal foods and farms into American terms.  Immigrants from around the world also enriched our culinary lives by bringing their beloved traditions here.<br /><br />However good a goat cheese from Vermont can be, it is not the same as a living chevre from a small region in France.  Even if Kraft were interested in making that kind cheese, the size of the corporation prohibits such a process.  Nor  could it ever reproduce the exquisite character of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  The craft of making this regional cheese from Parma has been refined over centuries by a consortium of cheese makers.  It depends upon great skill.  Cows eat grass and breathe different air, factors that contribute to the kind of milk they produce.  That milk becomes enormous wheels that are aged for a minimum of two years, preferably three, until pale crystals form in the golden surface that cracks unevenly as a trained cheese monger thrusts a pick into a newly opened cheese.  The taste is pronounced rather than sharp to the tongue, buttery, sweet yet mellow, nutty and utterly one of the best things one might ever experience in life.<br /><br />I urge you to take advantage of the fact that you are able to buy authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano imported from Parma, Italy these days. Look for the words "PARMIGIANO REGGIANO" perforated on the surface of the rind in black dots with a red insignia.  These are signs that you are getting the real thing.  It's not inexpensive, but then again, it isn't cheap either.  Price is a lot less than the bill for a new flat-screen TV.<br /><br />Serve it in small chunks, room temperature, with ripe fresh pears or grated on top of your favorite dishes where it actually melts.  Let Kraft continue to corrupt American culture and prepare our country's citizens for years of obesity, mediocrity and high dental bills.  You, on the other hand, can lead a better life without the shiny little green cylinder of cheese-like  processed goods.

Drop in 5 tea bags and steep for 5 minutes (don't let it go much beyond 5 minutes, or it can get bitter). I drop that in a 2 QT pitcher and fill up the rest with filtered tap water and let sit in the fridge for a couple hours before drinking.<br /><br />I am sure there are better ways of brewing iced tea out of this, but it was the first thing I tried and it worked out quite well for me and continued to do it. I will definitely purchase this over and over again. Much healthier and better than drinking sugary soft drinks with empty calories and yes, even fruit juices (even the natural kinds without artificial chemicals and corn syrup, etc) as those are just high quantities of sugar regardless.

review/summary: Great way to enjoy in bulk - Cranberry Pomegranate
review/text: The Cranberry Pomegranate herbal tea from Stash is one of my favorites, but this flavor is not always readily available where I live.  I was happy to find this bulk supply here on Amazon.  Instead of being packed in the standard 18-count boxes that are sold in stores, this item is packaged as a dozen individually wrapped packs of 10 tea bags in a specific flavor.  Each tea bag is sealed in its own flavor-saving pouch, just like the retail packaging, but this bulk version takes up much less space in your cabinet, while still keeping each tea bag fresh until use.  Buying in bulk like this is a great way to stock up on a favorite flavor while saving a little bit of money.  The tea itself is full flavored; a perfect selection for those who enjoy fruit-flavored herbal (and caffeine free) teas.

review/summary: Amazing, Affordable and Wonderful to Cook With!
review/text: As stated in another review, I've been an Amazon shopper for years yet never bought groceries online until recently. The cost for specialty foods in stores (if you can find them at all) is outrageous these days. Only one chain store in my town sells julienne-cut sun dried tomatoes; the packages are the same size as these from Bella Sun, but they sell for about $4 per package. This year to cut costs, I'm making gifts from my kitchen as well as homemade "Gourmet Gift Baskets/Bags".<br /><br />The Bella Sun brand of Sun Dried Tomatoes Julienne-Cut is far superior to the $4 per package brand in the store. These are tender enough to toss onto salads or pizza, are great in homemade bread and cook up beautifully! The flavor is superb!<br /><br />I made 6 half-pint jars of homemade sun dried tomato marinara using 1 cup each diced onion & celery sauteed in olive oil, 3 cloves minced garlic, one 3.5 ounce package of these sun dried tomatoes, 1/2 cup red wine, 1/2 cup water, 2 cups tomato sauce and herbs. Simmered it all until the tomato strips were mushy, pureed in the blender, returned to the pot, stirred in some tomato juice and brought it back to a boil before canning. The resulting marinara is amazing! We're talking serious tomato taste with excellent color and texture... perfect tossed with cooked pasta or as a pizza sauce.<br /><br />In fact, you can assemble your own "Gourmet Gift Baskets" by pairing one 3.5 ounce bag of Bella Sun brand Sun Dried Tomatoes Julienne-Cut with pizza dough mix, dried mushrooms, fresh cheese of your choice, herbs and perhaps a tiny bottle of olive oil.

review/summary: Finally, Tasty Dried Tomatoes!
review/text: I have tried all kinds of dried tomatoes, and had concluded that people who like them must be crazy.  That's because I never found any that were any good.  They were always some combination of hard, dry, flavorless, rubbery, fermented or burnt.<br /><br />I felt like I was taking a chance on ordering these, but huzzah!  These are awesome.<br /><br />Most shocking to me is that these have a real, fresh, and flavorful tomato taste; as if I myself pulled them from the garden and dried them at home.  They actually taste better than the typical fresh tomatoes available in grocery stores.<br /><br />The texture is great too.  It's not brittle, rubbery or mushy.  They are essentially just like any dried fruit - flexible, moist, but condensed.  They are pleasant to eat not only in flavor, but in the texture and the bite feel.  They have a great appetizing scent too.<br /><br />Each bag is a convenient size in terms of amount, and is resealable.  So you can easily throw a handful into pretty much anything to its great improvement.<br /><br />I will definitely always keep these on hand.

review/summary: Great For Quick Dinners
review/text: As so many people, I appreciate a dinner that can be made quickly, but value it even more if it is healthy.  These sun dried tomatoes are perfect for tossing on a salad or adding to a pasta or couscous dish.  The fact that they are pre-cut saves me time and allows me to mix them in with pesto even faster. They are also better than the oil packed sun dried tomatoes that are commonly found in grocery stores.  While I likely will not go through 6 packages too quickly, the convenience and price of these cannot be beat. They are tasty and easily rehydrate if soaked in warm water for a moment or two.  Also, the packages are a smaller size, so the tomatoes stay fresher than when purchased in bulk.

It tastes very nutty instead of sickeningly sweet.  I love the chunky too!  The only thing I don't like is that amazon sells 6 of them for $29.99 PLUS $13.99 shipping when one of them cost me only $4.99 at Whole Foods!  Let's see- if I buy it at whole foods that's a savings of $13.99 in shipping costs!  I think i'll continue to buy it at Whole Foods until Amazon brings its price down.  The products is really good though.

review/summary: best peanut butter substitute
review/text: My husband is allergic to peanuts and this soybutter is the best substitute we have ever tried.  We have tried almond butter, cashew butter, and sunflower seed butter but they both have a lot of oil and separate and have to be refrigerated after you stir it to keep it together.<br />I M Healthy does NOT have to be refrigerated or stired to mix the oil.  It is already all mixed and you can keep it on the shelf and not have to stir it every time you open it.  PLUS, the taste is wonderful and tastes so good - you cannot tell you are not eating peanut butter.  AND,BEST of all, as I am diabetic, it is unsweetened.  Other peanut butters, almond butter,cashew butter,  and sunflower seed butter have too much sugar in them.<br /><br />SPROUTS GROCERY stopped carrying this but found it at AMAZON.com

review/summary: This variety is sweeter than the "regular" version
review/text: Our school is "peanut free".  So I was desperate to find an alternative to PB & J. The regular soynut butter (blue cap) was really untasty, though I could get my daughter to eat it in a pinch if I paired it with something really sweet like honey or "fluff".  But then I found this "creamy" version (green cap) on Amazon.  I don't know why but it is much sweeter and tastier.  I even enjoy it as a dip with pretzels.  It does have some separation over time so you have to carefully stir it if you haven't used it for a few days.  But it is a great alternative to peanut butter.

review/summary: You'll never know the difference
review/text: My son has peanut allergies, so it was bye-bye peanut butter. We first came across another brand of soynut butter at a health food store and thought it was an OK alternative, but we like the I.M. Healthy varieties much better--less separation, more peanut-buttery texture, and excellent flavor. My wife is partial to the crunchy variety, but to me the soynuts don't quite have the same texture as peanut butter. My kids and I love this creamy variety--it's really hard to tell the difference from peanut butter. We haven't tried the sweetened variety, but I can't imagine a need for it, since this tastes fine. I highly recommend it!

If you go to the manufacture's site (do a google search for I.M. Healthy) you can get free shipping if you buy enough jars. The shelf life unopened is 2 years so that is a better deal for me. Sorry that I can't buy it on Amazon any longer because i like to pay by check.

review/text: I was after that "overpriced stadium nachos" taste and nothing I could find in stores was the right kind of cheese sauce. This stuff is it. Granted, I wanted plain cheese, and this actually has a slight jalapeno flavor, but that's okay. It's still really good. The pouches it comes in are a little annoying and I'm docking a star for that. If they were at least resealable, it would help tremendously. Unless you're using all of it at once, the pouches make storage a little awkward. Otherwise, perfect!

review/summary: Not "Knock-Your-Socks-Off" Hot, But Spicy, Versatile & FULL of Flavor!
review/text: First off, can I say that I LOVE Nando's? It's a peri-peri restaurant chain that has many branches worldwide and which I know and love as a favorite standby from the UK, but which has only a couple of branches in the US. Neither of those branches are within even a thousand miles of my home in Ohio, so my Nando's fixes are very few and far between. I love that their peri-peri sauces are available in the US, and buy them whenever I can as an all-purpose condiment to serve with anything and everything that could do with a bit of spicing up.<br /><br />Secondly... while I LOVE these sauces, even the "extra hot" version doesn't even begin to come close to some of the sauces that real chili-heads will be used to, i.e. the ones that rate so high on the Scoville scale that you're advised to only add them to your food one minuscule drip at a time. Nando's sauces are more of the "slosh generously all over your plate" variety if you have any kind of a taste and tolerance for the burny stuff, and I tend to use it more like ketchup than a genuine "hot" sauce. That's not meant as an insult to the sauces, though - don't get me wrong, I really do love them, but I get through a whole lot more of this stuff than I do the dangerously hot sauces I buy almost entirely for the burn. Nando's peri-peri sauces are just not like that; they're meant to be enjoyed for their complex flavor rather than as a challenge, so please don't buy a bottle of this stuff expecting to have your head blown off with a single taste.<br /><br />I love the Nando's Extra Hot and Hot sauces as a dip for fries and anything else that requires dunking, and it is also a firm favorite in my household when mixed liberally with a bit of mayo and/or sour cream for a spicy dipping sauce that works well with appetizers of all kinds. It works really well as a marinade for chicken, too - definitely one to try when you're grilling out.<br /><br />My only "problem" (and it's not really a problem, as such) is that I get through these little bottles far too quickly. Anyone who's ever been to a Nando's restaurant will know that customers can take as many HUGE bottles (I mean, containing maybe 2-3 pints) of peri-peri sauce in any and every strength and flavor variation back to their table to apply as freely to their meal as they wish. When I try that at home I find I've emptied a $5 bottle of sauce before I know it. I just wish they'd start making it available in stores in industrial-sized bottles for dedicated Nando-lovers such as myself!<br /><br />Finally, if you ever find yourself in a city that has a Nando's restaurant, I'd heartily recommend that you go along and try it out. Order some peri-peri chicken to suit your own personal chili tolerance level, a Portuguese or Brazilian beer and (my personal favorite) a bowl of their spicy mixed nuts to munch on while you wait for your order (these are SERIOUSLY hot and I love them so very, very much) and, well... enjoy! :)

review/text: I wanted to love this coffee. I wanted to want to drink it all day long. But, it's not meant to be.<br /><br />The raspberry flavor is incredibly cloying--so strong that the actual taste of coffee is lost. I almost always have to cut this coffee with a plain coffee (I use about an 8th of this coffee to non-flavored coffee to just get a hint of raspberry and chocolate).<br /><br />If you love raspberry flavor (which I do), just be warned that this may be too powerful even for the staunchest raspberry connoisseur. Exercise caution--or at least just buy 1 bag at first, instead of 4 (like me).

review/summary: Don't waste your time
review/text: I had high hopes for this product to be delicious.  The thought of having "fresh" pork rinds was intriguing until half of the rinds did not develop in the microwave.  Only about half of the product produced decent pork rinds, and the cinnamon flavor could not be detected.  I made sure not to crowd the uncooked rinds on the plate and still had poor quality.  The popped rinds should be eaten quickly as they harden a little more after cooking.  I will continue to purchase rinds that are "done" already.

review/text: My puppy loves these vitality treats. After reading the other two reviews I became concerned and quickly e-mailed the company with my concerns. Here is what they replied to me which immediately relieved my worries. They also sent me documentation of their checks on the products and pictures of the non-caged chickens.<br /><br />ello Karen,<br /><br />Thank You for contacting us here at DOGSWELL�.<br /><br />The DOGSWELL� manufacturing facilities meet the highest and most strict sanitary conditions.

review/summary: DO NOT PURCHASE THESE STRIPS IF YOU WISH TO KEEP YOUR DOG ALIVE!!!
review/text: BUYER BEWARE! This caused severe intestinal bleeding and an inflamed stomach lining in two of my toy poodles who had to be taken emergency, to my nearest animal hospital! The vet bill cost me $1,200 for a $25 6 pack of death strips! I have the remaining 5 packs that are sealed and was going to return them to amazon, but they don't accept edibles..<br /><br />I always buy Mellow Mut and wanted to give these a try. I don't know what possessed me to switch, but I'm so sorry I did!!! They seemed a bit rough, like an old piece of leather, very coarse, not the usual kind of texture my dogs have been used to. I didn't think much of it at first, because they eat these types of treats all the time and they are supposed to be the ''nautral choice'' only healthful, not harmful! But, I never knew the damage they would cost my dogs. They began to become very listless after digestion, severe bloody vomit and explosive, watery diarrhea with blood followed, almost to the point of shock!!! I just got home from a long night at the hospital with them and they are in a very delicate state and still not in the clear. I have to return with them if the vomiting continues for futher investagation!<br /><br />I don't know what to expect in the next couple of hours! They are on very strong medications and must follow a very bland diet for three weeks that is, if no more complications arise! I pray my babies make a full recovery! I urged amazon to pull these off the website, before this tragedy occurs with another innocent life! They are poison for dogs, maybe this batch was just the contaminated one? Either way, you don't want to take that chance with your beloved pooch! Please stay away! I don't even care if I lost my money on this order, you can't put a price on your best friend! I just want everyone's dogs to be safe! Vitality brand dog strips are toxic!!!!<br /><br />P.S. I just found out Mellow Mut and Vitality dog chews are made in China and manufactured by the same company Dogswell! I will never EVER purchase their products again! I'm reporting them to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration!

It's the one treat I can always get them to do their tricks for! I used to get them at a dog shop in a town over an hour away.

Be careful what you give your best friend, he trusts you. Now I am not one to want to hurt a companies products by bad mouthing them but I am not happy that I gave my dog chicken products from China, maybe by accident, I didn't see the small print (and it is VERY small print), as yourself the question too, if they made the words 'Made in China' bigger and on the front, would anyone buy this? If I am proven to be wrong I will be fair and remove this review but my Vitality chicken strips have the words 'MADE IN CHINA' in tiny print on the back.

review/summary: I gotta admit, these are great.
review/text: I first came across these while buying a variety of treats and toys for my new Australian Shepherd puppy. The lack of fillers and bad stuff, and very simple (essentials only) ingredients list was impressive.<br /><br />My dog loves these, and they have been very helpful for training purposes. As soon as he hears me open the bag, he comes and sits and waits in anticipation.<br /><br />They are slightly dry, which may account for some slight constipation, but like anything, treats should be given in small quantities and in moderation.<br /><br />My only real disappointment with these treats (and this apparently applies to all treats made by this company) is that they are made in China. While this isn't necessarily everything, if it were not for the great bullet point list of qualities these treats have, I would be looking for a US-manufactured product.<br /><br />It is my understanding (based on statements by Dogswell) that their China-based facilities are highly inspected, etc.  Hopefully, this is true, but there's no real way to know without flying to China to take a look.<br /><br />Either way, if Dogswell were to move its<br />Manufacturing to the US, and keep or even improve its standards, I would give these treats a 5+ rating, as the concept is really great, and my puppy loves them.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company will consider doing this soon.

review/summary: Great Treats
review/text: At first, I was very hesitant to buy this treat for our dogs. I was expecting these to be hard, because they look very similar to the one I usually buy from PetSmart. The "hard" treat I'm used to break up in to tiny sharp pieces, and sometime choked our dogs making them cough up.<br /><br />However, I took a leap of faith based on the great reviews on Amazon and bought the Chicken Breast flavor.<br /><br />To my surprise, they were soft, and easy to bend and tear apart. The dogs seems to love them, and I was able to cut up 1 strip in to smaller bit-size to use them as a training incentive.<br /><br />They will do anything for this treat, so it's a great product to our dogs motivated to do tricks for treats.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: These treats are an absolute MUST for my dogs. They would probably stop eating dog food if I gave them more of these, but one nice aspect of these treats is it tells you on the back how many they can have (by dog's weight) daily. My two toy poodles will do just about anything, including chewing the bag open for me, to get these. Except, maybe, eating their dog food dinner first. Dogswell has these treats for vitality, but it  also has these treats for arthritis and other problems too. And besides chicken, they also have duck breast, which my dogs are crazy about. It's so convenient to get them thru Amazon, too.

review/summary: 4.5 Stars: Healthy Treat with noticable benefits
review/text: I bought Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for my finicky Boston Terrier after visiting my mom's and she gave him a dried chicken meat treat which he devoured. But I didn't like how brittle and hard the jerky treat was and made me concerned about him choking on it, even after breaking them into bite size pieces. I found Dogswell Vitality for Dogs at Target and gave it try after feeling through the bag that it wasn't as hard as the other dried meat treats with a slight bendable feel to it plus the disclaimer that the flaxseed and vitamins included helped dog's healthy eyes, skin and coat. The reason the disclaimer appealed to me is my dog has dry, flaky skin and occasionally gets dry patches.<br /><br />I have tried all types of shampoos, both prescribed by the vet and store bought, even RX fish oil pills from my vet, which I disliked giving my dog because I don't like putting pill in mouth daily since I couldn't trick him by putting it on his food. I can say none of them worked near as well as Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast for his skin problems.<br /><br />I've been given my dog, who weighs approx. 18 lbs., two to three strips a day broken into bite size pieces for nearly two months now. After about two weeks, I noticed the flaky dry skin scales weren't as noticeable and now it's barely noticeable at all. When I noticed the difference at two weeks I started ordering Dogswell Vitality for Dogs Chicken Breast through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program because I knew this treat was going to be a regular part of my dog's daily meal plan going forward and the program helps cut the cost of these expensive dog treats.<br /><br />I do recommend in an additional to this treats zip bag, putting the treats in a second ziploc type bag to help keep the jerky strips from drying out further and loosing it small bit of moisture. I have found this keeps the jerky strips as moist as when you first open the bag. And even though these jerky treats aren't as brittle and hard as it's competitors, they are still brittle enough that I feel I need to break them into bite size pieces for my dog.

review/text: From :[..]<br />FDA issues health warning to veterinarians, pet owners about chicken jerky products from China<br />Nov 21, 2011<br />DVM NEWSMAGAZINE<br /><br />Rockville, Md. -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning to veterinarians and pet owners about chicken jerky products imported from China, after seeing an increase in dog illnesses over the last 12 months.<br /><br />The illnesses, attributed to consumption of chicken jerky products from China--also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats--were reported to FDA by both veterinarians and pet owners.<br /><br />FDA first issued a cautionary warning about chicken jerky products in September 2007, and again in December 2008. Complaints dropped off in late 2009 and for most of 2010, FDA says, but the agency is once again seeing a rise in cases.<br /><br />The agency is advising consumers who feed their dogs chicken-jerky products to watch for these clinical signs:<br /><br />* decreased appetite,<br /><br />* decreased activity,<br /><br />* vomiting,<br /><br />* diarrhea (sometimes with blood),<br /><br />* increased water consumption,<br /><br />* and/or increased urination.<br /><br />If the dog shows any of these signs, FDA says pet owners should stop feeding the chicken-jerky product. Pet owners should also consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours, FDA says.<br /><br />Blood tests may indicate kidney failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs appear to recover, some adverse event reports have involved mortality.<br /><br />FDA says it is working with several animal health diagnostic laboratories to determine why the products are causing illness. Despite extensive chemical and microbial testing, FDA adds it has not been able to identify a contaminant yet.<br /><br />FDA is also asking veterinarians to report cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their state or Click here<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've been awarding this "Chicken Breast, Flaxseed & Vitamins" strip of chicken jerky to my 25 pound mixed breed dog for over a year without any problem. In fact, this is her favorite dog food treat, valued almost as high as freshly cooked chicken or sliced Swiss cheese. The instructions say she can have up to two a day and if it were up to her, she would happily devour the entire bag (including much of the packaging).

review/summary: FDA says pet death toll from jerky treats now at 360
review/text: Dogswell jerky treat come China.  They are not safe.  I've had a subscribe and save subscription for the product, but I've calcelled after reading this story from September 15, 2012.  (Just search for the article's title, which is the same as my review.)<br />----<br />The FDA now says 350 dogs and one cat have died in the last 18 months, reportedly after eating chicken jerky treats made in China.<br /><br />An FDA report released this week says they've received 2,200 reports of illnesses linked to the treats - the deaths are included in that number. There is no geographic pattern to the illnesses and deaths - cases have been reported from all 50 states and 6 Canadian provinces.<br /><br />The FDA says the majority of complaints involve chicken jerky (treats, tenders, and strips), but others include duck, sweet potato, and treats where chicken or duck jerky is wrapped around dried fruits, sweet potatoes, or yams.<br /><br />The report goes on to say that in the past 10 years, there has been a dramatic increase in importation of pet food from China. It is estimated that nearly 86 million pounds of pet food came from China in 2011. Pet treats, including jerky pet treats, are currently considered the fastest growing segment in the pet food market.<br /><br />The FDA has been investigating the reports of illnesses, but no definitive cause has been determined.<br /><br />"The ongoing global investigation is complex, multifaceted and includes a wide variety of experts at the FDA including toxicologists, epidemiologists, veterinary researchers, forensic chemists, microbiologists, field investigators and senior agency officials," the report says.<br /><br />The FDA says product samples have been tested for contaminants known to cause the symptoms and illnesses reported in pets, and they are now expanding testing to include irradiation byproducts and they are consulting with NASA experts about it.<br /><br />In their report, the FDA says jerky treats are not necessary for pets to have a balanced diet - basically advising people not to feed them to their pets. But if you choose to give your pet the treats,  watch them closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination.

review/summary: Dogs FAVORITE treats - stinks that they are sourced from China!
review/text: Far and away these are my dogs favorite treats - and I've always liked the fact that it's really just pure jerky with a few added beneficial ingredients. She really loves the "Duck" Happy Hips the most for whatever reason, but she also likes the Chicken Vitality Treats and sometimes the Chicken Happy Hips.<br /><br /> She started eating these intially (when I first brought her home) because my local Safeway used to sell them at a decent price buy one, get one free. I would stockpile like crazy whenever they went on sale and as she got pickier and pickier as she got healthier these remained one of the few treats she would eat.<br /><br />Unfortunately I know that "free range" chicken (or duck, or any poultry, really) doesn't mean a thing as the requirements for a farm to be called free range are not stringent at all. Pretty much they will pile them up on top of each other but so long as they can "touch the ground" (not in cages) it's "free range." (Ugh, now I remember why I've been a vegetarian for 15+ years....)<br /><br />I have heard of a number of issues with the jerky chicken treats sourced from China and I keep closely monitoring her for any changes; in the interim I limit the amount of treats she gets anyway and the air dried raw food she eats is sourced from New Zealand. Hopefully I will eventually be able to find something to replace these with, but until then I'm fairly confident about them.<br /><br />After all, I feel better feeding these even if they ARE sourced from China because they are (at least) not irridiated and I feel better feeding these than the biscuit-style treats that have little nutriotional value.<br /><br />Unfortunately my Safeways finally stopped their buy-1 get-1 sales and raised their prices accordingly so I started orderign online via Amazon. I'm cautious whenever I open a new package of ANY kind of treats so I really like the fact that I now buy the larger packages for "bulk" discounts. It means I am using the same bags longer.<br /><br />Of course not all treats are for all dogs, and if I was starting from scratch I'd probably avoid feeding her these. (I really like Jones Natural Chews and would love to try their USA-sourced jerky) However, considering I'm on a very tight budget at the moment and she is picky beyond belief I have to made do.
