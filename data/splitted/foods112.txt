review/summary: BOMB.
review/text: These are amazing. I bought them after having the stomach flu all day, and they tasted like the best thing I've ever eaten- not only because my body was starving, but also because they are absolutely DELICIOUSS!!!!!!!!!!! I bought some more crackers when I didn't have the stomach flu and they were just as awesome the second time. They should call these "crackers of magic" they look plain and tasteless, but they are anything but that. WOO! love em.

review/summary: Glutino crackers are tops for gluten free.
review/text: Glutino gluten free crackers are probably the closest thing you can get to Ritz or club-like crackers. These crackers are crisp without feeling stale and have a nice crunch that I miss with regular crackers. The flavor is decent, I never ate crackers alone and I still don't, I judge the taste more on how well it pairs with dips, spreads and cheese. The flavor it subtle enough that you can put virtually anything on top. Be warned they get stale very quickly so keep them in a zip-lock bag even if they are in the box. The price of course is another downside but just like all other gluten free foods, I have developed an aversion to over-priced gluten free products.

review/summary: I love all three flavors!
review/text: I love these crackers and even serve them to non Gluten Free eaters with great success.  The multi-grain crackers have fennel seeds in them so if you don't like the taste of fennel be sure you get one of the other two flavors.  The original flavor tastes like a cross between a saltine and a ritz cracker and those were my two favorite crackers before I found out I couldn't have gluten.

review/summary: Great crackers!
review/text: I was a little hesitant to try these because I tried another glutino product & hated it. I bought one box of these in one of the local stores to try it & they were great. In fact the last two days I've had little cracker sandwiches for lunch. They're not as good as saltines or ritz but honestly when you pile all the goodies on them you can't really tell. I also tried the suggestion on the box of putting a slice of banana, honey & cinnamon on the cracker & omg! heaven!

review/summary: LOVE these crackers!!!
review/text: I LOVE Glutino's crackers.  I am gluten intolerant, so I cannot have gluten or wheat.  I never really missed crackers, but after I tasted these at my natural health food store during a tasting they were having - WOW!!!  They are AMAZING and I was hooked.  I also love their vegetable flavor.  I have never tried the cheddar as I cannot have dairy, but I'm sure they are good too.<br /><br />The only problems I have with the crackers are the high saturated fat content and the price.  Of course, with any gluten free item, they are a bit pricey, but that's to be expected, unfortunately.  But they really don't give you a lot in the box for the price.<br /><br />I saw the 'saltine' or 'table' cracker version of Glutino's the other day at my health food store and I was going to get them because I've been wanting 'saltine' type crackers for my soup, but the saturated fat content was really high!!!  Three grams of saturated fat for just THREE crackers.  Ridiculous!!!  Of course, some people don't care about the nutritional/health facts pertaining to the food they eat, but I do... and I would NOT get these because of that.  But the other crackers are really GOOD and the saturated fat content isn't too high.  Still not the greatest, but because they are so delicious, I've made an exception for them.

review/text: These crackers are the best I've tried so far.  If I didn't have celiac's disease, I'd buy a non-gluten-free cracker, but am very pleased with the consistency (softer than others I've tasted) of this gluten free cracker and it doesn't have that "peppery" taste that most others have.  They're great in soup or with peanut butter or cheese as a snack.

review/text: We've spend way too much money buying boxes of crackers only to find out they taste like crumbly cardboard, but once we finally tried these we knew our search was over. My wife loves these crackers and often eats them with peanut butter, Nutella, hummus or tuna fish. They do somewhat resemble Ritz crackers, but noticeably less salty. We've had pretty good luck with this Glutino brand in general and you definitely won't go wrong with these crackers.

review/summary: Wonderful crackers
review/text: One my standards for judging a gluten free item is that I can serve it at a party and my gluten-eating guests enjoy it.  These crackers reach that standard.  I have served these crackers several times to a gluten-eating crowd and there has always been at least one guest who unsuspectingly eats them, then at some point remembers that I am gluten intolerant, and comes over to me and asks, "These are gluten free?  Really?"<br />This is so predictable and it tickles me every time.  The only giveaway that they are gluten free is that the word "Glutino" is pressed on each and every cracker.  I would prefer maybe an elegant cursive "g" on the cracker because I don't think "Glutino" sounds particularly appetizing but that is just my humble opinion.<br /><br />I would compare these crackers to the no-salt saltine crackers I used to eat years ago.  They are not quite as crunchy, but they still have crunch.  They are plain but that's why I buy them.  I serve them with different cheeses, hummus, tapenades and smoked trout dip.  I generally don't want anything but a plain cracker for these purposes.<br /><br />I have also crushed these up and used them successfully in place of dry bread crumbs or panko crumbs.<br /><br />The only down side to this product is that there can be more than a few broken crackers in each box.  I would buy an extra box if you are using these for a party and food presentation is an issue.<br /><br />So many of the good gluten free items are quite expensive and these crackers are no exception.  I have learned to eat less and appreciate everything more.

review/summary: Better than most GF crackers
review/text: This is the closest thing I have found to a "water cracker" that's gluten free. There isn't any seasoning that would detract from or clash with whatever you put on this cracker, but for that same reason it doesn't really work well as a stand-alone, unless you just prefer a bland cracker. It's not at all salty. Texture...well, it breaks a little too easily, and when you chew it, it feels more powdery in your mouth than what you'd probably think of for a cracker, but it's not bad.  Of the Glutino crackers, we like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CWSK98">Glutino Gluten Free Multigrain Crackers, 4.4 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> best, because the fennel in the multigrain gives it a little more texture and taste.<br /><br />This is the only brand of GF cracker that my gluten-eating family will eat, other than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00250HYA2">Sesmark Ancient Grains Chips With Parmesan Herb, 3.5 Ounce Bags (pack of 12)[Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ET93N2">Sesmark Savory Thins, Original, 3.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)[Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] -- but Sesmark isn't marketed as GF, just as "no gluten ingredients." (I'm Celiac and never have reacted to Sesmark, but YMMV.)

review/text: These are the best glutin free ritz-like crackers...but that's not exactly a praise.  The cheese are not not bad, but the plain ones taste like egg.  A lot of gluten-free breads and crackers use egg as the lacking "glue"...and you can always taste it.  Yuck! All of that being said, the plain ones are ok when made into peanut butter sandwiches and all of the crackers are pretty good with a dip or chicken/tuna salad...sigh.

review/summary: Really great and fulfills cracker urges
review/text: From my wife Sarah: Being fairly new to the gluten free diet, I was happy to find a cracker that satisfies those cracker cravings. While they're not as light or buttery as ritz crackers, they're flavorful and crunchy. I eat them with a variety of toppings and these crackers compliment anything I put them with.<br /><br />I do wish there were more crackers in the box. There are two separate foil bags in each box, which is great for maintaining freshness. However for the size of the box, there are less crackers than you'd expect. When you buy alternative health oriented foods, this is often the case so it's not unusual.<br /><br />With the fine taste and texture, I'd certainly recommend these crackers!

review/summary: So-so....
review/text: One of the things I've really missed since going gluten-free are good crackers.  I've tried several brands.  None of them quite stack up to the real thing.  The Glutino crackers are slightly...soft.  They just don't have the crispness of regular crackers.  The flavors are okay, but, one thing that aggravates me most is that after paying A LOT of money for what looks like a substantial-sized box, one finds a pouch inside that contains very few crackers.  This deception seems to be rampant among most of the gluten-free cracker brands! (ie: Nut-Thins).  The best gluten-free crackers I've found so far are the brown rice crackers that come in a cellophane "log"...at least you can see what you're getting for the money and they are crisp!  When I am desperate for something to put a slice of cheese or some dip or spread or whatever on, I'll slice a cucumber and use the cucumber slices as a cracker (a trick from my low-carb days).  If anyone out there has some suggestions for a really good gluten-free cracker that doesn't cost a fortune for a small pouch...I'd love to know about it!

I don't eat eggs at all, so I imagine I was particularly sensitive to the flavor of egg in a cracker, but it seemed concentrated to me. I don't expect an eggy taste to a cracker, just buttery. It is strange that Glutino can sell pretzels that are better than the wheat based kind, and have these crackers taste so awful. I guess they work for some people, just really weren't for me.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: We have been looking for a cracker for our daughter whom we have just put on the GFCF diet. The Glutino cracker is about as close to a "normal" cracker that we have come across. The rest of us who are not on the diet even think these are good. They have a yummy buttery and salty taste to them. We bought them here on amazon.com in a case of 6 boxes for $24. Very reasonable. Highly recommend to anyone on the GFCF diet who misses their crackers. Makes a nice snack to pack in the car for road trips or flights.

review/summary: Precious rose buds for sachets, teas and decor
review/text: These rose buds from Catey13 are precious. They have a soft aroma and a pretty look to them. I plan to use them for small sachets in the bags I bought from catey13, and use rose-colored ribbon to adorn the bags. I'm so glad this seller. I bought several things from her and she gave me a refund on the combined shipping costs.

review/summary: Not easy on our dog's digestion
review/text: Based on our experience I would give this product 1 star, but I concede that our dog's reaction may not be typical.<br /><br />We gave our dog one of these early in the evening.  He's a mid-sized dog at about 35 lbs, but he's also a strong chewer.  Based on what I could tell from the package, though, I had no reason to believe I should buy the larger size.  We were in the room and casually observed him as he chewed on it.  Our dog had the whole thing eaten within an hour.<br /><br />He seemed fine and the next morning his bathroom routine was completely normal.  However, when we got home from work, it was clear that the poor guy had been struggling not to have an accident.  When we got him outside, he had multiple explosive bowel movements.  A little further examination showed us that, despite his best efforts, his butt had been leaking during the day.  He had also given himself a hemorrhoid.  The poor guy.<br /><br />We double checked the package and found no directions, advice, or warnings that would have helped us foresee this issue.  I never want my dog to go through that again and thus we will never buy these again (and the extras have gone in the trash).

review/summary: Doggie chews
review/text: My pug loves these chews. When I accidentally leave the door open where I keep them, she has her nose in there looking for them. They are her final treat of the day and she can hardly wait for them. After eating her food she jumps up on the chair and stares at me or if I don't see her she barks at me until she gets my attention so I can look and see she ate her food. Then she runs over to the closet waiting for me to give her one. I wish I could be so  easily placated and satisfied.

review/text: Our Schnauzer has some really horrible breath and we don't know exactly why. I tried several of the "dental dog chews" testing to qualify their claims. All failed my test. I saw these at Wal-Mart and decided to give them a try. SUCCESS! Honestly, though, her mouth doesn't smell like a rose garden, but what an improvement. I don't feel like shooshing her away. We can play at close quarters now My only problem with W-M is they carry only small bags. So, I am going to buy at Amazon.com since I can get the large size bags.

review/summary: Expensive!  Huge increase in price.
review/text: My dogs are absolutely crazy about these; they're like crack for dogs.  I last purchased some in Fall 2010 for $14 for 24; then we decided to take a break from them for awhile to ease the addiction.  Feeling soft, I thought to purchase some again.  Now, less than a year later in June 2011, they are almost $20 for 24.  That's an outrageous price increase in a short amount of time.  Yes, those of us who have dogs love our dogs, but I feel like our love for them is being taken advantage of.  I can only imagine what the profit margin is...

review/summary: Gave my dog horrible diarrhea twice...
review/text: We have a tiny little 8 lb maltese, and we got him the mini size bag of these.  Each time we give it to him, he seems to love it, but he had HORRIBLE diarrhea that led to multiple vet visits (it was awful, pretty much the worse diarrhea he's ever had at age 3).  I noticed about 8 hours after he ate the nutrident, the diarrhea started and it had turned blackish green.  Fast forward 2 months, and our dog was nursed back to health and happy...I didn't think that the nutrident was the cause of the diarrhea earlier, I thought it just made it worse so I gave him another one.  Wrong.  About 6-8 hours after, I noticed his normally firm stools were extremely soft and once again, they were blackish green.  I promptly threw the entire bag in the trash.  Terrible product and I will never be buying these again.  As a side note, my little guy tolerates and loves Greenies just fine.  I'll pay the extra few bucks for the Greenies to make sure he isn't food poisoned by these ever again.

review/text: My dogs love these chews. I have 5 dogs - all various sizes and temperments. I have found they are similar to Greenies but much less expensive. In addition you can often find coupons and sales on these. It is so good for their teeth to let them chew, and even my Yorkie at 11 years old has wonderful teeth because I have been giving her things to chew on since she was a puppy. As always, I do not let my dogs chew on any brand of treats without supervision.

review/text: You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog.

review/summary: Good spice, great price!
review/text: First off, the plastic bag option of getting this spice is awesome!  It's dirt cheap!!!  I just saved my old McCormick Pumpkin Pie Spice jar, and now I refill it from these bags.  This method makes these prices unbeatable!!!<br /><br />Okay the spice itself:  it is good.  Not great, but not a problem at all.  It's considerably milder than McCormick's.  So, to compensate, depending on what I'm making, I simply modify the quantity of spice.  I use about 50% more of this than I would with McCormick's PP Spice.  In any case, this brand is so inexpensive, it's still a good bargain.  And the flavor is great!!!  Just know that it is a little bit mild, and it will work great for you!

review/summary: Creamers Burst During Transit - Sticky
review/text: Read through the other reviews and you will find the same situation I had with the creamers.  It does not arrive in the blue dispenser box that is shown, the 192 creamers arrive loose inside a cardboard box with no padding.  Perhaps less creamers would burst during transit if the display box shown was wrapped inside a cardboard box.  The box arrived completely undamaged on the outside. None appeared to have frozen during transit, it appears that the creamer singles pop during high altitude transit or perhaps when the box is thrown by the shipper or pressure is placed on the box.  It is a sticky mess when it arrives.  The creamer taste and convenience is great, but it is unfortunate that so many people have commented on this problem and Interational Delight has not fixed its packaging and shipping issue.

They are also kept in the breakroom and since they do not have to be refrigerated they make for a very nice option for our clients.  Great value too since we can purchase such a large number of cups at one time.  Very handy on the road too.

review/text: Although I'm a big fan of International Delight's flavorful creamers,I must admit that I was unhappy with the condition the package arrived in. I received the box with at least 3 of the singles containers spilled in the box. Needless to say, the creamer carton was damaged and soaked(damp upon receipt). I also noticed that when opening the creamers for use, each single serving had a large number of tiny solidified cream pieces, which made me wonder whether they were still fresh.. Since they're still drinkable, I would give this item a little below average score...

review/summary: Arrived undamaged
review/text: I was a little hesitant to order due to the packaging concerns of others, but I did anyway.  They arrived today undamaged.  I had ordered some other items which were shipped together in a larger box, so that probably helped.  In other words the box the creamers were in was itself in a larger box.  I can see how a few might burst if they were roughly handled.  They are shipped loose in a box.  For the price though, I figured if a few burst I was still way ahead on price.  I give it 5 stars because you should already know about the product before you order (yummy!) and they were undamaged on this shipment.

review/summary: Multiple broken containers
review/text: I read several of these reviews that state how often this product arrives damaged.  I decided to chance it and order it anyway hoping to be one of the lucky people who wrote good reviews.  The box arrived and I could see and smell the leaking creamer from the porch.  I had not been one of the lucky few.  Several of the containers had ruptured and leaked all inside the box.  If you like washing close to two hundred tiny containers of liquid, go ahead and order this product. You'll enjoy it.

review/summary: Excellent creamer, but purchase locally
review/text: The product is excellent - I like the flavor these creamers add to my coffee.  As a single person, I also don't have to worry about spoilage since these are shelf-stable for 6 months or so, unlike the refrigerated version which expires shortly after opening.<br /><br />However, I would highly suggest purchasing this product locally.  It can be had at your neighborhood warehouse club for almost half of what's currently being charged.  This method also has the benefit of being able to check expiration dates and to date, I have never had a problem with containers breaking and leaking.  The only negative is that French Vanilla is the only flavor available in the warehouse stores, so if another flavor fancies your palette, Amazon is probably the best way to go.

They have changed their packaging since some of these reviews. They no longer arrive loose and now have padding. My creamers arrived in perfect condition. Not one broken one. This is such a great deal! International delight is the best creamer. Nice flavor and creamy! Definitely worth the buy!

Luckily I did not get any busted cups in my box.<br /><br />This is going in my break room at work. I'll probably order it again. For the amount of cups you get and the cost, it just can't be beaten.

review/text: Not much to say, the title pretty much says it all!<br /><br />Got it on an ongoing subscription for around 11 bucks, and it is a great add on to your coffee! No sugar needed, just pour a cup of coffee and add 2 of these creamers and you are all set to go, most of my mornings now starts with this! The funny thing is that I wasn't a big coffee drinker to begin with, but now I love my cup of joe in the morning, all thanks to this little guy!<br /><br />If you like your coffee then wouldn't regret getting this and Amazon subscription service is great, gives you a great price and no hassle delivery!<br /><br />I had read reviews about the fact that packaging was poorly done and it would be a sticky mess when it gets to you! Fortunately mine wasn't no bursts or ruptures, they have either figured out a way to improve the packaging, or I got lucky!

review/text: I love International Delight Creamer But was so Disappointed when i received this. The box & the creamers were a mess, i did not expect a mess like i received. Who ever is packing these needs to do something different with the creamers & not just throw them all in a box unprotected like they are shipping them. I will reorder more of the products when & ONLY when the packing is fixed. As far as the product and price it is unbeatable but the packing makes it a total loss, I do not recommend this until the packing of the creamers are changed. Bummer to.

review/summary: Nasty, sticky, leaky, messy, useless and spoiled product
review/text: I've ordered this product from Amazon before and always been happy with its delivery condition, until this package arrived. I opened it and found most of the little creamer containers to be crushed to some degree, with the creamer leaked out all over the inside of the box. It had apparently been in this condition for a while as some of the creamer had thickened and adheared to the insides of the box in nasty clumps. At first, I thought perhaps I could check and save some of the little containers, but on second look, it was apparent I was wrong. What a nasty mess, and the worst part is even if I wanted to return this mess, I discovered it cannot be returned. So I'm appealing to you to consider refunding this horendous example of bad packaging. Until now, I've always been happy with Amazon and will probably order many other things down the road despite this incident, but I just think I shouldn't have to pay for such a mess. Thank you, Susan

When I first got mine I had about 6 of them that were leaked on me. But on the 2nd and 3rd box, NONE were busted or leaked. When I removed mine from the box the second time, I was more careful and removed them slowly by hand not just dump them in the container I keep mine in. BTW I put 3 in per cup =)

review/text: I really am disappointed with Amazon for their allowing this product to be shipped to their consumers the way it is. I opened my box only to find creamers thrown in every which way, and there are several that have spilled. The whole box is now sticky and I don't even know what to do... I decided to take them all out of the box and rinse them under warm water. That has done the trick for the most part, and then I put them into a small wicker box (to be stored in my pantry). I really like the way it tastes, and makes my coffee so sweet and delicious. I gave it 3 stars for the messy situation I had on my hands. They do taste yummy though... so you have to decide if you are up for the messy clean up before you buy them!!

review/text: After years of never being able to have flavored coffee creamer because of all the hydrogenated oils I finally found this. I am for the convenience of the singles, but if you like big cups of coffee be prepared to use 2-3 per cup. It's a lot cheaper to get the large size if you drink a lot of coffee every week, but if your a once in awhile coffee drinker these are nice. They have a very nice vanilla taste and there is enough sugar to satisfy your sweet tooth. Very good product without all the added yucky stuff.

I would recommend keeping a supply in the frige to help cook the cocoa when making it.
