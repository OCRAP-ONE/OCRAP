review/summary: Nice flavor and good packaging
review/text: I appreciate that Gloria Jeans is available in this "frustration free" packaging. At first I was surprised that the little K Cups were rolling around loosely in a big box, but then I realized that all that extra packaging to make them in boxes of 18 or 24 was unnecessary. How many people leave them in the box anyway? I always unload the cups in to my own storage boxes and coffee caddy.<br />The Hazelnut flavor is one of our favorites. It has a nice strong note even diluted with milk and sugar.<br />The price is always a good deal, especially with the free shipping. Always check Amazon for the best deal!

review/summary: Dave's Review of Gloria Jean's Hazelnut Coffee
review/text: I have been using this coffee since purchasing my Keurig B60 brewer. It is a great tasting flavored coffee which I start my day with. I drink anywhere from 2 to 5 cups a day depending on what I'm doing. I spend 6 to 10 hours a day on the internet marketing and the coffee helps me get through the day. I highly recommend this coffee for anyone who likes a great cup of delicious coffee.

review/summary: BUY IT NOW
review/text: It comes out to roughly $0.42/ cup.<br /><br />This is a much better deal than purchasing any other pack/size. It's the same Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cup as a regular retail pack, so there is no worries about it being anything else, lower quality or not so perfect k-cup designs. The only difference with this than any other pack/size is that you get 50 in this one cardboard box, so either place it in a k-cup holder rack, or leave it in the box.<br /><br />as for the product itself, its like a mild coffee. if you like your coffee LIGHT AND SWEET, once you add a bit much of cream/milk/hal&half...you taste it more than the coffee itself. The smell is great though when you make the cup...it fills the room with a rich hazelnut aroma.<br /><br />if you like BOLD BOLD BOLD BOLD, go with EXTRA BOLD coffee people k-cups.

review/summary: Heavy on the hazelnut, light on the coffee.
review/text: This has a good hazelnut flavor, but I could not really taste the coffee at all. The flavor is just a bit strong and the coffee is on the weak side. My 18 year old daughter who is just starting to drink coffee and was not allowed to have cafeinne at all growing up, loves it. She is at the Sure I like coffee if I can add half a cup of cream and 6 teaspoons of sugar stage of drinking coffee. She does not have to add nearly that aount to this coffee and she really likes it. She is in college and this coffee has become her study buddy. I would say it has a good flavor to it, but if you like a stronger coffee than this is not for you. If you like coffee as long as it does not taste like coffee, then I highly recommend this one. I do like it. It just does not have that coffee taste and does not really get me going. This is a super light blend in my opinion and I do not like super strong coffee. I am picky about flavored coffee and this one just does not taste like coffee to me.

review/summary: K Cups Rock!
review/text: I love my Keurig coffee maker and the convenience of these K-Cups!  Since convenience can be costly, it's great to be able to buy the K-Cups in bulk.  The savings are substantial.  The coffee itself is always delicious!  My shipments always arrive quickly and in good condition.  Being a single mom, a full time college student, and a full time Realtor, I don't have much time for anything else.  Brewing my coffee in 50 seconds has made my tight schedule much easier to juggle.  I highly recommend buying these K-Cups from Amazon!

review/text: I have a standing order with Amazon for some time now where a case of K cups is shipped to me each and every month at a discounted price.  Amazon has raised their pricing without informing of they're doing so and shipped the case without my approval at the newer higher pricing.  To me, this is bad business and taking advantage of the dedicated consumer.<br /><br />The coffee itself is more than wondeful.

review/text: I was happy to get my coffee. Me without coffee is like a baby without her sippy cup! I tore the box open and my heart sank. The individual K-Cups were just thrown around. The bottom of the box had a good amount of coffee grinds. I don't think the post office is responsible for the mishap because the box didn't appear damaged. The only logical explanation is the damage originated where the K-Cups were loaded into the box. Five out of the 50 K-Cups were unusable. If you don't think 10 percent is a big deal, then imagine going on a blind date and your blind date answers the door and you notice he/she is missing 10 percent of his/her teeth! See, 10 percent is a lot. Bottom line, I'm not ordering K-cups on-line anymore. I guess I'll just get of my butt and head down to the store. It will be worth the extra expense.<br /><br />Arthur M.

review/text: ***<br /><br />Tazo's Earl Grey Black Tea is very perfumy. I am used to drinking super-premium tea that have the real bergamot added, not the essence. So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot"; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon". Tazo describes the aroma as "citrus, lavender, light smoke".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />***

Evidently smelly in the way only dogs love, good size & shape for frequent rewards. Salmon isn't the easiest on dogs stomachs so I'd advise mixing with something more protein rich and less acidic.  You will require a good hand soap after handling.

review/summary: dog favorite!
review/text: I have an Akita.  No other treats have come anywhere close to these for inspiring this dog to do my bidding.  Really, they seem like they have doggy crack in them. Being so small, you don't have a mess to clean up with them crunching though a big treat.  They keep well (much better than the oil, which goes rancid), and are small enough bags to keep around several places.

review/summary: Stinky, but good.
review/text: I got these as a treat for my golden that can't tolerate fish oil on his food.  Both of my goldens absolutely love them, but they are seriously stinky.  When I use them as training treats I always have to wash my hands after.  Also, since they are rounded, if I drop them they roll away which distracts the dogs - a small problem when we are training.  I've ordered them several time as training treats after the first shipment, but they don't really supplement the oil like I'd hoped.  Really good for dogs that might not like the typical treats.

review/summary: Another good Amy's product
review/text: I'm a huge fan of Amy's products and was excited to try Amy's Rustic Italian.  Given my previous positive experiences with this line, I had high expectations and they were met.  This soup is chock full of vegetables.  It is thick and has nice flavor and texture diversity.  I love the inclusion of kale, garbanzos, and brown rice.  While the soup is heavy on vegetables and lighter on broth, the broth that is in the soup is somewhat oily.  (This tends to be an issue with many Amy's soups save their chili options.)<br /><br />I find the soup to be quite filling and only eat about a half can at one sitting with a salad and some bread to create a satisfying meal.<br /><br />I think the nutritional profile is good with this soup.  Some may have issue with the sodium content; a full can of the Rustic Italian has 56% of a person's sodium.  Amy's Kitchen does have some soup options that are deemed lower sodium but even the low sodium options like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040HDXGC">Amy's Organic Butternut Squash Soup Light in Sodium -- 12 oz</a> have 1/4 of a person's daily sodium.<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 cup<br />Number of servings:2<br />Calories: 140 per cup<br />Total fat: 6 g<br />Saturated Fat:1 g<br />Sodium:680 mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 18g<br />Dietary fiber: 4 g<br />Sugars:4 g<br />Protein: 4 g<br /><br />Vitamin A: 30%<br />Vitamin C:30%<br />Calcium:6%<br />Iron:8%<br /><br />I purchase Amy's Kitchen soups at my local co-op for about 2.50 a can.

review/text: This is a wonderful low-calorie meal option for me, I love kale and the rice and garbanzo beans in it make it more filling than some soups. It's really nice with a solid whole wheat bread also (I bake my own, but store-bought would go with this as well). This is definitely my favorite canned soup, so I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good vegetable soup.

review/text: This has become my new favorite Amy's soup.  It is really well flavored and I like the variety of vegetables in it.  My only critique is that it is a bit oily.  I would love to see this in a low sodium.  I wish all of their soups were available that way.  I usually eat close to a whole can and at around 30% of your daily value of sodium in half a can, that is a lot.

review/summary: Reminded me of a cinnamon bun
review/text: I and my family drink tea daily. Between the three of us we go through about a gallon a day, usually a plain variety of orange Pekoe and/or Black tea. However, I like to mix it up and try new teas, and I fell in love with the quality stash teas after my boyfriend bought me a huge variety pack, so when I'm looking for something new I tend to gravitate towards the Stash brand.<br /><br />As soon as you open the box you get a pretty inviting warm smell of cinnamon with sweet notes, the same is true while  brewing. I made a half gallon using four tea bags, which made it plenty strong, I sweetened it as I normally would a half gallon of tea, which was a mistake it's a bit too sweet for my liking, so you may want to reduce your sugar by maybe %25. I made so much so my mother and I could drink some while it was warm, and then try it as an iced tea as well. In general the tea was okay,but something about it didn't quite seemed balanced. I couldn't see myself drinking this too regularly like I could some of their other flavors, but it's not so terrible that I won't keep it.<br /><br />Warm:  I preferred it warm over iced, which is rare. The flavors are much fuller while it's warm and the aromatics are better appreciated that way too,I tried it first with out milk, it was okay, almost reminiscent of warm apple cider sans the apple, after I added milk and it transformed into a liquid cinnamon bun! That was a delight!...at first.  It was one of those things that the more you drank it the less you enjoyed it, the cinnamon began to overwhelm you and the sweet notes became clawing.. - My mother didn't like it plain or with milk.<br /><br />Cold: It's just shy of "Okay" while cold. the flavor's become very sharp and one noted it still kind of reminds me of an apple cider due to it's predominate sweet and cinnamon flavor, I haven't tried it cold with milk yet. but I may consider mixing it with our regular iced brew to see if the flavors become more subtle and enjoyable.

This is much like the clams we used to get off the boat in the 1950's in New England.

review/summary: Pretty good, not great.
review/text: The price is comparable to brand name whole wheat pasta available to me locally so I have no complaint regarding that. The texture of this particular brand however is moderately  good. Some whole wheat pastas use a higher grade of  wheat making it lighter in color and slightly more tender ( Bionaturae and De Cecco  pastas comes to mind) . This pasta is darker in color and has a slightly grittier texture then those brands however it is still better then the bargain basement brands found for less. I found cooking it for slightly  longer then  the instructions call for and in a LOT of water helps to make it smoother. I would use a heavy, more robust sause for this pasta but otherwise we weren't really disappointed.

review/text: Whole-wheat pasta is better for you.  However, this brand, Davinci is an absolute ripoff.  It is about $3 per box for only 12 oz.  To give a perspective, one could buy 16oz boxes of whole-wheat spaghetti for $1 per box and it will taste just as good.<br /><br />One would think that the pasta is organic at this staggering price, but no it is just regular whole-wheat pasta in a small 12oz. box.  This is definitely a case of not getting what you pay for!

review/text: Well, of course you don't want to pay shipping for a 12-pack of soft drinks from the omnipresent Gristedes. However, if you're lucky ebough to live in New York, or your local store has this, by all means get the diet black cherry flavor.  This was so sweet and rich in cherry flavor, that I immediately checked out the bottle from which I was drinking--I thought I had bought the Non-Diet version!  They're just aren't too many diet soft drinks that taste this good. Note: Boylan's diet drinks use Splenda sweeterner, so if that's a turn-off, skip it (or splurge and go for the non-diet!) It's especially good cold, some ice cubes will help mask the lack of sugar.<br /><br />Boylan Bottleworks (gotta love that proletarian name!) is the real thing. They've been around since 1891 with the launch of their "Birch Beer," and expansion into othr award-winning beverages. (For more soda lore, see Boylanbottling.com.)

review/text: My three kids (4, 7,8) love this mac & cheese.  They've grown up only eating whole wheat pasta, so that's not an issue for them.  To me, the pasta is not much different than any other whole wheat pasta, maybe even a little more palatable, so I am guessing (not sure) that the reviewer who called it gummy is just not used to whole wheat pasta in general.<br /><br />If you're new to whole wheat pasta, I recommend starting with Angel Hair Pasta (hopefully with sauce).  It's much easier to get used to than other types of pasta.  Then you slowly work your way up to thicker pastas.

review/text: I have made a few boxes of this whole wheat mac and cheese and each has been gummy.  I have made sure to cook them according to the directions, not overcook them, and they do not come out well.  Their traditional mac and cheese is very good but this whole wheat version I do not recommend.

review/summary: excellent coffee
review/text: Melitta coffee is an excellent coffee for daily use.  It is a little stronger than most American brands, but your taste quickly adapts to it and you do not want to go back to regular coffee.  To me, Brazilian coffee tastes better than Colombian coffee and is smoother to drink with a good flavor.  I would recommend that anyone try a bag and see for yourself; just use a little less than usual to keep it from being too strong.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: I've been picking up the 14ct pkgs at the Dollar Tree in Cherry, Orange, and Lemonade flavors. They don't always have them so it's nice to know I could always order them online as well. I fill a 32 oz plastic sports bottle with water, pour in the mix, shake, and put it in the freezer for an hour or two or until it develops a thin icy crust. The flavors are great and using 32oz of water rather than the suggested 16oz creates just the right amount of tang. 16oz drinks are a bit too tart for my tastes. I drink these rather than soda all the time.. much more refreshing and cheaper too!

Local stores don't carry this flavor (don't know why), but it's my favorite so I buy it online.  Great taste and healthy, too!  What more would you want?

review/summary: My kitties LOVE it!
review/text: The pet food store proprietor told me Merrick is human-grade food, and I believe it. I don't find Turducken to be soupy at all, and I've bought it many times. My own cats and my foster cats LOVE it--which is true of all Merrick canned cat food.<br /><br />I used to use Merrick as a treat and regularly feed my cats high-quality dry food. But my two cats' dental hygienist recommended Merrick as being one of the best for feline teeth. (FYI, she didn't recommend ANY dry food, no matter how high-quality, because dry cat food must be at least 40 percent carbs in order to be extruded in the factory--and cats need hardly any carbs, if any at all. Carbs accelerate feline plaque formation, gingivitis and tooth decay.)

review/summary: Is this a joke?
review/text: This cat food literally has the consistency of chicken noodle soup.  It is at least 70% water.  And I mean straight up WATER.. not moisture.  You shake the can and it sounds like it's full of liquid, and it is.<br /><br />My cats didn't even bother to smell it, much less taste it, and they will eat darn near anything.<br /><br />The first time, I dumped it in a bowl and it looked like some kind of soup with a few fragments of ground meat.<br /><br />The second time, I tried squeezing out the can with the lid, like how you would squeeze out the water in a can of tuna.  This yielded maybe 2 ounces of food in the 6 ounce can.  The cats wouldn't eat that either.<br /><br />In summary, this is the most pathetic excuse for cat food I have EVER seen  and I have lived with cats for all of my 29 years.

review/summary: My cats LOVE Merrick
review/text: All I can say about Merrick's brand cat food is that my cats love it! They love the juices in it. I also like the fact that all ingredients are from the US of A and no grains. After the recalls on pet foods this can't help but make you feel so much better about feeding this to your cats. There is 9 flavors of Merrick canned and my cats love all 9. I suggest getting the variety pack that they sale to see which your cat will like before buying in bulk since most cats are picky eaters. I also suggest you look at the Merrick website if you want to know more about the company. That is what originally sold me on their products!

They took two sniffs and walked away.<br /><br />Just today I opened another can (same brand, different flavor) and it gave one of them diarrhea. Awesome!<br /><br />I won't be buying Merrick again. There are too many reliable brands out there to justify getting something this risky.

Not for the wasabi light-weights.<br /><br />Luckily, for the light-weights, the Original crackers are just plain good. No MSG or Gluten or Wasabe or Seaweed. Buying a case of these saves me about 25% versus purchasing them at the local grocery.

review/summary: Good Product, Bad Packaging
review/text: These rice crackers, to me, are very tasty and fun to eat, but the only problem is that when you open the box and start unpacking the bags, (I get the dozen) the bottom of some of the bags are either punctured or torn open.  I don't believe it is from tampering but the material used is too flimsy and gives way during manufacturing or somewhere in the whole process.  Instead of using a bag like the potato chip companies they use bags that have too many seams and it makes it easy for tearing.  The bags which are torn open have to be discarded because the product becomes stale not to mention the mess from crumbs all over.  So, hopefully the manufacturer will start using bags that will not rip open.

review/summary: Sulfite Free Dehydrated Fruit ...
review/text: As an individual with sulfite allergies, the Brothers freeze-dried fruits are a real find for me, since I find it difficult to carry fruit with me during my travels. When I realized Amazon was carrying them, I ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001942GAI">Brothers-ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana, 24-Count  Bags</a> for a variety.<br /><br />While I enjoy all three varieties, this one is closer to like than to love. In comparing it to the Fuji Apple, the pieces are smaller, and the flavor isn't really a strong pear flavor. I suspect it is because they are Asian Pears, and I am more used to my personal favorite, Bartlet Pears.<br /><br />Trust me, I wouldn't turn these down - in fact I do enjoy them greatly - I just happen to enjoy the other two in the package just a bit better.<br /><br />I first encountered "freeze-dried" fruit back in the 60s as stores carried the kind of light-weight food the astronauts were eating. So eating these isn't just a fun way to enjoy a healthy snack, it's also a bit of nostalgia.<br /><br />Each bag contains approx. 1 1/2 Asian Pears ... and nothing else. It's an awesome way to get your fruit, or to sneak it into your kids' meals.

review/text: My son is allergic to many foods, including life threatening allergies to peanuts, tree nuts and sesame.  Which eliminates many snacks that are run on the same line as nuts and seeds.  This line is completely allergen free.  The taste is great; they are very crispy and melt in your mouth.  And the single serve packaging makes it great to have a fun snack treat that is safe and healthy for him.  So far the banana/strawberry, pear and apple are all a hit!  These are cheaper than I can find in the store, and the free shipping option is a bonus.

review/text: A friend recommended these Brothers Crisps and I am very pleased that we took her advice! Being a type 2 diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories, these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels. The real test with any "good for you" snacks is if my teens will eat them, and they also love them!<br /><br />These are made from real fruit (and nothing else) that has been sliced and freeze dried, making them crispy (exactly like "Astronaut Ice Cream") but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough. This process also makes them very flavorful.<br /><br />Each pack contains -<br /><br />Asian Pear:<br />About 1 1/2 Pears per pack<br />40 Calories<br />8 NET Carbs (7 from sugar)<br /><br />We bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027IACXI">Brothers ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana - 20 Count Bags</a> and I like the Asian Pears the best, but all of the flavors are really good.<br /><br />These are a good tasting healthy snack alternative that, if it wasn't for the fairly high cost, I would keep on hand all of the time!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Note: These are made in China<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Awesome snack for toddlers
review/text: These are wonderful snacks...I like them, but I buy them for my 1 year old son.<br /><br />These are a little expensive and hard to find (reason for 4 stars), but compare the price to Gerber or even store brand freeze dried fruits made for babies...you definitely get more for your money here. Plus the kind packaged for babies are such tiny pieces, my son's outgrown them, and the bottom is filled with fruit dust...and you don't get much more than what's in one of these single serve packs anyway.<br /><br />These do crisp (for those of us with a mouth full of teeth), but they melt away just like the baby ones do, so they are awesome for new self feeders (with just a few teeth or none at all). And I love that there's no added sugar. I used to break them up into bite size pieces for my son, but now he's figured out how to use those front teeth--they're really airy so easy for him to bite.<br /><br />The packets work great for me! I can throw 1 or 2 in the diaper bag and go. If you have left overs, they tend to get a little soggy (reabsorb some humidity from the air) so it's much better to keep the servings packaged separately.<br /><br />Love these, wish they were easier to find.

review/text: I have a 17 month old who is allergic to peanuts and a 4 year old.  Both love this snack.  It is a very convenient alternative to crackers.  My only complaint is that I find them expensive, particularly since I find the pouches small -- my kids typically want more than one as a snack.  that is the only reason I give it 4 rather than 5 stars.  I brought a box of apples and pears (which I got at my local Costco) to my son's preschool for snacktime, and the teacher said the kids liked them.  There were 1 or 2 who weren't big fans, but I can't think of any snack that every kid would like.  I have also brought them to playtime with my younger son -- the little ones there love them too and the moms are always asking where they can get them.

review/summary: no additives = awesome
review/text: I give this product 5 stars because its a great all natural snack for kids (and/or adults) with absolutely nothing else in the ingredients besides the Pear fruit (or the apple or the strawberry/banana depending on which flavor you have) My son loves them and we will always have them on hand.  With so many other foods its always a concern these days what kind of toxic, or carcinogenic, or heart disease inducing ingredients it has.  You can't keep them away from all bad foods, but at least with this you know, its just the fruit.<br /><br />I have two criticisms of other reviews I've seen here though.  First, I'm not sure its fair to take a star off for taste, when this is just dried Pears.  They didn't flavor these or add anything, they are just selling your dried pears, they taste how they taste! how can you detract a star for that?!<br /><br />Second, some people mention its a great way to get your child their dose of fruit.  Well, as much as I love these, do not be fooled.  Your child is not getting their daily dose of fruit from these.  They are a great, natural, low calorie snack, but they don't have nearly the equivalent nutrition of a fresh fruit.  Much of that goes away when a fruit is dried, its just what happens.  This is OK, because as much as they don't compare to fresh fruit in nutrition, they are also far lower in calories so its not like they fill the child up and keep him from eating other things - just don't believe that its a substitute for a serving of fruit!

review/summary: I like these, but LACKING in Vitamins or minerals!
review/text: I do like these and think they are a great alternative to most snacks. But there is hardly have any nutritional value to them. Even potato chips have a real potato value left in them. But these have been drained of most all nutrients and fiber! Not so good.<br /><br />Also, the customer that claimed that these are mushy must have left them opened to the air. These need to be sealed shut so the moisture does not get to them because obviously that effect their crunchiness. Even if left open for a 1/2 an hour, might cause a problem with rehydration. It stands to reason, if they acquire their crunchiness through dehydration, we need to try to keep them that way by keeping the package tightly closed. I like to fold a crease along the top of the package after I opened it with my fingernails to make a sharp edge so less moisture can penetrate back into the fruit.It works and it's quick too. Just a thought.<br /><br />These are expensive, so I hope the customer that claimed these are $7.00 cheaper at Costco is right. That is a huge money saver.<br /><br />Thanks for all your information. That was great!

review/text: These snacks are great for quick lunchbox fillers, on the go snacks or a twist on the same old fruits for snack.  Great for little ones as they practically melt in your mouth.  Full of flavor.  Package does a pretty good job of protecting the fruit inside even when tossed in your bag for the day.  A hit!

review/text: I wish my daughter would eat fresh pears.  I have tried everything.  However, she loves these, and at least that's something.  At first I regretted that the packaging had so little inside.  However, in our humid climate (hawaii), they lose their crispness within about 30 min. of opening.  So the small servings work very well here.
