review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I am not a fan of cinnamon, but I like tea and wanted to give this product a try.  Surprisingly, although the cinnamon flavor is quite strong, I enjoyed the overall flavor combination of this tea.  For me, other spices are muted with cinnamon being the main flavor.<br /><br />I let a tea bag to brew for a while and to cool off in my spill resistant cup.  I drink it rather quickly and did not mind the cinnamon flavor.  I find this tea to be energizing, and I usually have it either in the morning when I get to work or at about 2PM when I am crashing from lunch and falling asleep.

review/summary: Truly a great chai
review/text: I drink tea, not coffee, and I drink a lot of it year-round, so I'm always looking for something new.  I like chai, but some versions are too heavy-handed with the black pepper.  This Higgins & Burke product has the perfect balance of black tea and spices.  The black tea, which is the foundation of chai, seems to be of high quality; it is flavorful and not bitter, so I can drink this without adding any sweetener.  The tea bags come in foil packets, which keeps them fresh, something I appreciate as well.  If you are a tea connoisseur, I highly recommend this as a full-bodied but not over-powering chai.

review/summary: Where's the spice?
review/text: Chai?  Really?  I'm used to most bagged chai teas to be a bit on the weak side when it comes to spice, but this is by far the most weakly-spiced chai I've ever tasted.<br /><br />I even tried it in water rather than milk, and I still can barely taste any spices; however, that way I did learn that the tea is of good quality and taste.<br /><br />But if you want some spicy kick to your chai, let alone some depth of flavors, I'd definitely look elsewhere.

review/text: As soon as you tear into the packet, you know that this Higgins & Burke Chai tea is going to be good. The aroma is intoxicating! The blend of Assam black tea, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and cloves is just right. I enjoy my Chai tea iced as well as hot. When drinking it iced, I simply brew as usual then add mild, a packet of sweetener and ice. Perfect for a hot summer day!

review/summary: Smells great, but black tea is too weak
review/text: I received a box of Higgins & Burke Chai Black Tea free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review of the product.<br /><br />I'm a big tea drinker, and have always enjoyed chai, so I was excited to try this brand. I had the water at a rolling boil when I poured it over the teabag, and I left it to steep for 5-6 minutes. I added just a little hot milk and some honey after removing the teabag, and enjoyed the nice clove-y fragrance of the tea.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the black tea in it isn't strong enough to balance out the spices. Classic chai is supposed to be a strong infusion of Assam tea, with subtle flavors of cardomom, cloves and cinnamon. This product has it backwards.<br /><br />Perhaps using two teabags would help.

review/summary: Nice:  pleasing aroma with complex taste
review/text: I like a nice tea, but prefer black tea rather than herbal tea. So I was excited to try out this Chai blend. I find it to be very nice, with an aroma like mulling spices, and a sharp but not bitter taste.<br /><br />Packaging and content:<br />This comes in a box of 20 individually wrapped bags. The ingredients are Assam Black Tea, Cinnamon, Cardamom, Ginger, Cloves, and "Natural Flavors" (whatever that means). When I opened the package, it smelled so good that I almost wanted to just keep the tea bag out and not put water over it.<br /><br />Taste:<br />The package says to brew for 3 to 5 minutes, but I like to leave the bag in the cup until it is empty. I am impressed that the tea just gets stronger, but never bitter. The taste is akin to "mulling spices" that are used with wine. I can smell the cinnamon and cloves, and taste a bit of the ginger and and other flavors. The tea is Assam, which is definitely better than other black teas. All of this comes together really well - the taste combines nicely into a wonderful flavor.<br /><br />Summary:<br />If you like a tea with caffeine and a complex flavor, this is an excellent choice. Highly recommended.

review/summary: More Spice Than Tazo
review/text: In the world of brew-at-home chai, you have the purists who watch for spice sales ("Oooh, oooh, I found star anise in the bargain bin at Vons!") and people like me who are just looking for a more exotic version of English breakfast tea with milk.<br /><br />The Higgins & Burke Chai was alright. If my supermarket choice was this, Tazo or Good Earth, I'd get this in a second.<br /><br />However, unlike other brands I buy frequently, you can't really see the individual pieces of spices (cardamom pods, arms of star anise). I prefer the more premium teas that have identifiable spices. I did notice more spice/tea dust than usual inside the envelope. More finely powdered teas lose their flavor quicker than the more chunky stuff.<br /><br />If homemade/authentic restaurant chai is a 10, Good Earth a 1, I'd give this a solid 4. (Two Leaves and a Bud Black Chai is an 8, Bombay Chai is a 8, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is a 6, Stash Double Spice is 6, Tazo is a 3, Bigelow/Twinings are 1s, any premade chai liquid/powder with sugar is a -3).<br /><br />Numi made with Roobios doesn't count on the scale.

review/summary: Huge Chai Fan here!
review/text: I am a huge fan of chai teas.  There are so many variations on the balance of spices that one must find one that they prefer.  I have made my own chai and definitely drink it often at Indian restaurants.  I really, really liked Higgins & Burke Chai Black Tea.  The aroma was nice and spices are nicely balanced in a way that I like them.  If I choose to make it as a latte (with milk), I brew two tea bags to one cup of water and I add soy milk to it and it's wonderful.  Definitely a fan here!

review/summary: Tea-licious
review/text: Rating 4.5 stars<br /><br />I'm a big tea drinker and you'd be surprised at the variety out there.<br /><br />Tea needs to do two things to be good for me: 1- it has to be strong.  A weak tea is simply water to me, and too many teas lack a strong, but not overwhelming flavor; 2- it has to be as good iced as hot.  I realize that's not the traditional English view of tea, but I make a lot of iced tea and I want it to be as good cold as hot.<br /><br />My verdict is that this is a variety I would buy again.  The flavor is good, the strength is good.  I tried the Chai Black and would love to try their other flavorings.  You can't really go wrong with this one, though.

review/summary: Delicate, Multi-Layered Flavor; Weak Brew
review/text: I enjoyed Higgins and Burke Chai Tea. The flavor is more varied and subtle than a lot of the bagged chai blends. Each bag contains notes, in varying strengths, of clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and of course cardamon. At the moment, it's unseasonably chilly where I live, and I've been drinking several cups per day.<br /><br />This blend serves well as a hot tea, an iced tea, chilled with milk, but is best when it's a heated milk blend. It isn't nearly what you'd get in an Indian restaurant, but as far as boxed chai tea goes, it's nice.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the strength of the tea. Even when doubling the tea and the time, it never gets as strong as I like (that said, I like "motor-oil" tea, as black as possible.) It isn't watery or remarkably weak, but I was disappointed that I couldn't get the flavor as strong as I wanted.<br /><br />Overall, this is a more-than-decent tea. I enjoyed it enough to buy a few more boxes, and I would confidently recommend it.

review/text: I drink a lot of Chai tea so I was excited to try something new. This tea is delicious but the clove flavor is a bit strong. Also there are some natural flavors which I haven't figured out yet. They add a sort of perfume to the tea not unlike Earl Grey. I suspect there are some essential oils being used as flavorings. This is a nice tea to drink in the afternoon. It might be a bit strong first thing in the morning. I used two teabags to make it strong enough. Also to get that milky texture I use powdered milk. This is also great with stevia instead of sugar. When you make this be prepared for a very aromatic experience. Enjoy.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Not strong enough.
review/text: A good chai should have a complex flavor of spices and be strong enough to accommodate the addition of milk and sweetner. This one just didn't fill the bill. Some of the more subtle spices, especially my favorite, the cardamom, were just not full-bodied enough in this tea to be savored; in addition, I didn't feel there was enough loose tea in the bag to brew a strong enough cup. It tasted fairly bland and watered (or milked) down, even after the brewing time suggested on the box.  Perhaps two bags per cup would have done the trick, but that would be pretty pricey. Overall, I was not impressed and would not order this chai again.

review/summary: Weak chai
review/text: I drink a lot of tea... from the dollar store plain black tea to exotic loose leaf.  I have so much tea that I've been placed on a "tea diet" and have to sneak new teas into the house.  Needless to say, I was thrilled to try this new tea.<br /><br />Sadly, this tea fell very short.  I dont expect bagged chai tea to taste like real chai.  I do expect a nice spiced tea with a little bit of a kick.  I found this tea very weak.  Even leaving the tea in my 8 oz tea cup for 10 mins, the tea was still too weak.  I found the only way to drink this tea was to double up on the tea bags.  At 20 bags per box, this box would only last me 5 days with my 16 oz "morning commute" tea cup.<br /><br />On the plus side, this tea does smell nice.  I'm currently mixing it with no name cheap black tea with good results.  However it is likely that I will not purchase this tea in the future.

She said there was nothing "special" about it, however; it was just nice tea.<br /><br />I didn't think a real Chai could be found in a teabag, but the combination of spices, for me, is just right.  I admit it was a little weak, but then I put cream and sugar in it and only steeped it for 4 minutes.  The Assam in it does not have a smokey taste and I'm grateful for that.<br /><br />I do intend to drink more of it and offer it to friends.

review/summary: This blend smells as heavenly as it tastes.
review/text: I am a lover of hot tea, but I've never tried the Higgins & Burke brand.  I figured this Chai flavor would be a great place to start.  The tea bag was quite an experience even while it was still dry.  The spices are very pronounced, especially the cardamom and the combination was quite an intriguing smell.  For my first cup I started with cold water and boiled it in a kettle, poured it over a teabag in a mug and let it steep for three minutes.  I'm telling you, that aroma was amazing.  (When I'm drinking hot tea I almost always drink it from a mug which holds approximately 8 - 10 ounces of water.)  After removing the teabag I tasted the tea without anything added.  The spices come through very strongly, not overpoweringly strong, but stronger than other brands of Chai flavor hot tea I've tried before.  The blend here is Assam black tea, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and other natural ingredients.  I thought the flavors were very nicely balanced, with none overpowering the others and yet remaining distinctive.<br /><br />I am not a tea connoisseur, but I do brew several pots of hot tea each day and I love to try all kinds of flavored teas.  The second cup of this Chai tea I made I started with cold water in the mug and heated it in the microwave.  Tea experts probably cringe when they hear that, but my palate is not trained to tell any difference and I couldn't taste any difference between the kettle boiled water and the microwave boiled water.  Each teabag comes sealed in an individual foil style pouch to keep it fresh.  My personal preference is to add a small amount of honey and a splash of milk.  The aroma coming off the hot mug of tea was enough to make me close my eyes and simply relax.

review/text: I've had a LOT of different varieties of Chai teas, some from bags, others home made.<br /><br />This is a strong tea, smelling much like strong cinnamon at first, yet a second smell or taste yields another different smell, more like allspice, but not quite.<br /><br />This is great with cream (classic Thai tea) or soy or rice milk (regular if you are OK with it I suppose).<br /><br />Great strong flavor that reminds me of chewing on cinnamon bark after drinking apple cider as a child, as far as taste.<br /><br />Might be a bit strong for newcomers to chai or Thai teas, but is absolutely wonderful! I mix half & half with soy or rice milk, but if too strong, you can add more milk to ton it down, or less to make it stronger.

review/summary: an Excellent Chai
review/text: I like chai, but it's not always my favorite tea drink because so often it wreaks of strong clove that overpowers all the other flavors. When I smelled this tea bag it did seem to smell very strong. But I was surprised when I tasted it. It does not taste as "clovey" as the tea bag had smelled at all. I was really happy with the flavor. I love cardamom but so often barely taste it in other boxes of chai. Finally I could detect it here very pleasantly among the other spices. This tea has such a nice blend.<br /><br />I have seen recipes of chai from India, and they sound amazing (crushing almonds, warming milk over the almonds, add the spices, etc.). But I know I am not about to do that when I want a quick cup of tea. So far, this has been my favorite chai tea that I have tried. Just thinking about it now is making me want to go brew a cup!<br /><br />I like it with a tiny bit of sugar and some whole milk. It's really smooth, delicious, and hits the spot.<br /><br />The box says it has 162 mg of polyphenols per serving (I am assuming a serving is one tea bag/cup). Which is apparently good for your health. So that's another nice bonus.<br /><br />edit: It's now October 2012 and this is still my favorite chai tea. The other day was very damp, cold and rainy. I had a chill, and wanted a nice warm drink but wasn't sure if I wanted hot cocoa or chai. Then it came to me ~ how about a hot chai cocoa?! I brewed a cup of this Higgins & Burke Chai Black tea, let it steep as usual. Then I added a teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa powder (I had Hershey's cocoa powder on hand) and a scant teaspoon of sugar, and then added some whole milk. It was deliscious! Spicey hot cocoa! YUM! It hit the spot.

review/summary: smooth, but mild spiced black tea
review/text: A perhaps too-mild Assam tea with spices, packaged in Canada, that makes a reasonable mid-sized cup but needs a long steeping.<br /><br />I drink a variety of black and green teas, though my true love is coffee.  Thus I similarly prefer stronger tasting black teas, deeper, ones with intense but nuanced flavors.  Also, I drink my black tea (and coffee) plain-- no milk.  Tasted that way, this Assam is an unassuming, mild tea, full-flavored, but not robust.<br /><br />There's a pleasing scent of spices on opening the packet, but less distinct spicing in the brewed tea.  For south-Asian inspired tea, I'd expect more scent/flavor of cardamom (I don't detect any).  It may be that getting a more robust tea with vivid spicing would mean moving to loose-leaf-- there's only so much room for tea leaves and water circulation in these little bags.<br /><br />Using boiling water, I made a 16oz mug with a 6 minute steep, and a 10oz mug with a 5 minute steep.  Both tasted fine (not over-extracted) and were almost surprisingly mild.  I don't suggest steeping at the low-end of the range (3 mins) considering how mild this tea is already.<br /><br />The tea drinks easily and is pleasant both hot and at room-temperature.  While I find it a bit too weak, if you like your tea mild and smooth, this one is a nice choice.

review/summary: Solid Gentle Flavor
review/text: I prefer "Earl Grey" tea, so I rarely drink a "Chai" tea.  Higgins & Burke has produced a very nice quality Chai product.  I didn't expect to like this tea.  I thought it would be too strong.  I'm pleasantly surprised to find a nice gentle flavor which isn't overwhelming and is quite enjoyable for a change of pace.<br /><br />The aroma is also pleasing and not overwhelming.

review/summary: A good spiced black tea for a non-chai guy...
review/text: I'm not much of a chai fan, since I don't care for milk or cream in tea or coffee except on very rare occasions, so I got this to try primarily as a spiced black tea. Chai sacrilege aside, I liked this quite a bit. The spices do tend to overcome the taste of the Assam tea, but better that than the other way around. The flavors are distinctive, with the clove and cinnamon predominating. I steeped for five minutes, and may go longer next time, since I like my tea strong. I also used sweetener, but I plan to try it without, as the spice flavors are strong enough to not need more sweetening. All in all, this is a good spiced black tea at a very reasonable price. When I don't feel like taking the time to make a full pot of something else in my iron Japanese teapot, this will be a fine substitution.

review/summary: Nice stuff
review/text: This is quite a pleasant spiced tea. The flavor of the spices doesn't overwhelm the black tea flavor, as it does with some other chai teas I've tried. Instead there's a nice even balance. I agree with another reviewer that this product isn't as strong as the masala chai you'd get in an Indian restaurant, but I don't mark it down for that; I think it stands on its own as a valid variation on the "theme" of chai tea. But you should be aware that you aren't going to get the robust, tongue-tingling product you might be used to from restaurants, and if you add milk, you may want to do so sparingly.

review/text: This is the third tea from Higgins & Burke that I have tried.  The other two, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061IUKDM">Green Tea</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061IUIDY">Earl Grey</a> were quite good with subtle flavor.<br /><br />I have had traditional Chai Tea in Indian restaurants.  This Chai Tea is not prepared exactly in the same manner.  However, as a tea-bag product, it does stand on its own merit.<br /><br />The H&B Chai consists of Assam Tea with spices including: cardamon, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger.  When the tea is brewed, it takes on the dark color of the Assam.  At first sip, I found the dominant taste to be that of the Assam Tea. Then the spices asserted their own flavors.  It made for an interesting spicy but not overwhelming drink.  One downside was that there was a spicy aftertaste which lasted quite a while.  This is definitely a tea to have ready for special occasions.

I found this Earl Grey to be very similar but with perhaps a slightly stronger bergamot flavor than the T brand.  I drink my tea black so I find some of the other brands to be too dark.  This one was well balanced.<br /><br />I have tried many other brands but the T brand and now Higgins & Burke are my two favorites.

review/summary: A very nice Chai Tea
review/text: I am a huge fan of chai tea, so i was pleased to see this come up on the Vine program to let me try a brand I was unfamiliar with.<br /><br />TO cut to the chase, I found this to be a really nice blend of chai tea.  Some other brands like Tazo have a little more of a stiff bite, and the Stash double spiced chai has an excessive amount of cinammon that overpowers the flavor of the tea.  This Higgs and Burke Chai Black has a very nice mix of chai and black tea that has a great chai flavor but does not overpower the taste buds. I'll definitely buy more of this tea.

review/summary: Pleasant but bland
review/text: A box of Higgins & Burke Earl Grey Tea was sent to me by Amazon Vine for review. Here's my take on it.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke, a Canadian company promising sustainable friendships amid socially responsible production (not sure what all that really means) produces Earl Grey, among several other types of tea. I received a box of twenty foil-wrapped tea bags. Upon opening the foil package, I was immediately aware of the slightly sweet scent of Italian bergamot (a fragrant orange) and anxiously awaited my first sip.<br /><br />I let a bag steep a full five minutes as directed, then added milk (actually, half and half). While pleasant, there was very little tea flavor, a disappointment. Today I decided to bolster the flavor by brewing in a pot. I used four bags, placed in a pre-heated pot, and 2 � cups of boiling filtered water. This brew steeped five minutes under a tea cozy. Since I'm a tea-to-the-milk type, I poured my tea into a Dunoon china mug which contained about 3/4 of an inch of half and half. Again, disappointing. The beverage was mildly sweet from the bergamot, but there was barely any tea taste.<br /><br />I consider myself more than a casual tea drinker, and Earl Grey is my tea of choice. I have tried nearly every available blend and still go back to Bigelow for real Earl Grey flavor. The Higgins & Burke, while pleasant and nicely scented, didn't do it for this tea-drinking reviewer.

review/summary: Strong on cloves
review/text: Chai from a teabag is always a dicey proposition because it can't possibly live up to the chai served in Indian restaurants. Part of the problem is that every chai from a bag that I have tried cannot live up to much milk and authentic chai is creamy, milky and strong. In order to even come close to authentic chai, you have to make a very tiny portion and use a light hand with the milk in most cases.<br /><br />I tried this tea three different ways in order to find the best alchemy for a good result. The first way was straight with no milk or sweetener. I noted that it has a very strong scent of cloves. Though tasty enough when drunk straight, it doesn't really feel like "chai" without milk, so the second variation I tried was with a little bit of low-fat milk added cold after steeping for 5 minutes. This tended to wipe out all but the stronger spicy notes (with the clove coming out on top of cinnamon, cardomom, etc.). Finally, I tried my standard method for chai in a teabag and that was to heat 1/3 of the total volume as low-fat milk and 2/3 as water. Heating the milk makes it creamier and steeping the tea with it makes the overall flavor stronger. I recommend using no more than 8 oz. of liquid total and would say it's better to use 6 as it'll make a more intense and flavorful cup of tea.<br /><br />Though the box says that this includes the "robust" flavor of Assam tea (a tea I enjoy greatly), the tea flavor was largely overwhelmed by the spices, and again, especially cloves. I would recommend always steeping for the maximum time (5 minutes) and a light hand with the milk and water. This could be a much better chai if they had been more generous with the Assam and less heavy-handed with the spices, but it's still a pleasant enough drink.

review/text: Unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6727O">Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea, India Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, which I occasionally drink (both tea bag and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XHI">Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai,  K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>), H&B's chai tea does not have that exotic a fragrance, being more along the lines of a minty, almost medicinal aroma. The tea, however, tastes quite good. With a little bit of fruit brandy, this is just the stuff to get me going in the morning. Tea bags are individually wrapped in a foil pouch, which seems to keep each bag fresher than a paper bag. It also keeps more of the aroma in, with a refreshing blast of that fruity mint coming out when opened. I found that steeping the tea for at least five minutes gets the most of the spicy aroma and the rich chai texture and flavor. This is really good, delicious stuff, and a definite break from run-of-the-mill tea.

review/summary: Flavor a little weak for my taste buds
review/text: The flavor of the chai seems a bit weak to me. Even the smell right out of the foil wrapper was mild. I expected a much stronger spice note. I could smell the cloves, but the cinnamon caught my attention first. I brewed up a cup and added a small amount of half-and-half and a teensy bit of sugar. The result was a mild, smooth tea with topnotes of spice, but not much spice flavor.<br /><br />I tried Higgins & Burke Earl Grey and enjoyed it, but this chai is a disappointment for me. I had expected something much stronger. I would categorize it as a scented tea because there wasn't much flavor, only some fragrance. Still, it is a nice tea -- it's not objectionably strong or bitter, and that's fine. It's just doesn't have the gusto I was expecting.

review/summary: Better than Tazo and Lipton
review/text: I am a Tazo tea fan and love all their teas. So it surprised me that I loved this English Breakfast tea more than Tazo's Awake tea. Usually I use two teabags per mug of tea. I tried two teabags of the Higgins & Burke tea but it was way too strong. So today I tried just one teabag and it was perfect. I'd say this tea is on the mild side but is perfect with a few spoons of dried milk powder and a packet of stevia. Since I drink coffee in the morning I save this tea for an afternoon drink. I like the pure flavor and will probably use this to make ice tea too. If you are a fan of Lipton then this tea is going to be a little more gourmet!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Had to use two bags for a real taste.<br /><br />- Aftertaste can be bitter.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke English BreakFast Black Tea received a lukewarm reception in our house.  A lot of tea is really, well just tea and this is a perfect example of that.  Higgins & Burke English BreakFast Black Tea isn't a bad tea by any means, but it wasn't particularly memorable either.  While it was mildly enjoyable I probably wouldn't consider purchasing it again.

review/summary: Good tea, but there are better ones
review/text: I do like the natural tea (without a lot of additives, or chemical procedures that make it "caffeine free"). Because of that, these Higgins & Burke black tea bags seemed interesting. However upon trying them I decided to stay with what I currently have.<br /><br />The tea flavor is actually nice. It is a little bit strong, but not too bitter. The real tea taste is not masked with additional flavors, and with a little cream it tastes great.<br /><br />However, it is not strong enough. I needed two bags per my usual cup, whereas one bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5JLY">PG Tips</a> would suffice. Also, while there is no after taste, there is a small (really minor) amount of bitterness. I like smoother tastes. And this takes the tea quality down a notch from perfect.<br /><br />Overall, I can easily give it a high rating, but I would remind that there are better alternatives on Amazon.

review/summary: It has a nice floral taste that would go well with rose petals...
review/text: I'm quite a tea lover, and I often brew up my own iced teas out of loose leaf teas and herbal ingredients.  I even have an entire section of my recipe book dedicated to homemade tea blends!  So, when I saw some tea up on the Vine page, I figured, "why not get it?  You can never have too much tea!".<br /><br />Truthfully, though, I wasn't expecting this tea to be any good.  I've tried out a ton of boxed black teas, and they tend to not compare too well to their loose leaf counterparts.  Most of the boxed black teas I've tried tend to be either bland and flavorless, or bitter combined with a lack of flavor.  So, I wasn't expecting much from this tea.<br /><br />I started off by smelling the tea bag, and I was surprised that it had a pleasant floral tone to it.  So, I brewed it up and I'm pleased to say that they pleasant floral tone is also there in the flavor!  In fact, I was very pleased with the flavor of this for a boxed tea.  It has that nice floral taste (as mentioned previously) and it wasn't bitter at all!  I much prefer a very smooth black tea, and this tea greatly fulfilled that desire.  Not bad at all.<br /><br />So, do I recommend this tea?  Well, yes!  If you are the sort who prefers milder black teas and doesn't enjoy that bitter tannin taste, then this is the plain black tea for you!  In fact, I'd recommend you pick up some dried rose petals too because that would taste great combined with this tea (1 to 1 ratio, I'd say)  If you do like a stronger black tea, then you'd best look elsewhere, but for the rest of us, Higgins and Burke English Breakfast is a fine choice!

review/summary: Any way I brewed it, a bit of a stale taste
review/text: To give this tea a fair shot, I first brewed it exactly as the box said to, and had a cup black, as I usually drink tea.  I was underwhelmed.  There just seemed to be some kind of stale taste there---it didn't taste sharp or whatever the taste is called that I like tea to have!  It wasn't just that it was mellow, you want that in a breakfast tea a little, but it just didn't have a standout taste, and it made the bitter bit of taste not something that complemented the tea flavor, but took away from it.  Then I tried it with sugar.  I liked it a little better that way, but no better than very basic tea like Red Rose or Salada.  Finally I brewed it strong and made ice tea.  I liked it the least that way.  The flavor issues came out more with the strong and the cold, and I didn't finish my glassfull.<br /><br />I like the ideas of this tea---that they are part of the ethical tea partnership and that the box is made from recycled materials, and I will certainly use the rest of the teabags, but it is not a product I would seek out or pay extra for.

review/summary: Tastes pretty good!
review/text: I'm not a fan of the milky, sugary "chai tea" that you get in coffee houses, but I do like all of the spices that go into masala chai.  (FYI - according to Wikipedia, the word "chai" means "tea".  Masala chai refers to the spiced tea.  "Chai tea" means "tea tea".)  This particular version of Masala Chai contains Assam black tea (that's from India), cinnamon, cardamon, ginger, cloves, and "natural flavors".  I'm not sure what those "natural flavors" are, but I like the other ones.  (OK, to be honest, I'm not sure what plain cardamon tastes like, but I frequently put cinnamon and cloves in my plain tea, and the cardamon doesn't seem to be screwing up the flavor of this tea.)<br /><br />I steeped the tea for 3 minutes.  It tasted fine, but it tasted a little better with about a quarter teaspoon of sweetener.  That punched up the cinnamon, ginger, and clove flavors (and probably the cardamon's too) without making it sweet.<br /><br />As of this writing, you can get 6 boxes of this for $18 on subscribe & save.  This is definitely worth $3 for a box of 20.  This has a lot of flavor without tasting like Kool Aid.

review/summary: An Excellent Chai Black +++
review/text: This variant of a Chai Black [tea] is quite authentic-tasting. Chai means "tea" in India by-the-way. It has a rich smell and taste like a "real" India SPICED Chai -- plenty of cardamon and cloves [and other spices] added to a full black tea. They have done well to balance the spices and tea. Even when adding a modest amount of whole milk and brown sugar -- the above is evident. A typical way to actually brew an "India Spiced Chai" is to put black tea, sugar and spices into whole milk [in a pot] and boil it for a while -- even to the point that there is a thin skin over the top of the brew. That this tea [under review] works well made like a usual [Western] black tea -- AS a Spiced Chai -- is excellent. I was a bit wary -- until trying a batch just now -- being very familiar with India spice-tea as well as Western tea. Tiga Garrum Chai +++

It has just the right balance of tea-ness and spice-ness, with just a hint of bite. I can taste cinnamon, cardamom, and I think black pepper, and it goes so perfectly with sugar and milk that I'm restraining myself from a third cup because I don't want to set off my arrhythmia.

review/summary: Spiced for iced or chai
review/text: This is a black tea with cardamon, cloves and cinnamon and ginger. As a "chai" tea, it's, well, not exactly true Indian Chai, which in addition to those sweet spices, has black pepper and is prepared by stewing the tea along with spices into an evaporated milk and water mix in a pot on the stove. How do I know? I have a friend overseas, a Sikh from Thailand, and he has his assistants make it in a little kitchen behind his office and that's how they do it. Chai masala, CTC black Assam tea, raw sugar and evaporated milk. And it's so delicious, served in little glasses and it cools you on a hot day by making you sweat.<br /><br />The Higgins & Burke tea, however, has the spice mixed in the tea bag, and no black pepper, which personally, I find is the best part of chai. But it's convenient and it makes a nice pot of tea, rather reminiscent of Bigelow's famous "Constant Comment" except it has no orange peel. The bags come in individual envelopes, so it's nice for serving in an office setting or at home to guests if they want to brew a mug on their own. It's pretty nice iced, and you can throw in slices of oranges for a real treat, or add some fruit juice (apple is nice) diluted fifty-fifty for a sort of summer punch that is slightly sweet but not cloying. But don't expect "pulled tea" or Indian Chai. For that, go get a box of chai-masala and follow the directions.

The tea is not bitter and does not leave an aftertaste.<br /><br />I left one teabag in the cup for more than 3 minutes and the tea was still very smooth -- even without adding milk or sugar. This is excellent as a hot tea, and even when it cools to room temperature it is still flavorful. The tea lacks the sharp astringency that some other brands of Earl Grey have, so I think it would make a very mild iced tea, although I have not tried it on ice. If you like tea but don't want the harshness associated with some brands, try this one.

review/summary: Third Time Was the Charm
review/text: I didn't know what to expect when I got this tea. After my first cup I sort of turned my nose up. It was a taste I wasn't familiar with and I didn't think I liked it, but when I was a little girl my mother used to tell me to try something three times, before I made up my mind that I didn't like it.<br /><br />I think the first time I heard that was when she gave us (four girls and one boy) spinach for the first time (well it was canned). I really didn't like that. Didn't like it the second time either. But the third time I heaped butter on it and liked it a lot.<br /><br />So, I tried it again and I liked it a little better. Then I thought back and remembered the above spinach story and remembered what the butter did for the canned spinach and I thought, why not try cream and boy of boy did that do it for me. Delicious. So there you go, the third time was the charm for me. Just like with the spinach.

review/summary: mild, more nutty chai
review/text: I love tea. I make it from bags, and brew it from leaves.  I drink pretty much every flavor, including chai.  Twinings is my favorite brand for chai, but I'm always looking for new varieties.  This Higgins & Burke is tasty, but also quite mild.  I found it to have a more prevalent nuttiness than other brands of chai, but it is also far less sharp.  As another reviewer touched upon, this won't stand up to much milk.  I made it with just a dollop and found it to be relaxing and flavorful, but not distinctly chai.  It was also good without milk.  This would be best for tea drinkers who avoid chai because it is too bold for them, or those that just like to switch things up (like me).  Sometimes, I want that chai flavor without the spicy bite (such as Twinings Ultra Spice Chai-yum!).  This a nice alternative for those occasions.<br /><br />The price here on Amazon is very competitive.  Most decent/good teas are about $3 a box in a grocery store.  The Subscribe and Save price is the same, without the hassle of going to the store.  Overall, this is a good tea for the right people.

review/summary: A decent cup of earl grey tea
review/text: I am a frequent drinker of black tea, so I am able to compare this with the many other brands of tea I have purchased before.  It's an OK cup of tea, not bad, but nothing special either.  The ingredients are natural, just black tea and oil of bergamot, but it somehow lacks the flavor of a fine earl grey.  Though the name Higgins and Burke sounds English, it appears to come from distributors in Canada and Texas.  It doesn't say on the teabag where the tea comes from and when I visited the manufacturer's website, it wasn't clear there either.<br /><br />This does not compare with some of the better quality tea makers, such as Barney and Sons.  But for the price, it offers a decent value.

review/summary: Mild Earl Grey
review/text: Earl Grey is one of those blends you often see done a hundred times over, and it's hard to find one you like. Earl Grey: you know when you brew a cup whether that brand is going to be a love it or leave it! My biggest problem with EG blends is that they tend to taste mossy to me, like someone dragged my tea bag through a pond swimming with algae bloom.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke's Earl Grey is not mossy, nor is it overpowering. It's a mild flavor that I was able to enjoy, and didn't need to add anything else to it. No sweetener, no milk/cream, it was great on its own. And I know someone somewhere will cringe, but I even liked it when we added a bag to our usual ice tea brew. Definitely will buy this.

review/summary: Verrry Bergamot.
review/text: I compared this to Ahmad Tea -London- and Twinings of London versions of Earl Gray Tea.  I let them all steep one minute in the same amount of water.<br />Higgens and Burke had the strongest bergamot of the three.  Ahmad was most astringent, H&B second, and Twinigs smoothest.<br />By the third cup. (re-using the same bag) H&B was practically perfect.<br />Since I prefer subtler and smoother  Earl Gray, my recommendation is to use more water (like a small teapot for one bag rather than a cup or mug) and be careful how long you leave it in.<br />If you are a fan of strong tea or double bergamot tea, I think you will really like this.

review/text: I'm really more of a loose-leaf tea drinker, when I have my morning cuppa, and I like it the English way, strong enough to stand to stand the spoon on end, a good dollup of milk and a spoon of sugar. Earl Grey, with the citrusy flavoring is better with honey and no addition of milk. Higgins & Burke is milder than I like when jumpstarting my morning with caffine, but is still a very nice and convienient way for that one single cuppa.

review/summary: Earl Grey Lite
review/text: I first tasted Earl Grey tea in college, after a lifetime of Lipton tea bags.  I was in awe; I never realized tea could have such a seductive aroma, such a delicate subtle flavor.  From then on, I was a convert to naturally fragrant teas, so I was happy to try this one.<br /><br />It is slightly less aromatic than the Earl Greys I have known, and the flavor is even more delicate than the ones I am used to.  But is has a very clean flavor, and a wisp of the smell that endears Earl Grey to me.<br /><br />The tea bags are well constructed, but do leave a  tiny bit of sediment in your cup.<br /><br />Overall a refreshing subtle cup of tea -- Earl Grey Lite?

review/summary: A Well Scented Tea
review/text: The sign of a good Earl Grey tea is the use of real oil of bergamot, not just flavoring. Bergamot is a yellow citrus fruit, in the orange family, native to southern Italy. The fruit is considered inedible, however the oil extracted from the skin has been the foundation of the cologne industry for many, many years. Higgins & Burke Earl Grey is provided in individual, foil-wrapped tea bags. Open a pouch and you are immediately aware of the distinct aroma of bergamot.<br />Higgins & Burke chose asian black tea as the base for their Earl Grey. Unfortunately, the tea is almost dust and somewhat weak.<br />If you allow it to steep long enough, you can end up with a drinkable cup of Earl Grey. If they had chosen a better tea base, the beverage could be better.

The first one was a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061IUKAA">Green Tea</a> that was also bland.<br /><br />I steeped the tea as directed directly into my mug. As mentioned it was very light in flavor and color. This might be a good thing for those that do not like strong teas. Next time I made this tea I steeped it longer to attain the desired flavor. The tea was not very aromatic.<br /><br />I was rather disappointed by the tea, especially when you consider the price. Stash has a better tasting Earl Grey.

review/text: I pretty much drink coffee non-stop and only drink herbal teas when I am not feeling well. I've heard of Earl Grey tea, as I witnessed people from older generations drinking it. First, the fragrance is strong, however pleasing. When I took my first sip, I wanted to spit it out. However, I decided to give it a chance and continued drinking it and I actually like it. Initially, I wanted to throw a pack of Splenda in it, but I found it tastes good with or without sugar and it was a definite pick me up. Perhaps, I'll drink tea more often.

review/text: Higgins & Burke's Earl Gray tea is mild but soothing. I've noticed that this company produces very subtle, mild tasting teas and I've sampled their Green Tea, which also has a light, clean taste. This Earl Gray is a little bland - certainly not as strong as the Mighty Leaf or Tazo, and it's easy to assume that the tea must not be very strong. Was I wrong! I drank two cups just before bedtime, and stayed awake almost all night! I usually have a cup of Lipton black tea before bed, and the caffeine content in it must be very low compared to Higgins & Burke. Needless to say, I won't have any more of this Earl Gray so close to bedtime.

review/text: Higgins & Burke is a company in TX and Canada. This is their blend of Earl Gray Black Tea.  The tea has a wonderful bouquet; which makes each sip all the more enjoyable.  The taste is very mild. Most certainly more than other brands I've tried.  My husband felt it was too light w/ barely a kick of caffeine.... I'm use to drinking lighter blends.<br /><br />The individual tea packets are probably the most attractive I've seen. I took some on the go and even layed them out on a flat surface -- just to test reactions. I noticed more men stopping to look them over than women. The company name and colors are masculine, so I'm guessing that's what caught their attention.<br /><br />I think those who enjoy their tea mild will enjoy Higgins & Burke's Earl Gray Black Tea.

review/text: Whether you like the Higgins and Burke Earl Grey will depend on how strong you like your Bergamot. This one had too-strong a Bergamot aroma/taste for me, almost a lavender aroma/taste to it, so much so I actually checked the ingredients.  It wasn't by any stretch a bad tea--no bitterness, no aftertaste (I don't put anything in my tea), and it brewed a good second cup.  I guess I prefer a bit more black tea flavor and less bergamot. I mostly use loose tea, and when I use a bag tea, I usually use the Twinnings or store-brand (Wegmans) Earl Grey and I'll continue to do so, though I'll finish this box with no real complaint ; it just wasn't my, um, cup of tea

review/summary: A mild Earl Grey
review/text: This is a fairly mild Earl Grey, although it is an excellent black tea. When you open one of the individually-wrapped tea bags, you can clearly smell the bergamot oil -- it is quite pleasant. After steeping for about 3-4 minutes, the tea is very dark, but the bergamot remains somewhat subtle. Considering the great aroma when you open the package, I was hoping for more flavor. Regardless, it isn't a bitter tea and is quite smooth.<br /><br />20 bags are in the box, each individually wrapped. The individual packets do a great job at preserving the product, because you can barely smell the bergamot oil through the packaging. The box is made of 100% recycled fiber, and the product is blended and packaged in Canada.<br /><br />Overall, a good tea, but I wished it was a little more "Earl Grey".

review/summary: A little weak for my taste
review/text: I was excited to receive this product for review through Amazon.com's Vine program.  In the afternoon I prefer a good cup of tea over coffee.  And I prefer loose tea over a convenient tea bag.<br /><br />For the purpose of reviewing the tea I decided to leave the bag intact and brew it as directed.  The scent was inviting but not as potent as when I brew loose tea, so I decided to skip the Half & Half and taste it pure first.  Hmm, not bad, but not great either.  I added a little sugar and tried again.  It seemed to bring out the flavor a bit more but still, so I tried it with a splash of Half & Half.  That washed out the flavor significantly.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good tea for those who are used to a lighter flavor, but I prefer bold taste and am still hunting for the Wow factor I remember from a loose tea that came from Russia I was in love with when I still lived in Germany.  This one didn't even come close, although it does brew a nice cup of tea.  It's just a bit too bland for me.

I'm certainly not a "tea connoisseur". . . but. . . but I know what I like.. . and I've always had a fondness for Earl Grey. . . and I like this Earl Grey.<br /><br />First, the packaging.  Each sachet is of course individually-wrapped.

FYI, Kusmi offers a few different "styles" of Earl Gray.  One of which is not even called Earl Grey but "Anastasia".  If you have tried other brands of Earl Gray and felt they were somewhat "overpowering", then you might want to try Higgins & Burke.  Especially for the reasonable price, it's not bad at all.<br /><br />Kusmi Earl Grey (20 Tea Bags)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001K5LN0">Kusmi Anastasia Tea Bags</a>

review/summary: Fragrant, above-average Earl Grey tea
review/text: As an Earl Grey fan, who has tried numerous branded (boxed, loose and/or tea bag)and specialty types, I found this to be one of the best I ever drank.<br /><br />True, it's not inexpensive for bagged tea, but you can purchase via Amazon subscribe'n save to bring the price down. Given what else is out there in the market at similar price points, this is, in my opinion, a superior offering.<br /><br />It's interesting to read the other reviews: Some folks find it too bland while others say it is too strong. Obviously, it's relative and subjective based on your own taste buds and sense of smell. I find it to be mildly strong and just love the bergamot fragrance. (Opening the individual teabag package is a wonderful start to tea drinking, whether by the cup or the pot. I really loved the fragrance, which seems really fresh and vibrant as opposed to some bagged teas that have a strong fragrance but seem "old" and musty.)<br /><br />If you're an Earl Grey lover, this tea is definitely worth a try. And for those who say it tastes like an herbal tea, I would beg to differ. I have tried numerous herbal teas (which I simply cannot, literally, stomach) and this is not at all in that category.<br /><br />I used two bags in one four-cup pot and it was perfect. I didn't need any lemon or sweetener and drank it "as is" from the pot. To me, this is a sign of a really good tea. You need nothing more than good cold water, proper brewing and it's ready to go.<br /><br />Drinking this tea elevates the experience from "just another cup" you grab on the fly to one that makes you feel as if you're in a really nice tea parlor (OK. Having some homemade scones with it doesn't hurt!).<br /><br />It's the kind of tea I'd brew even if I wasn't in the mood for tea just to enjoy and get a lift from the fragrance.<br /><br />This is my new favorite tea for those times when I need a moment to de-stress and regroup--and pretend I'm living the good life with not a care in the world (Yes, tea can transport me.).

The Higgins and Burke is somewhere in the middle.  It doesn't smack you with that flavor/fragrance of fruit loops like the Bigelow, but has more substance than the PG tips.<br /><br />Regardless of all that, everyone's sense of taste is different and our moods and cravings do swing.  This Higgins and Burke tea is well worth testing to see where it hits your personal palette.

It's not the bright orange rind taste of Constant Comment, more of a lemon/orange oil taste. It's not awful, but it's not the straight and strong Earl Gray I like best.<br /><br />I'd recommend buying this in a smaller quantity first and trying it out before you buy in bulk. I think this is a flavor you'll either love or hate.

review/summary: Good Bagged Earl Grey
review/text: Earl Grey was one of my favorite flavors before I got into loose leaf tea and I still come back to it on a regular basis. The comforting aroma of bergamot the it's flavor mixed with black tea is hard to beat. Of the many brands of Earl Grey I've tried over the years, H&B's is without a doubt one of the better ones.<br /><br />It rises above an average tea bag in that it can produce a well balanced cup over at least two steepings. Just brew it for a shorter time than recommended on the packaging. For me it is under 2 minutes for the first cup and longer for the second. It mixes well with cream and sugar too, though I prefer mine black. Another plus is it's ability to taste good as a cold tea as well as a hot one. The citrusy bergamot flavor is prominent in this mix so perhaps that is its secret.<br /><br />In any event, quality tea leaves and flavorings are evident here and I would purchase it again. There are better loose leaf tea blends available, but as a bagged tea it is hard to beat.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/text: This tea has a wonderful aroma. Earl Gray is a tea used to fight depression, stress, and tension.  Frankly, I just like the taste hot or iced.  I prefer it in the morning as it awakens my senses and gives me just the right jolt to start my day.  Who couldn't use a little "de-stress" tea before their morning commute?<br /><br />This is the best Earl Gray I have tasted, very smooth.

review/summary: Strong bergamot flavor, but still pleasant
review/text: I drink tea occasionally and Earl Grey is usually my tea of choice. I typically drink Twinings brand with some honey. I tried the Higgins & Burke the same way. While it was pleasant, it wasn't quite the same and I think I prefer the Twinings brand over H&B. This tea is, like others have said, very strong on the bergamot and light on the tea. While it tastes good, it tastes almost more like an herbal tea than a black tea. While this won't keep me from drinking the H&B tea, I'll probably still keep buying the Twinings brand.<br /><br />As an aside, H&B has good sustainable practices and uses recycled materials. While I applaud them for being green, I doubt it's something that will carry significant weight for most tea consumers.

review/summary: Best of Britain in a cup
review/text: I know, most people think the best beverage of Britain is the beer. Ok, for some it is but not for me. I used to live in the UK and have wonderful memories of brewing a kettle, making a wonderful cup of tea with milk and sugar and it was like heaven on earth. When I moved back to the states I didn't do that anymore and forgot how amazing it was. Until I received this tea. WOW! It is authentic, and uses the most amazing, fresh ingredients. The bergamot and orange oils are fresh and aromatic and the blend of the flavor with the tea is spot on and delicious! The flavor is perfectly blended and not at all overpowering. This may be the best black  tea I've had, and I love tea! What a find. I am so happy I discovered this!

review/text: Long a fan of Earl Grey tea, Higgins & Burke's is my new favorite. It has an exceptional taste - a strong, rich flavor with the essence of Italian orange bergamot. This premium tea is not bitter. It tastes good both hot or cold. If you're a fan of Earl Grey, do yourself a favor and try this one.

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: I have been drinking more and more tea lately, as I have been trying to cut back on coffee. One of the things I have noticed is that it seems like more and more brands of tea are getting "weaker". I don't know if they are going to cheaper tea leaves, or are using less leaves per tea bag, but in many brands I have had to go to two tea bags per cup of tea. I was pleasantly surprised that this Higgins and Burke Earl Grey led to a robust, flavorful cup of tea with one bag.<br /><br />I make tea using RO (reverse osmosis) water. 99.99% of a cup of tea is water, so for good tea you must begin with good water. I only use RO water in making tea. I steeped the tea for four minutes and then removed the bag. The cup of tea was most excellent, and you could detect the Bergamot, which is the key part of Earl Grey.<br /><br />I often drink Twinings Earl Grey, but between the two, I must say that I prefer the Higgins & Burke.

review/summary: A Delicious Canadian Tea
review/text: When this arrived today I was impressed by the packaging. Each teabag is also nicely wrapped to preserve the delicate aromas in this tea blend. I brewed the tea for ten minutes which seemed perfect. As I went to take a sip the aroma of bergamot definitely got my attention. I would almost go as far as to say this is a very romantic tea. But I could be under the influence of all the other romantic things I've done today including reading poetry and eating French chocolates. Since I wanted to stay up late reading in bed I took the chance and drank this delicious Canadian tea. As they say on the packaging..."indulge...escape." I'd love to try other teas by this company.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Aromatic and smooth tasting for Earl Grey Tea
review/text: I had never heard of Higgins and Burke tea before, but am so pleased with this tea that I will be trying more.<br /><br />The first thing that hits you when you open an individually wrapped tea bag is the wonderful aroma....very pleasing to the senses and a nice, not harsh fragrance.  The tea is equally smooth.......it does not become bitter if you leave the tea bag in the cup while you drink it.  More like darjeeling base tea than other black Earl Grey teas that I drink.<br /><br />If you're spending a fortune at Teavana, then try this instead and save yourself a trip to the mall.  Because individually wrapped tea bags are in a dark brown waxed paper type wrapper that is airtight sealed, it is not likely to lose this quality over time, like your tea in the tin will.  Graceful enough to give as a housewarming gift or small remembrance.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Mild Earl Grey flavor, not too strong
review/text: I pretty much only drink black tea. Other than the occasional mineral water, I drink nothing else. I love black teas and the stronger the better. For those like myself, you will find this version of Earl Grey mild and pleasant. I don't find this tea bitter at all, no matter how long I let the tea bag steep for. If anything I find it even milder than other common brands of Earl Grey, like Bigelow and Tazo. The bergamot is not overpowering at all and I find this even makes for a great to to go with meals because of the mild flavors.<br /><br />After drinking almost the entire box, I rate this as definitely one to order more of. It's a great way to introduce someone to Earl Grey who may not be accustomed to the bold flavors of the blend. It's also a great blend for those who like Earl Grey, but who sometimes find the flavor bitter or too strong. Probably one of the mildest blends I have ever had.<br /><br />No issues with the tea bags releasing any tea leaves into the cup and it makes a nice clear drink, with no cloudiness. No powdery residue left behind and no bitter after taste. This Higgins and Burke blend is delicious and goes really well with an meal.

review/summary: strong bergamot flavor
review/text: This tea has a really strong bergamot flavor. Personally, I prefer Earl Grey teas with a good strong black tea and only a hint of bergamot, so that the flavor of the tea itself is the focus.<br />In this tea, the bright oily citrus tang almost overpowers the taste of the tea. It's a little better if you let it steep for a full 5 minutes, but even then, the bergamot taste is still prominent.<br />It tastes a lot like Stash brand Earl Grey, so if you like that, you'll probably enjoy this one too.

review/text: I liked this tea.  The Italian bergamot orange adds a little extra punch!  Well sealed packets keep the tea fresh, tea bags make it handy to use without the fuss of loose tea.  Definitely a notch above the usual black teas and I'd rate it higher than other brands of Earl Grey that I've used.  Cost still a consideration, but, hey, who doesn't deserve a bit of luxury now and then??  FIVE STARS for this HIGGINS & BURKE EARL GREY tea.

review/summary: Good Taste
review/text: This is the second Higgins & Burke tea that I have tried.  The other one was Higgins & Burke Green Tea.  Usually, I drink either Darjeeling tea or Green tea.  Of course, I am familiar with Earl Grey tea, which is essentially black tea with oil from the rind of the bergamot orange, The Earl Grey in question was a nineteenth century British prime minister.<br /><br />This tea is is indeed very dark; it turns almost black after very little brewing time.  It has a very pleasant aroma and a taste that is not overpowering. Each tea bag is sealed in an individual packet for freshness.<br /><br />It does have a very nice kick, meaning it has a good level of caffeine. I recommend using in the morning or afternoon but not in the evening for anyone whom caffeine keeps awake.

review/summary: Not bad. A touch bitter; better with sugar.
review/text: Amazon sent me some for free to review.<br /><br />If you took away the bergamot ("Earl Grey flavor") leaving only the black tea, I would say I was disappointed with the weak yet slightly bitter flavor. Combined with the bergamot, the bitter begins to make sense. With a touch of sugar the whole thing wakes up and the flavors work pretty well.<br /><br />I would willingly drink this tea again, but it will not be my preferred brand of Earl Grey tea. I think others have a nicer balance and less bitterness.

review/text: I have always loved a good cup of Earl Grey tea, and this Higgins & Burke Earl Grey is no exception! The black tea is quite subtle, and less acidic than most, which makes this an excellent choice for anyone with stomach problems. There is a strong flavor of bergamot orange, which may be a bit off for those die-hard Earl Grey drinkers, but which I found delightful, especially when drank first thing in the morning with my breakfast.<br /><br />I give Higgins & Burke Earl Grey tea five stars and big thumbs up! I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys tea, and especially for the tea connoisseur.<br /><br />***DISCLOSURE: This product was provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an independent and non-biased review.

review/summary: Very tasty. A good alternative to my standard PG Tips.
review/text: I usually drink PG Tips, so I'm used to filtering the taste through a half-cup of "waste-water." This tea, however, has a sweeter backtaste unlike PG Tips, and you actually don't need to filter it.<br /><br />I use one bag per 8oz. mug with half boiling water and half milk, then a teaspoon of sugar. It tastes great, and, of course, the second cup is better.<br /><br />There isn't that bitter aftertaste the Tips is known for, so I may actually be looking into Higgins & Burke in the future.

review/summary: Wonderful cuppa!
review/text: I am a huge fan of tea - I never acquired the coffee taste and so I drink tea for my relaxation, for my morning boost, and just because I like the flavor. It has actually become sort of a hobby of mine, so I enjoy trying new companies and new blends. I was excited to see Higgins & Burke had an Earl Grey tea, as that is one of my favorite flavors. Finding a really good one can be difficult - so much depends not just on the tea itself, but on the Bergamot flavor that is an essential part of this tea. Sometimes the flavor is weak, sometimes it seems stale, and sometimes it is just...off. So I was curious to try this one.<br /><br />I am so pleased to say that it is excellent. There are only two ingredients in this tea - "Premium Black Tea, Natural Oil of Bergamot". The Bergamot aroma is strong and fresh - I could pick up the slight aroma on my fingers after I put the tea bag into the cup. I let the tea steep in the hot water for 4 minutes (suggested time is 3-5 minutes), then added a touch of honey. The overall flavor of this tea is wonderful. It is fresh and light, slightly sweet, not stale in any capacity. I am very impressed. I have had two cups already, and both were consistently good. Higgins & Burke seem well on their way to making me a fan!<br /><br />If you like good tea, then I would have to say I highly recommend this company. Their Earl Grey is excellent, as is their Green Tea.

review/summary: Tea.  Earl Grey.  Hot
review/text: I am a big fan of Earl Grey tea, and have been for many years.  The aroma and flavor does vary from tea to tea, ranging from delicate to robust, but I like them all. I consider that to be in the nature of full disclosure; I am pre-disposed to like this stuff.  And like it, I do.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke's Earl Grey falls on the delicate side, with a warm suggestion of bergamot that offers comfort rather than a stirring rendition of "God Save the Queen."  It makes a tasty cup of tea which would be just as good with milk and sugar as it is black.  At least in my opinion.  The only thing I find curious about it -- and it wasn't really a drawback for me, but it might be for some -- is that when I took the packet out of the box, I got a fleeting whiff of Aspergum.  It dissipated quickly, and wasn't evident in the brew, but I found it odd.<br /><br />Don't let that strangeness put you off if you're an Earl Grey fan; it could just be me losing my mind.  If you've never tried Earl Grey, this isn't a bad place to begin.  And if it matters to you, Higgins & Burke support sustainable tea-growing practices, and all their teas are ethically sourced.  Definitely a plus for me.

review/text: This Higgins & Burke Earl Grey Black Tea compares well to other Earl Grey black teas. I have tried many teas, including a number of Earl Greys. I just tried this variant brewed moderately strong -- and served in four ways -- hot alone and with milk then iced alone and with lemon -- each way with moderate brown sugar as well. I took an initial sip [before adding the brown sugar] and after smelling it carefully and looking at the exact color. It was just fine then and excellent after serving with brown sugar -- but in two ways hot and two ways iced as stated. This Earl Grey black tea is rich, a bit malty [which I like] -- but well balanced with the bergamot adding well to the quality black tea -- with a good amount of tea in each bag being enclosed in foil-lined packets +++

review/text: These tea bags produce quite a good cup of tea.  I generally go for loose leaf tea, but there are times when a bag is simply more convenient.  This Earl Grey has a strong bergamot scent.  The bergamot flavor is strong once brewed, but not overwhelming.  It was easy to brew a cup that was smooth and not too bitter.  I brewed for approximately two minutes, which is my usual for bagged black tea.  The tea was fresh and flavorful.  This is definitely a good choice for those in search of a bagged Earl Grey.

review/text: I usually prefer green or herbal teas, but this Higgins & Burke Earl Grey is a nice alternative. One thing that I usually dislike about black teas is the strong, sometimes bitter, flavor. This one is smooth and mild, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I did not steep for even three of the recommended 3-5 minutes, but it was strong enough for me. The package claims that it has a mild lemon flavor, but I could not distinguish any lemon flavor at all.<br /><br />I also liked the individually sealed tea bags that keep everything nice and fresh.

review/summary: Fine tea with me!
review/text: I love tea but my favorites are all very mild. I love Chrysanthemum, most fruit teas, some mild green teas (not Japanese green tea) but I am not a fan of Earl Grey. It's the same with coffee for me, the milder the better. My experience with Earl Grey in the past (Twinnings) is that it was so strong that I couldn't drink a whole cup. But this one is a milder tea than the other brand so this time I liked it better.<br /><br />I really think that whether or not you will like it depends on your personal preference. Do you like milder or stronger tea. If you prefer milder, go with this one. I smelled the teabag before preparing the tea and noticed that it smelled milder to me. Strong tea is just harsh for me.

review/summary: A Spot of Tea . . . but not quite Spot On Earl Grey
review/text: I think it was Jean Luc Picard with his "Earl Grey, hot." on Star Trek:TNG that first had me try that particular type of tea.  But it rapidly has become my favorite in the family of black teas with flavoring. I've enjoyed trying out many different brands of Earl Grey to narrow in on my favorites, so when the opportunity came along to try Higgins & Burke's Earl Grey, I snagged the chance.<br /><br />Among other brands I tend to dislike Bigelow as being too mild and flavorless.  Twinings and Stash both make a fair cup of Earl Grey, and they tend to be my regular brands to buy from the store shelves when I'm in need of more.  Both have a robust black tea with a nice balance of bergamot oil and fragrance that appeals to me.  I tend to prefer a stronger tea that holds up well with milk.  When I'm splurging on my favorite, it's usually Good Earth Earl Grey.  Higgins @ Burke's Earl Grey, I'm afraid to say, falls somewhere between Bigelow and Stash teas for me.<br /><br />My chief complaint is that it is too mild--it's a very delicate version of the tea that really doesn't hold up well with milk.  There's also a very odd sort of dry anise flavor to the tea that doesn't match up with my expectations for Earl Grey.  The bergamot flavor is there, but it isn't super strong.  This is best for tea drinkers who prefer lighter blends, more delicate teas and probably drink their Earl Grey plain.  It just doesn't match up with my preferences.<br /><br />Given that I've also tried Higgins @ Burke's Green tea, my observation would be that this company overall delivers a milder version of teas with some unexpected flavors.  Not bad, certainly, but not really *my* cup of tea.<br /><br />Happy Drinking! ^_^ Shanshad

review/text: I'd had high hopes for Higgin's & Burke's Earl Grey tea, as I truly enjoyed their green tea blend.  An avid tea drinker, I've sampled a lot of different Earl Grey blends. This is the first one that upon trying a sip, I had an overwhelming taste of licorice, not bergamot.  Since I am not a fan of licorice, it wasn't a pleasant discovery.  Thankfully, the taste does 'mellow' out after a few more sips to a more 'Earl Grey' flavor, the bergamot becoming more prominent, but it's not the strongest cup of Earl Grey that I've ever had.  I'm keeping in mind that people can have different reactions to flavor and will probably offer this to friends who enjoy licorice more than I do.

review/summary: Worthy of Jean Luc Picard
review/text: I'm big on organic and all natural teas from manufacturers that are environmentally friendly and free trade approved. Higgins & Burke serve an all natural tea and do a good job environmentally - 100% recycled (55% post consumer packaging), and are certified from the Ethical Tea Partnership, Rainforest Alliance, OCIA, US Organics and have Kosher certification (according to their website). So check, check, check and check. Great pedigree but how about the taste?<br /><br />This Earl Grey is a mild mix that tastes clean and crisp. A very good tea for sipping while unwinding at home (or on the star ship Enterprise.) I think I could go with some brands at the local market that are less expensive but compared to the organic section at local markets this is a very good value as the cheapest I've found good all natural teas in this quantity would be closer to thirty-five bucks.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good tea from a socially responsible company at a very good price. Recommended.

review/summary: Very Mild
review/text: Earl Grey tea is a favorite variety of mine and although the Higgins & Burke tea is delicious, it is a bit too mild for my taste. In hopes of deepening the brew and depth of flavor I let the tea steep for twenty minutes but it was still very weak. It is quite smooth without a hint of bitterness, but also rather bland.<br /><br />This tea would be perfect for someone who dislikes strong tea and/or has a habit of forgetting the tea bag in the cup or pot because this tea never reaches an undrinkable state.

review/summary: Delicious Tea
review/text: The Higgins & Burke Earl Grey tea is delightful. The box is really easy to open as are the tea bags themselves. I think the scent of Earl Grey tea should be evident as soon as you open the wrapper for the tea bag and that distinct aroma is present but not overpowering. Earl Grey tea should have a specific flavor and Higgins & Burke has used the perfect blend of bergamot and black tea. I love that these are the only two ingredients as well.<br /><br />Higgins & Burke Earl Grey tea is the perfect way to start your morning or for enjoying during afternoon tea.

review/summary: Higgins & Burke Green Tea
review/text: A tea expert I am not. However, my husband and I recently switched from coffee in the morning to English breakfast yea and we drink green tea with dinner and since we use and like Higgins & Burke green tea, we were anxious to try their Earl Grey. We've had Earl Grey in the past and I'm not sure why we settled on breakfast tea instead with breakfast, probably just because of the name, you know breakfast tea with breakfast. But now, after having tried this, we're switching. We drink it with milk and it like it very much.
