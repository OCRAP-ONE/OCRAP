review/summary: Best Almonds Ever
review/text: I recently discovered the Salt & Vinegar Almonds they are delicious. The individual size is perfect for when on the go. I also purchased the cans for at home. Almonds are a very heart healthy snack, just try to limit yourself to a few a day. For my taste I would like to have more vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Perfect snack, perfect size!
review/text: I love salt and vinegar chips, but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross, but was willing to give it a try.  And boy they are great!  They have about twice the vinegar punch of most chips, and are amazingly good, and the fat is the good kind, and you get plenty full on the almonds.  Mmmmmm.<br /><br />I was buying the tins (which are sometimes available at the grocery store), but then realized I couldn't stop once I opened a tin and was eating something like 1,200 calories in a single day just on almonds.  So these packs are perfect - there are enough almonds to really satisfy a hungry stomach, but not so much to blow your diet.  And they're great to stash when you know that you won't be able to grab a real meal, but don't want to find yourself at a vending machine or 7Eleven buying crap b/c you're so hungry.  Even my (naturally thin) hubby loves them.  Perfect!

review/text: This flavor is the best of the bunch by far.  I am reluctantly on a diet that allows for a few almonds as a snack.  I tried these and I was hooked.  Unfortunately, most stores do not carry this flavor.  My first case went very quickly, as every co-worker who tried them wanted a can of their own.  I recommend them to anyone, not only those of us trying to stick to a diet that deprives us of less healthy snacks.

review/summary: Absolutely the yummiest of the Blue Diamond flavored almonds
review/text: I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried. They have the nice fresh-tasting almonds you expect from Blue Diamond, and you can actually taste the wasabi (unlike the jalapeno smokehouse, where the jalapeno part is really elusive).<br /><br />I was reluctant at first to try this. Didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. Terrific snack almonds (if you don't mind saltiness). Love em.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: You can definitely taste the salt & vinegar
review/text: Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too "dry," some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are "too" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12.

review/summary: A nice enough flavor, but I wouldn't describe it as either "Blazin'" or "Buffalo Wing."
review/text: I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their "BOLD" line. Alas, their definition of "BOLD" is apparently "a little too spicy for kids." This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-"blazin'." It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>. But it doesn't taste much like anything in particular. They could have called it "BOLD Generic Faux-Spicy Snack to be Eaten Brainlessly While Watching the Game" flavor and it would have been more accurate.

review/summary: Not the best flavor
review/text: Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.<br /><br />For spiciness they are better than the habanero but not as much as the wasabi can be (though in all fairness the wasabi is in a whole different taste spectrum anyway)<br /><br />Flavorwise is where they lose out. They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.

review/summary: Not As Balanced As Other Bold Flavors, But Not Bad
review/text: I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other "Bold" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the "soy" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!

review/text: To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again.

These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol.

review/text: I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that.

You can eat 'em by the handful, and probably will once you taste them.<br /><br /> However, true hot-pepper fans know that the heat of the Habanero pepper is a fearsome thing. You won't find much of it here, just a little hint. That's probably for the best, given that most people can't tolerate the blazing intensity of those devilish little peppers. But I kind of wish Blue Diamond would put out a "BOLD, and This Time We Mean It" line for those of us who really do love spicy foods.

This price is better than I get them at Wally World for the 6oz can and they are cheaper there than anywhere else.

review/summary: A Great Spicy, Healthy Snack!!
review/text: Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.  So if you are looking for a spicy snack that is fairly healthy, give these a try.

review/text: first of all -- they're good.  really good.  go back for more and lick the bowl when they're gone - good.<br /><br />That said -- they're not quite as bold as you might hope.  I mean -- I'm from Texas.  Bold should be really BOLD.  But they are good -- so we'll just overlook it.  Yummy.<br /><br />And they are almonds -- one of those wonder nuts so full of B vitamins and other good stuff that you should be eating an ounce a day just for health sake.  But they're good enough that it's not exactly an intelligence test whether you'll want to eat them.

review/text: These almonds are delicious. When you first start chewing, they taste like the plain Smokehouse brand. After a few seconds the Jalapeno heat kicks in. Not overwhelming but just enough to make the snack wanting you to eat a few more. Only bad part is that they are not available in the 38oz tub or jar like the Habanero BBQ flavor that is a better value. If you like them as I do, you can go through a 6oz can very quickly.

review/text: I became hooked on these tasty tidbits, but after a while, I couldn't find them at my local stores anymore.  I tried Amazon and found I could order them in packs of six.  While the price is a little higher than I'd like, that is overridden by the fact that I can indeed get them, and they are delivered right to my door.  Ordering two packs gives me free shipping, too. These almonds are delicious by themselves, but when mixed with dark chocolate, they become irresistible.  The yummy recipe goes like this: take two almonds and one Hershey's dark chocolate kiss.  Pop the two almonds in your mouth and chew a little. Then pop in the chocolate kiss and chew, mixing the two together.  Sheer bliss!  I've become addicted and don't know what I'd do if these flavored almonds ever become unavailable.

review/text: I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.

review/summary: Perfect Snack
review/text: I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel "mouth-satisfied" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value.

review/summary: Full of flavor
review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

review/text: I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, "hey that happens, no big deal..." A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, "hey that happens, it's hot out..." But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, "hey these are really salty" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.

review/text: I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought "When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too.

review/text: We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

review/summary: Semi-Healthy Eats!
review/text: All Annie Chung bowls are delicious, without a doubt. I believe everything to be in the perfect state of consistency, the sauce is neither too thick nor too thin, the noodles the perfect thickness. The flavor is actually not the typical Pad Thai flavor as you would get at a chain restaurant such as Pei Wei. It is again the perfect amount of flavor, just as the rest of the elements are well proportioned.<br />However, as ALL ready-made dishes are, this is full of sodium. I believe this dish to be on the healthier end of the ready-made noodle spectrum. You will get a heartier meal out of an Annie Chung bowl than out of any ramen package. It is far healthier than instant Yaki-soba which follows a bit of the same preparation tactic (freeze-dried veggies, etc.).<br />Basically, this is a very nice occasional treat. Tastes are discriminating, but I do really enjoy this bowl.

review/text: Annie Chun's Pad Thai Noodle Bowl is EXCELLENT! With its savory sauce and peanut topping, it's a way to enjoy the taste of Thailand in your own home. It's easily made (only 2 minutes in the microwave) However,it does need extras. Stir fry some tofu,veggies,or something like that to make it heartier. It could also use a squeeze of fresh lime like the original recipe. As usual, Annie Chun brings a taste of Asia to your kitchen!

Extremely unnecessarily powerful flavor... kind of like drinking soy sauce and salt together. I guess someone might like it if their taste buds are numb.<br /><br />I will never touch another Annie Chun's product again because of this experience. I don't think their taste testers have my tastes because that was nasty to the EXTREME!<br /><br />If you buy this, then good luck.

review/summary: Edible, but not good
review/text: Pad thai is the first thing I order at any thai restaurant. It varies depending on the restaurant, but I've always know it to have a tangy peanut sauce that's slightly sweet.<br /><br />However, these noodles just don't taste anything like any of the pad thai dishes I've had. It's also just not very good. The first thing I noticed upon opening the noodles packet was the unnatural smell it emitted. I tasted the noodles plain, and they were very noticeably sour with another unnatural note (detergent... perhaps). I know I did not get an expired package because every Annie Chun's bowl I've had was just like this. And they were all a year or two from expiration.<br /><br />I thought it might get better when I blended in the flavorings, but it didn't improve. Very sour, as if the noodles were seasoned primarily with vinegar. I gobbled them up because I was very hungry at the time, but they were not all that good. They're not very unpleasant, but they could be much better. Though, one nice thing about these is that they're very generous on the noodles, so they fill you up (they left me very satisfied even though I had been famished when I was making them).<br /><br />You also might want to consider that they have strong green onions. My boyfriend had to admit to me (trying not to sound harsh) that they made my breath smell of onions hours afterwards. We're close enough that we don't get embarrassed by things like that, but you that you might not want to have this in the office.

review/summary: My Thoughts
review/text: Even after reading the reviews I went ahead and made an order.<br /><br />The Good-- for something that is a packaged and pre-cooked off the shelf product, I would say it's pretty good. If you're used to eating Ramen Cup-o-Noodles, hands down Annie Chun wins.<br /><br />The Con-- Sure this doesn't taste just like the Pad Thai from a restaurant. I would say you have to be an idiot to expect any product/brand like this to offer a 1:1 experience. This product contains no meat or tofu.<br /><br />An extra note : I started out by buying these from Food Pyramid. When I got my first order from Amazon I noticed the bowl was engineered differently. Once I opened it, I noticed the sauce looked different also. The taste was different. It had more of a peanut flavor and I would say it was more of a mild plus, rather than a mild on the heat index. The rest of the ingredients were the same. I wanted to know why it was different. The packaging looked the same. At first I thought... Oh Amazon is just selling secondary product. I thought maybe the factor screwed up and sold it to Amazon on the cheap. Then I looked closer and saw something interesting. [...] - The package from Food Pyramid was labeled as Annie Chun, Inc. The one from Amazon was labeled JP Foods, Inc. Both had relatively close expiration dates, so I'm not sure what going with that. Did Annie Chun sell out to JP Foods? I don't know, but for a product that had the exact same package design, it was not the same item.

review/summary: Not "Pad Thai" but NOT BAD!
review/text: These convenience noodls are microwaveable, fast to make, can be done in an office or while camping and are all natural with no preservatives or MSG. I'm a big fan of them. I keep a store of these at work for when I just don't have time to go to lunch but I want something hot and soothing.<br /><br />I've said right up front, these do not taste like Pad Thai. Not exactly. But they taste GOOD. Your restaurant pad thai is going to have a more savory, tangy sauce, there are fresh toppings such as lime wedges, mung bean sprouts, cilantro, and Thai basil. Of course, you get none of that in this package. But for what these are, they taste good. There is a paste-like sauce in a packet, a dry packet of peanut chunks to dust on top, and the usual round wheat noodles. You reheat the noodles in water, drain it off then add the sauce, the peanuts and you are good to go.<br /><br />If you want to make it more tasty, you COULD add some lime juice, some cilantro, even some bean sprouts, but if you are eating noodles from a packet, chances are you don't have fresh ingredients to hand. So, enjoy these for what they are, savory, tangy noodles and do not imagine House of Siam in your mind's eye (tongue, whatever.)
