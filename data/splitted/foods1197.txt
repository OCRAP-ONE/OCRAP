review/text: Normally with Jelly Belly beans I never worry about put more then 1 in my month at once. These however don't mix with each other and are pretty bad by themselves. I think it's the attempt to put the milk/yogart favor in that just doesn't work. Get something else...anything else. Jelly Belly get a new taste tester group and try again.

review/text: We normally love all Jelly Belly flavors, but Smoothie Blend was a disappointment.<br /><br />Pro: Fresh/Fast Delivery<br />They arrived in a timely manner and were very soft and fresh.<br /><br />Con: Awful Taste<br />I purchased these for my husband who LOVES jelly beans. He thought they tasted awful and only ate them so I wouldn't feel bad. I tried them and, to me, they tasted like dye. I'm not a huge fan of jelly beans, but Jelly Belly beans normally are pretty tastey. Smoothie Blend was not good at all. Don't waste your money on it.

review/summary: strong, coffee-like flavor
review/text: I love carob, so I had to try this carob molasses. I was surprised by the flavor, which is nothing like carob powder. In this much more concentrated form, the carob takes on a coffee-like flavor. It still tastes sweet, but the flavor is very intense. It reminds me a bit of blackstrap molasses, too.<br /><br />I think this will be great in homemade ice creams or in baking. It might even work well on meats.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned damaged jars or lids, but my three jars arrived intact with no leaks.<br /><br />My only complaint is the expiration date. Mine are only good for a few months, and since these only come in packs of three, I am stuck with a whole lot of carob molasses and not a lot of time. Then again, maybe carob molasses simply does not last that long & there is no way around that issue.<br /><br />A suggestion for Amazon is to note the expiration dates of current stock, although I bet that would be a logistical nightmare.<br /><br />I may give some to friends.

review/text: If you like carob and you like baking, this is an excellent product.  You can substitute this in any recipe that calls for molasses and it will add a rich carob flavor.  It's not quite as sweet as regular molasses so you may have to adjust recipes accordingly (some people recommend substituting 1/4 of the molasses with honey).<br /><br />I had no problems with the shipping, all jars arrived intact and without leaking.

review/summary: Can't be shipped
review/text: I'm still trying to figure out what to do with this stuff after buying it on sale (it tastes sort of like coffee/artificial chocolate syrup), but be ready for leakage if you order this product. It has no inner seal and if the jar rests on its side the sticky syrup begins to flow out. Squeezing isn't even necessary. Some jars will miraculously make the trip upright, some will only leak a little, and some will leak enough to warrant asking Amazon for a replacement. Amazon will send you another case and the same thing will happen; but out of two cases you should have at least the makings of three jars. If, however, the box begins to drip, UPS will return it as damaged, and it may take three or more orders to get a full case of molasses. It is of course necessary that this item be packaged separately, which means you'd need to have Prime to avoid shipping charges.

review/summary: Deep but uncomplex chocolate flavor, poorly stored
review/text: I am a chocolate expert, and expected more of this chocolate than I got. It was poorly stored, so the chocolate is brittle and the cocoa butter has risen to the surface, so it's no good for nibbling, but when you melt it, i.e. for baking, it is much better. All low notes (no fruit or floral notes) makes for a chocolate that you should not use by itself in baking, it just doesn't have enough complexity. But mixed with other chocolates it will provide solid support.

review/summary: Very happy with this product
review/text: I've purchased these before individually at the pet store at a much higher cost than buying in bulk here. I'm very happy with the quality of this product - all came individually wrapped in a large cardboard box as pictured. Best of all - no smell (unlike other natural pet treats or chews)! All my dogs, including a picky eater, are enticed by the buffalo (bison) taste.<br /><br />Be advised: this is not a chew product for aggressive chewers unless you are looking to give them a quick snack. Since it is jerky, it doesn't have the hardness of other products intended for longer chewing time. However, it works perfectly for my allergy-prone medium-level chewer as a 10 minute-long treat.

review/summary: VERY VERY NICE STUFF
review/text: I became aware of this product after reading an article about bugs in food and watched the accompanying video that showed the moving critters on a strawberry.  Oh my.  Then continued reading and learned about FIT, read the reviews, and tried it.  AND LIKE IT VERY MUCH.  I now have a new routine.  I use my large salad spinner to wash produce.  From parsley and kale to peaches and apples, I fill the thing with filtered water and a cap of FIT, swoosh it, let it sit for a few minutes, lift the basket out, dump the water, put the basket and produce back in and fill with fresh water to rinse good.  I lift the basket out and put it over a large bowl so that water can drain out.  And I recyle the second rinse water.  The produce has a clean and fresh feel to it with absolutely no hint that it's been rinsed in FIT.  I really really like it.  There's probably ways to make a homemade version of this but if you're not inclined to do that, buy this stuff immediately.  It's really a pleasure.

review/text: First, you can either soak or spray this product.  If you're lazy like I am you can put it in a spray bottle, spray your produce in a colander in the sink, and rinse a bit later. I've never had it affect the taste or appearance of food in any way (with the exception of when it starts to clean the wax from apples & the wax turns whiter & starts to chip off).  When I've used the soak method, I've seen the dirty water after, so I do feel like this does a nice cleaning job.  I love this stuff and many grocery chains don't carry it reliably, so it's great that Amazon has it!

And the standards of inspection are quite lax to say the least.

When I came to Amazon to order more - much to my horror (but appreciation to reviewers who made me aware) - I found out these treats are Made In China!!!!  Why would Dogswell do that?  They claim some of their other products are manufactured in the US - so why not all of their products?  Obviously China was the lowest bidder.  I hope Dogswell will move their facilities stateside - so until them - I will no longer buy, support this product.  Too bad.  Dogswell - are you listening  - do you care?

review/summary: MY dog almost die from eating only 2 happy hips duck jerky
review/text: I am a health nut I make my dogs meals everyday. I bought these treats not seeing that they were MADE IN CHINA. He had only 2 of these. He almost died he was paralyzed in his back legs and could not stand or walk, blood in his water like stools and vomiting. I still don't know if he will be ok I have over 1,000.00 vet bill and its not over yet. Please BEWARE I don't want any others to suffer the way Moe has. Check on the internet this has been going on since 2007 and the FDA has a warning but no recall.

review/text: My dog got ill after eating these treats (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting).  I would not recommend them to any other pet owner and I agree that folks should be concerned about the "Made in China" aspect of these treats.  The packaging makes them appealing as a natural healthy treat for dogs, but purchase with caution.

review/summary: My dog loves these but...
review/text: I have to agree that I am not comfortable with treats made in China, and also find it difficult to believe in the all-natural, cage-free claims. Why not make them in the U.S.? I am trying to decide if I should keep the ones I already have or throw them away and get something I trust. The company claims they test for many dangerous chemicals and additives, but some enterprising criminal somewhere is bound to come up with something that nobody has thought to test for, imo. That's what I'm afraid of. *sigh*

review/summary: made in China
review/text: After reading an article today about the FDA cautioning pet owners about chicken jerky and chicken strips made in China, I am wondering if that is what caused my dog do be so ill (and $380 in vet bills) three weeks ago, a few hours after eating a Vitality Chicken Breast strip. He has eaten them in the past and loved them and has since (before I read the article) had a few more from the same package without incident. His illness (throwing up, bloody stool, loss of appetite) might be unrelated but I am throwing away the rest of the package and staying away from dog foods made in China.

review/text: As with the Atlantic Haddock Chowder, I found that potatoes reigned the day.  It really needs more clams!!  I bought cans of diced clams and added one to each can of soup.....it made it sooo much more delectable and more 'clammy' tasting!!  Then add fresh milk, a little butter, and lots of fresh black pepper and this soup is scrumptious.  I will be buying more in the future.  Of course, having to add another can of clams makes the costs of this clam chowder very expensive but as a special treat, they are well worth it.

Once fat is rendered, add the following to the pot:<br />Pour 1 can of Atlantic Clam Chowder<br />Pour 1 can of Delallo Chopped Sea Clams with juice<br />Pour some Heavy Cream or Half n Half into the pot...decide how much you want...make it as runny or as thick as you like by cooking it down.  I used 1 cup of cream.<br />Salt and pepper to taste.<br /><br />DELICIOUS!!!  Time to order some more so I don't run out.

review/text: These all-natural snacks are wonderful for anyone but particularly nice for those on a restricted diet.  The simple nuts-and-berries approach is a great flavor even if you are not on a restricted diet.  Unlike a lot of the so-called "health food" bars that are out there, these do not have the cardboard flavor so typical of such snacks.  If you are counting calories, you might want to look elsewhere but if you want a full flavor snack without gluten or processed sugars, this is the snack for you.

review/summary: Tasty mix of sweet and savory
review/text: These bars are a great if you like snacks that are a little bit sweet and  a little bit savory.  I love that the nuts are whole and huge so you really get a sense of what you are eating.  I can be picky about nutrition and snack bars because sometimes they are overly sweet or leave you feeling hungry an hour or so later.  Thankfully for me, these do neither.  I also appreciate the nutritional information on these.  At 190 calories (and 11 grams of fat) they are perfect for a snack or pairing with a salad or half sandwich to make a filling lunch.  The only thing I wish is that these were a little less sugary.  I'd rather that a sweetener wasn't the second ingredient on the list (especially wen there is another sweetener listed on the ingredients and some of the dried fruits seem to be sweetened with apple juice, but otherwise this bar is pretty fantastic and satisfying.

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: These are basically a handful of nuts, mixed together with some fruit with a tasty goo to hold it all together.  They taste great and fill me up for hours.  My diet is increasingly basic, so I tend to steer clear of power bars that are filled with mystery ingredients that have been powdered and reformed. You can see and identify every ingredient in these bars, they taste great, and they are pleasantly filling.<br /><br />Primarily nuts, Pure bars are higher in fat than some of the other bars, but it's good, healthy fat from nuts, not palm oils so it's the kind of fat that your body actually needs to continue operating properly.  If you don't eat tons of fat elsewhere in your diet eating a small handful of nuts is probably not a big issue for most healthy people - but don't take my word for it, ask your doctor.<br /><br />I used to carry ziplocks of almonds around, but too often they just left me feeling unsatisfied. These bars nail both my physical hunger and my emotional need to eat something satisfying.  I carry one in my computer bag for those days when I can't break for lunch.

review/text: Good tasting snack.  In my opinion this is more of a healthy snack as opposed to a protein bar.  The protein level is 5g.  It tastes real good and contains dried nuts and fruit.  It is the summer when I am writing this review and I need to be careful where I store them as heat does cause it to melt.  I left one in my car and the heat made it very sticky.  All in all I am very satisfied with it and again it is great as an afternoon snack or whenever you need a quick pick up in energy.

review/summary: Very great and tasty, but a lot of fat
review/text: These fruit bars were delicious. Chewy, moist, slightly sweet and very enjoyable. My family and I ate them in the mornings for breakfasts, put them in the lunch bags for a snack, and used them to curb the hunger edge in between meals. These bars did not disappoint. They are the perfect size and have a simple packaging that makes it convenient to put them in your pocket and take them anywhere with you. Prior to this my family primarily liked nature valley bars, but for the most part they are pretty messy. These were easy and simple to eat no fuss, little mess. This is very important. The only draw back was the saturated fat. If you are not counting calories or worried about your cholesterol its not important to you. But if you have to be careful with your intake of certain foods you will have to keep your eye on this one. This bar won't really make or break you, yet it can tip you over the edge if you happen to have a problem. Overall we enjoyed the fruit bar, there is not much I would change.

review/text: These bars have a very fresh tart taste due to the cranberries, blueberries, and pomegranates. These taste wonderful and the ingredient list is relatively short and contains a lot of really healthy things (in addition to the fruits: chia seeds, almonds, peanuts, and sunflower seeds). I have been using these as a quick fuel-up snack to power me through my 6 am killer boot camp class and they definitely provide enough staying power for a hard-core workout. I also found them to be very chewy (remove your fillings chewy). As other reviewers have noted, these are also very very sticky.

review/summary: A very yummy snack
review/text: These snack bars have a delicious tart berry taste, and a wonderful crunch. Not surprising, since the ingredients are essentially raw nuts and berries, held together with a sticky fruit goo. In fact the stickiness could be a strike against them, if you eat them in the car while rushing from one place to another as so many people do. They contain 190 calories, so indulge with caution. They may not be suitable for small children who don't clean their teeth as well as we'd like, because ... well, because they're sticky.<br /><br />But did I mention that I love the taste? If you need a delicious and substantial snack with low sodium and no cholesterol, give these bars a try. I haven't sampled the other flavors and in fact I don't have a lot of experience with snack and protein bars, but I think I'll stick with this one.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2011

review/summary: Super Sticky Snack Bars
review/text: This is the first product that I have tried from this company, and it was just ok.  It mostly tastes like peanuts, even though almonds are the first ingredient listed.  There is an an underlying fruity note, but it is not very assertive.<br /><br />The main problem with these bars is the lack of crunch.  They are so chewy as to be almost too much trouble to eat.  Part of that problem may lie with the fact that the box sat in the sun for an hour in 90 degree heat after the mailperson delivered it.  However, other reviewers reported that the bars were very sticky so the heat may not be entirely to blame.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: Delicious, But Half The Calories Are From Fat
review/text: These Pure Natural Bars are absolutely delicious and good for you, but not good for your waistline. Loaded with cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds and peanuts, they are simply a sticky and crunchy delight. All berries strengthen your artery walls and do wonders for your body, as do nuts, so these bars excel at giving you much more than fiber.<br /><br />Each bar has 190 calories, 100 calories from fat. The sodium is low at 95 mg and the cholesterol is zero. This is one of those treats that your body needs, but because of the fat calories- not that often. Two cupcakes also have 100 calories from fat, but of course don't give you this great artery protection and fiber. This is a great healthy bar to have once a week, but never daily, as it's difficult to burn off 100 fat calories.

review/text: Nutty crunch is a good name for this bar because it has a very nutty taste to it, which is a good thing. The superfruits used are of the tart variety so this does not have an overly sweet taste, but more of a natural taste like grabbing a handful of nuts and fruit from a bowl. The cranberries give it a certain tartness that some will love and some will be put off by. This is a very wholesome bar that deserves to be bought.

review/summary: Reminds me of a good trail mix
review/text: I admit, I was skeptical when I saw these were coming. They screamed "health food" which my experience has taught me usually did not mean tasty. I was incorrect. Very incorrect. They aren't a large bar, probably similar in size to a store bought, cheap granola bar. What they lack in size, they make up for in taste. These bars are jam packed with flavors I wasn't expecting. All kinds of sweet and tangy fruit bits, like cranberry and blueberry float freely in the mix. Plenty of nuts to get a solid crunch from, like almonds. There are some oats and probably the part I liked best: sunflower seeds. One of the most underrated pieces in the bar. But all of these mixed together hold tight.<br /><br />The biggest challenge I had with these, was getting them out of the package. They are probably packed right after being formed, so the honey-like substance holding everything together sticks to the wrapper. I do mean sticks. It could take me a good 30 seconds to get the bar out of the wrapper, but aside from some sticky spots on the wrapper, nothing from the bar stuck to it or to my fingers. Which is great compared to a lot of other bars out there.<br /><br />So it's a great bar, filled with flavors that really remind me of a good trail mix, in a bar form. They're just a little small for me and take a little too long to get out of the wrapper.

review/text: Pure natural bars are a good snack if you are on the go, and need something between meals.  They live up to their billing in that they are basically a plethora of nuts and fruits together in bar form, and the taste is quite good.  They certainly are packed full of nuts and fruit, but in the process of holding them together they can become a bit sticky.  The protein content is pretty good as well (5g), and they are not heavy on calories.  The main downside to the bars is the high fat content for a bar.  However, if you are looking for a natural snack, loaded with nuts and fruits this is the bar you will want to pick up.

review/summary: Nearly all the "superfoods" packed into one bar... including Chia Seeds
review/text: This bar boasts cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds, and the new popular "superfood" Chia Seeds (sold quite expensively under the name "Benvia Gold", among others).  At 190 calories, it is true that 100 of them are from "fat", but that is the nature of nuts as they are classified. 5 grams of Fiber, 5g of protein, 22g of carbs... so a lot of good stuff, though they are not packed with any Vitamins (4% iron and 2% vitamin C). And yes, they are gluten free.<br /><br />Certainly, as others have noted, it is very sticky, but tastes good (according to me, my wife, and father), though my 7 year old daughter, who is not generally picky, did not like them that much. While not "diet" per se... they are fairly filling.<br /><br />With some of the Amazon promotions (look above), you can basically get them down to $1 a bar.<br /><br />One final side note... and I offer this with a chuckle: The creator, "Veronica" writes that she developed these because "At age 6, my daughter decided to become a vegetarian..."  Far be it for me to judge the parenting of another to whom God has entrusted their child, but if one of my children made such an announcement at such an age, it would be quickly remedied by an immediate, "No, you are not," reinforced by a subsequent trip to Mickey-D's for a Hamburger Happy Meal (double meat, if they'd oblige me).<br /><br />Ohh... and if you want to look further into the Chia Seeds for purchase: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014LNIPI">Chia Seeds 3 Pound (Chemical Free)</a>

review/text: At first I thought these bars were okay, but after having a few more of them, I realized they are pretty darn good.  If you eat them when you really aren't hungry, they might not seem that great, but when you are hungry, the crunchy nuts, and sweet fruits are very tasty.  These aren't diet bars, or high protein bars, just good tasting snack bars.  My 15 year old athletic daughter also enjoys them and I know they would be great for an after school snack  before she has a team practice.<br /><br />The only minor negative about them is that they are a little sticky feeling, like the honey is still on them.  If you don't have something to wipe your fingers off with, then it could get annoying, but I would still buy/eat these bars even if I knew I would end up with sticky fingers.

review/text: Almonds,peanuts, sunflower seeds,cranberries, pomegranates and blueberries are a delicious blend in this snack bar.<br /><br />The texture is not rock hard, nor too chewy. It is perfect.<br /><br />The taste is nutty, semi-sweet,not disgustingly sweet and has a clean and healthy taste. With 190 calories a bar, it is perfect for between meals or to get by a long day on a light lunch.<br /><br />I really like the taste ,texture and appreciate the wholesome ingredients. I'd recommend them in a heartbeat as a healthy snack bar.

review/summary: Great on Protein and Taste, but high sugar
review/text: Superfruit Nutty Crunch bars are very tasty.  The cranberries add twang, the nuts add substance.  They are a good mix of protein and carbs to keep you going.  One bar is a great breakfast that kept me going all morning.  My husband is an athlete, and he liked them too.<br /><br />That said, for all the good protein and carbs, the bars are pretty high on sugar--about the same as Luna or any other granola bar you could find.<br /><br />Still, the taste and density kind of balance out the sugar.  For breakfast, they are ideal, for a pre-bedtime snack, not so much.

review/text: These bars are really great tasting and they dont have that funny taste that most health bars have.  It is a nice fruity taste and is very pleasing.  These are all natural gluten free bars.  These make a great snack and my kids loved them as well.  They can be a little sticky but are a great treat.  I wish they had a little more protein in them but that might give it a more cardboard flavor. though.

review/text: I cannot say enough good things about the flavour and vegany goodness of these delicious bars. They are just the right level of sweetness; peanuts are second to my favourite, almonds (!); and the fruit blend creates a really joyful zing on the tastebuds.<br /><br />I have only two complaints. One was that they were incredibly stuck to the inside of the wrapper. Whether that was from hot weather during shipping or whether they're always like that, I'm not sure, but I probably burned 90 of the 190 calories just working it out of the wrapper. The second thing is that biodegradable packaging rather than mylar would be a plus, considering that these appear to be intended for healthy, earth-friendly snacks.<br /><br />All in all, however, I was enraptured and would definitely eat these again anytime and recommend them to others.

review/text: These Pure bars are really very good!  I'm not too surprised, I mean, I like snack bars like these, but usually the granola/fruit/nut bars are brick hard.  The bars were actually soft, chewy, fruit sweet, and salty with the nuts.  They are gluten free and vegan, which is a bonus for a lot of people out there.  The only negative thing I can think of to mention is that they are a bit sticky.  All of the ingredients used are pronounceable too, which is nice.  I'd recommend this product to others.

review/text: Ouch is what my poor gums would say after eating this bar. Pure  Natural Bars, Superfruit Nutty Crunch is just too hard. If you enjoy eating these types of hard bars that are on the sweeter side, then you may enjoy this.<br /><br />Pros: natural bar is gluten free, vegan, kosher, natural ingredients (the only reasons I have it 3 stars)<br /><br />Cons: too hard & sticky, there's too much sugar in it (or evaporated cane sugar) 12 grams of sugar is not a good trade off for only 5 grams of protein, it should be the opposite.<br /><br />I wouldn't want my young child eating this, unless I plan on brushing his teeth right afterwards and checking on his little gums to make sure they have not been irritated.

review/text: Get these bars if you're hoping to find a convenient snack that's also all-natural. These bars are packaged individually like most granola bars, though these are a little sticky coming out of the package (no doubt due to the lack of oils and additives). Each bar is made of whole nuts and seed mixed with healthy portions of dried berries, held together by a dried syrup the consistency of nougat. The combo is delicious, though folks expecting Quaker granola bars type flavor will be disappointed. These bars are sweet, but only if you're used to fruits and vegetables, and not if you're used to candy and soda pop.

review/text: My kids (aged 8-18) and I ate these bars and they were pretty good. They had a nice fruity flavor although a little tart at times. The one issue we had was that they seemed to have melted a little in the packaging as the package stuck to the bar pretty well. The bars are great for snack time and seem to be fairly healthy, just make sure the kids wash their hands afterwards. The bars contain lots of fruit and nuts and are a bit chewy. Overall, we give this snack two thumbs up.

review/summary: Delicious yet sticky
review/text: I really like the taste and balanced nutrition & sugar amount in this product but the stickiness is rather a disappointment. Straight to the pros and cons of this fruit&nut bar:<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Tastes great; balanced sweet and savoury.<br />+ Right amount of nutrition, balanced sugar too. Less sweet compared to the typical energy bar.<br />+ Vegan and Gluten-free. Great choice if you have a special diet.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The 'syrup mix' that makes the nuts and berries stick together is very sticky. The wrapper tend to stick to the bar so it's not so easy to peel it open.<br />- I eat energy bar as quick breakfast or snack on the go. Having my lips and fingertips sticky after eating this isn't a nice feeling especially when there's no tissue/water around to wipe it off.<br /><br />If you don't mind the stickiness, this product is a great addition to your choice of healthier snack, for a healthier lifestyle.

review/summary: Good Fruit Nut Bars
review/text: The Pure Natural bars are a great tasting combination of cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds and peanuts. The 1.5oz bars are so full of fruit that the shape is irregular, sticky, and a bit difficult to get out of the wrapper. It would take some preparation to eat them while biking or running.<br /><br />The bar has a lot of intense flavor and the fruit can be identified separately by taste. The peanuts are a somewhat overpowering, and if you have any problem digesting nuts, this is not the bar for you.<br /><br />Each bar has 11g of fat, 1.5g of this is saturated. There are 12g of sugars and 5g of fiber. The bars are advertised on the package as "gluten-free" and "vegan." Some of the proceeds go to the Ciliac Disease Fondation.<br /><br />I really like the taste of these bars and they are definitely filling. After eating one, I can go a couple of hours without being hungry. These "superfruit nutty crunch" bars are a good product.

review/summary: LOVE these!
review/text: These are really great - they taste so fresh and natural, you can tell they're not full of junk.  I love the big chunks of fruit in them.  They're not loaded with unnecessary extras like fillers and corn syrup, etc.  They're also not super-high calorie for what they are.<br /><br />It's a very delicious bar.  It's like a fruit/nut trail mix, but in a bar form.  It has LOTS of nuts.  That's one thing many of these bars skip.  The nuts are usually pretty minimal, because they're expensive, so they use cheaper ingredients instead.  Not this one!  The name says it all - "superfruit nutty crunch" and that's exactly what it is!<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of what others have said - the stickiness.  The wrapper is practically superglued to the bar, making it quite a bit of work to get it out.  Also, your hands end up pretty sticky, so you need to eat it someplace where you'd be able to wash your hands right away.  Both of those qualities right there make it less appealing for an "on-the-go" situation.<br /><br />Like someone else suggested, if maybe they could coat it with something (crushed nuts or coconut, or SOMETHING) so it wouldn't be like eating a bar covered in glue, then there wouldn't be any reason not to give this product 5 stars.<br /><br />That said, I hope the manufacturer takes that into account, because I LOVE these and want to buy more!

review/text: I like these a lot!  They're like trail mix in a bar.  They only have about 200 calories per bar, and are a decent size.  I'm only giving 4 stars though because they're penetrated with a clear binder that cements the wrapper to them.  In other words, it's pretty difficult to get the wrapper off without getting yourself sticky.  Maybe they could tweak the recipe so these have a coating on the outside like coconut or some kind of seeds?  Anyway, I like that these are vegan and raw - it's very hard to find a great-tasting raw bar with low calories.  I think I would but these again!

review/summary: delicious, but a little too sweet
review/text: These Pure Natural Superfruit Nutty Crunch bars are delicious, but they are definitely quite sweet.  If you have a sweet tooth (and I certainly do!!!), you'll probably like them.  I actually think they could reduce the sugar content, though, and they would still be delicious.  In addition to getting sugars from fruit and fruit juice, the second ingredient listed is brown rice syrup, another sweetener.  These are also fairly high fat, though they do have a lot of nuts in them which are obviously fatty so there probably wouldn't be a way to make them have less fat.  I do wish the protein content was a little higher, and given that this is a vegetarian bar the obvious choice to add some protein content would be to add some type of soy.  If the manufacturer had done that, my perception of this bar might shift from a good candy bar replacement to an actual nutrition bar.  As they are currently formulated, however, they only have 5 grams of protein per 190 calories, with a whopping 11 grams of fat and 12 grams of sugar.  As I wrote -- more of a candy bar than a meal replacement.<br /><br />I did mention that they are delicious, though, didn't I?  ;)

review/text: These are surprisingly good for a bar that is essentially fruits and nuts smashed together.  Everything involved in these bars at least sounds healthy, so I was expecting to taste cardboard.  I was happy to discover that these are actually quite tasty, though the peanut flavor overpowers many of the other more subtle flavors in the bar.<br /><br />I would have to say that if you enjoy fruits and nuts and are looking for a tasty bar for a bike ride or a road trip, these are an excellent choice.<br /><br />The two negatives I've found:<br />1) these are rather sticky - so think about that before handing one to the 3 year old<br />2) they are not sweet in the sense that many people have come to expect.  They are naturally sweet, but are not loaded down with artificial sweeteners.

review/text: Pure bars are delicious, no argument there. The fruit flavor is real and not a chemical concoction.<br /><br />However, they are small and they tout themselves as gluten free & vegan yet clearly on the back of the wrapper they admit they are made in a plant that also processes wheat & egg products. For many Celiac suffers their sensitivity is enough to have a reaction from just the "essence" of wheat. And many vegans might protest the egg connection. Truth is, the bars are good enough to sell on their own.<br /><br />Pure needs to find and area that really is pure to make their product.

Although I'm not exactly obsessed with nutrition, I am somewhat of a health nut and am concerned about proper nutrition and its role in energy, fitness, longevity, appearance, stress management, and overall health, especially for my family. I've been known to scour the shelves of grocery stores and other retail establishments for just the perfect bar, the kind that's tasty, chocked full with nutrients, and affordable. This "superfruit nutty crunch bar" meets those criteria and more.<br /><br />Containing cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds, and peanuts, its healthy ingredients surpass most other bars both in quantity and taste. Some bars have one type of nut or a little smidgen of fruit, but this has three fruits and two nuts. It tastes yummy, not too sweet, and it has a certain amount of crunchy chewiness. There's no way a person can gulp it down before first savoring the experience.

review/summary: A quality product with a few issues for me.
review/text: These 1.5 oz fruit and nut bars have excellent taste.  I've never been much of a fan of other snack bars I've tried, but I can say that this was really quite impressive.  The first ingredient listed on the package is almonds and that flavor was very noticeable for me.  The peanuts also add a distinct taste.  (The picture on the wrapper shows cashews and walnuts, but they are not in the ingredient listing and I did not find them in the bar.)  The two types of nuts combined with the chia and sunflower seeds and agave fiber provide any "crunch" you might be expecting.  I could not specifically see or taste the blueberry and cranberry fruits, but they are definitely there.  The pomegranate seeds are very visible.  The flavors all meld very well.  There was just enough individual nut flavor and the fruit combination provided the sweetness.  I did notice that the second ingredient is brown rice syrup, but since the bar is not overly sweet I think most of the sweet flavor comes from the fruits.<br /><br />At 190 calories per bar this seems to be a snack you would want to keep track of to make sure you don't eat too many simply because they are so good, especially since 100 of those calories come from the fats.  I did find that the bar was rather sticky.  In fact, it has been quite a chore getting the bar separated from the wrapper so that I can eat it.  Then I'm left holding a sticky bar.  To counteract that you can simply hold the bottom of the bar by the wrapper as you eat it.  That brings me to one aspect of the bars which I'm not completely happy about.  Since the bar is sticky I chose to cut it into bite size pieces.  Anyone with any dental concerns at all will want to be careful when biting into this very dense, sticky bar.  And, if you are like me and have teeth set very close together, the seeds from the blueberries and cranberries can be a real challenge.  I find myself needing to use dental floss after eating each bar.  Hopefully that will not be an area of concern for you.<br /><br />If you've read this far you will have noticed the word "sticky" used quite often in my review.  That's because that was an issue for me and for my husband.  The taste is delicious.  The fact that most of the ingredients are organic is certainly a plus.  The vegan and gluten free aspects are going to be very valuable to some consumers.  Certainly I would say that this is a quality product.

From the semi-crunchy chewy cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds and peanuts, Pure provides all the goodness of a healthy snack bar.  And although the ingredients specifically say gluten-free and vegan, one does not have to be a vegetarian to enjoy this nutritious treat.<br /><br />Indeed, there are other alternatives to the regular trail mix bar or granola bar, but Pure has a satisfying taste that is not too hard or too soft to bite into.

review/summary: Not Nearly As Good As Their Raw(Organic) Bars
review/text: I have tasted every Pure Bar in the Organic line and like them all.  I love the balance of flavors in the line and the raw aspect makes them feel good to eat.<br /><br />I was so excited to taste the Pure Natural Bars Superfruit Nutty Crunch bars that I could hardly wait to get them.  Once I opened the package though, something just didn't hit me right.  I didn't know that these were different from the organic line when I first tasted it.  I knew after the first bite, however.<br /><br />Compared to the Pure Organic Bars which are raw, these are really a disappointment to me.  The flavor is intense, for sure, but it seemed out of balance.  I tasted quite a few different bars just to be sure.<br /><br />The superfruit taste has a tangy aftertaste which is not too bad, but then there is the taste that almost assaults my senses- like over salted peanuts.  The salt in this is not listed as sea salt and it tastes way too strong for my liking.<br /><br />The blueberry pomegranate and cranberry flavor adds nice contrast but the harsh salty peanut taste really interrupts the flow of flavors in my mouth.  I just am not fond of it.<br /><br />As for texture, they are very soft, sticky, and intense in flavor, so that is not a problem.  The texture is very nice as far as crunch balanced with substance and sticky feeling.  The sweet is not overbearing, but is pretty well balanced, much of it coming from the dried fruit.<br /><br />In summary, if you love the Pure Organic Raw bars, you might not like these.  If you love cooked granola bars that are sticky and sweet like sticky buns, and you love peanuts, you might like these.<br /><br />I prefer the raw bars.  My daughter liked them all right, but she eats peanut butter by the pound and dumps half a shaker of salt on many of her meals.  :)  If you are like her, give these a try.  She loves them.  I have given them three stars as an average between her and my reaction to them.

They tasted great - a touch of sweetness, but just the right balance between sweet and salty.<br /><br />Individually packaged and 5 oz each, they are the perfect snack size and I definitely plan to stock up on them for camping, road trips and easy snacks to keep in my purse or desk.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give these 5 stars is because of some slight confusion on the packaging. They say "certified gluten free" (which is awesome!) but the disclaimer under the ingredient list states that the product was produced in a facility that also processes soy, milk and wheat (among other things). Gluten free is serious business, and with the conflicting information I don't know whether to feel safe sharing these with my Celiac friends.<br /><br />Other than that, I strongly recommend these and look forward to trying the other flavors!

review/summary: Yummy and not so sticky
review/text: Yummmmy.  Really hits the spot.  I've ordered many fruit and nutty bars on Amazon, and though others came close, this is the best.  More fruity than nutty taste, which is just the way I like it, and unlike other come-close-to-taste bars, this isn't so sticky that I need to brush my teeth afterwards.  The package I received had a 8 month expiration date, which is good.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: A Healthy Snack
review/text: I was pleased with the ingredients in these bars. I thought that there could have been a slightly bolder fruit flavor. The peanuts were plentiful, and that was a plus for me. Overall, I would rate them a good buy, and would definitely consider purchasing them.

review/summary: An Outstanding Healthy Snack!!
review/text: When I received this package of Pure Natural Snack Bars I was tempted not to try one as the first item I look for on any package is the calorie count.  I do not care if a product is organic, gluten free, celiac free, kosher,etc. as long as it doesn't have too many calories.  When I saw that the calorie count for such a small bar was 190,I didn't want to eat it but since I had to review it for the Vine program, I knew I'd have to taste it.  Lo and behold, it was good!  Not that I will buy any more of these bars since for 190 calories, I'd rather eat a piece of Lindt chocolate.  But, for those people who want to eat healthy, and I obviously do not count myself among them, these baars are great!

review/summary: HARD to open but SO worth it!!
review/text: I've always been a fan of Pure bars for their quality ingredients so was super excited to see this newest offering from them.<br />First off, this is a STICKY bar which makes it not hard, but actually very difficult to remove from the wrapper..no way you're sliding this thing up in the wrapper, think peeling/tearing the wrapper off instead. No exaggeration on the stickiness here, it's tough!<br />BUT, it is SO, SO, SO worth it! It reminds me of a conventional trail mix bar I bought back in the day, only with high quality ingredients and standards that I demand now days. Quality you can see and taste, a true winner and a unique offering in the natural/organics bar mix.<br />Definitely a new favorite and will become a staple around our house. Both my children, 5 & 2.5yrs old agree, it's worth the sticky fingers! :)

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised
review/text: I was pleasantly by this bar.  I am usually not a fan of anything with raisins but the texture of this bar was such that I did not notice they were there.  The predominate taste is the peanuts, but the rest of the flavors and especially the texture of the bar is what made me a fan.  It seems to be the perfect balance between chewy and crunchy. The packaging is distinctive and I am especially impressed "natural" aspect.  There was nothing on the the ingredient list that was foreign or "filler".  I would highly recommend this bar for a person who is on the go.  I will use them as my substitute breakfast when I am in a rush to get out the door.  After eating this I found that it was filling enough to get me through to lunch.

review/summary: They're Right -- Pure's Superfruit Bars Are Absolutely Delish!
review/text: My Superfruit bars arrived in heat exceeding 100 degrees, so I put them in the refrigerator for a bit of a cooldown -- just the thing for a cool summer's day treat (and adding a bowl of ice cream is ok, too).<br /><br />Here's my take on the Pure Superfruit bars:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  Superfruit bars are delicious, and they would be a perfect addition for the school lunchbox or the mom who'll soon enjoy a long break from summer vacation.<br /><br />2.  OK, with 190 calories, I can't call these bars low-cal, but they're lower in calories than a chocolate bar and nutritious to boot.<br /><br />3.  If you're looking for gluten-free treats, this one is perfect -- lots of flavor, no gluten.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />I have nothing to complain about, but I do have a warning for those who suffer from a peanut allergy.  These bars are loaded with peanuts, so watch out!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />When my box is empty, I'll be buying a new one -- for taste, for nutrition, and for fun treats.  If you enjoy dried fruit, almonds, and peanuts, give these a try.

review/summary: A mildly sweet Baby Ruth--that is good for you.
review/text: I am not a fan of candy bars--the nutritional variety or otherwise. Most are filled with sugar and/or taste like a sweetener stick. The Pure bars however are different.<br /><br />Although the second ingredient is the ubiquitous 'Organic Brown Rice Syrup', it only has 12g of sugar--even with cranberries, blueberries, and pomegranates. It does not taste sweet though. It can best be described as a mildly sweet Baby Ruth. The latter having a roasted nutty flavor that is sticky which is the first experience you get when eating the Pure bars. Know, though, that these are pretty good for you.<br /><br />They have a good amount of fat for one bar (monounsaturated) at 17% DV (because of the nuts) and a low 8% DV of saturated fat. Add to this a low salt content at 4%-95mg, and you have a bar that you can have anytime of the day that will likely satisfy a quick hunger grumble. Perfect to stock these in your office.<br /><br />From a nutritional conscious person, I can say I do not mind eating these once in a while because there is low added sugar, and; they taste like their ingredients. They are a natural way to satiate a natural appetite for a snack.

review/summary: Purely Natural Vegan
review/text: This bar seems to be made of a half-handful of almonds/peanuts & blueberries/cranberries with a trace amount of pomegranate & a few chia/sunflower seeds (seeds are listed on label, yet indistinguishable to me within the blend). These ingredients are mixed into Rice/Tapioca syrup and compressed.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The ingredients in this vegan nut/fruit bar are superior(certified organic and gluten free).  It contains superfoods and is sweetened with apple juice concentrate instead of sugar. I found it to be filling, making it perfect for an "on the go" snack. The syrups make a tasty binder without being too sticky, so I had no problems with the bar affecting my dental work. The flavor was interestingly yummy, making this a welcomed alternative to my usual snack of raw almonds. Bonus: Teenage son's sweet tooth was even satisfied with one! Includes organic agave fiber, boosting fiber cfontent to 5 grams per serving (1 bar = 1 serving)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />You must REALLY like nuts...the amount can overshadow the other ingredients.  Having 190 calories and 11 grams of fat, I was disappointed that the protein amount was only 5 grams (I am assumming that the organic rice protein helped to raise this number).  The superfoods included did not seem to have much if any impact on the nutritional content. I'm not sure if the vitamins/minerals were mostly lost during the actual cooking process, or if the amount contained w/in bar is negligible.  As listed: vitamin A 0%, Calcium 2%, Iron 4%.<br />FYI-sugar content is 12g, sodium is 95mg.<br /><br />Again, the quality ingredients make this vegan bar worth trying (the remaining ingredients I hadn't previously listed are: sunflower/coconut oil, salt & water). The flavor is good enough to make you look forward to eating more, though the fat/calorie content keeps one focused on moderation.<br /><br />This superfruit Nutty Crunch bar is a healthy way to satisfy any sweet/nutty craving...

review/summary: Very tasty, healthy ingredients, vegan-safe
review/text: I received one box of these Pure Natural bars free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review of the product.<br /><br />We've tried just about every bar out there - protein bars, organic bars, sugary kid-targeted bars, you name it.  But these Pure bars stand out in my mind.  They are full of recognizable fruit pieces (cranberries, pomegranate, blueberries), aren't overly sweet, and have a nice nutty taste thanks to the almonds, sunflower seeds and peanuts.  They are made from organic ingredients (which is important to me).  They are also gluten free and vegan-safe (which isn't as important to me).  Each bar contains 5 grams fiber, 5 grams protein, 190 calories, 22g carbs.<br /><br />They're a little expensive, at $16.98 for 12 bars of 1.5 ounces each, but they're probably cheaper outside Amazon.  Price aside, you're getting a high quality, healthy snack for the same price as a regular sugary, preservative-laden granola bar.

review/summary: Delicious!!!
review/text: First time reviewing a food product.<br /><br />I've eaten basically two kids of "granola bars" in my life. Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars and Nature Valley Sweet and Salty Nut Granola Bars. The crunchy ones are like cardboard, and the "Sweet and Salty Nut" are really sticky and sweet but have a good texture.<br /><br />These Pure Natural bars are great. The nuts give it a good texture, without being sticky, and the raisins and cranberry's give it a delightful zing of flavor.<br /><br />It also says they're Vegan. I'm not Vegan, but I like them.<br /><br />So, when it comes to granola bars, I give them a recommendation.

review/summary: Delicious, nutty and not too sweet....
review/text: I always get bars like this with a sense of trepidation.  They are either great or really bad.  I'm happy to say these fall in the "great" category in my opinion.  Here's what I like:<br /><br />They have lots of nuts, chock full of peanuts and almonds, already a big plus in my book.  Next, tons of fruit-cranberries, blueberries & pomegrante seeds as well as chia and sunflower seeds.  The bar is not overly syrupy or sweet, the natural sweetness of the fruit carries the bar and it comes in at 12 grams of sugar.  The spot where I usually get picky is consistency, is it too crunchy, too soft, too grainy?  Nope, this one is perfectly soft and chewy. I'm definitely planning to take a few of these to work and also camping this summer-they are delicious.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise these bars come in at 190 calories, 100 of the calories from fat, and 8% saturated fat,<br />Sodium is 95 mg, fiber is 5 grams and protein is 5 grams.  This provides 2% of your daily calcium, 2% of Vitamin C and 4% Iron.<br /><br />Dislikes?  Well, my dislike has nothing to do with the taste, I felt that the price of the bars were on the steep side.  With amazon's price reduction these bars still come in at approx. $1.64 per bar.  Seems a bit steep in my book, but I would still probably purchase these, maybe in the variety pack so I can try the other flavors.  If the price is not an issue, and you like fruit and nuts, this would be the bar to get for your purse or briefcase, in your desk, or out for a hike.

review/summary: I liked it.
review/text: This is billed as a "superfruit nutty crunch bar."  With cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds and peanuts, I'd say the "superfruit" and "nutty" boxes are checked.  I wouldn't necessarily call it a "crunch" bar, however.  That's not a complaint--but this is a realtively soft and chewy bar, which is more the way I like it anyway.<br /><br />Some details:  190 calories (100 from fat); 11g of fat (1.5g of saturated fat, and 0 trans fat); 95mg sodium; 22g of carbs; 5g of protein; gluten-free.<br /><br />Some selected personal evaluation:  Tasty, chewy, nutty, a very nice snack.<br /><br />For an enjoyable and relatively healthy bar, it's hard to beat.

review/summary: Good and very chewy
review/text: I don't eat a lot of protein bars but I do enjoy the ones with lots of nuts and berries. This one definitely fits the bill.<br /><br />This bar is not as sweet as I thought it would be, which was actually okay for me. It's the fruit that sweetens it, but it doesn't taste like a candy bar like some other so-called health food bars.<br /><br />This bar is packed full of peanuts and berries, with some almonds as well. it is so dense and sticky that it takes a little effort to free it from the wrapper! But that's a good thing.<br /><br />Please note that this is not a weight loss bar in any way - it has 190 calories per bar. What it is, is a very healthy and filling treat for your family, especially those with any sensitivity to wheat since these are fine for those suffering from Celiac disease.<br /><br />Recommended. I put a couple in my purse and my car for those times when I really need to eat something quickly. They're good for me and a treat as well.

review/summary: Salty, lightly sweet, and tangy--a flavorful, grown-up snack bar that's not too sweet
review/text: I really liked the mix of salty, sweet & tangy elements in this chewy, crunchy snack bar. It's a fairly small bar, but isn't too high in carbs (22g, incl 5g of fiber), and has a decent 5g of protein in such a small treat. It tastes like what it is--dried fruit and nuts, with enough light, natural sweeteners & binders (brown rice & tapioca syrups, agave fiber, rice protein) to hold it together. I really appreciate a bar that has the taste and texture of a handful of trail mix, rather than a poptart or some weird, over-processed "energy" bar. The ingredients are GF and vegan.<br /><br />If you've had the other pure bars, some of which have more of a fruit leather with nuts texture, this one is much closer in texture and body to a traditional chewy granola bar, only without the grains--loads of nuts and whole dried fruit pieces.<br /><br />I'm taking off one star because the packaging is somewhat misleading and the bar's a little overwhelmed by peanut. According to the ingredients list, it actually contains more almonds, but the peanut flavor dominates (you don't really want the cheaper nuts taking over the yummy almonds).<br /><br />And while the front of wrapper is prominently labeled "Cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds and peanuts," the photo on the front also shows cashews and several walnuts, with just one lonely peanut. In point of fact, it contains no walnuts or cashews at all; and while it does contain almonds and sunflower seeds (also pictured), the nutty flavor profile of the bar is really dominated by the peanuts. Their other packaging doesn't seem to be misleading in this way; maybe they fiddled with the recipe and didn't change the wrappers. It's not a huge deal, but it should be pointed out.<br /><br />As a side note, my mail carrier put this package in my car with the windows up, so it was broiling in the sun on a 100-degree day. As a result, they were really hot when I first tried them, but still held together well, so they're a good choice to keep in your glovebox or camping in summer. (And they didn't get to be a hard toffee that pulls out your fillings when chilled, either, FYI, so they should be fine in winter, too.)<br /><br />Overall, a convenient, healthy, real-food on-the-go snack, much nicer than your typical breakfast aisle junk.

review/summary: Nice, chewy and satisfying
review/text: It's nice to see more gluten-free products showing up. Pure Naturals Superfruit Nutty Crunch Bars is a long name for such a small bar, which will fit perfectly in a small clutch or purse, or even a shirt pocket for a quick snack on the go (3.5" x 1.5"). The overall taste is excellent, not too sweet, with a nice tactile crunch. Sweeteners are Brown Rice Syrup, Apple Juice Concentrate and Organic Tapioca Syrup--no high fructose corn syrup! The package says that Pure Naturals is a proud supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation, which is good news for those with gluten intolerance. The package also says each bar contains 5G protein and 5G fiber. This looks to be a fairly healthy occasional snack bar, and good as a quick grab for breakfast when you're late for work. Always read the ingredients and don't rely on any processed food, even as good as this one, for regular meals. This should be an occasional snack--and what looks to be a pretty good one as far as snack bars go. Recommended.
