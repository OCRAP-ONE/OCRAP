review/summary: Too sweet
review/text: I was really excited to learn about this product.<br />It is everything it says it is but for me it is just too sweet...I would suggest a non-sweetened version like mimic creme.  Sweetness is so personal and there are so many choices available, unsweetened would be better for me.<br />But other than that we like it.

review/summary: great (non dairy) alternative to whipped cream
review/text: This is a new product that I could not find in the grocery store.  It's a bit difficult to get out of the box (I ended up tearing/peeling the box off), but once I followed the rest of the directions (chill it for a few hours, chill the beaters) it does whip up and stay whipped.  Taste is somewhere between Cool Whip and dairy cream.  My teenager liked it (usually ultimate test of whether something is "good") and I like it because it is easy to use, does not spoil and is great on berries.  For coffee it will not melt like dairy cream (use regular mimicream for cafe latte), but will sit on top of the beverage, so it's better for hot cocoa, pies, etc.

review/summary: Awesome product!
review/text: At last! The best tasting non-dairy whipped topping made of almonds and cashews! I have been enjoying this from Amazon. Easy to prepare and I have been told it tastes better than real cream). Anyone who is lactose intolerant will beam after having dipped their strawberries into Healthy Top.<br />I find the easiest way to empty the container is to cut tabs on the side first, cut accross middle seam, cut down each corner to the bottom, then peel flaps and put "H-Top" into bowl,  be patient as you use your mixer on low to blend; I add any flavorings (vanillaextract or chocolate cocoa). I also add 1/2 cup water to get the right softness to the cream. Wow, you'll be amazed at the freedom for new recipes this product creates.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: The product tasted alright, but it wasn't what I expected at all. I thought I'd get a liquid that after spending half an hour in the refrigerator (as directed by the package) would be cold enough to whip into a cream. Instead the consistencly is very viscous and needs to be dug out of the container. It does lighten up a bit when whipped, but not to what I thought I would get. Also,the results are not speadable and doesn't lend itself to acting like a cake topping. I probably wound not reorder this again.

review/summary: Delicious but - saturated fat?
review/text: Bottom line is that this topping tastes great. It doesn't taste like real Whipped Cream but if you like Cool Whip etc., you will like Healthy Top. My only problem is that the description says "Saturated Fat Free" and the label says "Saturated Fat - 12%".<br />I have read that Virgin Cocoanut Oil (which MimicCreme uses) is not harmful like other Saturated Fats but I is think this mislabeling is important. I'm sure some people aren't supposed to have ANY Saturated Fat.<br /><br />I'm new at the dairy, cholestrol, gluten (seems like everything) free.... but NOT new to whole milk whipped cream, butter etc.<br />I don't eat chemicals when I can help it but recently started a holistic diet.  Protein and vegetables. Avoid dairy, wheat, soy, sugar. I even found healthy sweetener (Organic Zero) but just can't find non soy, non dairy cream for my coffee. (This diet allows Decaf made with the swiss water method only because regular decaf is made with a surprisingly narly chemical process).<br /><br />I ordered MimicCreme Coffee Creamers. The delivery guy screwed up so I have not received them yet and won't for a few more days. I will post when I do. Meanwhile, I couldn't stand it so I thought I'd try MimicCreme Healthy Top (because as I said, I used to use whole cream in my coffee). In case you're thinking the same, don't. It's the consistency of Crisco and even with heat, doesn't pour. But after all, it's NOT a creamer. So I whipped it and it's great (especially for a non everything topping).  Trouble is, on a dairy and wheat free diet, I can't find anything to put it on. :(  I just wish this labeling thing was consistent.

review/text: I'm a vegan and I bought these hoping to have whipped cream product that taste good and is quick to make. The texture of this product is perfect. For the taste though it's kinda bland and has a weird aftertaste. I make my own vegan whipped cream at home and it's alot better. It's good but the company needs to work on improving the taste or I won't be buying this ever again or recommending it to anyone.

review/text: I bought this product based on the positive reviews it has gotten here. My experience was the exact opposite of what others have said. While the texture of Healthy Top is great, I found the taste to be quite frankly pretty awful. I expected a nutty taste, but this is a very distinct, powerfully odd nutty flavor that I could not get rid of no matter what I added to it. My search for a non-dairy whipped topping continues...

review/summary: Confused About Sampler Pack
review/text: I ordered this sampler pack of instant soups and it was delivered very promptly. (arrived within 2 days)<br /><br />The confusing thing is that I'm not sure what I received in the package. I was expecting some instructions and/or information in English.....  but everything on the packaging is in Japanese.  Unfortunately I live in an area of Pennsylvania where there is no Japanese population.<br /><br />The package contained a total of 22 small packets in eight various sized strips .... two packs(4 strips), three packs(2 strips), and four pack (2 strips).<br /><br />I have no idea what is in the packets or how to prepare them.  I assume that they are various kinds of instant soup.<br /><br />Do I combine them?<br />Is each packet a complete soup mix?<br />Does this represent 22 servings?<br /><br />Your guess is as good as mine.  I am going to try to prepare the soup by adding boiling water to each packet.  I'll update this review after I get a chance to experiment.<br /><br />It's like a Dining Adventure!  Wish me luck!

review/summary: Lemonhead lovers, this is for you!
review/text: I wasn't really sure of this tea, Lemon Matcha. I ordered it for my wife in the hopes that it would be her gateway matcha drug, but she really doesn't like matcha, so it will likely be a bust (though she'll be a good sport and try it anyway). But I'm only a citrus fan to a point, that point usually being grapefruit. Mmm, grapefruit.<br /><br />When I first started mixing it, it smelled like a mix between Lemonheads and lemon cleaner. But the sip is pure lemonhead. It tingles down my tongue! It's tasty in its own way, and if you're into Lemonheads and the like, I would definitely recommend this to you. My wife has a coworker who loves lemon, so this matcha might be hers after another cup or two. It has a lemony bite that someone who enjoys lemons and sour candy might love. It's more of a mild vegetal flavor than a stronger matcha, which my wife appreciates in a matcha. The lemony bite can be cut with a touch of sugar, so while I can see that this matcha would be right up the alley of a lemonhead lover, it's just not the tea for me. I am extremely grateful to have tried it, though!

It's a chocolate muffin with chocolate chips in them, which puts the men in my life in chocolate heaven.<br /><br />I like banana nut.  It's full of banana flavor.  Yep, that's banana all right.  I don't think they could squeeze more banana flavor in it if they tried.  They could use more nuts.  Most of them are sprinkled on top.  Otherwise, I think they are fantastic.<br /><br />Blueberry is very good, also.

review/summary: Moist & Delicious - Better Than Homemade!
review/text: These muffins are superb.  All three flavors in this variety: blueberry, banana nut and chocolate, are fantastic choices.  The chocolate tastes like the best chocolate cake you ever had, and the banana nut is my personal favorite.  With tea, one of these muffins makes my morning special.<br /><br />Each muffin has two servings, so depending on the flavor, you are looking at up to 500 calories per muffin, with very high fat content.<br /><br />As far as price goes, you can buy this same variety lot of Otis Spunkmeyer muffins at well-known bulk retailer stores and wholesale clubs, for half the price that Amazon has these today.  But if you don't have access to to a club store, I highly recommend buying these at the price listed.  Bring the case to work and be everyone's hero for a day!

review/text: Very tasty. Generous size. Moist. The only 1 that wasn't great was blueberry- the blueberrys are little, dry things. kinda remind me of artificial blueberries one might find in a pancake mix. the cake part of it tasted like moist, dense pound cake, which i liked. the walnut/banana was the best- very bananany tasting-very moist.<br />-the moisteness is probably due to the oil in product- your fingers are all shiny with the oil after holding the muffin.

review/summary: Great for rush hours when the house is in chaos!
review/text: IMO, Pop-Tarts are not the most nourishing food, but they're convenient for when everyone is running late ... for school, work, or appointments.<br /><br />The kids like them because they're easy to pop into the toaster or microwave and they taste good--anything that's sweet, you know! Most kids I know seem to prefer the strawberry and chocolate-flavored Pops, but blueberry is my favorite. Clarification: I like them, but do not love them; much too sweet for my taste-buds, but still ... when in a hurry, they come in handy.<br /><br />I also like them because they have a long shelf life and are quick and easy to prepare. If you have very young children, either heat the Pop-Tarts yourself or supervise the kids as they pop them into the appliance of your choice. Don't want those little fingers getting burned!<br /><br />Kids learn fast, and all they have to do is remove the Pop-Tarts from the pouch and pop them into the toasting appliance or microwave. Be sure to let the Pop-Tarts cool briefly because the filling can get very hot. When using the microwave, use a microwave-safe plate.<br /><br />And that's all there is to it!<br /><br />Like I said, not the most nourishing food--although they contain some healthy ingredients--but it's quick energy and great for rush hours. We all have plenty of those.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008

review/text: These are tasty whether toasted or not.  Personally, I think everything tastes better toasted but you can be your own judge.  I should mention, however, that these are not my favorite flavor.  Blueberry is succeeded only by Low-fat strawberry and LF brown sugar and cinnamon.  I guarantee that if Kellogg came out with a LF Blueberry pop-tart, it would quickly rise to the top for me.  The LF pop-tarts toast and taste better. Less pastry and more of that delicious goo. Mmmmmmm.... just thinking about it makes me hungry for the future.

review/summary: Food of the Godesses!
review/text: Quite possibly the best food known to man.  As may have been mentioned,these are not the most nutritious items around, but there are very few people who will choose an apple over a delectable Pop-Tart, either raw (straight from the foil packet) or toasted until the edges are an attractive golden brown. My personal favorite are the blueberry, either frosted or plain, but the strawberry are also delicious.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, Pop-Tarts are a flaky pastry wrapped around a filling, sometimes topped with frosting and sprinkles. They come two to a mylar envelope, four mylar envelopes to a package.  Originally, Pop-Tarts came in a couple of fruit flavors and had no frosting, but they've added tons of flavors since I was a kid.  (I'm an old lady and can have Pop-Tarts whenever I want them.  This was not the case when I was a child.)  Happily, Pop-Tarts stay fresh for a long time in the package.  I can't say how long they stay fresh because they don't last very long in my house.<br /><br />If you haven't tried these tasty little handfuls, I urge you to RUN, not walk to your closest grocery store and plunk down a little bit of money for a box of these.  Once you've tried them, Pop-Tarts are available here at Amazon.  :-)

review/summary: My finicky cat loves it!
review/text: My Gizmo was diagnosed with diabetes in July and the Vet recommended teeth cleaning and dietary changes first then we will go the insulin route if necessary. So far so good. We bought the DM dry food to go along with the wet. He likes the dry when he has the urge to crunch but is hooked on the canned. I spoon out the canned food by the 1/4 of the can. I lid the rest and just give him more when he is ready for it. I keep the crunchy available. He goes thru 1/4 cup of the dry every couple days. He goes thru a can a day.  The vet placed no restrictions on how much he can eat in a day so Gizmo is happy to eat to his hearts content. He is a very large tabby mix and was about 25 lbs before. (He was very athletic and was always catching birds and chasing the dog) He is now down to 18 lbs and it feels weird to pick him up. He had no problem eating this food and that was a worry because he would turn his nose up at anything other that the canned whitefish pate. I don't know what else to tell you about this product except it is working well so far for my cat. My only problem is the price - but since the insulin treatments seem to be painfully high, I am glad that the diet modification is working for $2.00 "ish" a day. The hard food he liked also and crunches away happily. I hope you get the option to try diet modification first and that it will work for you also!

review/summary: This is not authentic
review/text: Authentic Pesto Genovese consists of: basil, extra virgin olive oil, pine nuts, pecarino (sheep) cheese, garlic, salt, black pepper.  Although many Americans are clueless, olive oil is not just a fat, it is a flavoring.  And it is one of the key flavors in real pesto Genovese.  Walnuts are an acceptable substitute for pine nuts, though I think they are much more commonly used in the Piemonte.  It's hard to picture why one would mix the two nut flavors together, but I will admit that I have not tried it.

review/text: I've grown quite fond of the Pastariso products and buy this one by the case. Anyone trying to find good alternatives to gluten pasta knows the difficulties but this brand is a nice alternative. Two things worth mentioning: (1) the pasta takes quite a while to cook and it is important that you wait until the salted water is at a ferocious boil otherwise the pasta quickly clumps together and cannot be undone (2) once cooked and in your meal, this pasta does break up so if you imagine twirling it around your fork in a good spaghetti dinner you may be disappointed.

review/summary: One of the best litters. Shipping litter bad idea though
review/text: No doubt in my mind that Fresh Step is the BEST litter on the market. Buying online though is tricky.<br />I bought 10 boxes when they were $10 on Amazon. A fantastic buy. However, all but 2 of the boxes were received split open. I bet you can imagine the mess. I don't know if the cost savings is worth the clean up hassle. I had litter all over my porch and entryway. They were still in a shipping box but there was hardly anything in the box to keep the litter from slamming around during transport. And being so heavy,I am sure the carrier didn't treat them like a caton of eggs. I bought so many because I like to stock up when things are a good price. Maybe that was my first mistake. I have 4 indoor cats and do go through a lot of litter though.

review/summary: This deserves the award for best cat litter!!!
review/text: We just got our kitten a little over a month ago, and we have searched desperately for the "perfect" cat litter... One that covers up the cat-created odors that doesn't have the normal "cat litter odor" itself.  We tried pellets, we tried supposed instant action, and we tried an all-natural corn based litter that does NOT live up to its name.  Then I went to my favorite pet store, and asked an associate what they recommended based on my needs.  Fresh Step was their answer, and it's the answer to my wishes!  This stuff works amazing, and it smells sooo good!  (Well, for cat litter lol!)  The carbon really does work to cover up the odors and it lives up to its description of Fresh Step... everytime Bella goes in and does her thing, as well as when I am scooping and moving stuff around, a pleasant fragrance is activated.  I can't imagine using anything else... this stuff is amazing!!!

review/summary: Best cat litter ever
review/text: No one likes kitty litter. It's the worst part of sharing your home with a cat, or in my case, two cats. I have a really small apartment and I keep the litter box next to the door in the living room. I've been to some of my friend's places who have cats and the litter box smell takes over the apartment. They swear they just changed the litter, but no matter, it still stinks. (They use the arm and hammer brand - definitely not my favorite.) This litter is the bees knees. Guests are always surprised when they see the litter box as they are leaving, they swear they never smelled anything the whole time they were over. Not to be gross, but I've gone a week without changing the litter (hey, I forget!) and that's usually when I start to smell the litter, reminding me that it needs to be cleaned. I don't know any other brand that covers the smell up as good as fresh step.

review/summary: Fresh Step VS Tidy Cat... Fresh Step Wins!!
review/text: I was so disappointed with Tidy Cat scoopable litter that I was about to go back to the regular litter, but decided to give it one more go with a different brand.  The trouble with Tidy Cat is that the soiled litter would turn to a thick, sticky mud that was very difficult to scoop and would leave a lot of mud-like residue behind.  I would end up emptying the entire litter box, clean it out, and start from scratch which defeated the purpose of scoopable litter.<br /><br />Fresh Step proved to be a major improvement.  It is so much easier to scoop and doesn't turn into the sticky mud that Tidy Cat would form.  I can actually scoop now and not have to empty the entire litter box.<br /><br />Both Fresh Step and Tidy Cat controlled odor.  Tidy Cat's plastic container was a bit easier to transport.  Fresh Step prevents litter waste; thus, saves money as pound for pound it scooped better and last longer.  Fresh Step wins hands down as it is by far the most scoopable litter.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I don't buy this online, so I can't speak for that, but this is the only kind of litter I've ever used (or ever will). I've used this brand since the day I brought my boys home.  I was unsure then about what kind to get, but it turns out I picked the right one.<br /><br />I have three cats, 3 litter boxes and a small 650 sq ft apartment.  You can't tell that I have cats (well, they'll come up and greet you and *then* you'll know, but you sure can't tell by the smell.)  The carbon / odor control / multi cat litters by Fresh Step all work very well.  I only buy the scoop-able, not the clay.  Works like a charm and a snap to scoop / clean the litter boxes.  Many of my friends have cats or rescue them and always remark how clean the apartment smells- fresh scent and not a trace of anything else!  They always ask me what kind of litter I use and I'm happy to inform them :)

review/summary: Really wanted to like this, but...
review/text: I used another one of the Clorox brands of cat litter, one that was more expensive, for my last cat who passed away. Now that I have two kittens, I thought I would try to save money. I found the Odor Shield formula at the local Big Box Store - only it did not say if it was scented or unscented, as it shows on the pictures here. I even wrote to the company, asking to verify before i purchased it, but they merely sent back a form letter. So I thought, it was by the same company that made the other litter, how bad could it be? For clumping ability, odor control, and my cats using it - it was very good. However, it was indeed scented, and there was now dust everywhere - not just near the litter boxes in my laundry room, but over most of the house. Also, the kittens reeked of the scent for quite a time after they had finished using the box. When one of my kittens started itching, I switched back to the other, more expensive brand of litter. Although I am still not sure if the extra scent and dust from the Fresh Step was the cause of the itching, I won't bother trying any box of Fresh Step- even if it says its unscented and low dust. Because the other litter has proved my point, and I can now fold clothes in the laundry room without worrying that I am putting clean clothes on top of a washer/dryer covered in litter dust. Sorry, Fresh Step, I was hoping on saving some money here. Anyway, although I did not purchase the cat litter from Amazon, I just wanted to warn others before they made the same mistake I did.

review/summary: Not a winner
review/text: First off, the litter does an excellent job at covering up the smell of urine and feces. But, what it fails at is clumping and tracking.<br /><br />This litter, to me, is comparable to a very low quality litter. It doesn't clump the right way, and it often stays muddy. I put a generous amount of litter in my box, but it still gets muddy. It also tracks worse than any other litter I have tried. The thing that bothers me the most is the amount of dust that expels from the litter when you pour it. It's so full of perfume that it makes a gigantic cloud.<br /><br />If you're looking for a litter to cover up the smell of your cat's feces and urine because you don't pick it up as often as you should- this is it. But, if you're looking for a litter that clumps right, doesn't track, and doesn't create clouds of dust, then this is not for you.

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best "bang for the buck" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing. What the heck? Turns out both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

I couldn't resist. That evening I finished half the box  while watching a movie. They're that kind of snack. Goldfish are good, to be sure, but they're nowhere near as addicting as Cheez-its.

review/summary: The type of cereal that you will crave after your first bowl
review/text: I swear that this cereal isn't as good as it was years ago. The waffles seem to be smaller and harder and there is less syrup on them. Other than that complaint this is probably my favorite cereal (number one cereal being Oreo O's which have been discontinued).<br /><br />I am a grown adult but I love cereal. Always have since I was a kid fighting my brothers over who would get the free toy in the box.<br /><br />These boxes are not the same size you'll find in most stores. I would say that one box is equal to 3 adult-size bowls.<br /><br />Let the cereal sit in milk a couple minutes so the waffles aren't so hard which makes it easier to eat.<br /><br />This cereal has a syrup taste to it and it really does taste like waffles especially when you add milk.<br /><br />If you like waffles or sweet cereal, this is worth a try. I think this cereal is the kind that adults and children will like. Great price with Subscribe and Save and you just might get addicted to it.

HOWEVER, this product can no longer be found in the grocery store, or in any store for that matter. Amazon USED to offer this cereal for the same price as the grocery store charged when it carried this cereal. NOW it seems, that since it is hard to find, the provider is taking EXTREME ADVANTAGE, by charging TWICE AS MUCH as it was charging just a couple of months ago!! I buy LARGE quantities of this cereal (40 9.4 oz. boxes at a time, as  ten packages of four), because I eat it daily as my exclusive snack. It would be so nice if the current provider would PLEASE reinstate the original reasonable price, so I could continue to enjoy this cereal, in the quantities I enjoy, as I have in the past!

I read the reviews above and was excited to try these cereals, supposedly tasting like pancakes or waffles.<br />Well, they don't...I guess they have kind of a waffle shape (as it says on the box) but no more than that. They are crunchy as advertised, which I didn't like.<br />I also found those cereals too sweet.<br /><br />However, with warm or hot milk, they were much more enjoyable (softer and less sweet).<br /><br />Finally, the price (about 11$) was reasonable for four boxes.<br /><br />Overall, I don't regret purchasing those, but gave only 3 stars because of my expectations (cereals tasting like pancakes or waffles).

review/summary: One of My Favorite Cereals as a Kid
review/text: I loved this stuff when I was a little kid! It's not as waffle-like when it's dry, but it is amazing once you actually pour on some milk. If you have kids, then this is definitely going to make them happy... and if you're an adult who likes sweet breakfast cereals, you'll love it to.<br /><br />The price is reasonable, especially if you do a subscribe and save subscription-- the boxes are about average for cereal.

review/summary: Waffles Without the Work
review/text: This cereal tastes exactly like waffles.<br /><br />I'd swear there is maple syrup in there, but, I am sure that there isn't.<br /><br />Somehow, with the help of artificial ingredients, they've concocted a way of tasting waffles in your cereal bowl. Tiny, cold but delicious waffles and maple syrup floating around in your cereal bowl.<br /><br />Still, I give it five stars just for the flavor alone. I opened the box to taste them one night and could hardly put the box away, that's how delicious they are !

review/summary: Excellent taste; lower acid
review/text: I love cacao and chocolate, but only eat organic.  I've tried a number of different organic cacao powders--both "raw"/cold-processed, and hot processed.  So far, Tisano organic cacao powder is the best tasting one of those I've tried.  And it definitely appears to have a lower acid content than others I've tried.  My only complaint:  I wish it didn't cost $16/lb!  I can't afford that high a cost on a regular basis, so Tisano will be in my "special treat" category from time to time.  The only problem is that when it's in the house, I lose my self-control and want to have a cup of hot cacao every day instead of only as a special treat.  So the only way I can control myself is to not order it!<br /><br />In addition to producing great tasting certified organic cacao, Tisano gets props from me for direct sourcing their cacao beans from farm cooperatives committed to sustainable farming.  Other facts about their cacao: sourced from Venezuelan Criollo single beans; cold-pressed--no roasting of the beans

review/text: This is my second time purchasing cacao powder, and I decided to go with Tisano. The biggest difference I noticed was this actually smelled like raw cocoa unlike the other brand which smelled heavily of fermentation. The taste was delicious in my smoothies after I got the portions correct. From what I can tell this is a very solid product.<br /><br />Hopefully they can continue to offer Prime shipping in the future.

These candies can get somewhat addicting, the flavor does taste a bit like ice cream, and everyone I shared them with seem to like the vanilla the best,I have no preference wich flavor is the best of the three, they all are good to me.

review/summary: This took me back!
review/text: I remember when I was young my sister and I would go to my cousins house because there was a lady who sold penny candy on their block and this was one of the items we would always buy.  I don't know what caused me think about penny candy but this particular candy stuck out.  I couldn't remember the name of this candy for anything.  I remember that it was in a white wrapper with a ice cream cone on the front and it tasted like ice cream but couldn't remember the name.  After doing some heavy searching I finally found it.  The texture, size, and design is different which is why it was hard for me to find but I found it. When I did I had to have it.  Between my sister and I this bag lasted about a month.  They're so so thin and small that you have to eat about 20 just to get a satisfaction of two. ;>.  Would I buy this again, yes.  Would I pay $7.20 S&H for a $3.50 bag, heck no!

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/text: Check the per ounce pricing.  The 'tub' of Enfamil newborn is 93 cents per prepared ounce.  The refills are over a dollar per prepared ounce.  I'm all for minimizing packaging waste but Enfamil needs to make it financially compelling as well.

review/summary: Imported Mexican RIce
review/text: Thirteen bucks delivered when my local store doesn't carry this item is a plus. Many other online stores want over TWO dollars a pound + shipping. It's a short grain rice that seems heartier like brown than typical American rice. It is more like the rice my Central American relatives used during my childhood. This is stick to your ribs rice!

review/summary: Finally a winner for my baby girl!
review/text: It took many different failed attempts at different formula brands to find the right combo for our little girl. Every baby is different, but for us this Enfamil AR mixed with Similac 60/40 is the right combo for less spit up and gas. I am very happy I tried this.  the only complaint is that the seller who I bought 4 of these from, sent it to me in an old beat up box and each tub was wrapped in newspaper. I was a little taken aback, it's not very professional and made me question the authenticity of the product.

review/text: Love this gum and flavor. Very long lasting. I always have gum in my mouth because I'm constantly on the phone and it keeps my mouth moist. Besides, this costs me on Amazon what others are charging between $20-$25 for, though based on grocery store prices (avg. $3.5/ 3/15) it's not much of a savings.

review/summary: Best gum of ALL TIME
review/text: I consider myself a gum connoisseur and have chewed on pretty much every available type of gum there is. This is by far my favorite brand and favorite flavor. Their other flavors are so so but this is just fantastic, better than any other mint gum from any other brand in my opinion. The flavor lasts longer compared to the others and has no bad after taste. With some gums the flavor of the gum gives a bad after taste once all the juices of the gum are gone in addition they may get gooey and nasty, but not this gum. They have found the perfect receipt for excellent tasting gum that lasts and lasts.

review/text: These taste good but I found them more oily than the Justins Nut Butter in the honey peanut butter flavor. Even after kneading them before opening.

review/summary: Great little squeeze packs
review/text: These squeeze packs are a great snack when you need something quick and on the go. The peanut butter is delicious as are many flavors from this brand. Could be a little messy and the top ridge is a bit scratchy.

review/summary: Awsome
review/text: I was first introduced to the Peanut Butter & Co. products by a coworker who races for their cycling team.  He gave me a jar of the Maple flavored PB which was AMAZING!  I got the packets of Bee's Knees PB for weekends and other times when we never seem to have anything to eat.  This past week I took them on travel with me and not only is the PB really delicious, but it's super convenient and it fits great in a purse.  We got to the airport late and didn't have a chance to get anything to eat, so I just ate the PB right out of the pouch.  It is super yummy and doesn't separate at all in the pouch.  A great snack and a great company.  I will definitely be getting more!
