review/summary: Really???
review/text: I'm amazed that people are happy with this product.  I'm not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee.

review/summary: Not a fan of this blend
review/text: Coffee is a very subjective thing.  Some people like coffee that borders on tea, others like the stuff that a certain national chain named after a famous Battlestar Galactica pilot serves.  For the record, I love the slightly-sour taste of Dunkin Donuts coffee and I find the stuff made by "that other chain" to be akin to re-hydrated cigarette ash.  For many years, we still percolated coffee...with most big-name brands of pre-ground coffee, you needed a percolator to bring out the flavor in it, but again, your tastes may vary.<br /><br />With my Keurig, my favorite coffee was Paul Neumans Extra Bold....because it didn't seem Extra Bold.  Until you buy 80 of them and get tired of the flavor.  Then, my favorites were the Caribu's....but something happened to that brand (see reviews) and I agree, they did something...either they don't put as much in the cups or they changed the blend, the sourcing of the beans, etc......wasted money on Caribu and wont go back to the brand.<br /><br />So Wolfgang Puck got the nod, tried 4 different flavors.  This one, Sorrento, is not my favorite of the bunch (currently Colombian Chef's Reserve).  It has a bolder strength (which I believe hard core coffee drinkers would consider Medium), but to me it has a simple burnt flavor to it.  Cream and Sweetener don't correct for this, and thus I'm a bit disappointed....but again it was a stab in the dark.<br /><br />I think if you prefer a slightly bolder, slightly more burnt flavor in your coffee...this may be for you.  I like the character of the Colombian Chef's Reserve, but it is not as strong, and perhaps that is just what my taste is slanted towards.  I don't believe you can get a bad cup of coffee in the Wolfgang Puck line however.  Can't say the same for some other K-cup brands.

review/summary: Simply - It's terrible
review/text: If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings.

Update to come when they finally come home for a break -- it may be a while.  The other coffees I have ordered have all been tasty and a very good value, I have no reason to believe this will be any different. I can say that the k cups and the Keurig have been delightful.  I enjoy having a freshly brewed cup every time and like that I save a bunch of money by brewing at home into a travel mug rather than stopping to drop $2.00 for a cup on the way to work.  Saves all those styrofoam cups too!

review/text: I do like this coffee, but even with Subscribe and Save, Amazon's price is higher than K-cups at Bed Bath & Beyond.  Convenience is one thing, but since there are BB&Bs all around me, it's pretty easy to pick up my coffee there and save a few bucks.  I wish Amazon would price their coffees more competitively - I'd buy here exclusively if they did.  But this is good, medium roast coffee.  Not quite as strong as I'd like, but a little stronger than the Breakfast in Bed version.  I may need to try Sorrento and see if it's a little bolder.

review/text: So here is another example of a 48-pack of k-cups I bought "untested".  I figured, well, I really enjoy Sumatra's bold, smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver, so why not?  Wolfgang puck has a few restaurants, so maybe he knows coffee.<br /><br />So, this is utterly average in all departments.  It's not very bold or rich, although I can say it does have the bitterness, which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness.  Purchased only because it appeared on the Subscribe & Save at a great price per k-cup.  That makes two WP's that have been run of the mill at best [Sumatra & French roast].  Next time I'll be more discerning.

review/summary: Average quality French roast
review/text: I really like to mix things up with k-cups and rarely buy 50-ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.<br /><br />It's fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.

It's not acidic, not bitter, just a great MILD cup of coffee, which is exactly what it purports to be! I wish other people would read the description before they give a bad review based on their own stupidity. Don't buy a MEDIUM roast coffee and complain because it's not bold! Also, as a general rule the ones with "Breakfast" in the name are milder. I don't care for bold, dark roast, slap you awake coffee so I wouldn't buy a bold coffee and then complain that it was bold.

As to "strength" I wish that there was more coffee in each K-cup... I am accustomed to Starbuck's strength, and I have to set my Keurig to medium-cup size to get the strength I need.  This is not as cost-effective as -- say Jet Fuel (but I found Jet Fuel too bitter.)<br />If Wolfgang Puck would add more coffee to its K-cups, this would be a perfect coffee for me.

review/summary: Wolfgang Puck Decaf can't miss!
review/text: When I feel that I do not need more caffine, I have found that the Wolfgang Puck Decaf is a great substitute.  I really can't tell the difference, taste wise.  I had been having trouble finding a good decaf.  I think this one is it.

review/summary: What a great cup of coffee
review/text: Sometimes I feel when I reach for a decaffeinated K-cup that I'm going to settle for less flavor. However, I'm completely happy with this product. I don't feel I'm missing anything. Everyday I treat myself to a relaxing cup of coffee after work before starting dinner. This product just fits  what I'm looking for.

review/summary: My Favorite K-Cup
review/text: My wife and I have decided hands down, this is our favorite K-cup. We've tried a lot of others, and Donut Shop and Caribu Daybreak are certainly still up there. However, this has a very solid body flavor with a medium roast. Almost a bold flavor with a smooth finish. Excellent flavor versus strength. Really nice to get up on a lazy Sunday morning and have a nice cup of Breakfast in Bed!<br /><br />Also, I see another reviewer had problems with messy K-cups. I can say after about 6 boxes of theses, I haven't had any issues. Very unfortunate for the other reviewer, but looks like it was rather isolated.<br /><br />Give it a try, you'll certainly enjoy it, the wife and I sure do!

review/summary: Unremarkable
review/text: First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesn't taste all that good.  It is not bad - it is just kind of there - like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead.

review/summary: Jamaica Me Happy!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Jamaica Me Crazy coffee.  There was a time in my life when I was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff, but a customer in the bank I worked at brought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers.  Every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe, the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again.  Eventually it broke me down, and I am back to being a full time coffee drinker, and proud of it! Imagine how happy I was to find my favorite brew in a K-cup!  The only thing better than a cup of Jamica Me Crazy is a cup sweetened with the new Almond Joy flavor International Creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut.  Unfortunately, we only have a Keurig at our office (I'm in Real Estate now), so I have to go to work to enjoy a cup.  I'm thinking I have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work! Now if I can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office - I'd have it made ;0)

I have gotten many different kinds of the k-cups to try but after trying this one, I think I could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when I want a really strong cup of coffee.  The rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness.  Perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful!  Plus, I have to admit...I love the label. The different color looks very appealing on my carousel with the other k-cups.

review/text: For years, I've been completely devoted to Dunkin Donuts brewed at the store and at home.  I tried brewing DD in my K cup and I also bought the Eco Brew and the actual DD k cups.  Awful!  So I was searching high and low for a new coffee.  After trying all the decaf k cups on the market, I finally found and loved Wolfgang Puck decaf coffee k cups.  This is the only place I can find them so I hope Amazon never stops selling them here.  They are mellow, medium roast and I enjoy them every day.  Any other brand is just a back up.  Try them.  I have never had any trouble with any of the cups and I'm on my third order now of 48 cups.  If they had a problem, they've fixed it.<br /><br />This is an update being done on July 7, 2012.  I continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee EVERY day.  It has ruined me for other coffees as I measure every other cup against this incredible Wolfgang Puck Decaf k cup.  Please, please, PLEASE Amazon, make this part of your subscription service.  My head hurts trying to make sure that I always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee.

review/summary: Great, but not perfect
review/text: I roast my own Colombian beans at home so I have a perfect "10" for reference. Right off the bat let me say that just like their Sumatran reserve, this k-cup is not bitter, but smooth. The aftertaste is also smooth. My chief complaint is it does not taste like a Colombian bean. It really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee, while the Sumatran Puck K-cup definitely has a Sumatran taste. The "8 oclock" brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k-cup. That being said, my final recommendation is that I would recoommend the Puck Sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor. However, if you are looking for a not-too-stong-but-not-bitter coffee, this Colombian is a great choice. I would buy this again just because of the smooth taste.

review/text: I've always been drawn to K-Cup varieties with out there names (Jet Fuel, Black Tiger) and distinctive flavors (Golden French Toast, Spicy Mayan Chocolate). This offering melds those two features into something I'm happy to wake up to!<br /><br />To me, Jamaica Me Crazy's definitely got a pervasive coconut taste fairly similar to Dunkin' Donuts coconut flavored coffee, but it's also got a lot of the flavor characteristics I've come to expect from K-Cup chocolate brews. Barely any of that acidic aftertaste that's almost inevitable with artificial flavors, and definitely not as watery as many other K-cup varieties. Sure, the name's pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or sophisticated, but that's what makes this cup of joe so fun!

review/text: What first attracted me to this snack were the ingredients.  Roasted Corn, Peas, Carrots, Red Bell Peppers & Tomatoes.  That's it.  No sugars, oils, salt, trans fat, preservatives, etc...  I grabbed these up along with the Crunchies Freeze-Dried Edamame's (those weren't very good at all) and was extremely pleased with the flavor and texture.<br /><br />Some of the vegetables work better freeze-dried as a standalone snack then others.  For instance, the Corn, Peas and Red Bell Peppers are a real delight.  Light, airy and crunchy, the roasted sweet flavor of these vegetables make you want to go back for more.  The Carrots & Tomatoes add excellent flavor, but as a freeze dried product they are extremely hard and more difficult to chew (which is why the 1 star deduction).  I think if more work were done to find vegetable that are more enjoyable to eat in a freeze dried state then the 'Carrots and Tomatoes' this would be a more enjoyable product.  Although they are two of my favorite vegetables to eat, I find myself sifting through them in this assortment.

review/summary: a snack it isn't
review/text: These were not a very nice snack. Some veggies held up well to drying (corn, peas), but tomatoes and peppers turned into very hard to chew burnt-tasting shards (probably they weren't peeled before drying). Product fared better in "alternative uses", such as adding to soups and rice dishes, where it had a chance to cook and get properly re-hydrated.

review/summary: Delicious and Nostalgia free
review/text: I grew up in the North West so I never had these growing up like it seems that many people did.  To be honest, I hadn't even heard of them until about a year ago.  I was watching one of my favorite shows when, bam, someone mentions a mallomar.  So I look it up.  Eventually curiosity got the best of me and I ordered a box.  Now let me say, I've had pinwheels (tried them for the first time yesterday in preperation) and moonpies.  Of the three these are my favorite.  The base cookie isn't all weird like it is in a moonpie, and it's not overly chocolatey like a pinwheel.  Best of all they have a great size, they are just so much simpler to consume.  Admittedly they were a little melted when they got here (30 seconds ago), but I daresay that made them better.  Over all I'd say I see where everyone was coming from when they said they liked these.  They're pretty simple, but the definitely lived up to, or even surpassed my expectations.  Given all this I wouldn't recommend them to anyone who has to order because I will not be able to convince myself to order another box of these for [...] bucks; and I know once I finish the box I will be depressed.  If you can find them at your local store then I envy you.

review/summary: Delicious cookies, but........
review/text: When I lived in NY mallow mars were only sold in the winter months. I think it was because of the chocolate they used. Anyway, the most I paid for these cookies was about $4.00.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I live in Texas now and can't get them anywhere. I think it's because we really don't get much winter here.<br /><br />Even though I would say these cookies are my all time favorite, there's no way I would pay $30 for them! That's just crazy! lol<br /><br />I would like to ask the seller why they're charging $30 for cookies that only cost around $4 or $5 the most? I really don't think it's honest to do that to people who can't get the cookies.<br /><br />Sorry if this review offends anyone, but honestly paying $30 for cookies! Come on!

review/text: Judging from the prior reviews, Mallomars have apparently been around for a while. Which is strange, because I have never seen nor experienced them. If I had, I wold be a lot chubbier than I already am. I love this cookie.<br /><br />For some reason, cookies with marshmallows rarely hit the right note for me. They are usually too hard. This cookie was just right. The marshmallow was soft and airy, the chocolate had just the right amount of bitter sweetness. The cookie, though a little o crumbly, got the job done.<br /><br />When I feel like splurging in the future, Mallormars will be my cookie of choice.

review/text: I ordered this product because "When Harry Met Sally" is and has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember. Billy Crystal's character comments in a later scene in the movie that it's New Years Eve; he has Dick Clark, and Mallomars the greatest cookie of all time. I figured I should at least know what my favorite movie deemed the greatest cookie actually tasted like. Not only was it extremely hard to order (apparently they are only made in certain areas during certain seasons) but as several of my friends and I tried tem we agreed not the best of all time, but not really even that good. (Not fatties, but definitely cookie lovers) We ended up giving the rest of the boxes away. Very disappointed in Billy who I assumed was a pretty stand up honest guy!

Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original "Chips Ahoy!" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes.

review/text: Chips Ahoy, chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces.  My tastebuds say they are too sweet, not cooked enough, lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes.  If you like cookie dough, you most likely will enjoy these.  I'll stick with a crunchy, less sweet cookie.

review/summary: Are We Reviewing Our Mistakes Or These Cookies?
review/text: Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of "calms" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not "crispy" cookies, or the blurb would say "crispy," rather than "chewy."  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.  I'm here to place my second order.
