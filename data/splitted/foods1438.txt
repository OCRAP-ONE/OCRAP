review/summary: Really seem to help
review/text: They really do seem to help. Our 13 year old dog used to growl at the younger herd members. After starting these daily she seems a LOT more agreeable to their puppy ways.  We can't ask her obviously, but we've seen enough of a difference to keep giving them to her.

review/text: I purchased this product both for my dog and my daughters dog and it gave them both extreme diarrhea, explosive poor pups couldn't even make it out of the house. VERY embarrassed dogs!!! Both dogs suffered from this product.  We administered the exact amount for the weight of each dog.  They both LOVE their Greenies so I was shocked with this reaction.

review/summary: A BIG Hit
review/text: Our 3 dogs love Dingo bones.  But these peanut butter flavor bones are an obsession of our smallest rat terrier.  He's only 5 pounds, so bones tend to last several sittings for him.  Give him one of these and he's occupied for as long as it takes to finish.  He'll still play with other bones, but he loses his mind when he sees me go for this bag.  I just wish they were priced as well as the other Dingo products and less difficult to find.

review/summary: Dog loved it but left a mess
review/text: My doberman went nuts over this bone.  He tried to devour it rather quickly.  My only complaint about this bone is that it left a mess on the floor; the red color of the bone rubs onto the floor.  It did wipe up fairly easily.  Just make sure when you give the bone to your dog he's not eating it on a carpeted floor.

review/summary: Dogs love this bone!
review/text: I have two 70 lb. dogs. One chews on anything but the other chews on almost nothing. Both will immediately attack this bone and have a ball chewing on it. The one dog usually ignores regular rawhide but I didn't have to wait and see with this, he took to it right away. The price fluctuates wildly with these kinds of bones, so watch for a sale. I paid about 3 bucks.

review/summary: WARNING: Open package received with signs of used product
review/text: Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red "meat" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Too big for my dog
review/text: I have a labrador retriever. He weighs 82 lbs. He loved the bone, but I made the mistake and allowed him to eat the bone in one sitting. It was too much of a shock to his digestive system.  The next morning he developed diarrhea. I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again.  To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.  I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting .

review/text: This was delivered lovely and healthy, and with a nice wire for hanging.  I bought it to divide into 2 for two 6" hanging globes.  Dividing it was quite difficult, and in fact 1/2 of this ball was way too much for a 6" globe.  So, I ended up using 1/4 in each of the hanging glass globes, and the other half I have hanging in a window without any globe.  They look great.

review/text: I have been drinknig Lyon's Gold Blend for years, and I highly recommend it.  For a period of time, it was difficult to find in the United States, so I tired other Irish-style black teas such as Barry's, Tetley, and PG Tips.

review/summary: PG Tips Gal
review/text: Both Lyons Gold and PG Tips are made by Unilever.  When I lived in England I started drinking PG Tips.  Back here in the states I've tried all kinds of teas and ended up tracking down places to buy PG Tips.  I read here and a couple other places that some people like Lyons Gold better than PG Tips.  Curious I wanted to give it a try.  Well, it reinforced that I really am a PG Tips gal and there's no replacing my PG Tips tea.  I love the malty flavor of PG Tips and this was lacking in the Lyons Gold tea.  I gave Lyons Gold 5 stars because it is a good tea and should not be down graded because of my preference for PG Tips.  But if you love PG Tips and are reading these reviews, I hope this info is of help for you.  I'll have to find a Lyons Gold person to pass this tea on to.

review/text: This is the best tea. It has a well rounded full flavor that no other tea has. It isn't wimpy...it is a tea for real tea drinkers. The gold blend I think is more flavorful and has a great dark, amber and gold color. The pyramid shaped bag definitely makes a better cup of tea than other types of bags from the common mass market brands.....this is a great price for 3 boxes since one box of 80 at the store usually costs $8.

review/summary: Whole Wheat ? Not the way you think!
review/text: My SCAM alert went off like a claxon when I saw this.<br />'Whole Wheat' can mean one of two entirely different things.<br /><br />1) It can mean it is made from the entire wheat berry.<br />or<br />2) It is plain old white flour stripped of its nutrient germ and bran but the product is 100% wheat and does not include OTHER grains<br /><br />Read the ingredients on this and you will see "Duram Whole Wheat Semolina"<br />Looking up Semolina, I see that it is the endosperm WITHOUT the Bran or Germ.<br />In other words, this appears to be plain old common white pasta.<br />I imagine they added color to it to darken it.<br /><br />The only thing that appears to be authentic about the term whole wheat in this case is that there is no other grain in the ingredients.<br />It does not appear to be made from the whole wheat berry though!<br />I hate this kind of misdirection, but when you see "Whole Wheat",<br />I would not assume that the entire wheat berry is being used,<br />it often is nothing more than 100% plain old white flour - of course, made from wheat and no other grain.

review/summary: 12 cal and 5g of Fiber
review/text: The fact that one piece has only 12 cal. and 5g of Fiber is why I wanted to give this a try; who wouldn't; and after reading the reviews I thought I would be one of those people who could handle eating a piece with nothing on it.  I was so wrong.  I can only handle one piece a day and there is 90 cal of Almond butter now added and a full glass of water along side it.  Having said that, after a small salad and one of these crackers, I am full all afternoon long.  So worth it in my books.  We will see if this helps with the weight loss!<br /><br />Update:  I am now breaking up a cracker on my salads and find that I absolutely love it, it is so easy to eat now and I feel full for hours!  10 lbs lost!

review/text: A picture of this crispbread should be in the dictionary next to the definition of cardboard. There are so many better products in the market today that I don't understand why someone would willingly purchase this product other than as an experiment (which was my case). It is somewhat more palatable crushed and used in place of breadcrumbs in meatloaf-type recipes, but even for this there are better options.

review/summary: Benefits out"weigh" flavor
review/text: Got the recommendation from the F-Factor Diet book.  Lost 4 pounds in 3 days and I do attribute a big part to the GGs.  I am a nervous eater (get anxious, nervous, pressured and I start looking for something to munch on to distract me) and these little 3.5" x 2.5" crackers are just the thing.  As we're learning most of us do not get enough fiber these days.  Americans average approximately 15 grams of fiber daily, maybe.  The Heart Association recommends 25-30 grams a day. GGs are a nice booster. Also just one cracker gets rid of that hunger between meals for me.  I haven't even tried putting anything on them yet.  They are just so convenient.  Granted they are not the most tasty thing ever and not that easy to find, but their benefits far outweighs their taste. Plus because they are pretty dry they do force you to hydrate. (preferrably water which most of do not get enough of either) Just saw a review that someone crunches these into soup.  Can't wait to try.

However, considering that Trader Joes sprouted bread tastes great and only has 7 net grams of fiber per slice, I will stick with that.  Pop a couple of fiber pills and you can get the net carbs down to 2 if you are really counting carbs that closely.

If the dog happened to swallow the whole Greenie, it WOULD dissolve in the stomach just fine.<br /><br />HOWEVER, as my Vet cautioned, get the RIGHT SIZE Greenie for your dog, so that if doggie does swallow it, it won't present a blockage risk.<br /><br />My only complaint with this product is that they don't last long, as my little guy gobbles it up frantically...

review/summary: Not our best idea
review/text: As a treat to our 2 year old ACD mix, we bought this bone for her.  She loves her nylabone durachew (much to my dismay) and we were aware that this one was actually edible before we bought it.  We don't often give her treats like this, and she really seemed to love it.  So much so, in fact, that the entire thing was nearly gone within 10 minutes..... and we purchased the largest one - the one with the first on the end since our dog is 50+ lbs.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling about it, and a few hours later, it was confirmed.  My dog started gagging and then vomitted.  She ate it at about 4pm and got sick around 10pm.  Slept through the night, although she woke me up a few times, and was still licking her mouth and gagging the next morning.  I don't know if it's because the bone is really rich and she's not used to it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless it's a product you and your dog are already familiar with as it was our experience that it made our dog ill.<br /><br />If you do purchase this product, definitely make sure you watch your dog with it - if they're eating it too fast, consider taking it away so they don't devour the entire thing in 10 minutes like ours did.

review/summary: If you know what you are buying, these are great.
review/text: Let me start off by saying I love these. My dog gets so excited when he gets one of these. These are not durable and go away within an hour or two, but they are meant to. These are not meant to be for a teething puppy or for a chew toy that lasts. These are supposed to be super special treats that you give your dog once in a blue moon (Like if you are leaving to go on a trip). Yes, they are expensive, but for a reason. They are made in the U.S. and for those of you that do not know, it is healthier to get treats from the U.S. if you can. They are also healthy. One Dentastix is about 300 calories and I read many reviews saying it gave their dog diarrhea and made them sick. Yes there is a review saying this made their dog sick, but he probably ate it too fast. Your dog may need to be watched while eating these. These are meant for a treat and not a bone that lasts. But my dog loves them and that makes me happy!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it. When she finally finished the original plastic bone I decided to go back to the store and grab some more. I was looking around and came across these, "natural," flavored bones and thought.... "SWEET!!! Same great bone but easier to digest!" How wrong I was. First off this is NOTHING like the plastic teething bones. They crumble easily... and by easily I mean my 3.5 month old Wheaten Terrier destroyed these in less than 30min, and she's only about 15 pounds right now. They are recommended for dogs 6 months + with pretty much a full set of permanent teeth because they can shred the bone more easily and to a finer debris. For my dog this was BS... she destroyed these into tiny little flakes that can be easily digested AND managed to get them all over her underbelly and tangled in her fur. The mess wasn't an issue.. the durability was. This is basically an expensive treat, I much rather give her bullysticks over this as a treat (and they last longer). If your dog is teething, this is def NOT the Nylabone version you want. Stick to the original plastic flavored bones or frozen towels. Both work great.

review/summary: is eaten way too fast
review/text: I was under the impression when I bought this at our local pet supply store (based on salesperson's advice) that this bone, while edible, would take several days of working on to be consumed.  Great.  It's a little pricey, but I have a teething 5 month old puppy who has recently been spayed; she can't get her regular course of exercise so I bought this as a nice treat to help keep her occupied in her restless state.  I took it away from her (mad dog!) after 45 minutes.  Just one end was left.  I had bought her the largest "souper" size.  After reading the other reviews, I count myself lucky that she got that much time out of it.  Yes it's a "treat", but at $6, it's a treat I cannot afford to give her very often.  Health wise it's not a treat I could make a habit of feeding often; I feel I have to give my puppy less dinner tonight to make up for the large amount of calories she just wolfed down.  I hope that it doesn't make her sick as it did another reviewer's dog.  I could take her kong, put a spoonful of kibble in it, break up a slice of cheese and shove it in there, stick the whole thing in the microwave for a few seconds to get the cheese melty, let it cool down, and THAT will take her a good 15 minutes to manage to get out.  All for a LOT less money.  That said, I give it 0 stars for value, 5 for "my dog loved it".  It gets a 2 overall from me and I probably would not buy again, nor would I recommend to a friend.

review/summary: Once in a while special treat
review/text: My 9 month old 45 lb pit bull is an avid chewer who has and will eat just about anything he can find, including my hard wood floors.. while picking up bird food I grabbed one of these relieved that at least when he devoured it he wasn't eating chunks of plastic and hence wouldn't get mad when I had to take it away and throw it in the trash.  I came home, read a magazine, he sat quietly on the sofa beside me happily chewing and by the time I had finished my magazine he had finished his bone.  While certainly not a long lasting chew it is something I'd pick up again when I get bird food since I know he enjoys it.  I used to buy the stuffed regular bones but then I'd end up with him wanting to play fetch with the empty bone and would end up throwing it away so at least I know this isn't something that months later i'm stepping on getting out of bed.

review/summary: what a waste
review/text: I wish I had read the other two reviews here. I picked this up at a local store for about 6 bucks. My dog just ate half of it in 5 minutes and would be done with it now if I had not taken it away. And he is only 5 months old...so an older bigger dog could destroy this even quicker. I can't believe they actually sell these...at that price at least. He absolutely loved it and is quite mad I took it away...but not worth the money.

review/summary: doesn't last very long
review/text: As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.<br /><br />With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.<br /><br />I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).<br /><br />My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it.

review/summary: Just like the ones in Belgium!
review/text: I fell in love with the taste of Biscoff in Belgium, where they're called "speculaas" and bear no resemblance to the windmill cookies we know in the US.  In Belgium, they serve one or two cookies with every cup of coffee or tea.  When my stash from Belgium ran out, I remembered enjoying Biscoff on USAir, and found them online. These are individually packaged just like the ones on the airline or in the Belgian cafe.  The packaging, though wasteful, works well to keep them fresh if you're trying to make them last.

review/text: I first had these "treasures" aboard a flight on Delta airlines. These cookies really pack an incredible amount of flavor into their "unassuming" crisp exterior. Normally I would pretty much ignore a crisp cookie. These are crisp BUT buttery, sweet, subtly spiced and literally melt-in-your-mouth. with a cup of coffee DIVINE!( I also kept the wrapper to order online) however I can find them in the International section of Meijer and most other grocery stores. The Biscoff spread on top of a toasted English muffin or a Walker's shortbread cookie is nirvana! Enjoy!

review/text: I first tasted Biscoff cookies on a flight from California.  Wow!  This is what cookies are supposed to be, crispy,sweet,and full of pure flavor.  So often people call a flat round cake-like product a cookie.  If I want cake I will eat cake.  When I want a cookie it should be crispy.  Biscoff fills the bill.

review/summary: A wonderful, high quality food that is great for the cat!
review/text: My cat has serious food allergies. She used to wheeze and breathe loudly--and was also bloated from my misguided, if well intentioned, attempts to feed her a very good quality chicken-based food (*see my other reviews for this brand.)<br /><br />Now, the food was excellent, but poor kitty was allergic to chicken. The vet put her on a veterinary diet that was supposed to be rabbit but seemed to be mostly vegetable. I tried the Nature's Logic Rabbit Dinner instead and the results have been phenomenal. The cat eats it with enthusiasm, has lost a pound, has a coat that is sleek and shiny, and her wheezing and bloated appearance are a thing of the past.<br /><br />Rabbit is an excellent food for cats since it is close to their natural prey (I call it 'uptown mouse')<br /><br />This is an outstanding brand of cat food made by people who seem to really care about what the cats eat. I am very pleased with the product and can recommend it very highly--and so can the cat!

review/summary: Not accepted by all cats
review/text: It might be OK for small young cats who will eat about anything, but my large older cats ignored it after the first few bites, perhaps because the size, shape and texture of the individual bits is wrong for them. The bits are very small, hard,  and have pointed tips, perhaps making them uncomfortable to chew. My adult cats go for the kinds of dry food that have much larger and rounder chunks.

review/summary: Rabbit dry and canned is their favorite!
review/text: The food this company makes is the closest I can find to raw until I actually get to feed mine raw more often. The value is amazing... actually because it is so dense with nutrients, my cats eat less and I spend less feeding them this brand of food than the other premium brands I was feeding them before.<br /><br />The Rabbit flavor is a favorite. I give them a bit of the dry here and there, but mostly wet. The kibbles are actually rounded and triangular. I am not sure what another reviewer received but it sounds nothing like what the product I have been getting looks like.<br /><br />My cats love this kibble! Their coats are magnificent! Their stools are small and odorless, similar to what it would look like if they were on a raw diet. My oldest cat who had mild digestive issues doesn't have them anymore. Hooray! I also noticed that while on this brand of food, the crusty sleepies in their eyes are just about non-existent. I hardly have to groom their faces anymore. And they are so active I can hardly believe they have that much energy for their ages.<br /><br />I honestly believe that having no synthesized vitamins makes a world of difference. I had to go back to my old brand of kibble for a short time because I was waiting for my next Nature's Logic order to arrive. On their old brand the cats were producing so much extra waste and it wasn't nearly as healthy-looking. The difference really is amazing. There is no doubt to me the Nature's Logic foods are truly easy to digest and the nutrients are absorbed and used! I hope they continue to grow and the product becomes more well known and available.<br /><br />Pros : Improves Coat, Increased Activity, Good Value, Likes It, All Natural, Good Taste, Nutritional, Easy To Digest, Odorless Stools<br />Cons : Few Flavor Selections

review/summary: Fresh pecans, good customer service
review/text: I ordered the pecans through Amazon in time for Thanksgiving at what I thought was a good price, in a bundle of three bags. Thus I was horrified when the pecans arrived as only one bag (out of three). I immediately e-mailed the company (from my private acct) with a scathing message, and they handled my ire very well. As it turned out, had I checked my b'ness e-mail first, I would've learned a day before that they ran out of stock, were refunding my purchase price and shipping charges, and sending me the pecans as a "we're so sorry" concession (gratis). Sure, I had to buy more pecans at a brick and mortar store (inconvenience, higher cost), but the pecans they sent were fresh, sweet, well packaged, and Soap.inc's customer service was excellent. I'm only taking a star off because they should have been on top of their inventory--but I understand that what they offer on their own website comes in different quantities than what's offered on Amazon. I wouldn't hesitate to order from this company again.

review/summary: Mmmm. This is a Wonderful Potato Soup!
review/text: I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Market. They're a British company and a lot of their items (other than store brands) are imported from England and elsewhere in Europe. One such item I discovered was Heinz Potato and Leek Soup in 14.1-ounce cans. Boy is this stuff good! You don't taste the salt, but it's a bit higher in sodium than I'd like. It has fairly low fat content and no trtans fats. The protien content is low so you'd probably want to serve it as a side dish to a meal. But it would make a wonderful side dish, that's for certain. The soup has a nice creamy texture with little square pieces of potato (about 1/4 inch on a side) floating in the creamy  sauce. The potatoes are done to perfection. Mmmmmm. This is just a wonderful soup.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
