review/summary: My All-Time Favorite Tully's K-Cup Flavor!
review/text: I usually drink Tully's French or Kona, but decided to get this since I had seen some really good reviews on it. It seemed like a lot of people were buying it, so I wanted to find out why.<br /><br />It's great! Of course we all have different tastes and taste buds that we're dealing with, so my "Great" coffee may not be someone else's choice. However, it's GREAT!<br /><br />1) I love the taste!<br />2) I love the aroma!<br />3) I love the combination of the taste and aroma!<br /><br />I know that I'll be getting this one again and again.<br /><br />UPDATED 3-4-12 to say that this is my absolute favorite coffee. This is the one I always want to drink when given a choice. I try not to run out of it.

review/summary: Amazing Fudge
review/text: Back in the year 2000, I managed a little gourmet snack company in Beaumont, Texas. The company was(is) called Big Steer Enterprises and the best item we marketed was this microwavable fudge from Galleria. Whether I was making the 14oz. package or the 2 and a half pound package this fudge turned out well everytime. It did not matter if the temp outside was hot or cold, nor did it matter if the humidity was at 95% (as it often is here). Truly an amazing fudge that is simple to make in less than three minutes!! A few years ago I contacted the company to get more fudge only to find that they no longer carried this item - as a chocolate lover this was a sad day indeed. But now I see Amazon has it listed. I will continue to check on it's availability. Thank you Amazon.<br />Just a hint: adding pecans, or adding peanut butter (very pleasing, i assure you) will enhance this fudge. But you must know that this is one of the smoothest fudges I have ever experienced and I recommend it to any chocolate lover!  ...no need to wait for Christmas!

review/summary: GOOD COFFEE FOR KEURIG VUE
review/text: I had been using this coffee in my K cup machine for several years and found only one coffee, Tully's French Roast, that could equal or beetter it. In my Vue cup machine, the regular vue cup size does not seem as strong as the K cup; so, I ordered the Donut Shop (the Coffee People) travel mug size vue cup and brew it for a ten ounce cup. Doing that makes it better than the K cup version. I happen to like very strong coffee and this vue cup experience may be unique to me. Tully's regular vue cup size is stong enough for me however.  I like the Donut Shop Vue Cup travel mug size sufficient to have set up automatic monthly delivery. I might add that I still order Tully's French Roast for an even stronger non-bitter brew. Variety is one of the great advantages of the Keurig system.

review/summary: Excellent! Deserves its popularity and..it's versatile as well
review/text: This coffee has me warming up to my VUE Keurig machine. The flavor is supposed to match the coffee, medium roast, found in famous donut shops around the US (you know who.) I found that if I brew it 8 oz or 10 oz and add a bit of evaporated milk or half-and-half and a tsp of sugar, it tastes EXACTLY like the (shhh....d.d.) coffee.<br /><br />However, this brew is more versatile than just lashed with milk and sweetened. It turns out, if you set your VUE to 184 to 190 degrees (NOT the hottest setting in other words) and brew this on 8 oz, on the "strong" setting, you get a very decent cup of coffee that is rather like high end restaurant coffee and it is superb when drunk black. Nothing. No milk. No sugar. Just as it is. The medium roast brewed strong tastes rich but not overly bitter. The lower temperature seems to bring the best out of the cup. To change the temp, the front screen on the touch screen has an arrow at the bottom and that is where settings can be changed, including brewing temperature.<br /><br />The nice thing, you can vary this brew to suit your tastes. Like, mild, light coffee? Brew this 10 oz or higher, with higher temp and on regular. Like a more European, "cafe filtre" sort of taste, brew 8 oz, on lower temp, on "strong." Versatile. I think so far, along with Nantucket Blend, this is my favorite coffee and it has absolutely gotten me to admire my VUE when I was just lukewarm to it at first.

review/text: Great tea to boost your immune system, it also works as stress reliever, the tulsi or holy basil is native to India. This herb improves resistance to stress and has a normalizing influence on blood pressure and blood sugar imbalances. Used on a regular basis as tea or tincture, Tulsi is likely to prove prophyllactic against the negative effects of environmental toxins, including cancer. The plant is also richly endowed with bioavailable antioxidants, vitamins A and C, and calcium. Great taste as well, I love it!

review/summary: Beautiful aroma, but flavor somewhat weak.
review/text: In looking for Organic India Tulsi Tea (Tulsi+black tea blend), I came upon this brand. I like infusing Tulsi with black tea, and I have tried to do this by combining Tulsi bags with Orange Pekoe tea bags. The tea carries the aroma of the Tulsi and smells enticing. I would have liked a stronger flavor, though, something that I can achieve dipping two of these tea bags with one sachet of Orange Pekoe. By itself it tastes good, and smells divine. Perhaps it is my palette or blending Tulsi with another tea is a really bad idea, but it loses a star because its flavor is weaker than the Organics India Tulsi Tea I have had before.

review/summary: Buyers beware!
review/text: The expiration on this box of tea which I purchased on 1 November 2011 was marked as best used Dec 2013 but should have read Dec 2010. The box contained 6 packages each containing 16 individually wrapped tea bags. After going through 4 packages of this same shipment, opening yet another package of the box, I found the label used as the suggested best used by date peeling and that it was placed over the actual suggested best used date which was printed on the package. The date the manufacturer suggests this tea should be used by was December 2010. My problem is not with the seller selling it past that date; the issue lies with the deception of covering the manufacturer's suggested best used date. I am no tea expert, I am however quite capable of realizing when I am being scammed. So, buyers beware!!!

It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.<br />So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts "dancing".<br />I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times. But he likes them even though they have a terrible smell. I would buy again.

review/text: These chew sticks keep my dog's teeth pretty clean between cleanings.  That's what they're supposed to do.  But when my dog developed a weight problem, and the vet vetoed "doggie treats", these little goodies kept ME out of the dog house.  When the treats stopped coming, my dog whined and put on a show of such pitiable neediness, that I had to do something to quiet her down.  I remembered that the ingredients in her Dental Stix were healthful and not likely to hurt her weight loss program a bit.  I went back to using these as directed, and my dog kept on losing weight, reached her goal, and has stayed there.  And we did it without her feeling deprived.  Not bad at all!

Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish.

review/text: I love Goya Agua de Coco, but it always has some sweetener added to it. I have been looking for the unsweetened Goya Agua de Coco for a long time. Most of the coconut water products out there are too expensive. Thank you for carrying this product, and at a reasonable price. It arrived in excellent condition, and the taste is very refreshing! I'm sure that I will be ordering it again.

review/summary: Very Tart and Somewhat bitter Taste
review/text: Everyone's taste buds are different, but I personally thought that this juice was a bit extreme. It is very tart and has a slight bitter aftertaste.  If you have never tried this flavor, I'd recommend purchasing it in smaller quantities to check the taste.  I won't say that we are stuck with 38 boxes, I'm sure I'll eventually drink them, but it will be a last choice.  This flavor is just not for me.

Good deal, this tub will last months if not a year.

review/summary: great deal for good quality coconut oil
review/text: I bought this coconut oil, not for popcorn, but to add more good fat to my diet. Despite the coloring, which is just beta-carotine (what makes carrots orange) it has a very neutral flavor, which is what I was looking for. It does very well as a substitute for butter or ghee, both of which I am allergic to. I add it to baked potatoes or baked fish, and in the lentil dishes I eat regularly. I did not see any advantages buying extra-virgin or specially processed coconut oil, since coconut oil is a plant based saturated fat and quite stable, even with processing. Overall, I think this is a good deal for those looking for a decent butter substitute or looking to add some safe saturated fats to their diet. Maybe someday I'll try it with popcorn.

review/summary: A really good product
review/text: Obviously some of the reviewers don't know what coconut oil is. If it arrived "hard as a rock" it means the air was cold. If it was "semi-liquid" then it was a little warmer in the delivery truck. Coconut oil is generally solid unless you melt it. That said -- I ordered this for popcorn AND for general cooking. I couldn't detect any flavor in it but it did make the popcorn taste good. I used it for cooking and it seems to work well. I was skeptical because it is so much cheaper than other coconut oil which cost generally 50.00 - 60.00 for a gallon. The label doesn't say how it was processed so maybe that's why it is cheaper. Maybe I should care about processing but I'm hoping it doesn't matter that much. The color doesn't matter to me. Hopefully I'll be able to enjoy the benefits of coconut oil without the steep price tags the other brands have. The only negative is the container. It really is hard to get out. I'll be melting it and putting some in a smaller container that will be easier to use. Get it -- try it -- you'll like it!

review/text: This is a great "tea".  Technically, it's not a tea-or so I'm told.  It looks like a tea, smells like a tea, brews like a tea, etc you get the idea.  It is naturally caffeine free so that is a bonus for those trying to avoid caffeine.  I expected this particular flavor to be somewhat like pinacolda but found that it is a light tea flavor with a cinnamon zing to it (which I happen to love).  Adagio teas are some of the best.  They come in a nice tin as loose leaf.  You will need a steeper of some sort or just brew a small batch in your coffee pot.  For me this is a great iced tea sweetened with a bit of sugar.  Oh I forgot to mention that this tea has a naturally sweet flavor to it so you could go easy on the sugar.  (But hey you only live once)

We use this with a light amount of Lemon Pepper but heavy on the Cavenders. First time I was introduced to this on a steak I thought the steak was too big to eat, but it tasted so good I ate the entire thing!  Our steaks are always grilled with charcoal which also adds to the flavor.<br /><br />I'm having trouble with the company that provides it though, Parthenon Foods, they used an incorrect zipcode and are telling me that the package never got returned to them.  It's been 5 months and I'm still trying to get a replacement or refund out of them.

Add a little lime juice (I prefer "Nellie and Joe's Key Lime Juice") for an extra zing. You now know the secret to Greek-style potatoes, too.<br /><br />And, you also have the perfect gift to share with friends and family! Start saving empty spice bottles. The labels wash off, so you can re-label them with your own name and "Mystery Spice Mix." I don't re-label, though. I just share. My family and friends think I'm so smart for buying Cavender's in bulk, especially when Amazon has it for such a great price and fast, FREE delivery.<br /><br />Oh, Amazon's price is quite competitive with local prices, too.

review/text: I agree....it works with ANYTHING!  Great on turkey burgers...really zips up an otherwise boring non flavor.  Use on any meat, veggies for grilling, soups and stews; add to meatball mix and make wonderful dips and spreads.  Try mixing Feta cheese, bit of mayo, little bit of Greek Salad dressing (I use Yassou, but I think that one's local to Boston) and Cavender's.  Whip to incorporate all ingredients into a smooth thick dip.  Use with veggies, crackers or my favorite, on grilled turkey burgers.  If you want to use the dip with lamb, add lemon juice and fresh or dried mint.  Yummy!  There is just so much you can do with it!  I too buy it in the five pound tub.  If the ship were sinking, the Cavender's goes with me!

I had purchased them for a party I was throwing and there was not time to for them to send more before the event. They not only refunded my money, but they also let me keep the gummy bears I had received to save me having to pay to ship them back. We were so glad they let us keep them! These gummy bears are so good!! Way better than the ones I ended up using for the party. I will buy from this company again!

review/summary: over priced, small, dubious quality
review/text: As a background, i have been preparing escargot for years at home and decided to upgrade my aging collection of olde Pyrex and metal escargot plates and to have matching dishes to serve 6 friends or family.<br /><br />I just received my escargot plates-had hoped that the ceramic would be superior in heat retention.<br />My disappointment comes from the quality.  The plates themselves appear to be a heavy stoneware-like material.  They are not. Worse still when i called the vendor i was told that each plate was very heavy and that was the reason for the high shipping cost.  A lot of nonsense and hooey.<br /><br />The glazing was incomplete on the bottoms of three out of 6, and on one of the handles.  This may result in moisture penetrating the ceramic.  It certainly will make clean up tougher.  The depressions are small at best to hold small snails and ample butter, and downright tight for the extra large snails. There is no lip on the edge which will allow for extra butter.  Worst is that these are 4.5" in diameter-downright small.  Very disappointing and i would not recommend these.<br /><br />They are, however, minimally functional and appear that they would retain heat similarly but not better than glass or ceramic plates without the bowl.<br /><br />Also the picture seems to show a two tone dish, brown top with a more rustic grey brown lower section, like real stoneware,  as well as a taper-mine are not like this, they are evenly brown and not tapered.<br /><br />Not happy as there as larger plain ceramic dishes available for half the price.  I thought these were a superior product.  I would not recommend these for the above reasons.  Shipping prices posted are ridiculous.  Actually, not ridiculous, they are outrageous, as all six, in thier cehap cardboard box (which holds six-likely originally sold as sets) weighed about 1.5 lbs total. The shipping prices quoted via the Amazon portal are absurd.  These bowls are made in Taiwan, which only bearing is that the cost versus quality is apparent.  WHiel the description i accessed indicates these are made in France , they are not.<br /><br />IMHO a waste of money, unless you like the color and compactness. When i complained to the vendor i was dismayed at the customer service, including a claim for re-stocking fees for defective items shipped, something i have never encountered. More dismaying still, is that these items in the vendors catalog, included in my shipment , sell for almost a dollar less than listed here.  So not only does the seller charge high shipping, a handling charge, but also more than its own catalog price.  I think this is a vendor to be avoided from my experience.

review/summary: Quality food without the unnecessary additives
review/text: Cats are carnivores.  If you check out the ingredients list for many of the common brands you find at the grocery store, you'll see the first couple of ingredients are *not* meat, but rather grains.  As well, the meat typically is made up of by-products, which are not suitable for human consumption.  Yes,  I know, we're not going to be consuming our feline companion's food, but the reality is with cats and their funky digestive tract issues, their food should not contain grain or meat by-products, plain and simple.<br /><br />There are a number of outstanding grain-free cat foods out there, but this one in particular our cats eat happily.  One of our cats was significantly overweight, and with NOW recommended by our veterinarian , my fiancee gave it a try. At the time he began this food, we were actually living on opposite coasts and I hadn't seen the cats in roughly 8 months given my travels.  When I saw our cat after that absence, I was shocked to see how slimmed down he was and how healthy he had become.  Using this food, in combination with that feeding bowl in which the cats have to stick their paws into to retrieve the food (looks like a flying saucer) has been the key to success!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this product is not widely stocked at pet care places in our area, but I am delighted that Amazon carries it.  I've been able to order it, trouble-free, and the food arrives fresh and ready to be consumed.  I highly recommend this brand and encourage you to read the ingredient labels on anything you feed your pet-companions.

review/summary: Great ingredients, I think.
review/text: I bought a small bag of this to try with my cats.  One is 16 years old and the other 10.  Both seemed to enjoy it as a snack, so I went back and bough the large 10lb bag, thinking I was doing them a favor.  The ingredients are impressive, however, as I slowly moved them over from their traditional Purina One to this product, both of them developed a severe case of the runs.  So, I portioned them back to a larger portion of the Purina One thinking they needed more time to adjust to this new food, however I can't seem to get them back to normal.  So, I have 95% of this bag and am not currently feeding them any of it.  I also had to get some remedy for the diahrrea, which is taking time to kick in.<br /><br />As I mentioned, they seemed to love the taste, but it has been a big problem for their digestive systems.

review/summary: Great for older cat with sensitive skin
review/text: About a year ago, my 12-year-old cat developed an itchy rash on her forehead.  The vet ruled out more serious health issues, and speculated that it was an allergic reaction or food sensitivity.  And so began a year of cat food experiments...<br /><br />We tried a range of grain-free foods with various protein sources.  Some didn't help the skin; some she didn't like. The local pet food store suggested this.  The big selling point was that it doesn't have any "meals"-- no "chicken meal" or "fish meal" or "turkey byproduct" or whatever.  She has been eating this for the past 6 months or so, and her skin has cleared up remarkably.  And the fact that she taps on my cheek until I wake up and feed her in the morning suggests that it is also quite delicious.<br /><br />It is expensive, but it has helped her skin issues enough that it's been worth it.  (A trip to the vet costs quite a bit more!)  If you have an older cat that seems to have developed a food sensitivity, this is definitely a good option to try.

review/summary: Outstanding food, grain free
review/text: As any cat owner will tell you, cat digestive systems are a royal challenge.  Now! Dry Cat Food is a unique product that doesn't have any fillers, no grain at all, and the meat that is used contains no by-products.  Essentially, it's human-grade.<br /><br />Cat's are carnivores, plain and simple.  And this food addresses that beautifully.<br /><br />This particular formula, for senior and overweight cats, has made a huge difference in the quality of our cat's health.  My cats love the taste, never turn their nose up from this product, and my formerly over-weight cat is now looking terrific, and both he and his brother are very healthy - healthy coat, bright eyes, etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately this product is not sold every where (yet)but I am grateful I can get it here on Amazon!  I highly recommend this brand.

review/summary: Great for cat with Irritable Bowel Syndrome
review/text: I've purchased the Now! Grain free (10 lbs) turkey with duck & salmon dry cat food 3 times now over the past 4 months.  Wanted to see how our cat with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) would do on it.  He loves it, and will chow it down to the point where he would get fat, if we let him.  Have to portion it out to him thru the day.  Other cat loves it, too, and she no longer vomits on a regular basis.  Definitely a good quality product which is sold at our veterinarian's office, but I buy it online with Amazon for better price. Sidenote:  we're gradually starting to reduce the amount of budesonide medicine given to our cat with IBS problem to eventually see how he does without the medicine & if he's okay just being on Now! grain free food.

review/text: I have been looking for an all natural alternative to tonic waters with HFCS or Aspertame. These are the perfect size to make two drinks. No capping bottles and coming back to a flat opened bottle. I didn't really like it with Tangueray, but I switched to  Beefeater (a friend told me the difference is that Beefeaters is dryer). Beefeater, Hansens and a squeeze of real (1/8 of a nice juicy lime)lime equals the perfect gin and tonic. In my opinion anyway.

review/summary: Excellent value for gin & tonics, but pair carefully
review/text: At our house, we make a lot of mixed drinks, and have intentionally sampled most of the widely distributed tonic brands, including several of the premium offerings. We've tried: QTonic, FeverTree, Stirrings, 365 (Whole Foods store brand), Seagrams, Schwepp's, Canada Dry, Hansen's. Different tonics pair best with different gins, and the value has to be weighed, considering that some tonics can cost 30x more than others per oz.<br /><br />There is always a value equation when making drinks, and you need to consider the total cost of cocktails, especially if you have drinks often, or host a lot of dinner parties.<br /><br />Some of the options (Fevertree, Q Tonic are good examples) can be really expensive at ~$2 per 6.8oz bottle; that starts to get a little steep per drink. Suddenly two cocktails each for a group of 7-8 friends has added $20-30 in tonic water to your evening. The premium tonics are worth buying once to experiment with, and can be great options for "artisinal" cocktails, but they also have to be carefully paired with the right gin to really bring out their strengths. (Citadelle, a little more of a citrus-y gin, is a nice companion for them both, and it's a mid-shelf gin that is an excellent value.)<br /><br />For everyday drinks, our go-to tonic is Hansen's. It's readily available in our area at Harris Teeter stores for ~$3 per six-pack of 8oz cans, so ~$0.50/can. 8oz is enough to make two G&Ts, and the flavor profile pairs really well with Hendrick's, our preferred G&T gin. Hendrick's is a top-shelf gin with a complex cucumber profile that pairs best with a lighter, less bitter tonic. This is where Hansen's excels. Add a drop of two of bitters, depending on your mood (rhubarb is a favorite, celery is another good option), and you've got one of the best G&Ts you've ever tasted.<br /><br />If you're using New Amsterdam, as one of the previous reviewers mentioned, then Hansen's is NOT the right gin. New Amsterdam is the best choice for a value gin. In our area, it's 1/3 the cost of Hendrick's. We keep it on the shelf for use in several other cocktails, but seldom use it in a G&T. It's sweet and citrusy and needs a bitter tonic to pair with it. For the ultimate in tasty, cheap G&Ts, pair New Amsterdam with Canada Dry Tonic. They pair well, with the bitter notes of Canada Dry complimenting the sweetness of the New Amsterdam, and you can make G&Ts for as little as $0.60/each, depending on the cost of liquor in your area.<br /><br />Bottom line, Hansen's is an excellent value--especially for a cane-sweetened tonic water. But don't write it off just because it doesn't match the gin in your cabinet; different gins need different tonic waters to really shine. Depending on your tastes and your interest in cocktails, you may want to keep several different tonic waters on hand for different occasions. Cheers.

I suppose some of this is up to personal taste, but I nearly felt a film on my teeth after drinking it, and all of the gin flavors were overpowered by the sweetness and the citrus component. Granted, I was using New Amsterdam, which is itself citrusy, but the sweetness would have overpowered even a more neutral gin.<br /><br />Skip.

review/summary: Great price
review/text: My husband eats this type of bar every morning for breakfast and this was one flavor we hadn't seen in the stores before.  The only one I tried seemed a bit stale but he hasn't noticed that with any of the others in the box.

review/text: These are very filling for their small size, and quite tasty.  I wish they had more pretzel, but I still like them.  Great on the go breakfast.

review/summary: Blech!
review/text: I enjoy the Kashi GOLEAN bars. They are portable, low cal, high fiber, and high protein. They keep you feeling satisfied and full way better than most bars. These did deliver in that aspect. I was excited to try this variety as I enjoy chocolate covered pretzels. The chocolate bottom coating tasted as good as the other varieties, but the bar portion? I was expecting a bit of salt and a bit of crunch. It tasted like a soggy tasteless mess. Nothing pretzel like about it. Even trying to put aside the expectation of a pretzel taste, it still was not enjoyable.

review/summary: Anya Loves It!
review/text: We had Anya on the diet Iams for a year, and when she FINALLY lost down to normal weight, I saw this item.  Anya, a Russian Blue from the branch of PAWS in DeKalb Co, GA, is always hungry...kind of like her owner.  As usual, she tore open the bag when it didn't get put up promptly.  But, I do notice that my cat is extra enthusiastic to get to this food!  To keep from having to have two kinds of treats handy, I keep a small bottle of this within reach at all times.  The two dogs and cat eagerly do tricks for this kibble!  It doesn't hurt a dog to eat a small quantity of cat food [dogs will gain weight if they have access to a steady supply].  However, dog food on a regular basis can give a cat kidney problems.  Even though treats are probably not enough to do this, I feel safer using cat food for everybody :)<br /><br />Anya has been on this food for over a year now, and she still is just as eager during our furkid kindergarten as she was the first time I used it.<br /><br />I am a fan of Iams food because, as they advertise, the cat box doesn't smell as bad on a diet of Iams as it does with Purina [I haven't used other brands]. Also, we don't have to feed as much Iams as Purina.  Like most cats, Anya is constantly hungry, so we just feed her twice a day. The only thing I give her that is not Iams is an occasional plain piece of meat, or a taste of greens or fruit off my plate [no sauces].  Cats hate citrus, but if I'm eating an orange, she will taste a tiny grain with juice inside. Because I resist her begging, she keeps her svelte hourglass figure.  Anya has soft fur and she smells good.  I think diet has a large part to play in her health, as I believe it does with dogs.
