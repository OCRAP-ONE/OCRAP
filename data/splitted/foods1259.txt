review/text: I got this gum to keep in my purse to chew after meals when I'm away from my toothbrush.  The Xylitol is good for your teeth and I like the subtle cinnamon flavor.  Is it the most fabulous, invigorating gum you will ever chew?  No...but it isn't gross, so there you go.

review/summary: good ingredients, sadly the flavor doesn't last as long as artificial flavor.
review/text: I was excited to find a cinnamon gum without all the horrible artificial ingredients.<br /><br />Sadly, the flavor wasn't particularly strong, nor did it last long at all. Barely discernible flavor after 10 minutes of chewing. I would love it if they made an "Extra cinnamon" gum that had even more cinnamon oil.<br /><br />However, after trying many of the other xylitol and natural gums on the market, this one has the best flavor of all that I have tried.

review/text: The gum is not positively bad, but it's not good, either.  If it didn't say "cinammon" on the package, I never would have guessed.  I know it sounds ironic to say that "the flavor is not good and it also doesn't last long enough," but that's the essence.  You have a generic, sugary flavor that disappears after about 5 minutes.  After that, it's like chewing a piece of rubber.

It took a bit of trial and error to get the ratio right to my taste.  I can recommend this tea with no reservations.

You simply marinade the item, let it sit for 30 minutes on the fridge and cook it.  Very nice for a quick and flavorful dinner.

review/summary: Turned Rancid
review/text: I first reviewed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEHQV8">these crackers for the Amazon Vine program in January, 2012,</a> listed as being sold in packs of six. Below are my original and updated comments:<br /><br />***** Original Comments *****<br /><br />Nabisco Premium saltines have been *the* saltine in our household since my childhood, so I was eager to try this new variety. It turns out this is more than just new convenient packaging.<br /><br />First of all, like most "New and Improved" these days, "New" really means "Less per Package." While the standard package of four full-sized sleeves of crackers weighs in at 16 oz., this new packaging holds only 13.6oz. There are only 24 servings per box vs. 30. Minus one star for that. Having said that, I like everything else about this product. The smaller sized sleeves helps keep crackers from going stale.<br /><br />When I tried the crackers, I thought they seemed crisper than "normal" so I compared them to the old style I had in the cabinet. Sure enough, these are different. These crackers are thinner. A stack of five of these is equivalent to four of the old. They are a bit crispier compared to the old version.<br /><br />A check of the ingredients shows a new recipe, too. Unlike the old version, which contain HFCS, these have no sugar at all. The new crackers have a slightly higher calorie count/serving, as well as a bit more fat. The sodium count, however, is down.<br /><br />Bottom line: I like this new version and will buy them when they hit the stores here.<br /><br />*****************<br />UPDATE 07/18/2012<br />*****************<br />Reducing my rating from four stars to one.<br /><br />I stored these crackers as I have all saltine crackers for the past 25 years, and the same way my mother did when I was a child...in a metal box styled to look like a Nabisco Saltine box. They kept unopened sleeves of crackers from going stale or eaten by mice.<br /><br />I opened the next to last sleeve today and discovered the crackers had turned rancid. When saltines go stale the smell ok but taste flat and have little crunch. These had a decided rancid odor and taste, but were just as crunchy as the first sleeve. Never experienced this from Nabisco Saltines, and I've been eating them over 50 years.<br /><br />I am assuming Nabisco sent Amazon factory-fresh crackers to be evaluated, so considering the short time I've had them I am truly disappointed. Unfortunately I tossed the box when I put them in the tin. When I called Nabisco CS I was told I was the first one to report this (what a surprise!). They made no offer to replace the defective crackers, offer coupons, or even ask my name. So not much Customer Service, either.

review/text: I first found this product on sale at my local health food store.  I purchased it as was made a cup of coffee in my 1 to 2 cup (9 oz.) single cup coffee brewer.  I was very excited to experience the rich taste.  I then decided I would like this in decaffeinated.  So my first order came in it still had most of the flavor the caffeinated did.  I then decided I would get the caffeinated version next and did so.  I now have two 2 1/2 pound bags and am set up for coffee for several months.  Since I keep my bags in the freezer I wish my first bag had been ground, but no problem, I have a small grinder which suffices.

review/summary: i'm a fan of tyler but *not* of this flavor
review/text: I enjoy watching Tyler Florence on the Food Network and think he's a very talented chef. I bought this marinade thinking that it should make a very good teriyaki style dinner with some chicken. I was surprised to find that the flavor was really off and did not make for an appetizing meal. This marinade is pretty strong and overpowered the chicken even though it was not in the marinade for very long.<br /><br />The flavor is very "heavy" - I'm not sure how to describe it other than to say it made the chicken taste more like beef and not in a good way. I feel bad giving this just two stars but honestly I just didn't like it and as a somewhat seasoned cook I can't even think of a single thing that I could use this on to make it better.<br /><br />The description says this could be used as a sauce for things like pot stickers; in my opinion these flavors are WAY too strong for that purpose and would totally overpower things like pot stickers.<br /><br />Unfortunately would not purchase this item again or recommend.

review/summary: Possibly the best flavor of "Grill-A-Corn"
review/text: Unlike most corn-based snacks you find in the US, the corn flavor isn't totally wiped out in processing.  The consistency is like a Cheeto, but a light sweet corn flavor remains.  I've tried the other flavors, but I find the red pepper flavoring makes a wonderful contrast to the lightly sweet base. Of course, if spicy isn't your thing at all it's not a good choice, but I find these are easily eaten without anything to cool your mouth (milk, etc) and fine with water.

So you can understand my nervousness when faced with something that screams WEIGHT WATCHERS all over it.<br /><br />Each patty is individually wrapped and worth 1 WW Points + each. I would say each is about the size of a 'fun size' York peppermint patty. The chocolate is rich, the filling is sweet and refreshing. There was no strange minty or saccharine aftertaste. I just love these!<br /><br />My supermarket frequently discounts them 2/$4, which would put them right at $2 for a bag. I believe the bulk version sold on Amazon is a little more expensive.

When I awoke the next day 9/4/12, all symtoms of urinary tract infection were gone.  I bought another bottle of Just Cranberry that day to make sure I was cured. By the way I am one of the minority of men who get UTI. I am cured.

I also prefer the organic version of this, but it is hard to find.<br /><br />Also, I am a nutritionist with a masters degree and this is full of healthy naturally-occurring plant chemicals called phytochemicals.

It's a fantastic oatmeal - far above any of the "Instant" varieties.  It takes me about 5 minutes to prepare in the microwave, but I don't need to add additional fruit or sweetener.  It's perfect exactly like it is from the bag.  Beware though, directions for a "serving" make a BIG serving.  About 1/2 of their serving is what I'm accustomed to eating at once.

review/summary: Healthy and Tasty but Pricy
review/text: These bars are tasty, with a pleasantly firm texture and a slightly more complex flavor than I've grown accustomed to in mass-produced cereal grain products.  After a few bad experiences with bland, gummy gluten-free bars, I was pleased to discover that these were quite good.  They took the edge of my hunger and gave me the nutrient boost I needed to reach the end of a long, hectic day.<br /><br />But each bar is tiny, about the length of my thumb.  I needed more than half a box to get that nutrient boost, which at these prices is no small cost.  I already know that gluten free food is pricier than unhealthy wheat alternatives, but if one snack costs as much as a fast food dinner, that really pinches my budget.  So it's a tough trade-off between health and economy.

review/text: You can see the REAL apples in these.  I think they taste great and my kids love them.  They do not fall apart while being held by toddlers and preschoolers, which is helpful in the car.  Plus, peanut free!  It is difficult to find a good price on allergen safe snack foods.  Amazon has a great price on these.  My only wish is that they were available to subscribe and save.  That would make this perfect!

review/summary: The incredible shrinking bar...
review/text: These have been a favorite of my son for three years now - their convenience, coupled with the fact that they are GF make them a staple at our house. That said, if they get any smaller, they need to start marketing them as cereal instead of bars. We already pay a premium to have food that he can eat without getting sick, and it's hard enough to get him to eat enough - don't reduce the serving size on top of that!<br /><br />If nothing else, the picture on the front of the box needs to be changed as it does not accurately reflect what is contained within. Heck, they may as well put a picture of a chocolate cake on it - there's that much difference between the advertising and the item itself.

review/summary: Excellent gluten free choice!
review/text: As someone who has been gluten free for quite some time, I have had the opportunity to sample many different brands/kinds of gluten free snacks.  People who are new to gluten-free eating may not realize that a lot of gluten-free foods are actually packed with a lot of sugar.  I found this bar to be a great, healthy, low-sugar gluten-free snack choice.  The only downside to this bar is it is a little on the small size.  Nevertheless, it's a great on the go snack, and I always make sure that I have some stashed in my glove compartment in case I am in need of a snack and do not have any gluten-free options available to me.

review/text: Not only is hubby celiac, but very glutamate & aspartate sensitive. It's not to hard to find GF goodies if you pay the price, but it is very hard to find any kind of food without some kind of MSG or related product under other FDA approved names. Enjoy Life has several - Cocoa Loco, Very Berry, and Caramel Apple bars. Snickerdoodles are clean too.<br />  Caramel Apple bars taste great too. Good for snacks at work or running around in the car.<br />  Buy things with Amazon's subscription plan and save money - 15% & free shipping. Don't be afraid of signing up for a set time period. You can de-activate and re-activate subscriptions when you actually need something. They also send a reminder several days before they actually ship something, so you can cancel that order if you wish. Works great! We sometimes get food at about half the price of the local health food store.

review/text: I'm here to assure everyone that this bar is worth it again.  The bar is now a BAR again, and not a nub like it was for a few months.  It's also softer with a more appeasing texture.  The rock is gone!  Someone has clearly listened to the customers in this case.  I actually had filed a complaint with their customer service a few months back.  I'm sure I wasn't alone.  So this change is something I've seen in the last month or two since ordering.  I would highly recommend ordering these again.<br /><br />And as a bonus, this month they're coming with one snicker-doodle gluten free cookie as well.

I think a double-stuffed OREO is bigger.<br />* Hard as a rock, not chewy in any way<br />* Taste leaves something to be desired<br />* More packaging than product. They used wrapper the size of most cereal bars, but it is only about 1/4 of the size of a cereal or snack bar.<br /><br />NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Since I opened up the packaging I couldn't return the product. Stuck with 29 more bricks.

review/summary: It's labelled a "bar", but it sure looks like a cookie to me....
review/text: Whoa, nelly.  This is NOT what I expected.  And not in a good way.  The "bar" on the cover of the box is huge, but inside the package lurks a horrible deceit.  While heavy, at one ounce each, these bars are nothing more glorified cookies, and not very good ones at that.  Oh, don't get me wrong - they taste okay (not great, I'm just trying to be fair here), but the texture is really off, and these are more suitable for using as children's building blocks than a "chewy bar".  The price point is also extreme for something of this size and quality - very steep for what you get in the box (which is mostly packaging, by the way), and left me and my gluten free self feeling taken quite fully advantage of.  Being gluten free is not a choice for me, it's a medical necessity, and it feels terrible to think that a company would hold me hostage financially.  There are many other, newer choices in gluten free eating, and if Enjoy Life wants to remain competitive, I'd suggest they do some quality testing and comparative market research.  I'll pass on these until they do.  Oh, and by the way, I love their cookies, but definitely NOT their prices.  These bars were a disappointment all the way around.  Five bars per box, and in no way worth the money.

review/summary: The pups love it!
review/text: I have a pair of Siberian Huskies, one of which is very picky. She wolfs these down whenever they're offered. A couple people mark these treats down because of the irradiation which is quite foolish. Irradiation uses energy similar to microwaves, just at a different frequency. People see the "radiation" in the word irradiation and make up their mind without educating themselves. The food does not retain the radiant energy. A light bulb radiates photons, but you don't continue to glow after the light bulb is turned off.

I take a few and crumble them on his food and he eats it instantly.  So, I can back off on the people food and feel better he is eating dog food.  They are also great for just an in between snack.  I bought these a few times and one bag seems to last three weeks or so between handing out as treats and crumbling on food.  I'll keep buying these as long as he keeps eating the dog food.

review/text: My 2 yr old mini poodle has had digestive problems. He seemingly cannot eat anything that does not crunch and needs alot of chewing. Bil Jacs, Red Barn, tube foods, chewy heartworm tabs, even canned food gives him problems, as in, they come back up. So dry food is the food of choice and sometimes treats, except for these. Even tho they say "Made in China" they also say "Tested Safe for USA" and so few ingredients, especially the Peas and Carrots, his fav, make me happy I can get them to make him happy. He loves them. We cut them into tiny bit size for training, and seek games, as well as, the "Brain" games.  Have tried other "Made in US" treats--No go.  So please keep these on your inventory.

review/text: It is not my intention to hurt anybody's sales but this product's package was saying "treated by radiation".<br />I found it only at the third package and decided rather not buy it again.<br /><br />There are lots of good pet products that are not irradiated and are going quite nice. I am ok if it is made in China like most of the pet products, I trust your quality control until proven otherwise. I trust an honest effort to make good quality products and inform the customers.<br />If it matters to the producing company, I would rather not feed my best friend with something treated by nuclear radiation. Steam it, freeze dry it, but don't nuke it and leave it natural. If a restaurant would sell you irradiated food, would you consider safe for you?<br /><br />To me, if advertised looking like natural, it must be exactly that, no sneaky fine prints on the back.<br />If the producing company would offer such alternatives (non-irradiated) I would reconsider the review and would buy again this product. I would appreciate any positive feedback. Thanks.

review/summary: You can put this stuff on anything~!!!
review/text: We found the Hidden Valley Ranch Original Dressing to be very flavourable and quite tasty.  We found ourselves putting it on many things and not just salad.  We found it delicious with our pizza, dipping sauce for potato chips and vegetables, putting it on sandwiches, mixing in with our mashed potatoes, using it in our pasta, our coleslaw and mixing it in with our dumplings instead of just milk as the liquid additive.<br /><br />Everything we used this upon gave our food a definitive edge to the overall flavour of whatever it was we were trying to enhance.  We preferred the Original versus the 50% Fat Free and the Fat Free versions.  The Original was thick and creamy and we found with the less fat in it, the more watery it became, which isn't something this family likes all to well.  We want our Ranch dressing to be thick and creamy and while the Original does deliver such highlights, the others were as well received, though they didn't lack in flavour only in texture.<br /><br />The other drawback was to the bottle design, some of the bottles had a small opening at the top to allow for better control in pouring and others did not.  It would be beneficial if ALL bottles carried the smaller spout opening, without such it comes cascading out of the bottle without any real control and you end up with more than you bargained for.  There was no apparent rhyme nor reason as to which bottles carried the spout and which didn't.<br /><br />We shared some of the bottle samples with our neighbours, to give an extra opinion and the consensus seems to be the same.  The less fat, the more watery and the spout is a bonus that was enjoyed by all.<br /><br />Hidden Valley Ranch dressing is more than a salad dressing, it is a condiment that can be added to all your cooking enjoyment!  The product is versatile to add it to any of your cooking and baking needs!

review/text: I ordered these thinking they'd be a healthy snack.  The flavor and texture are very good and I'd take them over Chips any day.  But if you're looking for a healthy snack I'm afraid you'll have to keep looking.  One bag of these (which could easily be eaten in one sitting) has 21 grams of fat, about 60 grams of carbs, and 450 calories! If you're just looking for a tasty snack, I say get them.  But if you don't want all those calories, keep looking.

review/text: I bought YummyEarth Organic Lollipops to have to have in my office as an alternative to regular candy. First, the mini candy jar containers are handy and cute for display. Then there are the lollipops that look great and the flavors sound delicious. However, I didn't care for any of the flavors accept for the pomegranate (dark red). The pomegranate flavor was very good and exotic. The others were not very good. They tasted bitter. Long story short, no one in the office liked them either...and we have some hard-core sugar junkies that passed on them. If they sold a bag of pomegranate only, I might buy them again.

The assortment was supposed to include a Mix of Pomegranate Pucker, Razzmatazz Berry, Cheeky Lemon, Orange Squeeze, Wet-Face Watermelon.  This does not match the flavors we were sent of Pomegranate Pucker, Mango Tango, Tooberry Blueberry, Wet-Face Watermelon.  This is also a non-returnable item so I am stuck with lollipop flavors that I didn't order. I am very disappointed that we did not receive the flavors as advertised on Amazon.

Especially since you are warned over and over again to be careful about eating food when you are visiting.Ok, ok I know that this came off in the wrong light. I was NOT trying to tear down your company. My children (2 and 4) absolutely LOVE these and for that very reason I gave the product a 5 star review. I was just,honestly concerned. As I said in the review.."in light of recent food scares...which was referring mainly to China at the time. And yes I am aware that our food in the US is not as safe as we might believe it is. I just felt that some of the comments were a little harsh. My stepfather is from China and I have many dear friends that were born and educated in Mexico so please do not think that this was bigoted. I was just a question. Thank you for your comment Rob, it was a good answer and I will continue buy this product. It's yummy and I even recommended it to a local icecream store to sell on their counter so I hope that makes you feel better that I was not trying to "slam" your business.<br /><br />jenny

review/summary: Fantastic Tea - Drink it Like a Brit
review/text: The day always goes better after a cup of Yorkshire.  We've tried other Taylors and tried Yorkshire Gold, etc., and this is clearly the best.  Perfect body and smoothness.<br /><br />The first time I arrived in London years ago with a backpack, I got off the train and walked up to a counter and asked for a cup of tea, expecting him to ask me how I liked it.  Instead he cheerfully put down in front of me a mug of Yorkshire with milk in it and said, "Here ya go, luv."  It's the first cup of real tea I've ever had, and the first cup ever that I really enjoyed. Now my British husband and I make it every morning.  This type of Yorkshire needs less tea and less steeping than other loose tea.<br /><br />Here's the way many Brits still do it at home (too bad, but many, especially in London, now drink coffee instead or use tea bags):<br /><br />1. Boil water.<br />2. Heat the teapot by rinsing it out with a slow swish of boiling water, leaving the kettle boiling slowly if possible.<br />3. For two people:  Put in two rounded teaspoons of red (red/orange package) Yorkshire.<br />4.  Pour boiling water over the tea -- enough water for slightly more than two 12-oz. mugs of tea.<br />5.  Cover teapot with tea cozy or towel.  Set timer for 5 1/2 - 7 minutes, depending on your taste for strength.<br />6.  Put 3-4 Tbls. of milk in each mug.<br />7.  Pour tea through a tea strainer into each mug.<br /><br />Wonderful.  And definitely worth the little ceremony.  Not that complex once you do it a couple or three times.

I've also managed to addict every single tea drinker I know to this amazing blend, which only makes it more difficult to find it here on Amazon, as it's a very reasonable price when purchased in bulk. So here you go, you will not find a  better array of blended flavors anywhere, except from the connoisseurs lurking within Taylor's of Harrogate. I also exquisitely jones for the Red Label over the Gold Label [it's just "sturdier stuff"] even though the other stuff is priced higher. OK, the secret's out, Enjoy!

Searching Amazon, I found it again and I stocked up.<br /><br />It's cut differently from other teas and tends to be stronger, I think.

review/summary: The real stuff
review/text: This is the closest to British tea I have found in the loose leaf form.  Of course, tea bags are a no-no for the traditionalist looking for the best flavor.  This Yorkshire tea is great because it is not in the "big leaf" form, which clogs up the good old English teapot.  The leaf size is just right, and the flavor is "spot on" for a "spot" of really great tea.  If you are looking for English Breakfast tea, this is much closer in flavor than many of the other teas marketed in the USA.

When we ran out we used to be able to buy Taylor's Yorkshire tea at the local grocery store (at about twice the price but still worth it).  On the last English visit we brought back several different brands (Typhoo, Taylors, PG tips ) and taste-tested them.  Taylors was the most appealing to us.  When we ran out again we found that the local store no longer carried it but not only does Amazon carry this brand in boxes of 6, but with an automatic delivery scheduled (every six months for our usage level) the price is sufficiently good that I'll never bother to stuff my suitcase with tea purchases again.  Incidentally, if you are a regular tea drinker you might want to try making it in a standard drip coffee pot.  It lets the tea leaves be in contact with the water about the right length of time and the filter strains them out.  However, DON'T use the same pot for coffee - coffee leaves a residue on the basket and pot that imparts an unwanted flavor to the tea.
