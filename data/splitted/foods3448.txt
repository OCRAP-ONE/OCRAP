review/summary: Very Stevia super sweet
review/text: I ordered the vanilla and the capuccino.  The vanilla has a strong Stevia aftertaste, but is not horrible.  I will eventually finish the box... maybe.  The capuccino is heavy on the stevia and is so horribly sweet, my mouth sticks together.  My 4 year old, who will steal any protein shake, tea or iced coffee I leave unattended for 2 minutes, got a hold of the one I was attempting to drink.  He took one sip, then went and got a paper towel and wiped his tongue.  Then, he grabbed a glass of water and chugged it to get the taste out of his mouth. I have to say, I feel the same way about it.  I am going back to my Orgain protein shakes.  I am pre-diabetic, so I am no stranger to non-sugar sweeteners.  But holy cow, lay off on the sweetness.  No one needs their mouth glued shut while attempting to drink this.  It is vile.  Luckily, Amazon refunded me the cost.  I gave away the rest of the case on Freecycle.  Hopefully, the person who got it knew what they were doing.

review/text: I love this product!  I drink the Cappuccino flavor and it tricks my body into thinking I am drinking a creamy coffee drink (without all the caffeine!) It is so filling I can't finish the whole thing and usually drink half, put it in the fridge, and have the second half for my afternoon snack.  On the weekends, I pour it in the blender with ice and a banana for a really yummy iced drink.  Keeps me full all day.

review/summary: I'll take my cake without MOLD on it
review/text: ..that was a complaint from another customer who posted pics of her moldy cake on a popular social networking site, right after I posted my disappointment with the company. It solified my position to notify potential customers of what they are getting here.<br /><br />**** I'm writing this review as someone who received a FREE cake.<br /><br />I was so excited to receive my Fantasicake, but my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. My fantasicake was more like a sweet lover's nightmare! Icing everywhere! I thought I could salvage it by scraping it off the box but was caked up and dried. It looks like the lid for the icing wasn't completely sealed and all the icing spilled in the box during transit.<br /><br />Fantasicakes DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY ICE PACKS during transit, nor do they put your cake in styrofoam. They pack it in a plastic bag (unsealed, not shrinkwrapped etc) in a cardboard box. During the height of the summer, many areas reach triple degrees, and the UPS warehouses and trucks are even hotter. The fact that they don't put ANY gel icepacks to help keep your cake cool during transit, ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMERTIME, really is shocking to me.<br /><br />My cake was warm when it arrived so i took it out of the shipping box, opened the lid of the cake box just to look at it, and icing was everywhere. I took a couple pics to show the company and immediately popped it in the fridge to cool down. During that time, I emailed Fantasicakes to tell them about the spilled icings and suggested that more care should be taken in packaging the items.<br /><br />The response I got was interesting. They know about the hot weather and clearly they know they don't include icepacks. They also know how rough delivery people are with packages. Offering me an extra cake with next purchase that could possibly be molded by the time it arrives? NO THANKS.<br /><br />Again, It must also be noted that I'm writing this review as someone who received a FREE cake. I have no axe to grind here. I want to give you guys an honest impression of what you will get from this company. While I thought the prices were great for a delivered cake, I can't take chances on sending a gift that is inadequately packaged for a perishable item and may arrive moldy. Prior to receiving the cake, I intended to purchase one for all the older women in the family as "just because" gifts. Not now!

review/summary: I love Passion.....
review/text: This tea takes me back in time.  When I was really young, my mom used to brew up big batches of iced tea.  First, she would get the jugs ready, and then pour hot hibiscus tea into them, and add a lot of ice.  We'd set them out in the sun and the natural light in mid-day would make the tea naturally sweet, as it brewed.  Those were definitely good times.  What better past time in the summer, than to brew a nice pot of iced tea on a sunny afternoon?  Tazo Passion Tea doesn't fail to disappoint.  For starters, one of the main ingredients blended to make it so delightful is hibiscus (along with orange peel, rosehips, cinnamon, lemongrass, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, licorice and red poppy).  If you like your tea on the (slightly) tart side, I reccomend you drink this unsweetened and relish its wonderful, natural flavors.  However, if you prefer some sweetness in you life, add a teaspoon of honey or your favorite sweetener for a different flavor note altogether.  Doctors are now reccomending people drink five cups of tea daily, for improved health.  Make Tazo part of your regimen!  It's a great way to take care of your health, while making an excuse for a much-deserved tea break.

review/summary: Hibiscus Treat, Fine Tea
review/text: ****<br /><br />Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.<br /><br />The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as "berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense". Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, juicy, red fruits".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.<br /><br />****

review/summary: Fruity and Flowery - Delicious Iced Drink - Thirst Quenching
review/text: Tazo Iced Passion tea is an herbal blend not a true "tea", since it has no black tea, no green tea, or any other kind of real tea. It is technically an herbal tea with some additional ingredients added. It has hibiscus flowers, licorice, orange peel, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass plus it as added "natural tropical flavors", citric acid, and fruit juice extract for the very red color.<br /><br />These are "iced tea bags" -- each bag is large and makes 2 quarts worth of iced tea. The directions indicate to boil 1 quart of water and to steep the bag for 5 minutes then to pour into another 1 quart of cold water to make the iced tea. This was easy to do.<br /><br />I like sweet iced (traditional) tea and also I enjoy herbal teas and other plant infusions. I first tried this tea with sugar added as I assumed I would want it, but then tried it unsweetened and found the flavor fruity and almost sweet naturally, so now I drink it without added sugar. I would say it tastes sweet and fruity and almost like a more sophisticated version of a fruit punch drink that kids usually like.<br /><br />Everyone is different and only you can determine if this is right for you...<br /><br />My husband enjoys unsweetened iced tea and hot traditional teas unsweetened and he felt this unsweetened iced passion tea was too "sweet" and "flowery". My sons didn't like it as they are used to plain water (which is 99% of what my husband and I allow them to drink) or having their flavored drinks even more dense such as pure fruit juices or artificially flavored drinks or having sugar-filled sodas. My kids have learned to associate flavored drinks with more of oomph and more sweet than this unsweetened herbal "tea", unfortunately.<br /><br />This also has a fantastic deep red color thanks to the added fruit juice extract.<br /><br />I really enjoy this as an alternative to drinking plain water all day long. It is nice to have a flavorful cold drink that has zero calories, does not have unnatural ingredients, and has no artificial sweeteners (as diet sodas have). It is quite thirst-quenching too.<br /><br />Drinking Tazo Iced Passion Tea also helps mask the flavor of city tap water which is good for when I am stuck with city water as my only water source.

I brew a huge pot in the morning and let it cool on the counter during the day - slowly cooling it with the bags still in the pot seems to add a bit of sweetness and the color is ruby red. And no caffeine means you can drink it day or night. Yummy!

review/summary: slightly tart bold herbal fantastic tasting iced tea
review/text: Normally I hate yucky flowery herbs like hibiscus and rosehips in my tea (such as Celestial Seasonings Tea) but one day while at Starbuck's, I was sweating, heated and tired in hot weather and wanted an iced drink but not coffee and since I'm really a tea drinker, I tried their Tazo iced teas and they tasted SOOOOO good and invigorating with just the purrrrfect balance of just enough herbs but still letting your senses know it was still TEA and the fragrance/taste comes out boldly!! The heated tea is nicely turned immediately, boldly, vividly, red in color. I don't need to add much sweetener even as it's tart but its tartness gives it more taste.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are its high price (compared to other teas which is why I'm always waiting for a sale on them) and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator (or quickly in the freezer).  It's true as another reviewer said that it's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in, the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water.  Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold, but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor, so I try never to add ice.<br /><br />It's a delight as an everyday iced tea as well as a great gift for a friend.

review/summary: The best!!! Allows you to make tea just as good as Starbucks!
review/text: I have been a huge iced tea fan my whole life and a Venti Passion Iced Tea sweetened is my absolute favorite drink at Starbucks. While the iced tea is pretty cheap option at Starbucks, by buying this, I am able to recreate my favorite drink at home.<br /><br />I tie together 4 tea bags, add it to 2 qts of water and refrigerate it a couple of hours Then I add in about a cup of sugar syrup (made by boiling 1 cup sugar/1 cup water and letting it cool). Sometimes I flavor the sugar syrup with a little vanilla extract when I remember, otherwise it's still good.  Voila, passion ice tea! Add a little lemon juice for an extra kick. Alternatively you could add lemonade like they do at Starbucks as well.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/text: I hate sweet teas.  I drink alot of different "frou frou" teas (including several varieties of Celestial Seasonings) but there are only a few that are my top "repeats".  This is one of them.  This is definitely tart enough that if you like sweet tea, you will have to use alot of sweetener.  If you don't like sweet teas & enjoy a tart tea, this one is great.

review/summary: Spice It Up for the Holidays
review/text: Blend a little apple cider mix into your Tazo Passion Tea and see what happens. This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.<br /><br />Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: THE BEST TEA EVER
review/text: Quite a few years ago a good friend of mine and I were visiting Cape May NJ for a few days and one night we went out for dinner and I ate something that made very terribly sick in the night. The next morning I felt a little better however, my stomach was still a little upset. We were strolling around and came upon a Starbucks so decided to stop and have a mid morning coffee. My friend got a coffee and I decided that since I was not feeling all that well that I would instead have tea. I had a cup of Tazo Refresh no kidding about an 1/2 hour after drinking this tea I felt back to my old self. I've tried other peppermint/spearmint teas and must say none of them hold a candle to Refresh. One of the people who posted a review stated they had a hard time finding it and I've had the same problem. I had an upset stomach yesterday and used my last tea bag and have just ordered another box through amazon.<br /><br />For the person who said that the tea was to weak I find same problem with this and indeed most herbal teas. What I do is start out with the hottest tap water I can and then microwave my tea for two to three minutes on high. This process gives me an extra strong cup of tea.

review/summary: Pink Himalayan Salt Brick
review/text: Very interesting concept. Our brick was about 10" x 4" x 3", pretty thick compared to the slabs others have or commented about. Brick was heated for about 45 minutes at 450 degrees..Tried some slices of Filet on a heated brick. Instantly started to sizzle, and withing seconds, flipped over and finished... Salt flaver is more than minimal, it added a lot more salty flaver than we anticipated based on other comments. Brick was very hot initially, but it cooled down so quick, that a second round of Filet slices was cooked a lot slower, even flipped it as we used it. Over-all... flavor of the salt is better, not very much information found to get some lessons on using these, lookes great sitting on a slab of granite in the kitchen, and certainly adds conversation...Will continue to improve its ability as we test and learn..

Looked up the interesting Fireweed plant (named for being one of the first things to regrow after a forest fire). There's something very special about the taste of this honey (from around beautiful Mt. Rainier, in my home state of Washington). A subtle, almost menthol secondary flavor. Lives up to its nickname as the "champagne" of honeys.

review/text: I had just read an article about single source honey and it listed all the different kinds so I set out on a mission to taste them all. The end of this experiment is a long way off but this kind is in my top two! Yes, I did hold the  bottle over my mouth and squeeze it into my throat on several occasions. The difference in all the honeys is amazing. Let me recommend that you do what I did. Bake some homemade bread, purchase different flavors and then invite friends over for a honey tasting.<br /><br />Everyone will have their own opinion about which is best but I like this one because it is light but not so light that you cannot enjoy its unique flavor. Gone are my simpleton ways that made me think clover honey was the best, I have been refined.

review/summary: I Can't Get Enough of the Stuff
review/text: I first tried Zen in an iced green tea I got from Starbucks.  I wasn't that crazy about it at first because it has lemongrass and a few other things in it, and I have always preferred nothing at all in my teas, just plain tea; no sugar, nothing. I had it a few more times for the same reason (was at Starbucks) and before long I was hooked, I had to have one every day.  I found that I actually FEEL BETTER when I drink it! I know green tea is ridiculously good for you, but this is crazy.  I dumped all the bloat I was holding, felt more alert and my appetite was noticably reduced.  While I'm sure not everyone will have the same experience I have, I drink it for the taste and have probably 2 32-ounce glasses of it iced (plain) per day.  I sip it all day at work and it is wonderful.  I brew it fresh each glass: brew it very strong and pour it over ice with a little cold water to dilute it to taste (I like strong tea). I just adore it!

review/summary: Mild, Relaxed Green Tea
review/text: ****<br /><br />Tazo's Zen Green Tea has a subtle, mild, light green tea taste, not bitter at all. I don't taste any of the additional flavors Tazo puts into this tea; maybe my palate isn't developed to this point. However, it still is one of their better teas, and has less of an artificial taste than the others I've tried. Maybe the flavorings are just too mild in this tea, but when it comes to flavorings, I prefer them this way; I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague "natural flavors" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. It is not a strong green tea, so it would definitely appeal to people who enjoy herbal infusions and milder teas.<br /><br />The ingredients in Zen  are: green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint, lemongrass, and natural flavors. Zen contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "an enlightening blend of the finest green teas and rare herbs available in this world." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Zen as "smooth, lemony, earthy, refreshing". Tazo describes the aroma as "lemon, mint".  The web site also says, "Select pan-fired green tea from Zhejiang province in China, artfully combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon essence. Zen's distinct green tea flavor accented with lemon and mint is impossible to express in words. Best simply to experience its sweet, lingering aftertaste." I don't taste the lemon or the mint or the sweetness; still, it is a nice green tea. It is relaxing and enjoyable to drink.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Zen gets only four stars.<br /><br />****

review/summary: Zesty spearmint and lemon are modulated by green tea into a substantial potion!
review/text: Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor. The aroma is sweet spearmint. The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample.

Zen tea is very mild and is absent of the bite and bitterness found in other green teas. Hopefully, it provides the same anti-oxidant advantages as its peers. I usually buy mine at the grocery store and they are not any more expensive than boxes of Twinings. Zen tea was, and is, a pleasant surprise.

review/text: I don't drink much tea, except for sweet tea when I eat out, or my own Mint tea made from my herb garden.  I've been sick with a horrible cold and sore throat and was rummaging through my drawer of tea bags late last night and found a Tazo sampler I'd had for years.  I tried this flavor, Wild Sweet Orange, and fell instantly head-over-heels in love. It totally lives up to the colorful, yummy words on the little packet.<br /><br />This is what's written on the packet:  "Imagine the invigorating bite of a sweet orange in a market in Marrakesh and you get some sense of the taste of Tazo Wild Sweet Orange tea."  I must say it tastes even better than described.  I was really pissed off that I only had one bag, so I looked it up online and ordered four boxes so I won't have to worry about running out again.<br /><br />The ingredients listed are:  lemongrass,  blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root."<br /><br />It's also caffeine-free.  I highly recommend this tea.  I'm even going to try it cold when I get my "stash" in the mail.

The ingredients, for the discriminating tea sipper are: lemongrass, blackberry leaves, rosehips, spearmint, orange essence -- and other herbs, spices and natural flavors.  All of these flavors go so well together.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Orange and Lotus Tea
review/text: This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality.<br /><br />I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer.<br /><br />The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea.<br /><br />Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root.<br /><br />I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful.<br /><br />A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component.<br /><br />For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea. That was the first Tazo tea I tasted and so far I can't think of a Tazo tea I don't love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Basic Orange Herb Tea
review/text: ****<br /><br />Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as "tart, sweet, smooth, licorice". Tazo describes the aroma as "oranges, roses, lime".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.<br /><br />****

review/summary: My favorite tea in its class
review/text: There are three broad categories of herbal tea that I rely on throughout the Fall, Winter, and early Spring:<br /><br />1) Citrus and lemongrass<br />2) Rose hips and hibiscus<br />3) Chamomile<br /><br />For me, Tazo has held first place in each of these categories for the last several years. This is no small feat - I'm cutthroat when it comes to my tea collection! Wild Sweet Orange is by far the best citrus and lemongrass tea I have ever had.<br /><br />For those of you who have never tried it, do not be mislead by the name. It is extremely tart and not at all sweet. I happen to love tart, fruity herbal teas and this recipe is so closely tuned to my tastes I could swear that the good people at Tazo had consulted a sample of my DNA during the design process.<br /><br />I actually never expected to like it, since I don't drink orange-flavored teas as a rule; they're generally too sweet and mellow for my tastes. I ended up with my first cup of Wild Sweet Orange due to a mix-up at the store a few years back and it absolutely blew my mind. The flavor profile is complex and I never get tired of drinking it.<br /><br />If you like tart, fruity, teas then put down that cup of Lemon Zinger and give Wild Sweet Orange a try.

review/summary: My Favorite Herbal Tea - EVER!!!
review/text: I knew when I tore open the package that I was going to like this tea...but little did I know that it was soon to become my all time favorite!  The sweet orange aroma reminds me of my childhood...the tangy orange flavor of an orange popsicle, or an orange flavored baby aspirin (St Joseph's) or piece of orange taffy.  This makes a wonderful substitute for a sweet dessert...a nice after-dinner treat with no guilt.

review/summary: Tangy orange fragrant tasty wonderful iced tea!!
review/text: Normally I hate yucky flowery herbs like hibiscus and rosehips and mint in my tea (such as Celestial Seasonings Tea) but one day while at Starbuck's, I was hot and wanted an iced drink but not coffee and since I'm really a tea drinker, I tried their Tazo iced teas and they tasted SOOOOO good with just the purrrrfect balance of just enough herbs but still letting your senses know it was still TEA and the orange with mint fragrance/taste comes out boldly!! The heated tea is nicely turned immediately, boldly, vividly, orange in color.  I don't need to add much sweetener even as it's tart but its tartness gives it more taste.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are its high price (compared to other teas which is why I'm always waiting for a sale on them) and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator (or quickly in the freezer).  It's true as another reviewer said that it's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in, the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water.  Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold, but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor, so I try never to add ice.<br /><br />It's a delight as an everyday iced tea as well as a great gift for a friend.

I like to brew it and serve it over ice in the summer with lemon for a garnish and maybe a  little honey.  Sometimes I do half tea, half lemonade over ice.  So good.  Orangey without being overpowering and subtly herbal.

review/summary: One of my husband's favorites
review/text: We buy a lot of herbal infusions in our family because I'm a day in, day out coffee drinker and when I'm not drinking coffee I prefer a non-caffeinated drink.<br />My husband loves <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BLQ">Bigelow Constant Comment Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, which I grew up on and he never tried until I suggested it. So when I look for herbal teas for him, I keep that in mind.<br />So an orange/spice tea is a natural choice for him. This is a sweet, very orange-y tea that's nicely spicy. It's fragrant enough to smell even with a head cold and it is a family favorite.<br />Like all Tazo teas, the color is lovely. The scent is orange/cinnamon, the flavor is orange/sweet/spicy. One tea bag works well with up to 14 oz of boiling water.<br />Individually wrapped, I usually keep a bag or two in my purse for when we are some place that offers hot water but no teas that we like.

review/summary: Reminds me of orange-flavored medicine
review/text: I got a packet of this tea in a Tazo sampler pack, and was really excited to try it. I brewed up a mug of it and had a small sip. The sour orange tea immediately reminded me of these orange-flavored vitamins I used to take. I tried a few more sips trying to convince myself it wasn't that bad, but I finally poured it down the sink. I hardly ever do that, especially with a nicer tea like Tazo. I like almost all of their other tea, and I like other orange-flavored teas, and many other people seem to enjoy this tea judging from the reviews, but unfortunately it didn't work for me.

review/summary: A rather unusual tea experience.
review/text: I got two bags of this tea in a Tazo tea sampler box.<br /><br />Brewing it, it smells pretty intense. Drinking it, it tastes pretty intense. A very strong sour citrus flavor, coupled with an inexplicable slightly gelatinous texture. After a few sips I decided that I did not care for it as it was, and added some powdered non-dairy creamer to the mix, to see if that improved anything.<br /><br />The creamer did not dissolve well in the tea, but rather, it coagulated into little clumps, making the already-odd texture of the tea even more odd, and not improving the flavor in any significant way.<br /><br />Perhaps the moral of the story is that I do not like orange-flavored tea, but I found this particular orange tea to be unpleasant beyond my expectations.

review/text: Although it's called 'Wild Sweet Orange' I have yet to taste the sweetness. For the most part, it seems very tart to me. It's still a decent hot tea (and I bet it'd make a good iced tea too) but this really wasn't what I had expected.

review/summary: Not for everyone, especially me.
review/text: The product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet' as well as a bunch of other descriptors, but I didn't get any sweetness at all. I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers, but this time I had my hopes dashed.<br /><br />I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. The teabag smelled different, but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day. Life is too short to drink something you don't like.<br /><br />However, I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus. I figured it was worth a shot, otherwise I'd have to throw out this tea altogether.<br /><br />The Lotus smelled great, so I was excited. I blended the two bags (one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange) in a large mug, then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute. I left the Lotus in for another minute or two (yeah, definitely two).<br /><br />The result was a very unusual, but not unappealing, beverage. Would I drink this more than once a day? No. Was it very interesting and something that I'll try again? Yes.<br /><br />Live and learn, I guess.

review/text: I'm not sure why they would call this Wild Sweet Orange.  It's not sweet at all.  It's very tart.  I'm not a tart tea person.  Even with a packet of sugar it still wasn't sweet.  Also, this tea tastes more like lemon than orange which I should have known based on the first ingredient being Lemon grass.  Really not happy with this at all.  Will likley just have to throw this out.  If you don't mind a tart lemony, citrus essence tea it might be okay for you but not what I was expecting at all based on the description.

review/summary: Finest Earl Grey
review/text: This is far and away the nicest blend of Earl Grey tea that I can find in the American market. I became a bit of a tea snob when I was living in England, but this is a very pleasant blend. A lot of Earl Grey tea blends in the States have way too much bergamot. This one is very pleasant, but you have to brew it the way it recommends on the box, i.e. heat up the water and then let it steep for about 5 minutes. You can't cheat and dip the teabag up and down in the water to speed it up. It won't taste the same.

I am not ususally a fan of pre-packaged snacks like this, but it was fun and reminded me of being a kid.<br />What I found interesting is that I didn't taste much butterscotch and I'm not exactly sure what the flavor was, but I ate them all and enjoyed them.  I do not see this becoming a staple for me, but should I spot them in the grocery store again, I may just try them again.

It is also terrific on broccoli. I recommend this sauce highly!

review/summary: Great Canned Apple Pie Filling
review/text: I had been looking for ClearJel for some time, when I finally found it on Amazon.  I canned 7 quarts of apple pie filling this fall and am in love with this product. The filling stays clear yet thick. One quart will make a 9" pie (but not heaping).  Now I want to find out what else I can do with this product as we have limited freezer space.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00015UC4S">Clear Jel, 1 lb.</a>

review/summary: Clear Jel is for me!
review/text: I tried Clear Jel for the first time a few weeks ago to can peach pie filling.  I turned out great.  I made a pie out of one of the jars and everyone loved it.  Today my friends are coming over to can apple pie filling.  I'm sure it will be just fine. I've been canning for almost 40 years and am pleased so far with Clear Jel.

review/summary: Just what I needed
review/text: Used this for canning pie filling and it worked great. When the recipe called for 1 T corn starch I found 1/2 T clear jel worked better. And the filling looks great in the jar and doesn't separate over time.

review/summary: Great Results
review/text: I bought this clear jel to use in canning apple pie filling.  Apparently it is the best thickener for this purpose as it does not break down in canning/storing, but it is very difficult to find.  I have been very pleased with the results: the texture of the finished product is perfect and held up through canning and storage.  Barry Farms shipped much more quickly than the estimate.

review/summary: not worth the money
review/text: I works fine but unless you are a commercial producer the price is ridiculously high.  It's at least 10 times more expensive than corn starch, which has been successfully used for likelt hundreds of years w/o a problem.  I wouldn't buy it again

review/summary: Clear Jel review
review/text: Clear jell works really well if used "right"  It does not tell you to mix it with dry ingredients or it globs up and make a really bad mess.

review/summary: Couldn't find in stores for Canning Pie Filling
review/text: It was impossible to find this product in Santa Maria, CA stores.  I needed it in a hurry so ordered from this online supplier.  The product was shipped more quickly and arrived before promised...I was a very happy camper.  The product itself was beautiful!  White! packaged nicely!  looked wonderful!  Worked great!  Now I have to buy more in larger quantities...would buy from here if they had the larger size at a comparable price with competitors.<br /><br />Made some terrific canned apple pie filling...lots of excited compliments on how good it is!  Thanks!

review/summary: Clear Gel Review
review/text: I used to run a  retail Bakery many years ago, and I used to buy Clear Gel buy 100 lbs  size to use in making fruit fillings and custards. This product is over priced and isnt as good  quality as  other named  prducts that I used to purchase years  ago. Sorry, will not  buy this  brand product any more, as for what I need it for, I can get buy in using any brand Corn  Starch.
