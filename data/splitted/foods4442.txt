review/summary: Great Beans!
review/text: First, a  small caution - I am not a fan of frequently eating soy products, too much soy has its own risks. That said, I love these beans! I believe eating them on occasion is OK, and sure beats a beanless life, lol.<br />I purchased these locally for making chili in anticipation of the weather getting cool (finally!). I re-started a low carb lifestyle in June and was sad to think I would never have beans in my chili again. These do not disappoint. These are a little firmer than what I am used to with kidney beans, but they were very good and tasted great in the chili. One thing - if you like a lot of beans in your chili, only open one can at a time and see how it goes. I opened two because I usually put two cans of kidney beans in, and one was plenty for a small batch. I saw the post about using them to make refried beans and I will definitely try that.<br />Also, I found a blog with a recipe to make CHOCOLATE CAKE with these beans! I am giving it a try this afternoon. It is at healthy indulgences dot net. That gal has killer healthy low carb recipes and promotes Amazon as well. Search on chocolate cake with a secret. ;-) After all, I have an extra open can now, and have been so good with my 1 net carb chili, I deserve some choccy!<br />My local health food store charges nearly $3 a can for these. I just ordered 12 of them on Amazon for half that with subscribe & save. I am a happy camper!

review/summary: Solid 4.5 stars for these...Tasty & Great Texture!
review/text: Hesitantly, I ordered these in a case (12 cans) on our 1st try. What a pleasant surprise! They are very tasty and the texture is great. My husband, a carnivore, can't tell the difference in his signature buffalo chili. They're now on auto-ship to our home every few months. A great swap-out for eating lower-carb.<br /><br />The texture is - as far as I can tell - identical to traditional black beans. The flavor is a little different (not worse) than traditional canned black beans, but when seasoning is added, I couldn't tell one bit of difference.<br /><br />Note: I didn't even think about this before ordering, but after receipt inspected the nutrition label and found that these black beans actually have more calories per serving than traditional black beans (Trader Joe's). It's not much of a difference (I'm still on the black soy bean bandwagon), but it's something to consider.<br /><br />Here are the side-by-side nutrition facts, soy compared to traditional canned black beans from Trader Joe's (serving size: 130g):<br />Calories:  120 (soy) - 100 (TJ's)<br />Total Fat:  6g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />-Saturated Fat:  1g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />-Trans Fat:  0g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />Cholesterol:  0mg (soy) - 0mg (TJ's)<br />Sodium:  30mg (soy) - 440mg (TJ's)<br />Potassium:  310mg (soy) - not provided (TJ's)<br />Total Carbohydrates:  8g (soy) - 19g (TJ's)<br />-Dietary Fiber:  7g (soy) - 4g (TJ's)<br />-Sugars:  1g (soy) - 0g (TJ's)<br />Protein:  11g (soy) - 7g (TJ's)

review/text: These beans are great for people watching their blood sugar!  The only complaint I have is that the are not seasoned.  I have to cook them on the stove top with water and lots of salt for about 10  minutes to get them to taste like traditional canned black beans.  That being said, I am so happy to have chili again!  I have to control my carb intake, and these beans are a great addition to my food choices.

review/summary: Magic beans!
review/text: I bought these beans as a substitute for regular beans because my family is on a low carb eating plan. We were coming into football season and knew we would miss beans in our chili.  These beans are great!  Not only do they make a great substitue for chili, I have made baked beans and hummus with them and they were wonderful!  Because of their low carb and high protien content you have no "gas" issue and they keep you full and satisfied for a very long time.<br />Low carbing or not I will probably never go back to regular beans.  One tip, cook them longer for a more tender bite.  But in most recipes you would slow cook them anyway.  My sister asked me where she could get some of these magic beans!<br />Could not be happier and this was definitely the best price anywhere on the web through Amazon!

review/text: These have a wonderful texture and, with some bacon drippings, make terrific refried beans with your blender. An excellent choice for anyone trying to cut carbs, these beans are packed with protein and fiber, and they are absolutely delicious in chili, bean salad, and any other recipe calling for black beans. The 12-pack was an excellent value, as well. I did find these beans in my local supermarket, but it was more expensive per can. I will definitely be ordering these again!

review/summary: Low carb, high flavor!
review/text: I like to marinate these in a bit of Italian dressing and put on salads for added protein.  They are good in chili, bean and sausage stew, heuvos rancheros, three bean salad, etc.  It is very important to season them well or they can be bland.  For an easy taco salad I add taco seasoning to these and cook in a saucepan with meat.  It tastes great, is very filling and low carb.<br /><br />If you want to make refried beans out of these, make sure you do it on the stovetop in a deep saucepan.  Make sure the beans are very hot all the way through before you blend with an immersion blender to insure they turn out smooth, if you try to blend cold beans (in any recipe really) they will turn out grainy.  Same trick for smooth hummus.

review/summary: Great and low carb bean alternative
review/text: I've been doing a low carb diet and found out about these low-carb friendly beans. I tried to find them in local grocery stores but failed to do so, so I hesitantly placed an order for a case from Amazon.<br /><br />At first I was afraid they may have a soy taste to them so I started off making a small batch of chili - which came out absolutely amazing. Since then I've become the go-to guy for any event when someone wants chili and I use these black soy beans every time and it has always been a hit. I've also tried these in a shredded chicken recipe and a soup, each time with great results.<br /><br />If you're looking for a low carb bean I'd highly recommend giving these a try.

review/summary: Soybeans are the healthiest beans we can eat.  Why?
review/text: All beans are moderately high in antioxidants (and calories) but soybeans are the healthiest beans we can eat because:  (1)Soybeans contain phytoestrogens called, "soy isoflavones" (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein), which have been shown to substantially reduce the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, numerous cancers, and bone fractures.  (2)Soy protein is the only plant-source protein that comes close to matching the quality of animal-source proteins.  The deficiency-critical amino acids, methionine, lysine, and phenylalanine are much more plentiful in soy protein than in any other plant-source protein including proteins from all other beans.  (3)Soybeans are rich in virtually every mineral listed on the label of a complete multi-vitamin or complete multi-mineral tablet.  (4)Soybean oil contains alpha-linolenic acid, a slightly beneficial short-chain omega-3 fatty acid.  Although canned soybeans are healthier for us to eat than all other canned beans, they are not as healthy to eat as the Japanese fermented soybean food called, "natto," which contains very generous amounts of nattokinase, vitamin K2/MK-7, vitamin K2/MK-8, vitamin PQQ, and vitamin C (manufactured by the friendly bacteria, not the plant) in addition to soy isoflavones.  This Eden Organic Black Soybean product contains 140mg of soy isoflavones per can.  Eating 1 can per day will be more than enough to give us the maximum benefit from soy isoflavones.  Eden adds a small quantity of "kombu," a delicious Japanese seaweed, into each can.  This adds a small amount of sodium.  Total sodium:  105mg per can.  A person on a salt-restricted diet might object to this (and give this product only 3 stars) but I don't mind because kombu is high in fucoidan, a very beneficial polysaccharide.

review/summary: Low-carber's dream food
review/text: I had purchased these locally for about twice the price, so I was really happy to find them here for bulk purchase and also auto-ship. They have 1g carb per serving (about 3g per can), and make a fantastic addition to just about every low-carb meal. I like to put some onions and Walden Farms (0g carb) bbq sauce on them and bake, for a baked bean casserole that you can't get anymore on low carb, otherwise. They're also good plain; or mashed and seasoned to mimic refried beans; or in any stew or pot of chili, absolutely! They don't have a "weird" taste, so don't let the fact that they're soy beans scare you away. They are just the same flavor as regular black beans, and you will be glad you tried them... and will want to order more!

review/text: I love the taste of almonds, and I love almond butter.  I also love Betty Lou's Peanut Butter balls, which have a very natural peanut taste.  So I was excited to try these almond balls and ordered a box.<br /><br />What I don't like is the "almond flavor" that I sometimes taste in baked goods - this flavor doesn't taste like almonds to me, rather something else artificial and overbearing.  Alas, these almond nut balls have that almond flavoring taste.  And, lo and behold, "natural almond flavor" is among the ingredients.<br /><br />Almonds have a more subtle taste than peanuts; maybe Betty Lou's decided that the almond balls would be too bland without some added almond flavoring.  To my palate, though, the flavoring fundamentally changes the taste of the product, and not favorably.

review/summary: Not as good as I expected
review/text: First of all, I love ito en's tea. I bought Oi Ocha and liked it so much that I bought one of every other Ito En's flavor. Unfortunately, this rose green tea is the worst one.I had expected some aromatic fragrance of roses, but there's absolutely none of that. I also think the rose flavor that was added interferes with the normal green tea flavor. This DOES however taste better than unsweetened bottled tea in America, and perhaps better than most common green tea bags you can find. It's not bitter and slightly sweet just like normal Ito En's tea. So, in the end, I will still finish up this 12 pack but I most likely won't buy this flavor again.<br /><br />Note that I've only drank one bottle so far, my opinion of this flavor might change over time - I'll edit this review when I've finished the 12 pack.<br /><br />My favorite flavors so far:<br /><br />Original Oi Ocha<br /><br />Jasmine Green tea<br />- Very nice smell, this is what I'd originally expected from the rose...<br />- Original Ito En and Tea's Tea seems to have a different flavor. The Original has a much better smell and is recommended. The Tea's Tea has a weaker smell but is still very nice.<br /><br />Green tea blueberry<br />- Sweetened. Sugar is bad, but it's a nice change every once in a while.<br />- Ito En one, I haven't tried the Tea's Tea one.

Those who enjoy this taste can drink this Japanese imported tea at home.<br /><br />I drink Sencha Shots, Oi Ocha, Green White, Green Jasmine, and Green Rose.  Straight Ito En Green Tea is usually too harsh for me, but even on occasion, I will buy a 2 liter bottle at Target, which is where I also pick up my Ito En Green Jasmine 2 liter bottles.  Unfortunately, they stopped carrying the two liter bottles of Green White over a year ago, in my area.<br /><br />Each satisfies my body in different ways at different times.  I may buy one case of rose tea for every 4 cases of unflavored green tea.  But, after a few days since drinking my last bottle, I am using my Rewards certificate to treat myself to another case.  Yum.  It truly is delicious, and perhaps any floral tea is an acquired taste.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Rose Tea is horrible (unless you like that flavor)
review/text: I think this tastes so horrible, I am not sure what more I have to say which would be reasonable for a public review. If roses are really your thing and you want a rose drink, try this. Otherwise, stay away!<br /><br />It is worth noting I like most of the rest of this manufacturers' (Ito En) drinks...

review/summary: Nerds, The Candy of My Youth
review/text: Whether or not you like Nerds probably depends on when you were a child. I was not yet in high school in the early 80s and the sweet, tangy taste was a salve that help take my mind off homework, bullies and girls. After bus dropped me off at school, I'd run up the hill to the candy truck and buy a box or two. The grape and strawberry where the originals and my all time favorite. Eaten one at a time or in an overwhelming mouthful, I just loved 'em.<br /><br />Nerds were the "Candy of the Year" in 1985. They're thickly glazed with carnauba wax that gives them their hard crunch, and a flavored gloss. The center of each candy is composed of one or more complete, tangy sucrose crystals. If you were patient enough to let the coating dissolve in your mouth, then you could take it out and see that the crystals were clear. I was rarely so self retrained though, and would usually suck on their fun texture for a little while then just crunch away.<br /><br />The box has two openings at the top, one for each flavor. It was always a mystery which side I'd finish first, since I went back and forth between the two. I tried them again recently, and though my taste buds have evolved over the years, I found I still love them. It doubt they're very healthy, but that's not the point, is it? Candy has no point, it is just to be enjoyed! :)

review/summary: Planter's Peanut Oil dissappearing fromlocal  supermarkets
review/text: Planter's Peanut Oil, indispensible for proper blintz's and for many of my own recipies, has diappeared from local supermarket shelves.  It's been around for almost 100 years, and Planters still makes it in quantity, they say.  And I want to make potato pancakes again, please!<br /><br />There are other brands, both in house at Safeway and the like, and across supermarkets,but their taste is indistinguisable from Crisco oil.  My Aunt Nettie--she is with God, rewarded for her good deeds and her good Kosher cooking, she must be--my Aunt Nettie, who taught me how to make potato pancakes that even  Grossinger's would envy, never used anything else.  What's this world coming to???

review/summary: Good Bagged Pu-erh
review/text: Is this cheap, "Heck, no."<br /><br />Is this good, "Yes!"<br /><br />Pu-erhs (ooo-air)are made into little (or big) cakes of tea, and then allowed to ferment (rot).  Bad Pu-erh tastes like tea left to rot.  This definitely does not.  It has a warm oak flavor.<br /><br />Pu-erhs are "double-fermented".  Tea makers let the tea oxidize like black tea, and then form the leaves into cakes.  Pu-erhs take awhile to ferment; they actually have vintages like wine and can be as old as 40 or 50 years.  Because of the longer processing time, pu-erhs are generally more expensive, so this isn't a bad price for pu-erh, although it is a little pricey for tea.<br /><br />This is good pu-erh for other reasons:  unless you have a tea diffuser, you can't make pu-erh teas--they're not generally sold in bags.  If you're not really into buying a lot of tea accoutrement, e.g., an American, these bags are a real find.<br /><br />Each one will more than handily make 3 or 4 cups of tea when steeped in a several cup teapot--or you can steep repeatedly for a different taste with each cup.

review/text: This tea taste is good.Sometimes I add agave to it however not a neccessity.I drink it cold and hot.I find that I really don't want my coffee if I drink it in the morning.I am not sure if it is doing what Dr.Oz said it was good for which was to eat fat cells, I do know that I feel pretty good after drinking it. Good tea, especially if you are wanting off the fifty cup coffee thing a day. Also the seller sent a box of white tea with it, I guess some type of sell, I did not pay extra for it,but they sure have gain themselves a customer with their white tea also, which i believe is suppose to block fat cell(can't remember for sure).It taste good though.

review/text: i was honestly a little afraid to try this tea because it gets so many mixed reviews in general and especially after reading about pu-erh's fermentation process.  But I am so glad that i didn't let all of that discourage me.  This is a very smooth, rich, full-bodied tea that satisfies someone like me who drinks lots of bold dark coffee.  It definitely has a very earthy taste that is very invigorating any time of the day.  I used to think that black tea was my favorite but that has definitely changed!!  What makes this specific brand better as well is the fact that the seller is extremely fast at shipping the item!!

I can tell you that this tea has made me feel sooooo much better! I mean I used to feel sluggish and constipated (sorry) not any more. It turns out this specific tea was reviewed on Dr. Oz (youtube it) as the best tea to drink first thing in the morning to loose weight. So far this is true. Add a very very small amount of honey and you are all set. Doesnt taste like anything and doesnt make your stomach run. Do it!

review/summary: Not exactly what is used at my theater, but still good.
review/text: Butter flavored popcorn salt is an important part of the popping process!<br /><br />I find the product works best when added to the kernels before popping; rather than trying to add it to popped corn. I use 1/4 tsp. for every 1/4 cup of kernels. With the oil already starting to heat in the kettle (just long enough to liquify it), I spread the kernel/salt mix evenly over the oil.<br /><br />When I ordered this, I thought it was a small bottle. Note that it's actually a liter bottle, which is pretty big when you see it. However, that just makes the value even better.<br /><br />It isn't the same exact flavor that is used at my theater. However, it is very similar and still very good.

review/summary: Healthy way to add butter flavor.

There is no fats or oils.<br /><br />Popcorn is a whole grain with lots of fibre.<br /><br />The problem with popcorn not being a healthfood is fats from butter & cooking oil and the salt.<br /><br />Using this in place of salt makes one of the three problems go away (the butter fat).<br /><br />This product is in granules sized to fit in a shaker just like salt.<br /><br />Of course it doesn't taste as good as real butter, you knew that already.<br /><br />But it is a bottle large enough to refil many shakers, and is in my opinion better than the imitation butter oil products.<br /><br />Better to put the butter flavor in the salt, like this!

review/summary: Just like the movies!
review/text: This is amazing stuff! I had been hunting for a few months for Jolly Time Buttery Seasoning, which I'd read rave reviews for. It's not available locally, Amazon wouldn't ship it to Hawaii, and other retailers wanted to sell me a dozen shakers and charge more for the shipping than the product. Frustrated, I hunted until I found Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt. There were only 3 reviews, but the price tag was only about [...] with free shipping and YES, Amazon would ship it to Hawaii.<br /><br />Wowie-Zowie! The flavor may be artificial, but I swear it tastes JUST like the stuff at the movie theater. Even blisters my lip the same way if I eat enough of it! So glad I took this $10 gamble. LOVE the product. I had an old salt shaker in the cabinet, so dispensing is not a problem. Agree with other comments...odd choice of packaging. Wonder why they decided to put it in a package better suited for a fifth of rum. Never mind the package...the product is terrific.

review/text: I feel like this is really salty. More salt than butter. I guess I might have seen that coming, but I figured it would be closer to 50/50 I guess. I tried adding it to the oil instead of sprinkling it on the popcorn after its popped. I think I prefer it that way. I would recommend adding it to the oil before you put the popcorn in. Just be aware that it is salt and you won't be able to get a movie theater style butter flavor without overpowering salt.

review/text: This is one of the best! Most butter-flavor salt you buy at grocery stores are overwhelmed by the fake flavoring they use. They don't make your popcorn taste salted. Believe me, I've tried them all! I used to buy mine from Mille de Lac, but they quit producing it so I had to search someplace else. After rying all the others, I went to Amazon to see what they had to offer. I was hesitant to spend that much on something I hadn't tried but it was well worth it. There's enough popcorn salt in it to last for years. You'll truly enjoy your popcorn with this salt.

review/summary: Almost  POPS*RITE seasoned salt
review/text: About 10 years ago I bought a case (12) of 5.5 OZ containers of the "Real Thing", POPS*RITE Heart Of The Ear NATURAL BUTTER FLAVOR popcorn seasoning.  I couldn't find it locally and finally ordered it.  Don't remember where.<br /><br /> Recently I finished off the last container.  Bad, very bad.  I hunted on line with no luck.  It's gone.  BUT, I found Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt.  Reasonable price, sounded like it would be similar, so I bought a bottle.<br /><br />  I'll be honest, it isn't quite POPS*RITE.  Something isn't the same.  But it's good.  I like it.  It's a reasonable substitute.  A bottle is over 8 of the 5.5 OZ containers worth, so it will last me a while.  I made a rolled paper funnel and refilled my old pops*rite container thru the small hole on the turning "shake or pour" lid.  When I use it I can almost fool myself into thinking it pops*rite :-)<br /><br />  Give it a try and see what you think.

review/summary: Extremely concentrated, but good.
review/text: This adds salt which is essential for popcorn. It is extremely fine salt (almost powdery), and colors the popcorn a yellow color as well.<br /><br />Beware however. It is extremely concentrated. To the point that you would use no more than a tiny cap full (or less than a cap full) for 1/2 cup of popcorn. I strongly advise putting a very small amount on first (before you pop the popcorn kernals), then add later in your 2nd batch, and slowly add more. I added a little of this and it was too salty.<br /><br />I added less on the 2nd batch, and it was perfect, and yellow color! Use coconut oil with this, and you can't tell the difference from home/movie theater popcorn.<br /><br />I do advise this! Just remember, use very little. Also, this is almost the size of a 2 liter coke bottle! So getting a bottle size this big, plus using very little, means that it should last for years. Literally.

Although Bigelow Organic Green Tea is still a good deal today, 3 years ago, Bigelow Organic Green Tea was priced at only 6.1 cents per tea bag and had substantially more organic green tea in each metallic foil wrapped tea bag.

review/summary: Excellent buy for very tasty, healthy pasta!
review/text: I was very happy with this 10 lb box of spinach fettuccini!  In my opinion, however, it's more like the size of linguini, not fettucini, but it's very tasty. The packaging was just fine.  The interior bag is very thin, but it was tightly boxed, and I'd already anticipated having to put it in something else to store it in my cabinet.<br /><br />It cooks quickly, and has a nice, light taste - can't say I really taste spinach, but glad to know it's in there for the nutritional value.  I cook a big batch and use leftovers for several days.  You can pop leftovers in the microwave for a minute, or run hot water over them if you prefer, and you've got another great meal in a flash. It doesn't seem to get at sticky/pasty as some of the 'regular' pastas you get at in the grocery store.<br /><br />This was a good bargain.  This pasta costs about $3.00 for an 8 oz box from my local grocery 'green' section.  Glad to find it here for half that price.

review/summary: Not a Starbucks Chai alternative....
review/text: This is a cane sugar flavored syrup which has a decent Chai flavor though quite different from the Tazo Starbucks variety.  As a syrup it is inherently sweet and, of course, dilution makes it less sweet but also reduces the nice spiciness of Chai.  I've found that to find the right balance of sweet and spice, I can add some loose Chai, Cardamom, and/or black pepper to bring the balance to what I want.  This is also made from a green tea base (milder) vs. a black tea base which affects the flavor quite a bit.  Still, it is a good overall value and a decent alternative to paying a ton for the Starbucks Tazo version.

review/text: After going to England and then to Scotland as well and trying these snacks, I was hooked, unfortunately they can be difficult to find in the US. Difficult, but not impossible. If the price on these drops a bit more, I will definitely be picking some up, but because the bars are chocolate and can be crushed, or melt in transit, I don't want to risk spending in the range of 50 dollars to get several packs that have been mis-handled and crushed/melted. The flavor alone for me merits 4 1/2 stars but the price drops the rating a bit and keeps me from grabbing these up this very moment.

review/text: I heard about this product through the author of the Body Ecology diet, Donna Gates. I ordered all 3 flavors immediately and quickly discovered my family likes the Berry flavor best. Sweetened with Xylitol, this is a light, sweet candy treat. The color and flavorings are naturally derived, so no need to worry about artificial colors or flavors. This is a great alternative to sugar-sweetened treats.

My husband suggested that I check with Amazon, to see if I could get a better deal on Amazon, than I do at the grocery store.  When we read the description, it appeared to us, as though it meant 96 actual packages (individual things of mints).  What the 96 refers to, is that you get 96 individual mints.  That certainly changes the price a bit!  This price is much more expensive than if I were to buy them in the store.  The pack of 5 in the store, is $2.99, and this comes out to something like $3.78 for 5 packages.  Oh well.

review/summary: such a special gem, this one!
review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

When making bison burgers, the key thing to remember is that they are quite a bit leaner than beef burgers, so you can't cook it as long or it really dries out.<br /><br />That said, the end product tastes fine and is better for you. Bison burger over a bun with some thin onion slices, tomato, mustard, and cheese, and you have a tasty treat!

Their vet has been amazed at how healthy their teeth are. Most small breed dogs need a teeth cleaning by the time they are one years old. I prefer theese over the regular C.E.T. treats, my dog's have an easier eating the veggiedents and they seem to like these better. I have worked as a vet tech for seven years now and have not seen a better treat that keeps your dog's teeth healthy.

review/summary: VeggieDent for Large Dogs
review/text: Looking at some of the reviews, I realize this is a preferred choice for people with three dogs and/or Aussies!  We have two Aussies (one large Mini and one smallish Standard) and a large Flat-Coat/Golden Retriever.  The VeggieDents are more expensive than the CET chews we give them after each meal, so about once a week, we give them each a VeggieDent later in the evening.  They love the green "bones," and make short work of them.  I swear the dogs seem calmer and happier after eating this treat.

review/text: We are proud owners of two Dachshunds. They love these treats! We were first introduced to these CET VeggieDents by our Veterinarian when we got our puppies. He had us come in for an appointment he calls a 'puppy rap' to give you some dos and don'ts, training tips, and goody bags. These treats were in the goody bags, and the dogs have been hooked ever since. Now almost one year old our babies still love to receive these. By giving them plenty of toys and dog chews we have not had any problem with them wood remodeling (our previous Dachshund did this), shoe chewing, or eating things they aren't supposed to. These dog treats are good for our dogs, good for their teeth, and good for our home!

review/summary: GAS!!!
review/text: My dogs love these, but I hate them because they give my 3 dogs terrible gas! They contain sorbitol which is very gas-causing. I haven't found that they do anything for my dogs' breath or teeth.

review/summary: Vet recommended...
review/text: Our vet recommended Veggie Chews for our puppy. He said they are better than high fat chews and have an antibacterial element to them which helps their gums and teeth. We give our puppy 1/2 of one for now..she seems to enjoy them..they came on time and we saved a few dollars rather than have the vet order them...

review/summary: My dog definitely recommends these chews
review/text: My dog has poor teeth despite yearly cleanings and daily brushing, so I am always looking for additional ways to clean her teeth.  I have tried several C.E.T. chew products and have never been disappointed.  She really likes the Veggident chews, although for her size, they are a fairly big and dense treat.
