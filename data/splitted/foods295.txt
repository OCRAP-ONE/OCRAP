review/summary: Cheaper in the stores!
review/text: I just bought a few boxes of Belvita at a local store and I really love the golden oat variety. The taste and texture are so good I'd want to eat them whether they were "healthier" or not (I say "healthier" instead of "healthy" - because although they have no HFCF, contain whole grains and fiber, more "real" ingredients and better handling/baking, they are still a processed food). Anyway, I thought I'd see if amazon had a good deal on them. I'm floored by the price here! Over $25 for 3 boxes??? I think I only paid $2.99/box. Shop around, guys!

review/summary: Taste Great!
review/text: I can't say if it gives sustained energy as I just had my first pack.  I will say they were crisp and tasted great!  I'm always looking for portable energy food that is NOT low calorie.  These are about 230 calories per pack and since I take snacks like this hiking/backpacking, that's a good thing.  So far, I really like them.  Perhaps I'll update after I take them hiking and see how they hold up.

review/summary: Perfect for breakfast on the go
review/text: Yes, I know that "breakfast is the most important meal of the day" yada, yada, but I, like many who start the day before the sun is up, don't really feel like eating first thing in the morning. By the time the early domestic tasks have been completed I am usually in the car rushing for work.<br />I have found these biscuits are a great way of starting the day and can be eaten just about anywhere (ok, not while swimming, obviously). There's a lot of calories and oats in there and to me they do seem to be better than a bagel or toast, keeping me going until lunch time.<br />Get them in your local store, as they are unbelievably expensive on line.

review/text: I love these little breakfast biscuits.  They are tasty, very filling and full of fiber, without tasting like cardboard.  I only eat 2, in a package and save the others for a snack.  If you like oatmeal cookies you will like these.  I don't care for the "blueberry" flavored ones, they are too artifical for me.

review/summary: Defies description
review/text: This is not like any traditional English pudding.  In fact, it is unlike anything I've ever attempted to put in my mouth.  It is pumpkin in color, springy in texture, with globs of stretchy substance which I suppose is the treacle.  I am at a loss to describe the flavor - a sweetness lingers in the background, but what the prevalent taste is I don't know.  It's not buttery, salty, caramelized...it's 'misc.' flavor.  My husband and I each took a bite or two, had a good laugh, and tossed the rest.  We're not fussy food snobs, nor are we unsophisticated eaters.  My husband's best contribution to my attempt at analysis was "if someone told me that was monkey brains, I'd seriously believe them."

review/text: When this canned dessert arrived I could hardly wait to open it and try it out but I waited till my son was over and we enjoyed it together! I tasted it cold (got on my fingers while pushing it from the can) and found it very tasty and reminded me of pumpkin. It is supposed to be heated and was very easily done in my microwave. We both liked it heated but I still like it better cold. If you like something sweet, you have to give this a try!

review/text: I have loved these since I was a kid. They are just awesome!!!! I started to buy these locally at one of the oriental stores (locally meaning a half hour drive - lol). Unfortunately The store I buy such products from had been shut down and there was no other local oriental store from which I could buy my favorite foods. Although shipping is a bit costly, it's not so bad if you buy a ton of packages at once, thus saving you on shipping costs. Being that I spent 2 years in Japan, I am addicted to quite a few of the foods they make there and this seaweed is an addiction for me. I just love it and I could eat 10 packets of these at once. You must try these seaweed packets. Don't be fooled by the other seaweed products. These are specific, slightly salted, excellent munchy snacks, even taste more wonderful than potato chips, pretzels or anything else. They have less calories. You just cannot go wrong with these wonderful seaweed snacks. If you don't buy these you really are missing out on the awesome foods in life.  XD

review/text: I love roasted seaweed, and had purchased the Sea's brand on amazon several times. I wanted to branch out and maybe get a better bang for my buck so I tried these. They didn't compare. The seaweed itself was all stale; it lacked the crunch of other roasted seaweed. I supposed I could have tried adding strips to soup or something, but I really just wanted something I enjoy eating directly. I don't know if I just got a bad bag, but I don't think I'm going to try another one. Too bad, I loved the idea of the small wrapped portions that would fit in the pocket.

review/text: Matsutani Ajitsuke seaweed comes in small packs, which are very handy if you are using these to manage a food or cigarette craving, or to include in kids' lunches if you have open-minded offspring. However, the taste and texture are subpar. These are thicker and tougher than they should be, with a distinct taste of soy sauce. They do not dissolve on the tongue as nicely as competitors' products do. I got through one of the 100 packs in the Amazon shipment but I plan to give the rest away if I can.

review/summary: not Korean seaweed snack... learn the difference!
review/text: I'm an avid fan of both the Korean seaweed snacks as well as the Japanese seaweed snacks. This, being the Japanese seaweed snack, is chewier, less oily and less salty than the Korean counterpart because it's not roasted but simply dried. The people who bought this and gave it negative reviews because they thought it was stale don't know the difference between two. This is a great snack if you really enjoy the taste of seaweed and are looking for something more "plain". It's always a good idea to know what you're buying before you buy it and give it negative reviews!

This arrived fast and I am loving this unique edible. I can eat them plain but I like to make a little sushi rice and roll it into a ball, then add the seaweed paper over it. I also like to cut it in my food processor adding in toasted sesame seeds. It makes a great topping to steamed jasmine rice.

review/summary: Pomegranate in the name is deceiving
review/text: I purchased these treats on Amazon thinking they would be like the chocolate covered pomegranate seeds at Trader Joe's, but unfortunately they are not. While they are quite tasty (yes, I will be finishing the bag!), the expectation was that there was actually going to be pomegranate as the main ingredient. The name is misleading and, like many food companies, this seller is jumping on the bandwagon of adding the smallest amount of the fruit in the mix and using its name in the title. The pomegranate juice concentrate is mixed with several other fruit juices, and there is no indication on the package of how much pomegranate is actually in there. Trader Joe's version is actual pomegranate arils covered in a small amount of chocolate - definitely could qualify as a "healthier" treat option. These, unfortunately, do not. Quite tasty, but don't kid yourself on any health benefits here - too much sugar! FYI: 180 calories and 26 grams of sugar in � cup (about 16-20 nuggets).

The chocolate doesn't taste bitter, but it's not too sweet either, and the pomegranate enhances the flavor with a slightly sour touch.

review/summary: Superb, satisfying, sumptuous
review/text: I love chocolate -- rich, dark, lucious chocolate, and every autumn my love becomes an obsession. For most of the year, I am able to have a bite of good chocolate candy or a rich chocolate pie or ice cream once a month or so, and it is enough. Not as much as I want, but as much as I need, and I'm satisfied. However, as the days cool and get shorter during the autumn, my craving is impossible for me to withstand, and I have always laid in a big supply of Hersheys and mini M&Ms, etc, for Halloween, and then I "graze" on the leftovers for the next six weeks. How long has it been since you have actually TASTED one of these products, rather than just eaten them remembering "you always liked them." When you taste it, you taste a lot of sweet but very little chocolate, and so I'm not satisfied.<br /><br />So, wanting to find a healthier snack in the hope of appeasing these urges, I tried these.<br /><br />Living in Texas, I ordered these during the first solid "cool spell" of fall, which was a mistake. By the time they were shipped and arrived, we had another streak of near-hundred degree days, and so the product arrived and had melted in shipment and re-congealed into a mostly-amorphous mass after arrival. When I opened it, I was irritated at first, but then I realized this was actually a confirmation that I was dealing with a better grade of chocolate, so I carefully extracted the lump and put it on a cutting board, prying the mass apart with a chef's knife.<br /><br />Under a little pressure, the lump broke apart into smaller lumps, but there were a substantial number of the "beads" of chocolate which came apart, reflecting the original consistency of the product, so I tasted them. The flavor, and the combination of pomegrante and the rich Brookside Dark chocolate was amazing. The aroma as you brought it to your mouth, and the release of the vibrant flavors "sang" to whatever area of my brain craves chocolate. 3 small pieces with a small glass of milk, and I was happy.<br /><br />I love chocolate, and I love pomegranate, but who knew what a synergy there is between these flavors! (I love chocolate covered orange peel, and enjoy chocolate dipped raspberries or strawberries, but they are not very significant compared to these small nuggets of chocolate.) As someone married to a creative cook, I can imagine a cheesecake topped with a vanilla and sourcream topping, with these dotting the top rather than the bland white chocolate chips.<br /><br />Back to my story -- just 3 of these with a little milk, and I was both ecstatic and content. I cannot wait to try 2-3 with a fine cup of dark coffee after a meal. I'm not sure how many callories are in one of these, but my guess is the two or three which satisfies is no more than a "mini" chocolate bar, and the flavor lingers in your mouth for minutes.<br /><br />So, to recap, there should be all of the benefits of flavinoids of dark chocolate and pomegranate, and the flavors are rich enough to really register on the palate and brain. In a reasonable and small quantity, they are a "little taste of heaven", that satisfies my brain without blowing my diet!<br /><br />You should order these if you prefer just a little excellent, flavorful chocolate, to a lot of so-so choclolate. Maybe they'll work for you like they are for me. Just make sure the weather is cool before ordering! Since ordering in hot weather was "on me", five stars for this fine product.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

review/text: my 2 bags of dark chocolate covered pomegranate came to me melted into two blocks of chocolate and pomegranate.  of course, this also means that the chocolate was dried out.  i am going to see if my costco still carries these candies and not buy them by mail again, if i can help it.  the box they were shipped in was not even labeled as to special handling of the contents.  very poor shipping, amazon.<br /><br />the product gets 5 stars.  the (super saver) shipping and handling gets no stars. i guess i got what i paid for.<br /><br />ellen

review/summary: Okay, Not Great
review/text: This flavored chocolate confection is merely okay.<br /><br />First off, it isn't really chocolate over pomegranate seeds.  That would have been cool.  Instead it is chocolate that supposedly has the flavoring from a different confection from the same manufacturer, and that confection supposedly tastes something like pomegranate.  That stuff is mixed into dark chocolate to make this stuff.<br /><br />The dark chocolate part of this confection isn't semi-sweet, which is what I'm used to seeing for dark chocolate, instead its regular sweet, making it too sweet.<br /><br />Some of the confection appears to have that beige dimpling that occurs when chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, is exposed to the elements.  I don't know if its water, or air that does that, but this package was like that.<br /><br />Many of the small balls were stuck together into large constellations.<br /><br />All in all this confection isn't disgusting, but it hardly deserves the rank it has.  I'd say all in all its pretty 3-star average.<br /><br />EXCEPT, this treat has a fatal flaw: it doesn't taste like pomegranate.  Not even a little bit.  Nope, no trace of pomegranate flavor is perceptible.  It tastes like not-pomegranate.  And that not-pomegranate taste isn't readily identifiable.  I eat fresh pomegranates regularly, and so have an inkling of their flavor, and that pomegranate-flavor isn't contained within this chocolate confection.

review/text: Delicious product.  However, be aware of where you live and what the season is.  I ordered these in June in North Carolina and they arrived as a bag of liquid chocolate with suspended animation pomegranate seeds.  Put them in the freezer and then had a chocolate and pomegranate brick.  Still was able to enjoy them by breaking off pieces and making cookies (oatmeal raisin cookies that have chocolatey pomegranate instead of raisins).  Very good cookies.

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious!
review/text: I absolutely detest dark chocolate, so when someone gave me these as a gift I was bitterly disappointed. But I couldn't very well throw out this large bag without giving these a try so I ripped it open and took a nibble. My reaction? Holy cow, are these delicious! The dark chocolate covering was nowhere as bitter tasting as I'd feared and it went well with the sweetened internal "juice piece." Now I and the rest of the household are hopeless addicts, because they're just that good.<br /><br />BTW, let's talk about the controversial "juice piece" that other reviewers are mentioning. Just know that when you buy these Brookside candies (blueberry, pomegranate, acai), that the "fruit" in the middle isn't a whole dried fruit; it's some kind of concoction that's a blend of several juice pieces. Some people have described this as being "like jelly" but that's inaccurate. The candy has the exact consistency of chocolate-covered raisins, so in spite of the artificiality of the juice piece, there's nothing particularly funky or fake-ish about the texture that should cause anyone pause. I personally didn't have an issue with the fact that these are "fruit pieces" but some people wanting the "real thing" might want to be aware of what they're getting should they order a bag of these.<br /><br />One last good thing about these Brookside chocolates? They're very filling. Just a small handful and you're stuffed. So there's no danger of gorging on them like you would a less healthy candy. So all in all, a very good product and welcome, much healthier alternative to the usual fare. Just a word of advice: if you're a member of Costco's or BJ's, you're better off buying these over there, because these stores sell them for much cheaper (a little under $10).

The taste is so wonderful that when your bag's over, you don't simply want something sweet, you want THEM. The filling is somewhat tart, it's a blend of pomegranate and other juices. The outside dark chocolate is not too sweet and not too bitter - just right to go with the filling (the filling has almost the same texture as the chocolate, it's not liquid or caramel-ish). Costco sells it for a little over $9 for this 2 lbs bag. The candy is completely natural, no artificial anything, no preservatives. Highly highly highly recommended, but... did I mention it's addictive?

review/text: I should have known better than to order chocolate this time of year.  Most shippers refuse to ship chocolate to Florida in the summer.  As a Prime member I thought it might have been packaged well enough to get here in good shape.  There was nothing in the package to protect it from the heat and what should have been delightful little bites of chocolate covered pomegranate turned out to be a two pound block of chocolate with little bits of 'gummy' candy discs.  They may have been made with some pomegranate juice but not enough to give it that 'kick' that real pomegranate juice has.  Even if I see them on a shelf in a store and I can tell from feeling the package that they have not all melted together, I wouldn't spend this much money for so little pomegranate.

They're a dark chocolate and are a natural source of antioxidants. Did I mention that they're really, really good tasting? Did I mention that they're not particularly expensive? This is one item that fits the bill. The only difficulty is that they're so good you may have to worry about eating too many of them.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I actually had to stop buying these because I couldn't stop myself from eating them. Those 2 lb bags were disappearing a lot faster than I would like what with bikini season around the corner. But OH MAN are they good. Seriously, I don't even like sweets that much, but if I am anything, it's a chocolate snob. The chocolate part is this unbelievable melt-in-your-mouth  concoction. I usually like darker chocolate, but for some reason, the milkiness in this is perfect. The inside part is this deliciously tart candy that is kind of the consistency of a jelly bean (trust me, it works). It's definitely not real fruit (this is the case for the acai version as well). It's some kind of juice concentrate mush. You shouldn't fool yourself into thinking these are "antioxidant healthy." They're really just a treat. A whopping 180 calories for 1/4 cup treat. But they truly are to die for.

review/text: I received a bag of these as a gift and was thrilled to discover that they are identical to Trader Joe's Powerberries. I no longer live near a Trader Joe's and had been missing one of my favorite chocolate treats - so if you're a TJ's ex-pat like me, take heart! The center reminds me of a fruit chew, though a bit less rubbery. The chocolate coating is delicious. They are quite sweet, but also tart. A handful is the perfect cure to a chocolate craving.

These candies are very good dark sweet chocolate with a center of tartness--a jell or gumdrop type center made of the pomegranate juice and other high quality ingredients.  The corn syrup content seems minor (I have an aversion to any noticeable corn syrup taste). These Canadian made candies are a very pleasant surprise.  I will probably be ordering some for gifts next Christmas!

review/summary: one of the best tasting snacks
review/text: This has got to be one of the best tasting snacks I have ever experienced. Two pounds worth of this may seem like a lot, but I can assure you that it will not last as long as you imagine, even if you're the only person eating it. I believe that I am living proof of this.<br />The pomegranate center is tart, sugary and tastes like a fresh bunch of wonderful. The chocolate outside is fairly good quality, which you don't get often with chocolate covered fruit bits. Eating them together blends the tart and slightly sour flavor of the pomegranate center with the darker complexions of chocolate, making for an exciting moment in your mouth. Which of course, you're more than happy to repeat over and over again.<br /><br />If it weren't for the expensive price on this (9/lb, that's almost as expensive as a good steak!) I would be purchasing this constantly. As it is, maybe every other month would be a worthwhile investment.

review/text: I found the product in a big box store, and it looked great.  I love dark chocolate, and fruit.  I was immediately disappointed.  The chocolate was just too sweet for my palate.  The fruit in the center was too similar in texture to the chocolate shell.  I found the chocolate boring.  I am glad many people love it, and can't say for sure why I don't, but it will not be my tipple, either to buy again, or to give away.  There are too many good chocolates out there for me to settle for one that just doesn't quite make it.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R81L92">Brookside Dark Chocolate Covered Pomegranates - 2 Pounds</a>

review/text: I had ordered this item expecting something of quality to arrive, having tried similar wares from Costco. I was severely disappointed. The chocolates arrived in terrible shape, flaky, dry and truly tasting noting like what they should. There was absolutely no difference in taste between the chocolate outer shell and the inner fruit core, it all tasted like sugary cardboard. After digging deeper in the pack and observing it was all the same, there was little choice but to dispose of this excuse for good dark chocolate.I don't normally go through the hassle but I thought I had to reach out and demand for a refund, even attaching a picture of the contents of the packaged chocolates. My two complaints were met with absolutely no reply, no refund, nothing.<br /><br />I have put this one down to a learning experience, do NOT buy food via mail order. Very difficult to return (especially from this vendor).

They are an odd concoction of multiple fruit juices.  I taste more cranberry than pomegranite (if you like cranberry juice you will love these).  I gave it two stars because the antioxidents should count for something.  And a serving size is 20 pieces, so if you like them you can enjoy a nice sized treat.  They are also quite plump.  I just don't love the cranberry flavor.

review/summary: Good taste but not so great packaging......Buy with some reservation
review/text: I have always enjoyed Orville Redenbacher brand popcorns, whether it is SmartPop or Natural or Sweet & Savory type. And with such past experiences, I went ahead and bought this particular popcorn (Pop-Up Bowl Butter Microwave Popcorn), even though this particular product is way more expensive than the bag version.<br /><br />First impression: Packaging looks great and the illustration on the box lures you to try it at once as soon as you look at the box.<br /><br />Cooking: I used my Sharp microwave 1200 W, 1.2 cubic feet of sheer raw cooking power. Even though my microwave has sensor based cooking feature for popcorn and other food items, I set the microwave timer to 2 minutes and 30 seconds, so as to not leave anything to chance. Instructions on the pack are very clear about up & down side markings, cooking time, handling instructions etc. After cooking for 2 & 1/2 minutes, I carefully removed the popcorn bowl (as it miraculously transforms itself into).<br />Now comes the little tricky part. Instruction on the bowl clearly indicates how to handle the bowl and how to remove the top plastic off the bowl, so as to dig in and help yourself with the buttery popcorn. So I tried opening the bowl by pulling the plastic from one side, but to no avail. So I tried the other side with more frustration and no better result. I contemplated using a scissor to cut the plastic open, but then I would have to clean the scissor, since all the residual butter would be transferred to the scissor creating a mess. I was surprised that all this hype and commercial about bowl popcorn really amounts to such bad packaging. Then, I forcefully pried open the plastic and got hot residual vapors on my fingers. Boy, what a scalding experience it was!! But I endured the agony so as to try this new popcorn.<br /><br />Taste: Popcorn kernels were large and uniform, and so were popped popcorn. It smelled very buttery, very aromatic indeed. They were crunchy, buttery and crisp. However, I could not have distinguished this final product from the regular Orville Redenbacher popcorns from regular paper bags.<br /><br />Conclusion: If this product tastes the same as regular same brand paper bag product, why am I spending 3 times more money to buy this item? So that I could just eat from a bowl instead of a paper bag? Now I am not a dodo and neither are regular Amazon customers looking for a better bang for their buck, so then what on the earth would make one shell out more money? I am amazed at the marketing department at work here. Do they really think that giving people bowl instead of a paper bag would somehow cast a Harry Potter like spell on us and force us to buy this product on a regular basis? Well guess again marketing guys, as far as I am concerned, No Popcorn Bowl for me. If you like the idea of eating your popcorn from a paper bowl, and if you are willing to put up with the inconvenience and mess and higher price, then this is the product for you.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Clear instructions<br />2) Tempting packaging<br />3) Giant uniform popcorn<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) EXPENSIVE<br />2) No easy way to tear apart the plastic top off the final popcorn bowl<br />3) Did I mention EXPENSIVE

review/summary: Great Idea - Terrible Execution
review/text: The idea of a popcorn bag that turns into a bowl is simply brilliant! I was sick of having to either get my hands covered with grease or clean the large bowl I'd dump my popcorn into. So I got these as soon as I saw them in the grocery store. Here are the problems;<br />What's worse than a hot, oily paper bag? Very hot, oily PLASTIC. The plastic absorbs heat more than paper, and it's the part you're expected to pull off to get to the popcorn! Ouch! Burnt my fingers more than once, and when I didn't, had to wait and let it get cold-ish.<br />The bowl is made of the same paper as the bag, and more flimsy, so you don't avoid getting grease everywhere. Unlike the bag, the bowl does not contain the popcorn. The popcorn reaches the very top of the bowl and falls out.<br /> I'm going back to bags.

review/summary: Sprayed orange grease all over the inside of the microwave
review/text: The pop-up bowl sounds like a great idea, but evidently they rushed it to market before all the bugs were out.<br /><br />The first bag I cooked was fine, except the instructions for opening the bag are far from clear, and even after you figure out how to do it it's a lot of trouble and makes a big mess.<br /><br />But the second bag evidently sprang a leak - it sprayed bright orange grease all over the inside of my microwave, even into the tiny vent holes inside the top and side. I always watch popcorn carefully while it pops, but I could not see the grease spray until after it was done and I opened the door. Cleaning it all out was a horrible ordeal, and I'm sure everything I cook in the microwave will come out smelling like popcorn grease for weeks.<br /><br />They released this product too soon. It needs serious redesign. I will not buy it again.

(I have followed instructions and tried a few different time settings) I also think it leaves a  bit more of a greasy filmy residue on my tongue than other  microwave popcorns.

review/summary: Not good....
review/text: This "bowl" type is not very good. It leaves at least two dozed or more unpopped kernels. The bagged popcorn is far better. I usually get ten or less unpopped kernels in those.

review/summary: Microwave Popcorn Bowls
review/text: Sorry, the flimsy bowls are terrible you cannot pick them up and are not easy to handle. My favorite was Orville Tender White in the bag, they should offer both, but it appears Orville has switched to bowls only which you cannot pass to another person. I regret that I have switched to Jolly Time White and Buttery, Crispy White and any other brand still offered in bags! :(

review/summary: Waste of Money
review/text: I have always thought that Orville Redenbacher's is the best microwave popcorn. Until this product came along. It is a failure in several ways. If you pop for even as short as 2 1/2 minutes, you will get about 50% good kernals, and the rest will be burnt. And I mean individual burnt kernals and a few solid masses of burnt kernals fused together! I have popped three bags so far and the result has been the same for all three. And I stood next to the microwave listening, as the product advises. At 2 1/2 minutes, there was still plenty of popping going on, but I stopped anyway.<br /><br />Then comes the challenge of opening the bag. The instructions are somewhat clear, but I was scratching my head on the first one or two that I popped. When you attempt to pull off the plastic bowl cover, you must pull very hard, and when you do that, the paper attached to the plastic tears and popcorn spills out. I tried pulling one side, but it didn't open cleanly, so I tried the other side, with the same result. I was determined not to use scissors because I didn't want greasy scissors that I would have to clean. I ended up on all three bags eating the popcorn with the plastic cover still partially attached. It was clear that any more attempts to remove the cover would have meant popcorn on the counter and floor.<br /><br />Finally, the picture on the box showing a nice buttery yellow bag of popcorn overflowing the top of the bowl is blatant false advertising. On all three bags I popped - at the proper time and temperature - the result was some yellow kernals, some grayish kernals (on their way to being burnt), and black, burnt kernals. And each time, the amount of popcorn was at least two inches below the top of the bowl. And many kernals were not popped.<br /><br />If an industrial design student presented this pop-up bowl for a class assignment, I think they would get an A minus for idea, and a D minus for execution. Didn't anyone at ConAgra foods bother to TEST this product before putting it on the market???

review/summary: Messy, difficult to use new bag. Less popcorn.
review/text: Pros:<br /><br />The popcorn tastes the same as it always has. Good.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The plastic pop-up bowl packaging doesn't work very well. It's difficult to open. If you're not careful you'll end up spilling the popcorn all over the place while trying to open the bag. You might also burn yourself.<br /><br />I know some people like to eat out of the bag, and if you do you will find this experience quite messy. The plastic portion of the bag does not soak up the oil like a traditional paper bag, so it gets all over your hands.<br /><br />After popping 4 bags in 2 different microwaves, I have come to the conclusion that these new bags simply do not pop as well as the old ones. I have more unpopped kernels, and visibly less popcorn when I pour it out into a separate bowl to eat (which I prefer). And 1 of the 4 bags leaked some oil into the microwave.<br /><br />The new bags are smaller than the old ones; 2.69 ounces compared to 2.9 (which used to be 3.3 ounces not too long ago.) Is this new packaging really just a scheme to hide a price increase?<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />2 stars.<br /><br />Start with 4 stars for the taste; about as good as microwave popcorn gets, but not as good as homemade. Subtract 1 star for the smaller package, and another for the messy new bag.
