review/summary: Horrible bitter taste
review/text: This was one of the worst cups of coffee I have had in my life. Very weird, bitter taste to it; everyone who has tried it has had the same opinion. I usually enjoy bold and full-bodied coffee, but I had to throw out the entire box. I don't know if it has something besides coffee in it (isn't there a tradition of putting chicory or something in the coffee in New Orleans?), but YUCK!

review/summary: Too strong for me!
review/text: Interestingly, I do not disagree with the positive reviews -- this is a super strong coffee! Army coffee, as one reviewer said! Or, a slap in the face, as another one said! This is just too strong for me. I thought I liked strong coffee until I tasted this one. It made me realize I'm really a medium type of girl. I drink my coffee black and I had to water this one down to be able to drink it at all. I would have given only one star, b/c I don't like it personally, but gave it three b/c I recognize that what I hate about it is exactly what some will love about it! So, army coffee lovers, slap-in-the-face coffee lovers, this is for you! Medium guys and gals, not so much.

review/summary: It's Decaf
review/text: Very disappointed!  Nowhere in the online write-up, or on the outside of the box, does it state that this is decaf coffee.  I've had the regular and it is great.  However, I was deceived into thinking that this was the same product.  The words "decaf" are only printed on the actual K-cup.

review/summary: Emeril Doesn't Know Beans
review/text: If coffee is not a dark roast I pass it by.  There was a sale on Emeril's plus I had a 30% off coupon [should have known better].  While I was not expecting a French or an Italian level of dark roast, I was anticipating a decent cup of coffee.  "Big Easy" is a misnomer for "Big Zero."  When I add a tablespoon of half&half and the color of the coffee goes to tan, that's telling about the darkness therein.  That's what happened here.  Then I went on to the taste:  this stuff is weak with a bitter undertone; and then, oddly, it tastes, as the first sip goes down, as though water was added.  I use the 5 ounce side of my Keurig.  Can only imagine that the large cup would be right up there with dishwater.  I will slug down the remaining 17 kcups, but will never purchase again.

review/summary: Favorite for hearty-coffee lover
review/text: Best K-cup coffee I've found so far. (Also applies to Emeril's Decaf - best decaf I've tried) All OTHER brands and blends have been way too weak, or weak with an over-roasted taste. I use the 3.7 oz setting on my Keuring machine - anything more than that dilutes the finished product resulting in a watered down cuppa. (I'm not 100% satisfied with the Keurig system in general, but it IS convenient.) Thank you, Amazon for carrying both Emeril's coffees and delivering them to my door. Easy!

review/summary: I have 6 favorites, this is one of them
review/text: This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.<br /><br />Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.<br />I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.<br /><br />That being said...my favorite coffees are:<br /><br />Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee<br />Newman's Own Extra Bold<br />Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold<br />Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br /><br />and a special mention for<br />Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.<br /><br />Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.<br />Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.<br /><br />We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.<br /><br />2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.<br /><br />3. The Senseo "duck" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.<br /><br />4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors "open" at once. Yes for those of you that are "green" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee.

review/summary: Very bitter, burnt
review/text: I was hopeful that this would be a good cup.  What I received was a very bitter cup with a very bad aftertaste.  I had to throw it out after a few sips.  This reminds me of the burnt beans that Starbucks roasts.  I am a an of strong coffee but not when the flavor is reached by burning the beans so badly that all you taste is the bitterness.  No thanks Emeril.

review/summary: Emeril's price increase excessive
review/text: I, too, think the 25% price increase for Big Easy Bold is out of line.  But I disagree that the increase in the commodity price of coffee can justify it.  The overall amount of coffee in k-cups is not large enough to have driven such a big increase.  My other favorite k-cups are going up "only" 16%.  I don't get it, and I'm not buying it... even though I enjoy the product.  I, too, cancelled my order.  So 1 star for the sticker shock!

review/summary: What happened to Emeril's?
review/text: I have to agree with Dr. Pete's review below.  Up until this batch, Emeril's Big Easy was by far my favorite coffee.  To give you an idea of what my taste runs to, I also drink Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast along with an occasional Van Houtte's Honduran.  However, Emeril's was my standard cup.  But this latest bunch is nearly tasteless and watery!  It used to have a great aroma, full body, and was easily drinkable.  The only reason I didn't score it lower was because it is still not bitter or has a bad after taste.<br /><br />I am not sure what to do now.  I just put this on auto renew when I got this batch. I'm kinda' scared to keep on getting it, if it is going to stay this way. I might just cancel it and drink more Black Tiger (the most similar IMHO).  Too bad; I have frequently seen coffee quality from the same brand change in my life- and not only in the k-cups.<br /><br />Update: I tried using this on my 7.5oz instead of 9.5oz setting, and it is somewhat better.  However, it is still not nearly as flavorful as it usually was on 9.5oz.  I am really puzzled why more people have not experienced this; maybe my taste buds are growing Old? ;o)  However, my other coffees still taste the same.

review/summary: a little sharp...
review/text: This was my first time trying this brew of Kcup. It is ok, but the flavor is a bit acidic. I like a bold brew, even though I do add cream and Equal. When using this Kcup, I found I used at least one extra sweetener packet and twice the half & half. Friends of mine have enjoyed this flavor, however.<br /><br />I'd like to find a brand of kcup that is similar to Newman's Own, extra bold.  I have found this brand on Amazon, but it is through outside sellers, so not eligible for subscribe & save. The price through these vendors is also nearly twice the price of most of the kcups offered on amazon. So, for now, I will keep trying different varieties of kcups and trudge to Walmart to buy boxes of Newman's Own Bold 18 kcups for $10. If I see them on Amazon, I'll probably order several boxes.

review/summary: Bold Isn't Always Better
review/text: Emeril's "Big Easy Bold - Big Easy Intense" Gourmet Coffee is anything BUT easy.  This thick, pitch black coffee mounts an EXTEMELY rich attack on one's palette quickly followed by a bitter, gagging, complex finish of earthy flavors.  This stuff tastes like that tar-sludge coffee in Monsters, Inc. looks!  Beyond the shock and awe of the cutting, intense attack on one's senses, the coffee blends an unpleasant mix of flavors that may induce nausea.  Unless you can drop shots of 100-proof vodka as if they were Jello shots, this is NOT your coffee.

However, now that Amazon has substantially raised, by 25-30% the prices across the board and subscribe and save has been removed I have found, at least temporarily, a cheaper place to buy. If you have a Bed Bath and Beyond near and get the 20% off coupons you can buy three 18 box cartons and save about $5. Cost me with tax about $25 and I got 6 extra cups vs the 48 box offered here. Just a suggestion. There may be other places as well.<br /><br />I do enjoy buying from Amazon and hope, maybe after the holidays? that the prices will become competitive again.

review/summary: Only Strong Cup Out There
review/text: I tried about 20 different cups before settling on this surprise contender. I hated to buy a celebrity-endorsed product but this was the only one that didn't taste watered down. I was testing the other cups at 7.5 oz of H2O but with Emeril's I can run it at 9.5 oz and be happy. True, it has more body than flavor, but unlike Emeril himself (or me a 45 year old tech ops loser), this coffee has a REALLY nice body. If you're looking for thick and rich, this is it. I've tried other Timothy's coffees (Emeril doesn't roast/grind "his" own, of course), and have found them sub par. I may rethink the Timothy's line now. There is a French Roast offering from Emeril/Timothy's now. I just ordered a box. Hope it's as good as the Big Easy.

review/text: We've tried many K-cup flavors in our house and this one quickly became the one you had to drink when we were out of everything else.  Finished the last one this morning and can safely say we'll stick with other tried and true flavors (like Tully's Kona Blend, Caribou or Gloria Jean's Cappucino).  Definite bitter taste and aftertaste, takes a ton of flavored creamer to make it palatable.  My wife went as far as to describe the flavor as what burnt tires would taste like.  Wish I'd read the other review about one k-cup being good for 2 cups of coffee--might have meant less creamer!

review/text: Not one person in my household who has tried this, has enjoyed it.  I bought some of this for my dad and i thought he would love this because he likes a really bold cup of coffee but he hated it.  I have to had it to him though... he tried to like it for my sake.  He tried it several times before he was honest and said he truly hated it.  My mother, who likes her coffee on the weak side tried to water it down but she said she almost spit it back out into the sink when she took the first sip (wish i had been there to see it).<br /><br />I tried it knowing it wasn't really my type because my dad honestly didn't like it and that made me curious.  Also i tend to believe with the appropriate amount of milk and sugar any coffee can be decent right?  Well i didn't finish the cup even after the extensive doctoring i did.  It was burnt tasting and very bitter.  I'm very surprised there are so many good reviews for this one.  The only use i could think of for it is if you are on a long drive down the highway at night... it would be good to keep you awake.  Not only will the caffeine help but the terrible taste in your mouth.

review/text: I BOUGHT THIS COFFEE DUE TO THE RAVE REVIEWS, BASED ON "EXTRA BOLD" CRITERIA. SINCE I HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH ALL MY OTHER TIMOTHY BRAND COFFEES, I WILL ASSUME THIS WAS A VERY BAD BATCH. VERY BITTER WITH A STRONG BURNT AFTER TASTE. THREW AWAY BOTH BOXES, AFTER TRYING SEVERAL OUT OF EACH BOX. WILL NOT BUY THIS ONE AGAIN BUT WILL CONTINUE BUYING OTHER TIMOTHY WORLD COFFEES.

review/summary: Bold? Not!
review/text: I bought Emeril's K-cups based on the reviews here. I love strong, bold coffee but Emeril's goes way over the top. There is a difference between bold and bitter and this coffee is just plain bitter and it is one of the worst coffees I have ever had. I got a Keurig B60 after my coffee maker broke and saw a Keurig in one of the lounges at work. I was taken in by its convenience and bought one and am the sorriest person I ever did. I have sampled all the Keurig K-cups and cannot find one to my liking. They are either too weak and watery no matter what size cup you make or just plain bitter which leaves an aftertaste. In addition,if you like stronger coffee, you need to make the smallest size cup, 5.5 oz. which in this day and age is ridiculous; people drink out of large mugs and you can drink that 5.5 oz in 3 or 4 gulps! I am getting rid of the darn thing and going back to brewing my own. There is a reason that the majority of the nation's premium coffee roasters have NOT jumped on the Keurig bandwagon. It does not make an excellent cup of joe.

Later, when I'm ready to go to work, I make another cup to take with me because I prefer its taste to any  coffee I could buy on the way. Big Easy Bold has spoiled me.

review/text: This Extra Bold, Dark Roast K-Cup is great for those who like the convenience of using a K-Cup, but prefer a richer, more bold flavor to coffee. If you're like me, and tend to find most K-Cup coffee weak and reminiscent of vending machine coffee, you might like this. Its flavor and strength do not seem to require using only the smallest cup size, but seem good to the medium mug size. It is similar to Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond, Tully's French Roast, and Black Tiger (among a few others).

review/text: After FINALLY purchasing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA">the best coffee maker</a> I've ever had in 40 years of drinking coffee, the hunt was on to find the best tasting coffee to go with it. When it comes to coffee, I suppose that it's really a "to each his or her own" thing. But I've tried 'em all, and out of all the various varieties that are offered here at Amazon, the K-cup that provides the most pleasurable mix of everything that I was looking for in a cup of coffee is undisputedly Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />Nothing beats Emeril's Big Easy Bold. There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the "Midnight Magic" brand; I've tried the "Jet Fuel" brand; I've tried the "Donut Shop" brand; I've tried all of the "Extra Bolds"; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here. If you like a darker roast that's full of flavor and packs a punch, you've found the right page here at Amazon. Wake up people, and add this to your cart. Bam!

review/text: It's strong, bold and intense. I usually don't like strong coffees, but this is really good, especially from a TV chef. I really didn't expect it. Personally, I like it more than Tully's KONA, which is also a good bold coffe.

review/summary: Differentiate Between Bold and Bitter
review/text: Some reviews here call this coffee "Bitter" - well all I have to say to them is: "Clean your pot" - if you can't handle a strong cup of coffee, go buy a latte and let people who like REAL coffee define - coffee - not a non-carbonated soft drink that you want so badly.<br /><br />Of all the K-Cups, this is by far the best coffee around. It is bold, strong, and keeps you wanting more. This is why its the best selling K-Cup around. I suggest that you shop wisely online for these, and buy in quantity, this is what I do - I get usually 12 24-Pack boxes. Me and my wife drink this daily - it truly is a great tasting coffee - without any of that ridiculous flavoring that some on here want - if you drink this you better wear pants - otherwise stay in your skirt and drink some Sanka!

review/text: Emeril's Big Easy Bold is one of my favorite K-Cups, and it's the type we are always running out of. We got a subscription for it, saves us a lot of time and money.<br /><br />I honestly expected some sort of catch or something. Amazon's subscription service is amazing. If you drink Coffee, you really should get a subscription.<br /><br />On to the coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee, this one I quite like. It's got character without being bitter, a bit of kick without being obnoxious. I would definitely pit it against a good coffee shop, and at the subscription price, it's a steal.

I have a coffee maker in my office and when my co-workers have a cup they always compare it to the ones you get at those coffee chain shops around town. Now for those of you who don't like your coffee strong I won't recommend this one.

review/text: I keep trying k-cups that describe themselves as BOLD and being disappointed. This one truly lives up to that adjective. Many "bold" coffees are bitter, this one is not. It is too strong for some family members who add water to their cup, but my immediate family members always choose this one first.<br />Still my favorite and I love the blue k-cup, so I never grab the wrong one accidentally!

review/summary: the real bold coffee
review/text: I've chosen many bolds from the Amazon offers here as well as other on line shops. I always felt there left something more to be desired in each one I tried. This is the problem with the K-cup b/c the amount of coffee is limited, and when I am feeling like I want something stronger, which is often, I can't just put more in the hopper like I used to with the old machine. I often add another K cup after the first into teh same big cup. Also, often when I'd get to work I'd make another.<br /><br />I've had Emeril's Big Easy for a month now, and rarely have I felt like I needed to double the cups, or needed more when I get to work.<br /><br />I think that says it all.

review/text: I like strong coffee. If you can see light through the coffee, it's too weak for me. After trying a couple dozen various K-cups from other suppliers, Emeril's Big Bold Easy stands out from the crowd. It is everything advertised: Big (strong), Bold (great flavor), and Easy (not bitter at all). Another reviewer mentioned Newman's Own Extra Bold, which is also good, but for me, Emeril's wins without contest.
