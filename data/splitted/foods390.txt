review/summary: A mixed results product, depending on your baby
review/text: I have tried using this product with my new son and it has brought mixed results.  I recommend that when using this product with your baby that you exclusively use it during a feeding without mixing in breast milk or another formula.  On more than one occasion my son has spit this right up or just plain thrown it all up.  I'm not sure if this is because it is a water mixed formula, being a powdered formula, or because of the mixing.  Some of the time he seems to keep it down and be alright, but I have discontinued use of this product in favor of another Enfamil product - the milk-based ready-to-go 6-pack bottles with nipples.  Those ready-to-go bottles are much better than this powder formula you mix with water, although more expensive.  I would really really recommend sticking to breast feeding ladies because my son craves his mom's milk and goes right to sleep, happy as can be.  However, I understand that breast feeding may not always be possible so that is why I would like to direct you to find a milk-based formula instead of this water/powder mix.  I think your baby will much happier!

review/summary: baby likes it
review/text: We got samples of this at the hospital & the few times we used it our baby seemed to like it. When we decided to give our baby a formula bottle at night so I could pump & build up supply, we switched to the gentlease formula b/c he had gas & was fussy so we thought it would help. The morning after we gave him the gentlease he was worse. We kept him on it for a few days but saw no improvement. So we switched back to this formula. He has no spit up, isn't gassy or fussy after having it.

review/text: I've never used artificially flavored extracts before, so maybe this is common with all of them, but I thought it had an alcohol taste. I used to use real Black Walnut Extract years ago from a grocery store, and loved to add it to ice cream. I didn't care for this in my ice cream. A lot of people like it, so I guess it's a good "imitation", but just not for me.

review/text: I think to be honest, most of the protein bars do not taste good at all. If they are, then they have quite many bad stuff in their ingredients. This bar taste fairly better than lot many but I would still never buy it again. All that being said I'm going to finish my current order that I received. I eat it when I'm too late for my evening snack and I've nothing else to grab.

review/summary: Taste: meh.  Value: high.
review/text: These taste bland.  Not awful, just a bit flavorless and mushy.  And you know what?  I'm glad.  Because if they tasted better (e.g., like candy bars), I'd be tempted to snarf them during moments of low will-power.  Instead, I reserve them for post-workouts when my protein powder isn't handy, or for early morning meetings when I haven't had a chance to grab a proper breakfast.  And for that, they do just fine.<br /><br />I like that they're not grossly sweet or painfully chewy (ow, my teeth!) like so many other protein bars.<br /><br />Worth having as a backup for sure.

review/summary: good flavor, more moist than many similar bars; expensive
review/text: This review pertains specifically to the Chunky Peanut Butter flavor of thinkThin bars.  I haven't tried any of the other flavors.<br /><br />It's always interesting when a product receives such disparate reviews.  Some people here think these bars taste great, and others found them so horrible that they threw them away.  Count me among those those think these taste good.  I didn't notice any chemical flavor, just a nice chocolate and peanut butter mixture.  Probably most impressive about this bar versus other brands with a similar flavor and nutritional makeup (Clif Builder's, Pure Protein) is that the thinkThin bar is more moist and soft.  I actually like the creamier mouth feel of the thinkThin bar, though it does mean it's easier to eat and feels less substantial than the drier brands.  The Pure Protein bar is more similar nutritionally since it also uses sugar alcohols; the Clif Builder's Bar has more actual sugar in it.<br /><br />I did a quick cost comparison with the two other brands cited, based on Amazon's current subscription price.  The thinkThin brand costs more per ounce than the others (approximately 7 cents per ounce more than the Pure Protein and 15 cents more per ounce than Clif), but the cost per gram of protein delivered is more similar, with Pure Protein being the least expensive at about 5 cents per ounce of protein, Clif's being about 6 cents per ounce of protein, and thinkThin being just shy of 7 cents per ounce of protein.

review/text: Hey, we all got to cheat on our diets sometimes.  Sometimes, I find them a bit too filling, so I will only eat half of one. However, those with a large appetite will surely love how filling they can be. It is almost hard to believe how good these taste. I was cynical when I read the ingredient list compared to the other reviews. 20g of protein, sugar free yet tasty? All I can say is that all the positive reviews are correct. They are really yummy yet have a great nutritional value. I keep a bunch in my office at work, and will use them to snack on mid-afternoon to keep my energy and focus up. Admittedly, sometimes, I will eat two.

review/summary: Healthy Fuel When You're on the Go
review/text: I am addicted to the Think Thin bars. I have Celiac's Disease (gluten intolerance) so quick, on the go food is not always easy to find for me. The Think Thin bars help alleviate that problem by offering practically a whole meal in a bar. I ALWAYS have them on me when I travel, or when I'm having a busy day running to and from meetings, and often eat them for breakfast on a regular day, too. I was at first concerned by the long list of hard-to-pronounce ingredients, but my Naturopathic doctor friend told me that most of those were just scientific names for B vitamins. I love the crunchy peanut butter the best, but a friend of mine said that I need to try the white chocolate ones as well. Love these bars!

review/text: I liked these bars although at first I wasn't crazy about them. As far as energy bars go or something like them I think Luna bars have the best flavor. These are not as good as those are, but they are still pretty tasty. I like the crunchies in the crunchy peanut butter. I also think they taste better when you keep them in the fridge. I like to have mine with a glass of milk and they do a good job at keeping me full. I like how they are packed with nutrition and its great how much protein they have. This bar would be perfect for me if it had some fiber though. I also ordered the cookies and cream think thin bites and I really like those for snacks throughout the day. I like those out of the fridge better too.

review/summary: Great taste and protein!
review/text: To me, this tastes like a candy bar though not overly sweet like a real candy bar.  Not quite as smooth as the Creamy Peanut Butter version, but close and it has some chunks in it to give it a bit more character.  I like both types.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for something a little less candy bar and go for something else like a Purefit Protein bar which is also a favorite of mine, but totally different taste and texture.  This bar has Whey Protein Isolate which is the best kind, while not the first protein listed, it's the 2nd and at least it has it - many protein bars don't.  While the bar states it was created for women, (which I'm not) it's also great for men who want to lose or maintain their weight and balance their snacks with a healthy portion of proteins.  This also has a good amount of vitamins to boot though I really don't need the extra iron. So if you're a male, you probably want to limit this to once per day.  Though I probably only have it about 2 to 3 times per week as I like to mix up my snacks.<br /><br />I also wanted to mention that I didn't have the problems some of the other people mentioned in the reviews where the the bars were stale or the chocolate coating had a white film or something on it.  The bars were perfect and fresh.  I did notice that the box that it was shipped in was a normal celephane protected box of bars but then they put that in another thicker sealed plastic bag of some sort... maybe that was done to help prevent those issues?  Or maybe it's because I live farther North (WA) and we don't have those issues up here with the chocolate melting in transit and then hardening again.

review/text: Great source of protein. Absolutely delicious flavor and especially, texture.  Love that, unlike other protein bars is is not hard as a rock or taffy-like.<br /><br />Great for anyone who is concerned about blood sugar levels avoiding spikes and sudden drops.  And no sacrificing flavor and real pleasure in eating.<br /><br />These are great.

review/summary: Simply delicious and very satisfying!
review/text: I needed to cut back on my sugar intake and increase my protein consumption.  I came across the thinkThin bars at the store one night and bought one chunky peanut butter and one brownie crunch.  How delicious they tasted really surprised me!  They are tasty and filling.  Eating a thinkThin bar at breakfast with a glass of fat free milk is a fantastic and healthy way to start the day.  It keeps me full for hours.  You can't go wrong with thinkThin protein bars.

review/summary: a good protein bar
review/text: I'm a pretty big fan of Think Thin's protein bars.  The Chunky Peanut Butter is my second favorite of this line.  I'm a huge fan of peanut butter and chocolate and this bar melds them pretty well for a protein bar.  As perception of a flavor is definitely personal (look at all the high ratings but sufficient number of low ratings for this bar), purchase several single Think Thin bars at your local grocery store to determine a favorite before committing to an entire box on Amazon.<br /><br />Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter has an exterior chocolate coating and a tan/brown center. The exterior does have a slightly sweet flavor.  The peanut butter center is relatively smooth.  Despite the word "chunky" there are not many chunks to be found.  For those that enjoy sweets, this may be your ticket to fulfilling your sweet tooth and obtaining a decent amount of protein. Note: The exterior coating is sensitive to heat so if you will be in warm temperatures, expect meting to occur.<br /><br />I found this bar to be moist and flavorful compared to the typical protein bar.  I'm not saying that you cannot taste the protein. I don't know if that is something you can escape without massive amounts of sweetener. It is a very edible option. The ease of consumption is also appreciated. With some protein bars, you have to worry about chipping a tooth but this bar was easy to consume.<br /><br />These bars can really help you ride out a period of hunger. I sometimes use them as breakfast bars and can go three to four hours before I feel like a snack or other breakfast item is needed.<br /><br />Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter protein bar has an admirable amount of protein and is sugar free. Those with sensitivity to sugar alcohols (they can cause stomach cramping and other unsavory side effects) and soy should probably pick another protein bar because these bars contains both.  This is another reason to buy several bars at a local grocer before committing to a box from Amazon.  If you do develop intense stomach issues, you know this brand as a whole isn't for you.<br /><br />Think Thin's Chunky Peanut Butter Bars are made in the United States.

review/text: These bars are almost $3 each at your local stores, I love that I can get them on Amazon for a little more than $1 each. Thank you Amazon! For those of you who have never tried think thin bars, these are the best. To be able to find a bar that has 20 grams of protein and no sugar and still taste amazing is quite the feat! The brownie flavor is great too. I have shared these with friends and family and they are always amazed by the taste and quality ingredients. 5 star rating, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Not a great taste but good for you
review/text: I ordered these on a Subscribe and Save special because I liked the high protein content and most of the reviews had a positive message about the taste.  I am generally a fan of Peanut Butter flavored things but not these.  They remind me of old school powerbar taste and texture.  The taste is not very peanut butter.  The texture is pretty dry and grainy too.  You will definitely want to drink a full glass of liquid with these.  They are also very dense and heavy.<br /><br />Part of the reason why I might not be happy with mine is it looks like the bars got hot at some time.  The chocolate on the outside is melted to the package pretty badly.  I ordered mine and they sat on my doorstep for a few hours in 95+ heat. I dont really blame this on Amazon its just what happens when ordering online.

review/summary: Hooked on thinkThin bars
review/text: After sampling the chunky peanut bars at the VIP tent of the Big Sur Marathon ,I searched the web to find them. Amazon had the best price, so I ordered several boxes, taking advantage of free shipping offer. They are a delicious meal replacement, or an after-exercise treat,composed of 20% protein while remaining fat and sugar free. They are soft and moist, unlike other peanut butter chocloate bars.

review/summary: Taste terrible and didn't help me lose weight.
review/text: I bought these in bulk so had no choice but to try them for quite a while before giving up.  I just noted that I agreed with review of Ms. Hampton.  They are loaded processed peanut and cocoa butter fats, which can't be good. I did not lose any weight but gained.  It wasn't until I switched to a rice protein drink that I lost and I know it was the bars because I didn't make any other changes but to substitute the bars for the rice drinks.<br /><br />I also tried all the flavors but none tastes good.  I will not be making any more orders of these bars.

review/summary: I like them
review/text: I like them even though they are not too sweet.  I think that is what I like about them.  I like the fact that they are sugar free.  They do have a peanut taste to them.  A fresh roasted peanut taste.  Not all the time, just sometimes you will get some nice chunks of peanut in a bite and it will be really nice and nutty.  If they could capture that taste for the entire bar, they would be awesome.  I am not looking for a candy bar, just a protein bar to help when I can't get a clean meal after workouts etc.  It does make me feel full and satisfied until my next meal.  Also, even though it doesn't taste real sweet, it does satisfy any sweet craving I might have.  So I would definitely purchase these again.  They don't taste great but are hardly the disgusting bar some say it is.  But tastes do differ.  So in order to know if you like them, you have to try them, unless of course you know for sure that you need a really sweet bar for satisfaction.  Good luck.

review/summary: Should be Think FAT.  Awful tasting and high in fat.
review/text: My husband kept buying boxes of these to take to work (thinking it was a good thing) so I also tried them.  Every flavor tastes awful with the peanut butter being the least awful.<br /><br />The worst part, though, is we both GAINED weight and his cholesterol went through the roof.  That is when I checked the ingredients to note that, though sugar free, they are very high in fat - 8 grams of fat per bar!  And this is a bad fat because after my husband stopped eating these, his bad cholesterol went back down.<br /><br />Bottom line is there is NO substitute for eating a sensible, healthy diet of REAL FOOD and getting exercise.  No such thing as a meal in a pre packaged bar that is healthy and certainly not these.  If I am going to eat something unhealthy (as these are) it better taste really good to be worth the sacrifice.

I also bring a bunch with me when I am travelling so I don't have to eat junk food on airplanes etc. These are so filling and so large compared to other bars. I love that they are also gluten-free. They do taste like a candy bar - that's the best part! I don't feel like I am dieting. This is my favorite flavor, although I also eat the Brownie Crunch to mix it up. You will not be disappointed! I've gotten many friends and coworkers to eat these too. Everyone loves them!

review/summary: Love thinkThin Bars but these were so stale!
review/text: I love thinkThin bars (especially the chunky peanut butter) and buy them all the time at Trader Joe's.  When Amazon had a "Deal of the Day" for them at a discounted price, I immediately ordered two boxes (and signed up for a subscription because their price seemed a little better than Trader Joe's.)  Unfortunately, the two boxes of Thinkthin bars I received were so stale they were inedible - the bar was covered with a white powder and fell apart into dusty crumbs when I broke off a piece to check the inside condition.  Like an idiot, I actually decided to taste the bar just to make sure the appearance was not deceiving - I really do love these bars and my mouth was watering for one!  YUCK - the taste was horrible and I couldn't seem to wash it away!  Amazon doesn't allow food returns, so I've contacted customer service and asked for my money back.  I want a full refund - and I've cancelled my subscription.  So, buyer beware - thinkThin bars are great, but you apparently have to be careful where you buy them.  And sometimes a seemingly great "deal of the day" is not that great.

review/summary: Great flavor with lots of protein, but there is one problem...
review/text: We love these bars because they are low sugar and high protein for a reasonable amount of calories. However, some of the bars seem to be old or dried out, and one bar was very strange looking with spots all over it. I couldn't find an easy way to get a partial refund or replacement of only one out of ten bars, so that one bar was simply a waste of money. The product itself is excellent, but we're unsure whether we ultimately save money by buying it from Amazon when we may randomly have to throw away bad bars.<br /><br />Bottom line: awesome product, but there are some issues with quality control.

review/summary: Horrible Taste!
review/text: Sorry, folks, but it looks like I'm the only Amazon purchaser of this product who thinks it is absolutely terrible.  The peanut butter flavor is barely discernible, and after every bite, there is an absolutely horrible chemical after taste.  I can't put my finger on it, but it is truly nasty.  (I also bought a box of the Cookies 'n Creme, and they actually tasted even worse!)<br />Please understand, I have no hidden agenda, but honestly if you're looking for a great tasting energy bar I highly recommend the Kashi Go Lean Peanut Butter bars.  Admittedly, they are much chewier, but at least they taste like peanut butter and they don't leave that disgusting after taste.  Sorry, just my opinion.

review/summary: Contains maltitol
review/text: Initially I liked this product very much. I like the taste and texture, and the three shipments I've received have all been fresh. I have not had any problems with "stale" or "chalky" shipments as described by some other reviewers.<br /><br />However, I became suspicious of whether it is really "low glycemic" as claimed, because it tastes sweeter than one would expect for a sugar-free low-carb product. Looking more closely at the ingredients, I noticed that it contains maltitol, which is a "sugar alcohol." The maltitol in the product contributes 11 grams of carbs to each bar (for a total of 24 grams of carbs).<br /><br />I've read that if you're on a low-carb diet, maltitol should probably be avoided, because it is a carb, and it does have an effect on blood sugar.<br /><br />Also, maltitol can cause intestinal discomfort and/or diarrhea, if you're sensitive to it, or eat too much of it.<br /><br />I have switched to Greens+ High Protein bars (peanut butter flavor), which are fairly low glycemic for this type of product but do not have artificials sweeteners or maltitol. (And no, I do not work for Greens+).<br /><br />Disclaimer: I'm not a nutritionist. You can google maltitol if you want to find out more.

review/text: This is one product where I'm glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews.  I consider protein bars a treat in my current sugar/gluten-free diet, and this one fits the bill.  Delicious and satisfying, the consistency and flavor are great (very natural taste, in my opinion).  Just sweet enough, and 8 grams of fat clearly comes from the amount of peanuts used - shouldn't be a worry in moderation.

review/summary: Tasty, like a diet Reese's Peanut Butter Cup! But hypoglycemics are absorbing some sugar.
review/text: UPDATE APRIL 2012: Awhile back, some Amazon customers were having a problem with the product they received.  I believe that Amazon packaging sorted out the issue. Now when I receive these from Amazon, they are always fresh and in sealed packaging. Each box is individually sealed tightly in plastic wrap.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />These bars are very good, kind of like a diet Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. They taste so good that they have taken their place as my new favorite protein bar by thinkThin. They taste like chocolate and peanut butter.<br /><br />However, I should clarify that the chocolate is sort of a diet tasting chocolate. The ingredients are natural, but it is diet. It is good for a diet protein bar. It may taste a little bit dry compared to some protein bars that are loaded with sugar. There are some brands of protein bars out there that, if you read the labels, contain a lot more sugar. If you want a bar like that, then this may not be the bar for you. It tastes pretty good for the type of bar that it is: very low sugar and low fat.<br /><br />They are less sweet than other brands of protein bars, because the bars by thinkThin contain lower amounts of sugar.  However, they are healthier, so for me, it is a good trade-off. Also, if you are used to other brands of protein bars, they may not taste as rich. If one looks at the ingredient label of the other brand versus this brand, one may see a lot more sugar in the other brand.<br /><br />Note for hypogylcemics: For hypoglycemics like me, at first glance this bar appears to have 0 gms of sugar, which would help to stabilize the blood sugar. Combine that with 20 grams of protein and it sounds like a great combination for hypoglycemics. If you are not a hypoglycemic, but just looking to lower your sugar, this would seem to be a healthy bar -- and compared to many high-sugar protein bars on the market, it is.<br /><br />However - taking a look at the nutritional information, it also states there are 11 gm of "sugar alcohol" in the bar, which from reading the label I see come from Maltitol. Maltitol has a relatively high glycemic index, which is not good news for hypoglycemics. Seventy-five percent of Maltitol calories and sugar are absorbed by the body. This does impact blood glucose levels. Estimates state that Maltitol is 75% to 90% as sweet as sugar, depending on the source. It can also cause intestinal discomfort. So if you are a hypoglycemic, don't be fooled into thinking you are eating a truly 0 gm sugar bar. You are absorbing some sugar. Just plan your menu accordingly.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts per bar:<br />240 calories<br />Fat calories: 80<br />Total fat: 8 gm<br />Saturated fat: 3 gm<br />Cholesterol: 5 gm<br />Sodium: 240 mg<br />Total Carb.: 24 gm<br />Dietary Fiber: 1 gm<br />Sugars: 0 gm<br />Sugar Alcohol: 11 gm<br />Other Carb.: 10 gm<br />Protein: 20 gm<br /><br />If you are used to other brands of bars with a lot of sugar in them, ThinkThin may take some getting used to, but if you are looking for a lower-sugar alternative, give these a try.<br /><br />~~<br /><br />>> "I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

review/text: Horrible!  When my friend gave me these Chunky Peanut Butter bars to try that she purchased at Whole Foods in California, I thought they tasted like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups - delicious.  The two boxes I received from Amazon.com were horrible.  Each bar was encrusted in white - looked like mold.  It didn't taste like mold but it was tasteless and gross looking.  Some other reviewers complained about the same thing but I hoped the bars would be more like my initial experience - high protein and delicious.  It is going to be a long time before I enjoy a chocolate covered anything - maybe that is the best thing to come out of having to throw out almost $30 worth of bars.

They are no candy bar by any means, but they still taste great in my opinion.  They aren't too big (which is great if you are going to run and don't want to have a full stomach) and they pack 20g of protein...<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you want a candy bar, go buy a candy bar.  If you want a great tasting protein bar (by protein bar standards) then this is a solid choice.

A strong Chemical after taste.<br />zero grams sugar, but still products tastes sweet -- loaded with chemicals and artifical sweetners<br />one bite and it fills your stomach.  A bloaty feeling just after a couple of bites.<br />a definete NO-NO for any one 12 and younger.  But also not recommended averse to eating food with unnaturnal ingrediants.<br /><br />Since Amazon does not accept return of grocery items - I had to trash the product.

review/summary: Looks and Taste Good at First Bite, but Beware of Hidden Danger
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CRHQN0">thinkThin Protein Bar, Chunky Peanut Butter, Gluten Free, 10 - 2.1-Ounce Bars</a><br /><br />This product is what it claims to be. However it contains a sugar alcohol by the name of maltitol. Maltitol claims to have a negligible effect on your blood sugar if any at all.<br />This is not the case for certain people. In my case I received my delivery at my office and was so excited and hungry at the same time to try the bar that I neglected to even read the ingredients list thoroughly. If I had I would have seen it contained maltitol. I ate a bar and not more than five minutes later I was almost passed out at my desk. What happened you ask? A sudden and severe sugar crash caused my maltitol. For all you low-carbers and/or diabetics please be aware of this substance in this bar. Like I said not everyone has this same reaction, but the people  that do have an adverse reaction to it suffer a not so pleasant experience.<br />In hindsight it was my fault for not checking the ingredients before I clicked the purchase button. I can't return them to Amazon because they're a grocery item, so they'll be left in the lunch room for my employees to eat at their leisure.<br />And yes, I've given them the warning as well with a huge sign reading "EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK"

review/summary: Good for Muscle Recovery, NOT Sugar free.
review/text: Some of the reviewers eat these for weight control purpose, which I don't think that's what these bars are for. 20g protein bars like these are designed for muscle recovery after weight lifting workout. ThinkThin protein bars use whey protein isloate; which is the best protein for muscle recovery. I've been eating Cliff Protein bar for body building, although it's 95% organic but it has too much sugar. ThinkThin protein bars provide same amount of protein as the Cliff Bar with less sugar.<br /><br />These bars use sugar alcohol, instead of conventional sugar. Sugar alcohol is a sweetener commonly found in "Sugar Free" gums. It has less calories and doesn't cause tooth decay as conventional sugar does. Nonetheless, it's a sugar. I hope ThinkThin would start making these with organic ingredients.<br /><br />For those who are interesting in snack bars (instead of protein bars) for weight control, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P504ZG">Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> are awesome.

review/summary: Nothing special, gets the job done
review/text: I was doing the 5-6 meal a day thing and trying to get some lean protein in between lectures until I could get some lunch. I work out and eat pretty healthy but was trying to lean up some more but as a college student don't always have the time and resources to cook a bunch of chicken breasts. Overall, these are pretty bad. They have low sugar, and are just about the cheapest protein bars you can get, but I'm 175lbs and these just don't really satisfy any hunger, and in fact only whet my appetite and make me hungry for some real food. I think the cheap price is just not worth the bad taste, and hunger they don't fill.  If you're looking for quick convenient good tasting protein that gives you a little sometime to go on, I would go for some protein powder like Syntha 6 or something, or at least get a little more expensive, slightly more sugary but more filling and better tasting bar like Builder Bars. These can be a last resort if you're just looking to stash them around here and there in case you find yourself without something to eat but you can definitely do better. If you're going to go against my advice, I would recommend getting the peanut butter instead of the chocolate, because cheap, fake, crappy peanut butter still tastes better than cheap fake crappy chocolate, and I've had both, the chocolate is much worse. Also, pair it up with an apple or banana or something to help fill you up a little more and have at least something with some nutritional value in there.

review/summary: Five Star Rating for Low Carb Diet
review/text: Being on a low carb/low glycemic diet, I shop around for low carb bars as meal replacement or snack option.  I saw these bars at Kaiser Permanente (my HMO) and purchased them.  1) they are cheaper than other low-carb/no-carb bars out there, 2) they are actually quite tasty for being low-carb.  I think a lot of people who are not used to low-carb protein bars do not have the experience with these types of bars, so they make comparison to regular bars out there that have upwards of 25 grams of sugar per serving.  Of course sugar makes everything taste good, but that's definitely not my goal nor the goal of other low-carb eaters out there.  We're looking for bars that don't have the same amount of sugar as a candy-bar (like Snickers), which a lot of other nutrition bars out there have.  I give a five star rating, because compared to other low-carb bars, this is top notch.

review/summary: Gluten Free Breakfast
review/text: I've been eating gluten free for almost four years after my diagnosis with Celiac disease.  At least half that time I've eaten one of these bars for breakfast every morning.  I love them, and I find they provide a nice balance of taste and nutrition to satisfy me through lunch.  I use subscribe and save and have two boxes delivered every month; sometimes I add a third if I'm traveling.  They make great emergency lunches or snacks for traveling abroad, as well.  Last time I left the States for three weeks, I took three boxes... I didn't eat them all myself, but it was reassuring to know that I would always have an emergency meal if I couldn't find something GF.

review/summary: Dry but not revolting
review/text: I typically buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008US57">Balance Bar Complete Nutrition Energy Bar, Peanut Butter  - 15 Count</a> but I wanted to try something else and Amazon had a sale going on for the thinkThin Protein Bar so I got the chunky peanut butter version. I was very disappointed, the bars did not have any type of creamy texture that you get from peanut butter. I had issues actually swallowing a bite from the bar. I needed to drink a glass of water while I ate to even finish it. The taste of the bar was okay at best, I mean it faded after a few moments probably due to the massive amount of water it took to finish it. The bar did have little chunks of peanuts so that was pleasing but other then that it just wasn't very good.  I wanted to like this but I don't so I can't recommend this item to anyone who is just looking for a quick bite in bar form that isn't a candy variety.

My best guess is improper storange with Amazon or during shipping extreme heat)  I did contact Amazon and they did refund my money on these (well let's see the next statement).

review/text: I wasn't really dissapointed with the taste of this bar. It was tasty enough considering it is a low sugar bar. It does taste like peanut butter, but has a somewhat strong after taste that I don't get from Clif builder bars.<br />I was shocked that this bar only contains 1 gram of fiber. They can do better than that! Most bars, even protein bars have way more fiber than that.<br />I am not sure if I will purchase these again. I also wanted to mention that I was shocked when I found that Whole Foods (usually expensive) sells these by the box for about $2.00 less per box, and that is their regular price, not a sale price.

review/summary: Best tasting protein bar I've had so far
review/text: I've tried several brands of protein bars and this one is great.  I especially like the fact that it contains more protein than the Luna/Cliff bars, uses protein Isolate instead of Concentrate, and has no added sugar (who needs more calories?!).  I prefer bars that have only Whey protein Isolate or Soy Isolate since I'm lactose intolerant (whey concentrate doesn't agree with most people who are lactose intolerant).  I really like the taste and texture of the bar and it doesn't have a foul smell like some others I have tried.  I would like to see them make a mostly organic version like Cliff/Luna has done and possibly lower the fat content a little.  This bar really helps stave off hunger for several hours thanks to the high protein content.

review/text: I agree with a lot of the other reviewers -- the bars were not as "fresh" as when purchased in a store, specifically, Trader Joe's.  The chocolate had a "chalky" coating.  I feel like they may have been stored improperly.  The chocolate on the bars purchased at Trader Joe's was creamy and just looked "fresher."  I'd rather pay more for the ones at Trader Joe's as they appear to be fresher.  Having said that, however, the bars themselves are actually very good and I will purchase them again, just not through Amazon.

review/summary: WOW! no sugar added + high protein + yummy = PERFECT BAR!
review/text: I had gastric bypass recently and have been searching for 8 months for a low/no sugar added protein bar that wasn't loaded in fat - it is nearly impossible, which shocked me as they are supposed to be healthy snack items (or so I thought).  I wasted ungodly amounts of money on dozens of brands and flavors.  FINALLY I found ThinkThin bars!  Added bonus = they are really delicious - one of best tasting protein bars I have tried, especially the chunky peanut butter flavor.  The chocolate ones are good too if you are a chocoholic (which I am not so they are too sweet for me). They also have mini bars, of which I have only tried the cookie dough - it too is very sweet and perfect size for a snack. I recommend ThinkThin products with every thread of my being and with all my taste buds this is an A++ bar!

I'd eat a snickers bar, peanut butter cup and a twix but that's pretty much it.  Chocolate cake yuck. Ice cream.  Yuck.  So it was real tough for me to find a tasty protein bar cause they love covering them in chocolate (though I have found some other flavors such as this) but they aren't in large quantity.  SO I read the description and it said chunky peanut butter.  The coating is coca which doesn't takes like the dark chocolate coating i've found everywhere else.  These bars are tasty.  OMG.  Almost like a recies peanut butter cup but a little thicker.  I could eat these all day long and are perfect!

The Peanut Butter taste is good and rich, no complaints from me on that.  Also love the fact that they are Gluten free as I think I do have a tolerance to Gluten products  haven't had the time to get tested yet<br /><br />I will order these again, they are very yummy for being on the go and helping me stay on a good eating path

review/summary: Very good!
review/text: I have had many protein bars before and after working out.  I have also recently taken a traveling job and you never know if there will be a descent place to eat.  With these bars you won't go hungry.  Reasonably priced and very good taste, compared to everything else I have had.  High on protein and about as low as you will get in calories and sugar.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These bars pack 20 grams of protien and are actually tasty.  Beware: Not all the bars have so much protien.  Check the labels.  I eat this for lunch with a greek yogurt and some fruit and it's very filling and keeps me going til dinner.

review/summary: thinkThin� Protein Bars are too Delicious to be so Healthy!
review/text: You have got to try thinkThin� Chunky Peanut Butter Protein Bars.  I think these bars are a great substitute for Reese's peanut butter and chocolate bars, but, without the guilt!!  When I want to snack between meals during a busy week or after a workout, eating these protein bars is a nutritious way to tide me over until my meal.  When I'm not so hungry, I can actually think of cooking a healthy meal instead of buying fast food because I'm starving.  Buying thinkThin� Chunky Peanut Butter Protein Bars in bulk is a great value, so make sure to stock up.

review/summary: good alternative
review/text: These bars are a great alternative to typical protein bars. They are not full of sugar and carbs like most other types. They taste good and are filling. One bar was not enough for a full meal for me, but with a piece of fruit or a small salad or something, it's great.

review/summary: Got Progressively Worse...
review/text: I love Think Thin Bars.  Love them.  I eat one every morning. This crunchy peanut butter is my favorite.  "Subscribe and save" seems like a bargain, but by the time I was six months into the program, the bars I was receiving were bloomed, chalky, and gave every appearance of having been stored in a hot place, which certainly compromised the quality and eating experience (and maybe even the nutritional value, like the vitamins).  I cancelled my subscription, and am back to buying them at a higher price at my local grocery store.

review/summary: Solid protein bar
review/text: thinkThin protein bars are extremely tasty and filling! Over the years I have tried several brands and flavors of protein bars but thinkThin's exceed taste expectations and are sustaining for several hours. It's also great that they come in several flavors (my favorites: chunky and creamy peanut butter) and are gluten-free. Be aware, these do contain a small amount of dairy. Overall, great solid protein bar with enough grams of protein per serving for complete female (or male) nutrition!

review/summary: Freshness questionable
review/text: Bars appear to have been either mishandled in storage/transport, or they are just old.  Bars on surface should be uniform chocolate color but instead are dry and ashy.  This is a disappointment, considering I ordered a whole case.  Taste is also dry.

review/summary: Kind of can't live without them
review/text: They taste good, they are healthy and low in carbs.  Great snack and sometimes in a crunch, a meal replacement.<br /><br />That said, my last shipment from Amazon was not so good.  The chocolate had bloomed and the taste was not quite so good.  This means that the warehouse where they're kept probably fluctuated in temperature a lot.  This isn't a reflection on ThinkThin.  I have bought these bars for years but I didn't know where else to post this comment.<br /><br />Otherwise, I am really into these and even take them with me on vacation.
