review/summary: The best option out there
review/text: I didn't use organic for my older kids, as it wasn't really available then.  With # 3, it was a must.  After researching formulas, we started with Similac organic since it is easiest to find in stores.  We were supplementing with formula, so I wasn't overly concerned about the sugar.  After a few weeks, we noticed that our baby was regularly constipated, and it took about a week (and reading reviews on amazon) to put it together. I moved over to Earth's best and within days, she was back to normal.  I couldn't believe it!<br /><br />That said, I do have a one small problem with this formula.  Because of the source of the DHA, the formula has a faint fishy smell.  We had one horrible can recently that smelled disgusting.  I figured that I got a bad batch and called the company.  The formula rep called me back and explained that the formula was fine, but the smell can sometimes be unpleasant.  My baby wouldn't drink it!  They were very nice to deal with and refunded my money.  I also looked online and read that Earth's best was pulled from the shelves in 2007 for the same problem.  From what I learned, cans that sit on shelves too long can get that smell.  I had to go to 4 stores to find another can, since the local Target only had cans from the lot with the funny smell.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy with Earth's best and will continue to use it.

review/summary: My Daughter loves this formula!
review/text: We tired so many formulas before Earth's Best--all the Enfamils, all the Gerber Easy Starts, and finally our pediatrician told us to try Earth's Best--my daughter loved it from the start.  First, I tasted the other formulas, and they definitely were not as 'tasty' as this.  Second, it's organic, what beats that?! Third, our doctor swore by it.  The only complaint is it made my daughter constipated.  Despite this, our doctor still encouraged us to stick with the Earth's Best, and once a day we feed her a bottle of 3oz water, 1 oz prune and that does the trick.  No fussing, no cramps and no gas.  The best part is my daughter is not only off the charts developmentally but also has gone through the cold season with only 2 days worth of the sniffles.  :-)

review/summary: The best formula on the market
review/text: I started to use Similac when my Baby was first born. I couldn't stand the smell of it and my daughter was getting lots of gas and spit up. I decided to change to Earth's Best and it was the best choice ever! This formula doesn't not smell, looks more like breast milk and my Baby doesn't have any tummy problems or painful gas. It's truly a wonderful product. It is a little expensive, but it's definitely worth the higher price.

review/summary: Best for "spitty" and "gassy" babies!
review/text: This formula is the the best formula!  I switched to Earth's Best when the formula I was using had been recalled.  Another reason is that my baby was spitting up a lot with the former formula and was extremely gassy but the pediatrician and I thought she was just a "spitty" and "gassy" baby.  Her tummy could not tolerate other formulas either so I was very hesitant about trying Earth's Best at first but I didn't have many other options.  It supposedly has real lactose and is less sweet than some of the other formulas and it has generally good reviews on web sites I researched.  Since we switched to this formula a few months ago, my baby doesn't spit up anymore and she is less gassy.  The formula must be a lot easier to digest for sensitive babies.  As the company's name indicates, it really is the best!!!  I order this formula repeatedly from Amazon b/c you can't beat their price anywhere!

review/text: I love using organic milk, but this made our baby girl very gassy, fussy and she spit it up.<br />Since switching her to Enfamil Gentlease she has been fine. I wish they'd make a gentler organic milk formula too.<br />At 8 weeks we have gone back and tried this formula again b/c we had 2 big cans of this left in the cupboard. She has no problems now with this formula at all. So we will now use this from now on since organic milk is important to us.

review/summary: This is the only formula we use!!!
review/text: When we started shopping for formulas for our DD to supplement, we reviewed and researched all possible options out there. After a considerable review and research we decided that this is the best one we could find in the market for now.<br /><br />There are several reasons why we picked this over the others..<br /><br />- This is organic (so a lot friendly to the baby as well as the environment).<br />- Pesticide / Chemicals / Hormone Free<br />- This was very very close to breast milk and our DD did have any problems switching back and forth between breast milk and the formula.<br />- The bowl movements were regulated and resembled very close how it would look if she were only breast fed.<br />- Less Gas / Less Iritations<br />- AMAZON's amazing price offer (on Subscription).

review/text: We love this Formula for a few reasons.  One it is pestiside free another it is usda cert organic not all the organic formula's are.  The best reason our son is moving his bowels once a day.  All the other formula we tried gave him bad painful gas and spit up and he wouldn't go to the bathroom but every three or four days.  The formula doesn't make me want to vomit every time I make him a bottle every formula smells awful except this one it's the closest thing to breast milk for our son.

review/summary: Great & Green!  And it un-constipated our Baby Boy!
review/text: Our son was on Similac Organic from birth.  At about 3 weeks, he became very fussy and we suspected colic as he would cry for hours.  At about 4 weeks, he had a horrible day--he cried the WHOLE day.  We tried everything but nothing could completely calm him.  The next day, he pooped a very hard poop...and was finally calm.  So the poor guy had been constipated.  We went out and got some prune juice--gave him 1 teaspoon in every other bottle.  And then we decided to switch formulas....<br /><br />Thank goodness we did!  We wanted to stay organic, if we could, so we tried Earth's Best Organic.  It was great--less gassy, burps smelled better (as did the formula itself)--and, most importantly, his poops are normal again!  It did take about 1 week for him to get back to normal (during this time, we kept doing the prune juice & Earth's Best)--his little system sure was messed up!<br /><br />So we highly recommend Earth's Best Organic, esp if you want to go organic and you want an un-constipated baby!

review/text: I have been using this product since my daughter was 4 months old and she LOVES it. We haven't had any issues with spitting up or irritating her stomach. We used it in addition to breastmilk and she was willing to take both!! We really felt strongly about giving our daughter the best in organic products and felt that a company that focuses only on organic would be the best choice for us. So far we have had nothing but success!! She is now also enjoying the rice cereal and solid food!!

review/text: I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this formula, on auto-ship, for my grandson. It was the only one I found which had, as the first ingredient, organic whey. He has been drinking this formula for five months now, and is doing great. It pays to look closely at ingredients. Your child's nutrition is NOT something to risk on the "bargain" formula or food. Buy used clothing, but get the best formula you can find.

review/text: I really wanted to like this formula because it claims to be organic and gets good reviews. We used it for several weeks while our baby had crying sessions after every feeding. We received a sample pack of Enfamil Lipil in the mail out of the blue and decided to try it, and our baby has had much better feedings ever since. So Lipil it is. Over the weekend we tried Similac Organic and it looks an awful lot like Earth's Best, and again our baby has had stomach problems and gas.

review/text: Biotech company Martek is under fire for nondisclosure of non-organic manufacturing processes of their infant formula additives, DHA and ARA, which have made their way into numerous infant formulas, including some bearing the USDA Organic Seal. Martek's DHA and ARA products are synthetic attempts at omega-3 fats, chemically extracted from algae and fungi that have never before been part of the human diet. These infant formula additives, never USDA approved, have been heavily processed and chemically treated with solvents like hexane, and modified with the use of recombinant DNA techniques, all of which are supposed to be disallowed in organic products. There are hundreds of adverse reaction reports filed with the FDA about infants suffering severe gastrointestinal distress, vomiting, and diarrhea after consuming formula with these additives.

review/summary: CONTAINS GMOs
review/text: My daughter is almost a year old and still breastfeeding. However, I had to have emergency breast surgery when she was 3 months old and she had to take some formula off and on during that time. I chose the Earth's Best brand because I like all of their other products. She seemed to tolerate it fine and we had no issues. Imagine my shock reading the Organic Consumers' email newsletter just now informing me that Earth's Best formula was found to have genetically engineered neutraceuticals (in the DHA). Apparently, Horizon Organic milk does too, which is very angering....if you ask me, if a component of a product has to be GENETICALLY ENGINEERED, that product is clearly not 'organic' and shouldn't carry the organic labeling.<br /><br />The only thing I will say is that the Earth's Best brand is a good brand, and I'm sure this product is still much better than all the conventional brands.....I would still pick this over regular infant formula any day....however, the organic label is misleading in a product that apparently contains GMOs. I don't want GMOs anywhere near my developing child, and until law passes that all GMO food be labeled, I guess you can't even trust organic food now. Buyer beware.

My last purchase I looked on the ingredient list and to my surprise the formula had changed. It now has "organic glucose syrup solids"...added sugar. Why change a great product by adding sugar? I now will be changing to another product and possibly no longer use organic because I feel the added sugar is more harmful. Thank you Earth's Best for 7 months of a good product. Now the doctors thank you for adding to the obesity epidemic and the increase in type 2 diabetics in the US. You have lost a customer.

review/summary: Made My Son Sick
review/text: I started my 3 month old son (who is partially breastfed) on the regular Earth's Best formula, because I wanted something with organic ingredients that closely matched the Weston A Price Foundation's recipe for homemade formula.  My son did really well on this formula, but was a little gassy, so I decided to give the Sensitive formula a try & ordered 2 cans.  Within just 2 days of him drinking this stuff, he was projectile-vomiting EVERY formula meal, but not the breast milk.  It didn't take long to connect the dots & figure out that somehow it was the formula messing with his stomach.  I did more research & bought the Target brand Advantage formula, and supplemented with infant probiotics.  He's been fine ever since.

My second baby had a milk protein sensitivity so when he was younger and I first had to supplement with formula, we had to use Nutramigen and could not use this formula.  I hated the fact that there were no organic options for milk sensitivity (I wish Earth's Best had an option... they have a Lactose Free option but that is not the same thing).  Luckily when he got closer to 1 year he outgrew his sensitivity and we were able to switch him to this formula.  Much happier with this product.

Earth's Best made it easier for me to make the transition to formula feeding. I was so grateful that it didn't have brown rice syrup in it (which was found to have high levels of arsenic), and it didn't upset my baby's tummy. I guess it tasted fine, because she took right to it.<br /><br />I almost went with Similac Organic because of name recognition, but then I read about them using organic cane juice, which makes it sweeter than other formulas. Forget that! I'm glad I looked into what was going into the formula.

review/text: I wanted to stick with organic formula and tried similac organic but that seemed to give my daughter stomach problems.  She really reacted much better to Earth's Best and it also seemed to be not as thick and foamy as the similac (more like the consistency of breast milk).  This product does go for $35-$45 where I live so doing the ship and save through amazon is by FAR the best price!  I had been getting it shipped for about 4 months now (daughter is 7 months old now) and price has only fluctuated maybe $4-$5 for the pack of 4 containers.  This still at the most breaks down to $23/container- can't beat it!  Easy to mix, occasionally gets little chunks but can be mixed with a quick shake.  Highly recommend for value and quality of the product.

We originally were buying another brand of organic formula (major brand at Target with green lid) prior to giving this brand a try. Our babies had no reaction to switching and enjoy this formula just as they did the other brand. We feel good about providing them an organic formula during the 1st year of their lives and this brand is the cheapest all organic formula we could find that was readily available. Couple that with the 15% subscribe and save discount and you've got yourself a great deal...<br /><br />Since we need to feed 3 babies (now 9 months old) and not just one, saving any amount of money makes a big difference to us.

I tried one canister of Similac (only b/c I hadn't discovered Earths Best yet) and he seemed to spit up a lot after each feeding.  At 4 months old (tomorrow) he's a healthy 18 pound boy.  We are very pleased and look forward to trying the baby food that Earths Best offers for when he's old enough for solids.

review/summary: Earth's Best Organic Infant Formula Review - Price?
review/text: I love this formula! I started using it when I weaned my son off of breastfeeding around 9 months. I would have liked to continue breastfeeding to be honest, as it is better for baby in my opinion, as well as MUCH cheaper, however, I promised myself I would listen to my gut, trust my instincts as a mom and follow his cues, and that just seemed the time to wean so I did. I do love this formula, even with some of these reviews about the toxic stuff and syrup solids - people must realize that NO formula is perfect. A woman has breasts for a reason and no formula will ever compare, in my personal opinion. Not good or bad, just as mother nature intended it. Debating or reviewing the product itself is not the main reason I decided to write this review, however.<br /><br />My main reason for writing this review is the fluctuation of the PRICE. I was going to order last week, however it was almost $100 (with the S&S discount), where I had originally saw it for around $85. I logged back in today and saw it was $84.15 and decided I was going to order it today. A few hours later, when I went to place the actual order, it was $87 something. Now, this really isn't as big of a deal as it is annoying. I would still be paying $29.99 plus tax at Babies 'R Us per can, which is just shy of $130 for four cans, so you still save a considerable amount of money. The way I look at it, I buy 3 and get the 4th can for free ordering them on Amazon. However, what gives, Amazon???? Why does the price seem to change by the hour/day? That's obnoxious. Just a heads up to buyers really...order it when it is priced LOW and it's a phenomenal deal (although you do save money no matter what)!

review/text: My first priority in choosing a formula was that it was organic.  I tried 2 others  before buying this - they both had a funky smell and tasted awful (my little one agreed!).  This mixes wonderfully, has a very pleasant smell and actually tastes nice (I figure if I can't stand it - no way my baby will enjoy it multiple times a day!).  The subscribe and save price is better than purchasing through any retail stores.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Breast is best...but, Earth's Best rocks!
review/text: I have to admit, I have been a bit snotty when it comes to formula vs breast milk.  An advocate for breastfeeding, I never thought I would need to resort to feeding my baby formula, but my view has changed dramatically over the "debate" when my 5 month old demanded more than my body could produce, leaving me to find another source of food for her.  As a result, I now think formula (at least Earth's Best Organic!) is such a great innovation.  As parents, I think we all strive to give our children the very best, and so in my search for an infant formula, I went to our local health food store (Mother's Market) and came across Earth's Best, read the high quality ingredients and decided that it was worth the extra money.  Thankfully, our daughter responded very well to it and didn't have any lactose issues.  I also like how it has iron, since BF babies lack the nutrient.  Anyway, our daughter has been on Earth's Best Organic going on three months and couldn't be a happier baby.

review/summary: Baby loved this formula
review/text: Nothings gets passionate moms fired up for debate like formula! If you have decided to offer formula to baby, then I think an organic product is the way to go.<br /><br />We choose Earth's Best because we trust the company and were scared by the many frightenig reports about imported, non-organic formula.<br /><br />We tried all the natural and organic brands and this was the one that baby accepted easily and stayed with. I love that its organic and available in stores, so I can always buy extra if we fall behind in orders. Subscribe & Save also offers this at a very reasonable price and ensures that the cupboard is always full.<br /><br />Some reviewers have commented that it clumps-- I didn't notice any difference in clumping between this brand and others. Shake vigorously and problem should be solved.

review/summary: A good formula for supplementing
review/text: My 2-month-old son didn't gain enough weight in the first two weeks of being exclusively breastfed, so we knew we'd have to supplement with formula, especially considering that human milk banks charge between $3 and $4 an ounce. Of course, we wanted to use something organic, considering that we're trying to avoid chemical exposure as much as possible (glass bottles, cloth diapering, natural detergents, etc.).<br /><br />He likes this formula, and with the Amazon subscribe and save discount, it's much more affordable than buying it in a retail store. It is, however, the first formula we tried. We haven't used anything else, so I don't really have anything to compare it to, other than the expressed breastmilk that my son still gets.

review/summary: Great option for our house!
review/text: We did a lot of research on formula for our son - and switched him from the Similac Advanced that we supplemented with for the first few months, after reading the list of ingredients on the side of the container.<br /><br />Switching my son to EB was a breeze - we had absolutely no problems with gas or fussiness. It's a great option for those that can't breast-feed.<br /><br />Regarding the clumping: I typically filter water for my son's bottles in the morning and again in the afternoon, and set the bottles out at room temperature in between. This is how my son prefers his bottles, and I've found that either room-temperature or warmed water helps to break the clumps up and then it's very easy to mix up.

This breading certainly brings on the flavor; it's salty and definitely spicy hot.  The mix is super easy to use: I just pour a little in a ziplock bag, place a few fillets inside the bag, and gently toss to coat.  The mix adheres nicely to the fish and really adds a nice cajun flavor.  I would recommend this mix to anyone that enjoys spicy food!

If you like flavorful spice without the added breading (you could always add it to flour/breadcrumbs for breading but I prefer the seasoning alone) this is a great choice.

review/text: Ok so if you ever watched the original 1980's version of the Chronicles of Narnia then you know what Turkish Delights are and probably got hooked on them back then!  I found some in a TJ Max store a couple of years ago and was not able to find them anywhere else until I bought these online.  They are delicious, soft, chewy, nutty, and covered in powdered sugar.  If you have no self restraints when it comes to sweets then I suggest you have someone hide them from you because you will want to eat the whole box.  The only thing I found them to be missing was the slight aroma of flowers which the original ones I tried had both the flower aroma and the pistachio nuts making them my favorite.  I have yet to find one with both of those qualities yet but this was a good enough substitution.<br />The seller is pretty fast on shipping and the product tastes pretty fresh, just eat them within a week because if left open longer than that they will start getting a bit hard.

review/text: Narnia???<br /><br />I first had Turkish delight while I was in Turkey.  There, shops produce Turkish delight and hundreds of other exotic treats fresh.  Every town of more than a few thousand people seems to have at least one of these shops. The sweetness of Turkish delight varies by shop in its native homeland, and this confection is a fine example, so long as one doesn't eat all that sugar sifting around in the box.  I think there's so much so it will act as a natural preservative.<br /><br />If you can't fit a quick trip Turkey to get the genuine article hand-made fresh, then this is the best imported substitute I've tried.  I wouldn't trust getting something like this from a regular retailer because of potential shelf-life issues, and I wouldn't trust confections obtained from a discount clothing outlet, but on-line through Amazon I trust.<br /><br />Tangentially, if you like Turkish delight, you owe it to yourself to visit the country of origin, because there's many other delicious Turkish confections you probably haven't experienced.

review/text: I had tried a different brand of Turkish Delight twice before. A co-worker brought it to the office from his trip to Turkey. It was so delicious that I needed to get some and I decided to order from Amazon as I could not find stores that carry it.<br />This Galil Turkish Delight is so sweet that I could not even eat 2 of them and they are pretty small. I tried to remove some of the powdery sugar, but still the same, which was surprising since it contains pistachio. After eating 2 of them it left me with some kind of sick feeling since they are too sweet. The other problem is that the order comes in 4 boxes, which means that I wasted my money since I could barely consume one box. I took one to the office and the other I gave to a friend of mine, but warned them that it is very sweet. The 4th box may end up going to the garbage as I cannot even think on eating this Galil Turkish Delight again. What a disappointment.<br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/text: If you prefer the taste of coconut water, then this item is not for you. However if you are looking for a substitute for a hydrating drink then this is a good alternative.<br /><br />It takes some experimentation to come up with the amount that suits your taste.<br />I prefer 3 scoops with a pinch of sugar although it doesnt come close to coconut water taste.<br />The downside of using more than one scoop is the salty aftertaste of the residue.<br /><br />2 stars since its not close to taste of natural coconut water.<br />3 stars as an alternative to hydrating drink.<br /><br />a single serving size of 1tbsp contains the following:<br />40  Calories<br />40mg  Sodium<br />326mg Potassium - this is 10% of the daily value<br />8g  Sugar<br /><br />3%  Calcium<br />6%  Manganese<br />15%  Magnesium<br />100% Vitamin C

review/summary: True Southern country ham -- Delicious & everything I remembered
review/text: I've looked for a good country ham ever since a past trip to Tennessee, where it was served in a restaurant.  Not available here in the Northwoods!  But this is definitely the real stuff.  It's much stronger flavored than regular ham, and very salty -- which, lord help me, I love.  A small serving goes a long way, though.  Also, it's not pink like most ham, and it is MUCH firmer.  You'll need a sharp knife!<br /><br />We started out frying it by the slice.  Then I baked it, whole, and dumped the grease.  But that dried it too much, so I then boiled it to soften and reduce the salt a little.  Used the water from that to make the BEST bean soup I've ever made.  Now we just cut off a thin slice at a time and warm it in the frying pan.

review/summary: tough salty ham
review/text: Well, a friend suggested we don't get the attic aged ham but one of their others. Our friend is from California, Missouri so she knows the hams.  I didn't listen to her because I wanted to try some aged ham.  Well, it was mostly bone and tough.  I went with their instruction but it was still too salty for my wife.  I then cooked it in water (after soaking for 24 hours) and it was still tough.  My friend said, well that is aged ham.. it is tough...<br /><br />So, next time I will order one of their non-attic aged ham and have it sliced..

review/text: This is a super premium dog food but worth it if you are willing to pay. Our dog kept having acid reflux to a number of other foods containing meals....so to avoid this we tried Spring Naturals on a hunch. Since then, our dog no longer experiences any of the gastric issues that plagued her. It is worth mentioning that you should shop around here on Amazn for different vendors considering I've seen dramatic swings in prices depending on who the seller is. Overall a good food that  is well balanced, and good for your dog, I should finally mention that her cost has visibly improved as well.

review/summary: THE GREATEST CANDY EVER CREATED
review/text: I'm one of those people who wakes up in the middle of the night to scavenge the cupboards for sweet things, and this is undoubtedly my sweet of choice.  There's simply nothing better on the candy marketplace than this masterfully concocted product, so be glad that the owners and creators have found a way to bring it to the masses.  Given their emphasis on small batch quality over quantity, it can be hard to find in a lot of grocery stores, but now anyone with a computer can rightfully gorge themselves.  I've emailed the folks at Funley's via their website to inquire as to whether they're putting actual crack in the little treats (as they're so damn addicting), but they just say that the only thing in there is "fun, love and chocolate-y goodness".  Sounds like they're trying to protect their recipe, but who can blame them.

review/summary: All Natural?  Hardly.
review/text: I contacted the company regarding their claim that the product is:<br /><br />"All Natural" and has "No Artificial Anything".<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these statements to be no more than marketing hype, as the product is not non-GMO.  Even when the Funley's marketing person responded to my query, he re-stated the claims above, then stated that the product is, in fact, not non-GMO.<br /><br />It is arrogant to assume a consumer's memory is only a sentence long--that we aren't "smart" enough to understand that two statements in a short email are contradictory.  Funley's is another company that has abandoned honesty in favor of trickery in marketing.  While the product may be tasty, the marketing is distasteful and dishonest.  There is nothing natural about GMO ingredients; it's common sense.<br /><br />If you are not aware of the problems with Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO), such as preponderance of soy and corn on the market, please visit your favorite search engine and get started!

The holy grail of chocolate and peanut butter sweets has always been Reese's Peanut Butter Cups for me. Until now. Funley's Delicious Peanut Butter Stix In The Mud are crazy good. So good, in fact, that I ate an entire box of them in one sitting. (So much for the so-called "portion control" individual wrappings.) I never write reviews (who has time!), but honestly I had to share this discovery with the world. If you like chocolate and peanut butter you must try Funley's. Thanks for listening. Happy holidays.

review/text: With a major sweet tooth I am always looking for the next great snack and I have found it in stix in the mud. I first tried Funley's product at a local grocer in Los Angeles. They reminded me of a snack my mother used to prepare and I have been hooked for a few years now. While I am discerning about my snacks I accept that they are usually sinful. What a pleasant surprise to find that over the years Funley's snacks have become free of preservatives, trans fats and high fructose corn syrup. Now when my kids ask what I have in my mouth I can offer them a stix in the mud snack with a little less guilt - they say a sweet tooth is inherited genetically....

To be honest, I was worried that this product wasn't actually all natural since they taste so good, but I did some of my own research and learned that they're made by Whole Foods standards (which is where I buy my groceries).  I'm so thrilled with these snacks that I feel like starting a fan club!  Thank you, Funley's!!!

review/text: I've pretty much liked the other varieties for the Tassimo other than this one. I put my usual amount of creamer and sugar in, was ready to head out the door for work when I took a sip. Fortunately, I did because this tasted just awful. It wasn't bitter or bold. It just tasted lousy. I ran to the fridge dumped a load of Hazelnut flavored creamer in there to mask the nastiness, was about to head out again and it was still too gross to drink. So, long story short, basically, this morning I had a great big mug of Hazelnut creamer with a little bit of coffee in it.<br /><br />This one definitely isn't for me. I'd rather just have a cup of Maxwell House Breakfast Blend and and some flavored creamer to it.

review/text: Tried the Gevalia french vanilla t-discs and didn't really care for them.  They had a very strong, slightly unpleasant smell...and I like vanilla.  I was a little tentative to try the Maxwell House version.  I shouldn't have been.  While the Gevalia version is a little too much for my taste, Maxwell House was just right.  I remember when you could buy the French Vanilla ground coffee for regular coffee makers back in the late nineties, early 2000's.  It was a favorite of mine, not only for the taste, but it made your kitchen smell wonderful.  Then they stopped selling it.  Now, thanks to Tassimo, it has returned.  Can't wait to try the other flavored Maxwell House coffees.

review/summary: I Love The Taste!
review/text: I have been drinking coffee for many years and recently received a single cup coffeemaker. I tried the Maxwell House Cafe Collection in the French Vanilla. I like that it is not only so easy to make but the taste is great too.The coffee and cream are the perfect combination,it steams up and is very hot!

review/summary: had better
review/text: this coffee was kinda bland.  Not really what I expected.  I drank all of it so it was alright.  I probably won't buy it again though.  I am pretty big coffee person.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I love the taste of this french vanilla coffee!  I have purchased the Gevalia kind as well, but I thought since this was a little cheaper I'd give it a try.  I can't tell the difference between the two brands, so I'm going to stick with Maxwell House since the price is better.  It smells so good while it's brewing, and has a wonderful subtle vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Aromatic and dellcious
review/text: This was a great addition for our Tassimo and the whole family loves it.  Excellent quality, flavor and aroma. It's also great to be able to order on Amazon and get it in 2 days, there are fewer and fewer stores in my area where I can buy T-discs anymore.
