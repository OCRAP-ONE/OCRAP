review/text: My "kitty girls" are both almost 16-and I promise they really ASK for these-they actually go over to the pantry door and paw at the door because they know they are inside on a shelf.  They both absolutely love them better than any treat they have ever had-I will be ordering these on line on a regular basis inasmuch as they are less expensive and I can be sure not to run out and have to face them!

review/summary: Very refreshing when ice cold
review/text: I am a soda conniseur and I like to try new sodas all the time. This is a favorite, a delicious grapefruit soda from Mexico that is commonly sold in mexican groceries and bakeries in the U.S. It is my favorite flavor from the 10 or so different varieties from the Jarritos company. It tastes kind of like Squirt or other citrus sodas, but lighter with no afterbite. The sugar tastes more authentic and light as they use the more expensive cane sugar instead of the cheap frutose sweetener most soda companies use on us now. The carbonation is a bit lighter as well and not overpowering.<br /><br /> Jarritos is now the best selling Mexican soft drink brand in the U.S.  This offer is for a single serving of the grapefruit, but they sell other sizes and volumes at Amazon.

review/summary: This curry powder delivers flavor!
review/text: I have tried different types and brands of curry powder in cooking various dishes such as rice, veggies and Indian cuisine.<br />So, far The Spice Hunter has been the best of all the brands I've tried.<br /><br />What makes this brand superb is that to get a quality curry flavor. I don't have to use half a jar to taste the curry, nor are the spices<br />too strong.<br /><br />Furthermore, I also like that it is salt-free, which enhances the curry flavor instead of tasting salt.<br />For those of you who like a saltier taste, this probably isn't the brand for you, unless you want to add salt youself.<br /><br />For me, this curry is perfect for my taste and at a reasonable price as well.

review/text: This is by far my favorite curry blend. Seeing this visually in my favorite local market was a determining factor in my purchase. You can visually see the individual ingredients as it hasn't been pulverized to oblivion. So I purchased it, then I used it... OMG I don't usually get excited over bottled spice, but this brand has proven to be an exception. I've since tried and become a fan of The Spice Hunters. Unfortunately my local market quit carrying this brand. So very happy to see it here on Amazon.

review/summary: The world's best cold remedy.
review/text: The product description calls the Orangettes "Belgian Vitamin C."  Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.<br /><br />I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.  In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try.<br /><br />The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.  For shipping, the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell.  Mine arrived within three days and looked like I'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift.

review/summary: Exquisite Chocolates
review/text: If you crave dark chocolate with orange like I do, this is a superlative indulgence, Leonida's Belgian Chocolates, Dark Chocolate Covered Orange Peel. It is the kind of treat you have to horde in a secret refrigerator away from people who get the munchies and will eat any old thing. This is *special*. This feels very French. I was enjoying it so much one day at work that I missed a very important moment. My boss was leaving, soon to be deployed. He said, "Well, see you around." I was in chocolate oblivion. I didn't know that was The Moment to wrap up four years of working together. I watched him in disbelief as he waved his hand. I couldn't cry out, "Wait!" because my mouth was full of Leonida's Dark Chocolate Covered Orange Peel and you cannot talk, chat, email, or read a book, sharing/wasting this gastronomic experience with any mundane task. As I said, that was a big moment lost, but that chocolate was incredible, fulfilling, remarkable!

review/text: I am very impressed with this product (and the company that creates it). The packaging is gorgeous - nice enough to give as a gift as is. And the dark chocolate covered orange peels are the best I have ever tasted. The dark chocolate is rich and flavorful. The candied orange peels on the inside are the perfect balance of sweet and tart. And they're easy to bite into - not hard like some others I've tried.<br /><br />Yes these are pricy but they are truly gourmet. And since the package includes a full pound I believe that justifies the price.<br /><br />I ordered this during the winter so I was not concerned about melting.

People, do your math before ordering this flavor. If you can buy it in store, better do it. If someone is reading this who works for Amazon, please reconsider the price of this product. If you buy it at Krogen you pay $ 1.83 per bottle but the price at Amazon, you will land up paying $3.20 per bottle. See the difference...

They say they don't have a candy shell, but they do have some sort of glaze over the outside that I didn't care for.  It made the outside texture seem waxy, and I just didn't care for that, so I'll stick to either a Hershey bar or kisses if I want Hershey's chocolate.

I have been a fan of this product since it was introduced and continue to make it my first choice. Quite frankly I was very pleased to find Purina ONE here and the ease of ordering and shipping will definitely make it easier than lugging the bags from store to home! From my experience with Purina, the company backs their products 100% and have always been quick in response to concerns and questions regarding products and suggestions. For older dogs who are a bit less active I use Purina Fit and Trim. For puppies I use Purina ONE Large Breed Puppy Formula.

I was introduced to this product as a young boy when my family would take me into LA's China Town for Dim Sum and we would go to the Asian Market for supplies for the the meals Mom would fix at home. I was able to buy it at CostPlus World Market for a period of time but they stopped carrying it. My other source, a local Asian Market I used to also get it at went out of business and I was down to the last of my stash when I did a product search on Amazon and found suppliers. If you want a sweet heat without that vinegar after taste this the product for you.

review/text: I've been using this hot sauce for years as part of my collection of sauces.  If you are looking for a strong vinegar based hot sauce this is not it.  But if you are looking for a sweet-n-hot sauce, this is perfect.  I've never been fond of the way most of the hot sauces are dominated by an overpowering vinegar tart.  They have their place, but as a straight sauce on most foods, by the time you have the food warm to the taste, there may be little taste of the food left.<br /><br />I've found this sauce a delightful departure from ketchups and other similar condiments, used right on fresh foods including just plain rice.

review/summary: different but good
review/text: I know, I know, it sounds weird but it's good! I am a soda conniseur and I like to try new sodas all the time. This is a delicious pineapple soda from Mexico that is commonly sold in mexican groceries and bakeries in the U.S. It is one flavor from the 10 or so different varieties from the Jarritos company. It is lighter than most sodas with no afterbite and it is less sugary. The sweetness tastes more authentic and light as they use the more expensive cane sugar instead of the cheap high fructose corn syrup sweetener most soda companies use now. The carbonation of Jarritos is a bit lighter as well and seems to make the fruit flavor taste better.<br /><br />Jarritos is now the best selling Mexican soft drink brand in the U.S. This offer is for a single serving of the soda in a glass bottle, but they sell other sizes at Amazon.

review/summary: Delicious - similar to Sesame Corn Thins
review/text: We're big fans of Sesame Corn Thins, but they haven't been available lately, so we tried these crackers.  The ingredients are similar, and it's a good cracker.  Maybe slightly more crumbly than Corn Thins.  I took a chance on ordering these because I couldn't find the ingredients list anywhere online.  Here's what's in them:  Corn, quinoa, sesame seeds, and salt.  There's less salt than in Corn Thins if that's important to anyone.  There are 27 crackers in the package.  Three are a serving, with 38 calories and 11 mg sodium, which is super low.<br /><br />They advertise these to be gluten free, but they are manufactured in a facility that also processes wheat, milk, and soy.  They are made in Belgium.  The website is [...] .

review/text: As someone with food allergies, finding GOOD organic non-wheat products gets more challenging by the day in the USA.  These crackers (which on the box say imported from Belgium, FYI) taste great and have no questionable ingredients.  I only eat natural sugars (cane sugar, honey, or stevia) and natural oils  (olive, sesame, coconut, grapeseed, corn, soy).  The price was good (at least at the time I purchased it) and it shipped quickly in a box fitted to the bundle. In addition, QUINOA is known as the world's best super-grain with the most vitamins and minerals.  It's a tasty cracker that's actually good for you. Kudos on that feat! :)

review/summary: The BEST Ketchup!
review/text: Of all the ketchups (organic and not) I have tasted, this has the best flavor.  Anyone who has eaten at our house and tried Muir Glen Ketchup has also commented the same.  It is a nice balance and just sweet enough.  To compare it with non-organic, I would say the flavor is much closer to Heinz than to Hunts.  Personally, I think Hunts is harsh and like eating tomato paste.<br /><br />I no longer buy non-organic ketchup considering tomatoes are one of the worst when it comes to pesticides.  Unfortunately, my local grocery store stopped carrying it.  Maybe I was the only one buying it?  Does anyone know if it is Gluten free?

review/summary: it you were to make ketchup at home, this woud be it....
review/text: ...so is that good or bad? well, depends.  If you like your ketchup to be the consistency of heinz or hunts, forgeddit.  This ketchup has a consistency that is more like tomato paste from the can....a bit thinner, obviously, but certainly not what the average consumer is used to.  BUT (and yes, that's a big but!), this is probably the most flavorful, tomato-y ketchup I've ever had.  It's not real vinegary (which is what I would prefer), so I only gave it 4 stars, but there is flavor all over the place.  I read a review that said it was closer to either hunts or heinz, but truly, it's not close to either....it tastes the way ketchup was probably meant to taste...like tomatoes!!  I'll be subscribing and saving it from now on, as I'm on a mad rampage to get high fructose corn syrup out of my diet (a direct response to watching the movies King Corn and Food Inc.) and I'm a ketchup fiend.....this product makes me happy.

review/text: It's by no means a given that a name-brand organic product will also have a great recipe, but this one does.  This is delicious ketchup as well as pesticide-free.  For me the one negative is the plastic bottle, but amazon seems reluctant to give bulk subscription discounts on items in glass bottles -- understandable since they pay the shipping and replace damaged shipments.  But this stuff is just too good to complain, so it gets five stars even with the plastic bottle.

review/text: I'm pretty lax about writing reviews but I'm trying to remedy that since I rely on reading product reviews myself before purchasing items. Anyway, I felt obligated to write about how good and addictive this ketchup is. I was hesitant at first to purchase this because you had to buy a whole case at a time, especially having never tried it before. When we first received ours, of course promptly as usual with Amazon Prime, my wife and I tried it. Hmmm, interesting, came out of both of our mouths. I wasn't sure if I really loved it or not. Then, after the second or third time using it I can't imagine using anything else. As a matter of fact I told my wife the other day, Hon we are down to 9 bottles of ketchup, you think I should order some more? This is a thick, excellent ketchup with a distinct flavor of it's own. I'll never go back to those other store brands unless we can't get this any more. You will all love it.

review/text: Ketchup isn't something I had given much thought to, in the past.  The sad truth is, we had run out of ketchup in the dead of winter and I could get it from Amazon faster than I was going to get to the store.  I read the great reviews and decided to give this one a try.<br /><br />Not only do we LOVE this ketchup, but we gave bottles to family members and they now LOVE it also.  "Let us know if you need us to take any more of that ketchup off your hands!" they say.  :)<br /><br />I love the taste, the texture, and I love that I can give it to my kids and actually feel pretty good about them dipping everything in it.  Highly recommend!<br /><br />The only drawback, if you are a stickler about expiration dates, is that we did not use an entire case before it expired (part of the reason we shared with family).  I ordered my case in February, and it expired December of that year.

review/text: Wow what a suprise.  I couldn't decide between the offerings on Organic Ketchup, but decided on the Muir for a couple reasons that have long since been forgotten, and new ones formed.  It's an amazing combination of "au nataral organic" and zest, body and soul.  It seems to be a great deal more sophisticated tasting than your garden variety catsups.  Your kids might notice initially, but surely would find it perfectly suitable for their ever-more-bazaar uses for catsup over time.  If you are concerned at all for your health, your children's health, and the health of the planet, this is surely a spectacular choice.  If you just enjoy higher quality products over generic processed foods, then this will surely please.  Either way, Muir hit a home run.  Thank you.  I'll be purchasing again.

The box that holds the ketchup was set inside of a larger box, but only partially surrounded by brown wrapping paper.  UPS obviously dropped the box as it was split up one side, and the ketchup was damaged & leaked.  I don't know how many did this, but am not excited about having to wash them all off to see which ones had been damaged and which ones are just covered with dried ketchup.  That was such a disappointment as I really like purchasing hard-to-find items here on Amazon!

Very good tomato taste, and slightly less sweet tasting than the Heinz, which is a plus in my book.  The flavor is more full than the Heinz as well.  Yummy!  Thanks Amazon!!

review/summary: Muir tomato ketchup
review/text: The taste was better than I expected. The main reason for ordering the Muir ketchup was the sea salt component to eliminate the effect of swelling from ingestion of salt. I found out, there was more components than the salt in diet that controls the swelling. If I maintain the same amount of food I am ingesting, the sea salt in Muir is excellent. However, If I ingest more food, even with the same type, swelling starts to start. Apparently, even with the sea salt-discipline is the key, along with the lack of gluten, wheat. Certain gluten foods causes an annoying rashes, swelling and skin abnormalities. Eliminating one irritating component is important, but for perfect control, an all over evaluation must be maintained.<br />  I found out American choice foods are perfect, but the discipline of the amount food ingested will be done to gain all over control. It was interesting, even with eliminating the gluten, over eating gluten free foods, is fattening. A day two of fasting will eliminate the problem.<br /><br />I was really surprised and amazed the efficacy of ordering from Amazon!<br /> The time of delivery was excellent,the representatives were very helpful and amazingly truthful. I still have to evaluate the positve effect of the Muir.

review/text: After trying Muir Glen, I find it hard to go back to Heinz.  It has a great flavor and good thick texture to it.  I've tried many other organic ketchup and this the only one I've found worth getting.

review/summary: Finally, a ketchup that is good value, all organic and no trans fat!
review/text: it is funny that the Keinz brand sold in the US has trans fat and the same brand sold in Europe has no trans fat?!  So once we noticed the trans fat in Heinz... we started taste testing the organic and non-trans fat brands.  This is by far our favorite and best value too as we like to use ketchup a lot in a our cooking (taste great in our turkey chili!!).  The viscosity is great and has a slightly sharper tomato-sweetness, which we like as it brings out the meat flavor when heated.  Muir Glen makes some great canned tomato too, which we also use if our supermarket is not doing a special on vine tomatoes!  We tried to start from basic and the original products first, but a dash of ketchup in the cooking really intensifies the tomato goodness.  yum yum.

review/summary: DEMERARA SUGAR.  I'M SPEECHLESS THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS REVIEWED THIS PRODUCT, because it's GREAT.
review/text: You are definitely missing something if you have not used Demerara sugar, from England, in your tea.  This sugar was first introduced to me on my first trip to the U.K. about 22 years ago.  It is so good that I brought several boxes home with me and savored them until my next international trip.  However, if you ask your local grocer to keep this product in their inventory, then you can just pluck it off of the shelf.  You'll save on the cost of fuel!  8]<br /><br />HOWEVER, WHAT REALLY MAKES A GREAT CUP OF TEA IS A COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING: U.K. WATER, U.K. CREAM, DEMERARA SUGAR, AND TWININGS TEA(S)!  I have never had better cups of tea when I am outside of the U.K.<br /><br />If you can't make it to the U.K., then just go with Demerara sugar and Twinings tea.  These two products alone will increase your enjoyment of tea! ENJOY!<br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />Sorry about some info. in the above review.  Apparently, this product is made on the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.  All of my boxes have'ENGLAND' (whether I purchase them in England or the U.S.) written on them.  Got me?  However, it's still great sugar!

review/text: I fell in love with sugar cubes when I lived in Europe. When I returned to the US, I had the hardest time finding them in the grocery stores. I decided to search Amazon for them and was so pleased when I found this product. It is made from real sugar and dissolves quite rapidly when dropped into my tea. Using these sugarcubes also help me to be cautious and consistent in the amount of sugar that I use. Thank God for Amazon for having almost any product that I desire!

review/text: These woodears are top quality. They come pre-shredded, making them easy to add to soups and stir-fries. They swell A LOT when rehydrated. The texture is wonderfully hearty, the flavor exceptional. This company, Fungus Amongus, produces the highest quality products across the board. I've purchased dried mushrooms from many other companies, but their quality is the best. Should you have any inquiries, they also respond in a timely fashion. Also highly recommend the truffle salt and dried porcinis............best ever!!

review/text: I have already written to complain about the packaging of these cans of nuts....have had no reply.<br />The cans were stacked 4 tall and completely covered with a very sticky tape.  When I tried to remove the tape,<br />which was not easy task, it ripped the Planters can covers off in many places.  I had wanted to use these as Christmas gifts but could not.  They looked like someone retrieved them from a dump.  I was very disappointed.<br />However, we are eating the nuts ourselves.  The Planter products are always good.

review/summary: Tastes Fantastic - save money!
review/text: I have been hooked on Starbucks Frappucinos for years - when they recently changed the formula I was so upset. I do not like the new taste. I tried McDonalds Frappe's but didn't like the taste as much. I figured my Frappe days were over and that I would just start drinking iced mochas.<br />When I came on Amazon a couple of weeks ago, I somehow ended up seeing that there were MOCAFE Frappe's you can make at home. I first was wondering if they would taste good, and then would they be hard to make? The 3 pound tin was on sale so I decided it would be worth a try. I am so glad I did!<br />All you have to do is put 16 oz of ice in a blender (measurements are right on the blender), add 4 oz of coffee, milk or water, and then 2 scoops of the powder. My first try I used 4 oz of coffee - it tasted really good but had a very strong coffee taste. The next one I used milk and it was perfect! The other day I ran out of milk and used water and it tasted the same as when I used milk, so I figured it is a great way to save 60 calories or so.<br />It costs $20 for the can, and it makes about 15 servings that are 16oz. With that in mind I realized I save $40 by not going to Starbucks and making my own - each can! Also no gas expense going to the mocha stand. I drink one a day so the savings really add up!<br />I highly recommend you give this a try.

review/text: This mix is fantastic! I have been addicted to Starbucks frappucinos for over 10 years and it never helps that I live close to a 24 hour one. My daily visits were really taking a toll on my budget and I too was really upset when they changed the recipe to the "however you want it" frappucino.<br />I don't know how I found this mix, but I'm glad I did. It tastes just like a Starbucks Mocha Frappucino or a Caribou Cooler. I use my Mr. Coffee Cafe Frappe, but this drink can definitely be made in a regular blender. I use one scoop of the Mocafe, two tablespoons of my favorite coffee, about 1.5 cup of ice, some vanilla soy milk, and sometimes a little bit of coconut syrup. The mix does come with a recipe, but you have to play around to create your own recipe just the way you like it. My tin did come with a scoop so I have had no measurement problems. Also, since I only use one scoop of the Mocafe and this tin contains 35 scoops, I estimated that I am paying about $0.60 per frappe if I don't include the soy milk and coffee costs (which are regular household items for me anyway). I don't know if I'll visit another coffee chain again!

review/summary: Pretty darn good frappe.
review/text: I ordered this trying to save money from not heading to McD's every morning for my mocha frappe fix. I am hooked. I was excited to get this, it shipped pretty quickly and I tried it out as soon as I opened the box. The instructions on the tin, weren't the right amount for me. So I have adjusted and am trying to find my amounts. The listed 2 scoops of Mocafe mix is too much for me (it turned out tasting powdery). So I have cut down on to about 1 scoop, plus a splash of choc syrup in the blender. I also found that taking time to make coffee ice cubes out of 2 or 3 ice cube trays I found at the dollar store made a wonderful mix!<br /><br />All in all this Mocafe is pretty darn good. Doesn't taste like the McD's frappe but I'm hooked & happy with being able to make at home instead of spending the $3.96 everyday. That gets pretty pricey after awhile.

review/summary: No Need to Ever Pay $$$$ For a Frappe Again!
review/text: This product is great and truly "mocha" flavored.  It is not too sweet and can be altered if you prefer more of a coffee flavor, or a creamier blend by adding yogurt or ice cream. My only suggestion, to avoid a powder texture taste, is either mix it with warm liquids or mix a large quantity and store it in your fridge.  I bought this to go with my Margaritaville Mixer and I will never again pay $5 or $6, for a frappe or any frozen drink because I was able to buy the drink base on Amazon.  I suggest the Vanilla Bean, too, for a wider variety of drink options and being able to give your guests a nice treat.

The taste is OK, I mean who doesn't like raspberry filling or chocolate or sponge cake? And anyway if you didn't you shouldn't be eating this.<br /><br />But what's great about this is the tactile sensation. When you put it in your mouth you first taste the chocolate skin, then you bite down on it and you release the raspberry filling and finally bite down into the sponge cake. Then you masticate and mix it all up in your mouth. Trust me, the taste is good, but the tactility of this product is even better.

review/summary: Healthy Tasty Pasta
review/text: I love this 51% whole grain pasta by Barilla.  A nutritionist recommended switching to whole grain pasta.  Initially it was difficult to find a whole grain pasta that wasn't too gritty tasting and fell apart.  Then I stumbled upon this Barilla pasta and it has a great texture and taste.  I make a lot of healthy tomato sauces (using vegetable juice and canned tomatoes) with cut up vegetables (peppers, zucchini, onions, mushrooms, black beans etc.) and chopped turkey or low-fat ground beef to pour over the whole grain pasta.  It's a quick nutritious meal that everyone enjoys.  The pasta takes less than 10 minutes to cook.<br /><br />Sometimes I keep the pasta leftovers separate from the sauce as the penne, if sitting in the heavy sauce over night, breaks up.  I just pour the left-over sauce into a large glass container, put the left-over cooked penne or rotini on top and the next evening mix and microwave them for another tasty meal.  You don't have to feel guilty eating pasta as a serving is 24% of your fiber requirements, low in sodium, low sugar and low fat.  If offers 7g of protein for about 200 calories.

review/text: These are wonderful little treats, elegantly packed. A treat has to be good, satisfying with 1 or 2 bites, and worth every calorie.  These certainly are!  Crispy, light and sweet-hope Amazon carries these always. The lime essence is in the powdered sugar, so be sure to enjoy that with the cookies.<br /><br />A collection of 6 nicely packed boxes  enables you to give a nice box to a deserving friend. And these certainly are appreciated!<br /><br />Note: freshness is not an issue.

review/text: Not the same drops from Flathau that I remember. The ones I was expecting had powdered sugar. I was disappointed.

review/summary: Better Than Home Made
review/text: These lemon snaps are some of the best cookies I've ever eaten.  They taste better than home-made, with a hint of cracked lemon candy inside each cookie.  I would serve them at one of my finest dinner parties.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: These are great!  They taste very fresh and have the perfect bite of lime flavor with plenty of powdered sugar.  The packaging is very nice, which made these great gifts for our clients.  The boxes weren't packed very well for shipping to Amazon, so two of six had damaged corners, but the others were in good condition (original shipping boxes inside Amazon's shipping box).

review/summary: 2 week expiration
review/text: When I received these key lime snaps I noticed they were ready to expire.  There is no way we can eat 6 boxes of these in 2 weeks.  They are very good and have a great taste.  I am very upset about this product.  I have never had a problem with any products I have bought on Amazon.  I hope Amazon does something about this. A very upset and disappointed customer.
