review/text: Bought this as a gift and sent it to someone. Hard as a rock, broken up and inedible. Turned a cool gift idea into a pain in the ... oh by the way not sure why I care about the steps the recipient had to go through ... oh yes I do because I gave it as a gift ... sigh ... very disappointing ... to use amazon because it was easier to make it a hassle to gift recipient .. Well the box was clearly inedible and awful ... actually the recipient mentioned that the package would be preferable to eat to the stale nasty candy they received.

review/summary: Lots of flavor - enhances Asian food!
review/text: This oil is excellent and can be used sparingly since it has intense flavor and aroma.<br />It makes home-cooked Asian style meals taste authentic.  In addition, I like to add a few drops to a bowl of miso soup for a richer, more complex broth.  It is available (in Maine at least) at Shaw's Supermarkets and at local health food stores for just over $5 for a 12.7 oz. bottle.

review/text: Loriva Peanut oil has a deep, rich taste that enhances dishes calling for peanut oil.<br />It's hard to get on the east coast, at least in my neighborhood (Brooklyn Heights)<br />where I used to get it regularly. So I was delighted to see it offered on Amazon.<br />I highly recommend this oil.

review/summary: micro powder salt
review/text: The micro salt was not really powder.  The salt was micro in size but did not have the ability to cling or stay on  a food substance when applied. After thinking about it I don't think it can be changed into real powder form. Other then being really high in cost will stop me from purchasing it again. However I was glad to see this product exist in this form anyway. Thank you.

review/text: I use this product primarily for oatmeal/maple scones I make regularly. The recipe calls for a small amount of maple extract. Recently, I decided to experiment by switching Agave syrup with maple syrup in the recipe. I added an extra teaspoon of the maple extract to the agave syrup and in the final scones, I couldn't taste the difference.

review/text: I have been searching everywhere for maple extract and was excited to find it on Amazon.

review/text: I can't eat much in the way of refined sugars because of a  health condition, and Maple Syrup is a refined sugar. I make a more benign Maple syrup by adding a tablespoon of this to about 12 ounces of Agave nectar. It is delicious and I can't tell it from grade B (the dark kind) maple syrup. I am thinking about trying an experiment, adding it to Splenda or Erythritol/Stevia mix and putting in the food dehydrator to make maple sugar substitute. I'll let you know how it works.

review/summary: Rice Bran Oil
review/text: I saw Rice Bran Oil talked about on Dr Oz.  He said that it doesn't turn into fat in your body and that sounded like something I definitely wanted to try. I'm glad I did.  There is virtually no taste to the oil.  It takes on the flavor of whatever you are cooking it with.  I've used it to saute garlic for pasta dishes and I couldn't taste a difference between the rice bran oil and the olive oil I usually use.  Another great trick I've found is for popcorn. I put maybe one or two tablespoons of butter in a bowl and mix it with a little of the rice bran oil.  Poured over a large bowl of popcorn it tastes like its pure butter. This is a great item to add to add to a healthy lifestyle.

review/summary: Great tasting oil!
review/text: I am another Dr Oz viewer who saw him rave about Rice Bran Oil on his show, so (after doing some additional research) I ordered it to see how well it actually works and tastes.  After using the RBO three different ways, it is definitely a hit and my whole family loves it!<br /><br />The first way I used the oil was to substitute it for vegetable oil when making a raspberry vinaigrette, the second way was to make fried potatoes with green peppers and onions, and the third way was to use it making cupcakes.  The vinaigrette was light and delicious, the potatoes were also light and delicious, without that greasy quality that sometimes comes when too much oil is absorbed into them, and the cupcakes were very moist, not too dense and they, too, were delicious.  Really, the only difference that we noticed was positive and consistent; the oil has a light quality that takes on the flavors of the food instead of the food tasting oily and heavy.<br /><br />Another benefit is that rice bran oil cooks very well at high temperatures.<br /><br />After trying this oil using different cooking techniques, I highly recommend it to others!

review/text: These are amazing black olives. They taste more like a kalamata than just a ripe black California olive. These olives are the closest thing I have found in the US to sprinkle on top of a pizza that has almost finished baking, in the traditional Sao Paulo/Italian pizza style. They are salty and have a stronger flavor than a brined kalamata black olive, so someone new to these olives might not want to eat them straight out of the jar...

review/summary: Essential for thai and vietnamese foods
review/text: What This Is:  Galanga, or galangal, is a root "spice" similar to ginger in flavor and appearance.  The flavor is different in its complexity and intensity than ginger, and the root is much more robust and woody than ginger.  Whereas it is easy to slice ginger and eat it, this root is not something you would eat outright.<br /><br />Recommendation:  do not order this during the warm/hot season without expedited (overnight) shipping.<br /><br />Why 3 stars:  The product arrived with a small amount of decay/mold on the root.  There were two large rootstocks in the package in a sealed plastic bag; it would have benefited from ventilation.  Being sealed in, condensation formed, the wetness in constant contact with the root combined with the warmth of spring caused a small amount of decay/mold to occur.  It was a very small amount, removed without too much difficulty.  One root was cooked, the other is growing in the garden.<br /><br />I recommend using something akin to a bone saw to cut the rootstock.  It is quite woody.

review/summary: Easy chocolate for fondue
review/text: I wanted a chocolate fountain for a recent party with 70 guests. After looking at many fountains, I splurged and got the Sephra. The Sephra, which is over twice the price of the Rival, has elegant looks and incredible quality. Why put ordinary chocolate in it? This SF chocolate was delicious. It is also easy to use. For most people, the fountain is only one of many things being prepared for a dining event, so speed and ease are extremely important. The bags heat nicely to get your fountain going quickly. Well worth it, and much easier than fussing with oil and chocolate blocks or chips.

review/text: This chocolate was so delicious and easy to use.  I was nervous when I got my fountain that I would have to spend a ton on chocolate and then have to put lots of oil in it, but this stuff is amazing.  It was so easy to melt in the microwave (right in the bag)and flowed just perfectly.  It was the absolute hit of the bridal shower and will make another appearance at the bachelorette party and then at out holiday party.  The chocolate has a rich flavor.  Delicious, easy, and FUN!

review/summary: better than chocolate chips & oil, not as good as Sephra
review/text: Most people would probably have no objection to this product, and it was good, it just wasn't the wonderful chocolate love affair I was looking for.  I was willing to try it because it cost less and had free shipping.  It was better tasting than the fondue melts I've had from craft stores. And more satisfying (and a whole lot easier) than adding oil to chocolate chips.  I'm still going to have to spring for the Sephra next time, though.  I am a very finicky chocolate connoiseur.  If you are not, then you would probably really like this product.

review/summary: A lovely, delicious, easy to use product. Can even eat it like snack!
review/text: I bought this for an occasion, and it was a dream. Melted perfectly in the microwave--you do NOT need a fondue apparatus. Just nuke it.<br /><br />You can nuke it in the bag, or pour some out and nuke the dish. Great either way. Lovely creaminess, nice dark chocolate flavor (not overpowering), yum.<br /><br />And the small niblets are great in a candy dish, fine for snacking, too. Not as intensely dark chocolate for snacking (the fat content is high for it to melt perfectly). But when it tastes fine in the hand, you know it'll taste good on your strawberry or dried fig or bits of angel food cake or banana disc or whatever.<br /><br />So, to recap: 1. ease of use  2. nice flavor 3. can be a snack when unmelted 4. comes in a big bag that makes a huge amount, or you can use some now and put some away for the next family occasion. (Since it comes in a two-pack, I gave one pack away as a gift.)<br /><br />I'd use it again. No problem.<br /><br />OH, and that previous poster who said that the packaging was devious? I have no idea what that was about. I got the exact package shown above in the amazon image of this fondue chocolate, and I didn't get 2 bags with big blocks. I got just what is shown. Two bags full of nice, discreet, fresh, tasty, very small circles/discs of dark chocolate. Not a big block of chocolate. Perhaps that reviewer's chocolate got overheated and melted on route? I dunno. But I got exactly what was promised and was quite, quite satisfied.

review/text: The small pieces of chocolate melt incredibly smoothly---much more so than "normal" bar or chip chocolate. This makes them perfect for fondue, or for simply stirring into hot milk for a drink. The dark chocolate could be richer and darker; I thought it tasted closer to milk chocolate, and lacks the depth of flavor of really good-quality chocolate.

review/summary: Worked Great in our Chocolate Fountain
review/text: Unlike chocolate chips or other fondue meltables, this fondue chocolate worked perfectly in our chocolate fondue fountain.  It required almost no oil or paraffin to keep it smooth and silky, which is perfect because the oil tends to detract from the chocolate taste.  It melted relatively quickly and very smoothly.  Once the fountain got going, it really kept moving along nicely.  I do recommend doing a pre-melt in a pan before adding to the fountain, as this tends to make it run even better.  The chocolate itself tastes wonderful on whatever you are dipping.  Highly recommended!

Before the New Year they were $ 1.58 each. I was hoping to find them for less on Amazon... Oh well, I guess that strategy doesn't always work out either... sigh...

review/text: That, indeed, is the question. After sampling the milk I realized that a better choice would have been regular. The milk taste pretty darn good. I made a milkshake (vanilla, strawberry) and it was delicious. I tried it in some cooking and the results were not as expected. But then I attempted a soup with Pumpkin, Barley, Seafood and the Coconut Milk and it came out pretty good (among herbs and spices, of course). Also did Chocolate Pudding Sugar Free and this milk is thick and fits right in with the added plus of the flavor. The fact of the matter is that there is probably many more uses for this type of milk that I have yet to devise, but for the time being I love what it can do with ice cream shakes and a few other uses. Next time I will be going all the way, for the full taste of Thai Kitchen Pure Coconut Milk (nothing like Mother Nature own Juice!) 4 Stars!

review/text: I've tried a lot of bars and crackers and with seeds - this is the only one I've really liked. Usually products with lots of seeds just don't taste good. This one is nice and moist and a nice seedy texture. It's true the flavor is not very strong, but there's a hint of peanut butter and a hint of chocolate. I don't taste overwhelming dates like I do with Lara bars - I just can't stand those anymore. Of course these ARE expensive - twice as much as most others - but the others don't give to charity with each purchase, so clearly that's why. If you like bars with seeds and the charitable aspect appeals to you, these are definitely worth trying. I would agree that trying one at WF first is a good idea because they ARE pricey.

review/summary: Does not taste like Peanut Butter and Chocolate
review/text: What first caught my attention of these bars were that they were vegan and soy free.  I have been trying to stay away from so much soy so I thought these bars would be a nice change of pace.  Upon opening this bar the smell was really nice.  I could smell peanuts but no chocolate smell was present.  I really loved the look of the bar, with all the seeds and such.  First bite I loved the texture, alot like the lara bars.  The taste was just so not what I expected, there wasn't any taste at all that I could even compare it to.  All I tasted to be honest was dates, no peanut butter or chocolate at all.  I was so dissapointed in this bar, I had such high hopes and expectations. I gave it two stars because the nutrition is there, but the flavor is not.  At over two bucks a bar at my local health food store, in no way is it worth it no matter how good the nutrition is.  I will get my nutrition in a more delicious form. So if I were you I would purchase one in the store before even thinking about buying this bar on amazon.  If you cant find it at a store near you, dont worry because you are not missing anything.

review/summary: Gluten free?
review/text: This product *was* listed in the heading here as "Gluten free."  However, clearly listed on the package I received, it said, "Allergy advice: This product was processed on machinery that also processes WHEAT, peanuts, treenuts and sesame seeds."  I received this flour promptly by mail, and everything was in order and undamaged.  Now, I don't know what to do with it... maybe just give it away rather than risk it.  *UPDATE*:  The seller promptly refunded, and apologized for the mix-up.  The seller has stated they will relist this item, and take away "gluten free" in the heading.  Sorghum is a nice wheat substitute.  I just can't risk it if it has possible wheat contamination.  A non-celiac may love it!  It just isn't for me.  My thanks to the seller for the quick, quality shipment, and for promptly resolving my problem!

review/summary: I hope the price hike puts them out of business.
review/text: I have been treating my sweet baby Boston Terrier Natural Choice biscuits for his entire 13 years with me.  He loves them so much, he refuses all other treats.  I went to my local store today to get a replacement carton, only to find that they have repackaged, reformulated and increased the price more than 100%.  They show egregious greed and a complete disregard for their customer base and a lack of understanding for the economy as a whole right now.  I would have gladly paid a reasonable price increase for a product I loved so much, but I will not stomach this.  They have broken my trust in their brand and in them as a company, and they will not win me back.  Like Netflix learned, social media is a powerful thing.  Word will spread and they will get more and more calls like the one I had with their extremely patient and kind customer service representative.

review/text: The ad-wizards at Nutro not only raised the price on their dog food but also dropped the amount in the bags by 5 pounds.  I am in the process now of switching my dog over to a cheaper better quality product.  You can be sure that the prices will continue to go up because if they didn't hedge against the spike in commodities the first time, they are too stupid to do it a second time either and will be passing on the cost of their stupidity in the form of an even more reduced bag size with an increase in price.  MARK MY WORD.<br /><br />12/20/2009 FOLLOW-UP: I was right.  Price jumped to $60 a bag from the high $30's.  Beware, company is currently being investigated.

I was embarrased and mentioned my finding to my host. He agree: the worst I have ever given him. Only the apricots redeemed this as a two star.

I decided on this Broadway Basketeers because she is allergic to the salt on most of the nut products and this has so many great dried fruits. She called me and was so so happy she said it was just huge and her husband and her were going to love eating it. This is a great basket for those who have allergies to food products. People love getting things to eat and this is the product for them. My sister has even used the empty box for her crafts.

review/summary: Too much celery-- much too much too much
review/text: This rub does indeed have low salt (compared to most meat rubs), but in order to achieve this the makers added heaps of celery.  The taste overwhelms this rub (I and the dear spouse both agree).  It cooks well and does flavor the meat, but the celery is just so in-your-face that it is impossible to ignore.  We much prefer low-salt rubs with added garlic instead.

review/summary: Everything from Pappy's has been wonderful
review/text: I've purchased a number of Pappy's seasonings.  I'm happy with all of them.  Pappy's Choice Seasoning with 50% less salt is one of my favorites.  If I ever need more salt, I just add it separately (it's easy to add salt but nearly impossible to take it away).  I use this seasoning on any number of meats.  I use this one particularly for hamburgers that I season right before grilling.<br /><br />I also use this seasoning with my "naked" chicken wings.  I take Pappy's Choice and mix it with grated parmesan cheese (approx. 5 parts cheese to 1 part seasoning).  I deep fry chicken wings with the skin left on but with no batter (hence "naked").  As soon as I pull them out of the fryer, I toss them with the Pappy's mixed with parmesan.  Since the wings are still greasy from the fryer, the seasoning and parmesan stick to the wings. It is VERY tasty!<br /><br />Shop around the Internet for Pappy's.  Amazon doesn't always have the best price for Pappy's.  That surprised me since Amazon is one of my best sources for good prices.

review/text: I like this tea. My guests have called it "herby" and "spicy". I agree. It is not as pleasantly fruity as the "Get Charged" version, which I love. However, the ingredients are what I wanted. Especially, the ashwagandha, which I saw on Dr. Oz's Over 40 show.<br />The Republic of Tea is new to me and I am happy with the shape and sturdiness of the cylindrical tube. It makes it very easy to store and open to get out a bag of tea quickly. I find the old fashioned boxes fall apart and leak tea powder into my cupboard.

review/text: I am normally a fan of the Traditional Medicinals chamomile tea, but this stuff is pretty good.  As the previous reviewer stated, it is well-suited for a gift.  Both the box and the tea pyramids themselves are aesthetically pleasing.  The tea tastes lighter and fresher than my usual chamomile tea due to the organic orange peel and hibiscus flowers in the tea; the tea is very refreshing.  Note that the tea seems to take a few minutes longer to brew because the chamomile flowers are whole, not ground.

review/summary: Short Lived
review/text: I am a law student and my study schedule rarely works well with my two dogs. In order to keep them occupied, I routinely give them bones similar to these as "get away from me for three hours and let me study" treats. Each of my dogs finished its respective bone of this type within 15 minutes. They devoured them. While it is most likely not harmful that they swallowed the crushed bone chunks, it makes me worry. I will not, ever, give these bones to my dogs again. The reward, the time they spend chewing on them, is minimal while the risk, that swallowing bone chunks will hurt them, is higher than I prefer. In balancing these two aspects, these bones are worthless in my opinion.

review/summary: Stay clear of pork bones
review/text: Go with beef bones or marrow bones.  The salt they put in the pork bones and other chemicals to keep them from rotting is horrible for your dogs.  Smell one next time you go to feed one to your dog, its disgusting and it smells 100% man made.  Smell a beef bone, they actually don't smell bad at all, there not toxic as pork bones are.<br /><br />I had given these to my dogs twice, the first time it slowed them down, like us eating 2 combo meals from Mc Donalds, the just lounged around and didn't do much, had a touch of diarrhea.  I didn't think the bone had anything to do with it until I gave them the 2nd bone 2 days later.  They both got sick this time, couldn't drink enough water and was vomiting out over control.<br /><br />Its just not worth it with all the other alternative out there and on Amazon.  Please find something better.<br /><br />I use marrow bone I get at my grocer, I freeze them and give them to my dog.  Keeps them busy for a solid 45 minutes and they have never gotten sick.  Either that I have used the beef bones, the ones smoked and dried.  They work well and are safe for your dogs.  Check out my reviews if you like I have some on dog treats.

review/text: Normally I buy the Yamamotoyama Jasmine green tea (not decaf) and the flavor is absolutely amazing.  But I've been getting headaches from the caffeine, and since Yamamotoyama doesn't offer a decaf variety, I decided to try this.  The flavor was less than I had hoped for; not nearly as sweet or potent, even after steeping for several minutes.  I'm not sure whether it's just because it's a different brand or because it's decaffeinated, but it's just not what I'd hoped for.  I won't be buying it again.  I'd rather have the great flavor and headaches of the Yamamotoyama brand.

review/summary: Good to have handy
review/text: I need to use coconut milk at times but don't have it in the canned version. This allows you to keep it at the ready, and fresh, in its individual packets.  The product description said nothing about how much milk each packet would render once prepared, so I bought this flying blind and found out each packet gives you 3/4 cup of liquid coconut milk in the end.  (You can add a 1/4 cup more water at the end of mixing to make it an even cup).  It mixes better using warm water and also sifting it first.  All of this is not explained on the packet, why, I don't know.  So I hope I have helped you avoid the pitfalls I fell into the first few uses. I use this when cooking rice, using the coco milk as part of the liquid to cook it in, and I use it when making rice and tapioca puddings, I use it in breads, cakes, and regular main course, meat dishes.  You'd be surprised how versatile it is.  I even use coconut milk when making a frozen coconut sorbet.  For that reason I recommend this item.

review/text: Now why would the description say it's a great alternative to milk when it contains milk by products!?! Annoying! Now I have to waste time returning it.<br />Update: This company was extremely difficult to deal with. They argued with me about it containing milk when it says right on the ingredient list that it contains a "milk derivative". When I refused to pay for return shipping they claimed to not know how to give me a shipping label. Their email responses did not even make sense much of the time, nor were they timely. After 15 emails and almost a month of being patient I had to file a claim with Amazon to get my money returned. Amazon credited my card within a couple of days and I'll just give the product to a food bank. This was not my usual experience in dealing with Amazon merchants. They are usually much better.
