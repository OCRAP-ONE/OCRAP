review/summary: Nothing like the original...
review/text: I have to disagree with the previous reviewer; I don't think this tastes anything like the original Parmesano flavor - it more closely resembles library paste or something to my tastebuds.  I think the Angel Hair Parmesan has a flavor that is kind of close to Parmesano, but something is missing - I can't tell what.  Noodle Roni Parmesano was my very favorite comfort food, and I miss it a lot.  *sigh*

review/text: Some of the other Pasta Roni mixes did not seem to have a lot of flavor.  We liked this one as much as the Pasta Roni Parmesan Cheese and the Pasta Roni Fettuccine Alfredo.  I have made the mix by adding the water and milk.  For the oil, I have used different oils such as Olive oil, sunflower oil, and coconut oil for a slightly different coconutty flavor.  Give it a chance, you may like it as well.

review/summary: Almost like the old Parmesano
review/text: I grew up with the old Pasta Roni(Golden Grain) Parmesano. The original had very thin egg noodles.  The flavor of the Parmesano sauce is imitated, but nothing exactly matches the flavor.  I am soooo glad that Pasta Roni has at least continued to carry this classic flavor.  For me, pork chops are not the same without this side dish.  It also accompanies fish and chicken dishes well.<br /><br />What can I say, side dish perfection, in my opinion.<br /><br />Thank you, Pasta Roni (Golden Grain) for continuing to offer this pleasant memory from my childhood!

review/text: Just last month, at the age of 32, I was introduced to pickled okra. Thank you, Sandy, for insisting I try them!!<br /><br />If you like pickles, you'll love this stuff!! I immediately went out and bought two jars - one spicy and one not - for snacking. They have just the right kind of tangy, flavorful crunch when you want a treat, and so much better for you than potato chips. I'm obviously a big fan.<br /><br />The Talk of Texas brand is the best. I have sampled a few others and the flavor here is my fave. Try it - you won't be disappointed.

review/text: This pickled okra is outstanding.  They are best chilled, however, even at room temperature they are still tasty and crisp.  I have a condition that precludes me from eating pickles, but I indulge myself now and then with this.  It is sold in lots of 6 for about $40--pricey, huh, but oh so good.  The packing is excellent.  These shipped from the vendor.  My carton was dropped onto my concrete patio floor by the courtier, sat outside for about a month, got rained on twice, BUT nothing was broken nor wet, and the product had not degraded!  How's that for packaging?

review/text: These are delicious mashed potatos.  They taste like real ones, not instant.<br />They couldn't be easier to make.  Just put in a bowl, add water, put in the  microwave for a few minutes and you're done.<br /><br />These taste like you have already put on the butter.  I am sensitive to any tastes that are artificial but there is absolutely nothing fake tasting here.  The potato taste is real, the butter taste is real.  You can tell these are made with real ingredients.<br />With this there is no reason to ever make mashed potatos the old fashioned way.<br />This tastes every bit as good, is made with genuine potatos and butter, and is fast.<br /><br />Each package will make two very large servings or three smaller ones.<br />I highly recommend this if you have a mashed potato lover in your household.

review/summary: Delicious pantry staple for almost any meal!!
review/text: I don't know what Idahoan's secret is, but thank goodness they know how to do it.  These are absolutely wonderful mashed potatoes, and they can be substituted for homemade any day.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUK7E">Idahoan Mashed Potatoes, Four Cheese, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 12)</a> are even better, by the way, but these homestyle ones are great, too.  And so easy you'll almost think you're being cheated -- just add contents of 1 bag to 2 cups of tap water in a microwaveable bowl, stir, and microwave 3 1/2 minutes.<br /><br />We keep these on hand all the time for quick meals after work.  Along with a fresh steamed vegetable and/or green salad (or, if you're really short of energy, a high quality canned or frozen vegetable), these are the perfect complement for a store-bought rotisserie chicken.  Several local grocery stores sell such rotisserie chickens as loss leaders, and we tend to buy them two at a time:  one for that night, and one in the fridge for another meal sometime later (they keep well in the original packaging and reheat beautifully).  If you're really feeling energetic, retrieve the juices out of the bottom of the chicken container, heat in a small pan with some chicken demi-glace (sold as chicken base or gravy extender in some stores) and some arrowroot or cornstarch shaken in a small container with a little more chicken broth or water, and you have some very presentable gravy to pour over the chicken and the mashed potatoes, all of which can be ready in about five minutes from the time you walk through the door!<br /><br />I confess:  these even get used occasionally for late-night comfort food (but not too often, because they're better for you nutrionally as part of a balanced meal -- although I have to say even these are better for you as a snack than ice cream, brownies, cookies or candy!!).  :)  And my husband thinks they're terrific under homemade or even canned beef stew.

review/text: Over the years I've tried various brands of instant mashed potatoes and always end up going back to Idahoan because they don't taste like they came out of a box.  Unlike many "instant" mashed potatoes, Idahoan Buttery Homestyle potatoes don't need extra butter or salt, although you can add a small amount of milk if you like them a bit creamier. I also like the fact that the package allows you to make a little or a lot, and is resealable.  Great, tasty product, especially when you're in a hurry.

This kind tastes buttery, and has just the right amount of salt for my tastes in it. So it works out well when I just need a quick side dish. My favorite way to make them is mixed with a package of the Baby Reds. That combination tastes very close to homemade, and a lot better than any other brand I've tried.

review/text: I found out the hard way I was looking for a different brand of instant potatoes.  This brand is horribly salty. I had to donate them to a "food pantry" even though I should have thrown them away to avoid making someone else sick.  I am on a low sodium diet and these would of put my health in jeopardy.  Not only that but they didn't even taste good.  Did I mention they were "horribly salty"?<br /><br />Too bad I bought two cases!!!<br /><br />The brand that I was looking for if you can find them was "Nana's Own" instant mashed potatoes.

Slightly minty, with a light, bubbly interior that gets it its name, the candy bar is light and delicious, and absolutely unlike anything else I've found since moving to the USA.  My wife, who's lived here her whole life, has never tried anything like it either.  Taste wise, the best comparison I could think of would probably be Andes mints, but the Aero bar's minty taste is much milder, and the chocolate is smoother.  Delicious.

review/text: This is a whole bean coffee and must be ground to your specifications.  In the past, I used Barnie's chocolate mint beans.  Unfortunately, they no longer have this particular one available.  I received four pounds of the Coffee Master's Flavored Coffee.  After trying 10 cups of this brew, may I state that it isn't Barnie's, but is acceptable.  I found it to be mild, and it was necessary to use more than I normally would for a cup of coffee.  I used two full scoops instead of 1 1/2.  If you like a milder flavor I would recommend this.  I like my coffee with a little more robustness.

I served it to a variety of picky coffee drinkers, and everyone gave it a thumbs up, including me. It has a nice blend of mint & chocolate that isn't overwhelming. With other coffees, I sometimes grind enough beans for a couple days and store the ground coffee in a zip lock, but in this case, the coffee is MUCH better if ground fresh every day. It's definitely worth the effort.

The noodles by themselves smell stale as you cook them and once cooked the noodles are mushy, the flavor is pretty weak and the spice is mild at best.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I usually buy these from my local Indian grocery. After doing a little research I found that the Maggi brand is how Kraft is branded to much of the world outside the US. It's one of my favorite snack foods/meals. It's essentially a pack of ramen instant noodles with an Indian curry flavored sauce. Another plus is that it's completely vegetarian. When prepared according to the directions on the package the noodles wind up covered in a slightly runny sauce opposed to traditional Maruchan Ramen which when cooked according to the package's directions end up in a broth.

review/summary: Purple potato chips!
review/text: I bought this product along with the other variety (Pineapple; also reviewed) on Amazon. Never had taro before, I must say I am pleasantly surprised. It has that "the more you eat, the better it tastes" flavor. I find it a good alternative to potato chips, which are usually too greasy and too salty. I told my kid this is purple potato chips and he likes them too!

review/summary: Best Ever Dog Food*!*!*!*!*
review/text: Have been feeding Avoderm Lamb & Brown Rice to my German shepherds for many years.  Makes their coats silky and soft.  Saved the life of one of my shepherds who had open wounds, scabs, and welts from allergies of unknown cause.  Canine veterinary dermatologist/allergist could not help.  Special prescribed foods did not help.  Boiled potatoes and fish did not help.  Six weeks after starting Avoderm, my shepherd's skin problems were completely healed and have not returned in eleven years since then.  Would not ever consider buying anything else.  Amazon.com has the best price anywhere, worth the wait on shipping.  Thank you, Amazon.com, for offering this wonderful product at such a wonderful price*!*!*!*!*

review/summary: Saved my two year old  Newfie from having to be on steroids!
review/text: My Newfie developed sores and raw patches that special baths,salves, special food and medication would not help.Eventually he was in a cone with shaved hot spots that looked and must have felt just terrible. The vet said best bet was to put him on steroids. He lives in Southern Cal so already not the best environment for him. I did not want to put him on steriods due to side effects and so started researching and found Avoderm. After three weeks of Avoderm Lamb and Rice his sores were healed and his coat beautiful. I also supplement with Halshan Raw Pet food. I am so grateful for Avoderm and so is he and so is our pocketbook!

review/summary: GREAT PRICE FOR A GREAT FOOD!!!
review/text: My dog is a rescue who had mites when I adopted her as a puppy. She continued experiencing problematic skin even after the mites issue was resolved. Her former vet kept her on Rx's but I knew there had to be a better way so I went to a more holistic vet who suggested an avocado based food such as Avoderm. I discontinued all Rx's and within a week she was noticeably less itchy and has been for the past 3 years. Her coat stays lustrous even with regular swims in the ocean and baths biweekly. The food itself even looks better than other brands. When set side by side, its clear, the kibbles look cleaner and of better quality. Lastly, this price is UNBELIEVABLE!! I've been purchasing it at Pet-- which I'd found to be the cheapest ($55), only after I'd accumulated enough of their stupid coupons for spending set amounts of money but this price blows Pet-- out of the water. Coupled with Prime shipping and you can't get better. Thank you Amazon for offering a wonderful product at a great price & with Prime shipping!!!!

review/summary: Not sure of quality
review/text: These were wrapped very well, too well, to the point it was difficult to unwrap them. Luckily they were individually wrapped because one of the LEAKED and got tossed in the trash. The other did not leak but I wonder about the 'safeness'.  They were wrapped extremely well so it wasn't a wrapping problem, perhaps it's the high temperatures we've had or the ligs are just not tight. I'll try the remaining and wait a day to see if I get sick.<br /><br />There is a break-away plastic ring on the bottol lid that does allow some movement before breaking. There are no other barriers (a punch seal) once the lid is removed. Dosen't seem like a hermetic seal.<br /><br />Sold by 'Cheapees', not that that means anything.<br />They arrived quickly, delivered by Unites States Postal Service.<br /><br />I do love A1 sauce but this is too expensive when one leaks.

review/summary: Wonderful Plant
review/text: The whole reason for the interest in the fenugreek was for ingredients for cooking curry. However it is an amazing plant. Besides being a great addition to pickling spices and as a salad, the leaves are used to reduce diabetes. The seeds will help mothers produce milk. And if you don't go for herbal remedies, it does make your sweat smell like maple syrup. Hey, better than onions and garlic BO. For more info, I would suggest hitting up Wikipedia.<br /><br />These seeds were great. Seems like all of them sprouted (I planted alot) and they sprouted fast.<br /><br />For other interested gardeners, I would suggest looking into stevia, a naturally sweet plant 300 times more than sugar, with no rat poisons (aspartame) or funkified taste (sucralose). Great plant, but buy cuttings and avoid buying seeds. Seeds usually  don't produce viable plants.<br /><br />Happy Gardening!

review/summary: very diabetic friendly
review/text: &lt;-- diabetic, type 2. Sometimes I like some cinnamon and sugar in my coffee so I needed to find a tasty alternative for the sugar part. There is NO nasty after taste and it tastes just I put cinnamon and SUGAR, not sugar sub, in it. I like to put it in my coffee mug or travel container before I pour in my coffee. It tends to help it mix in really good and if I'm in a hurry where every second counts, putting this in first gets mixed pretty good and saves me a little time. This is the 2nd bottle of this I have purchased since March I think and I plan to continue buying this for years to come. Even once I loose my weight and am no longer a diabetic, it's that good.

review/summary: This Stuff Is Great!
review/text: A while back, I ordered one of each of every tea-tree foot/body powder I could find, to try them all out. I was looking for a natural alternative to the various anti-fungal medicated powders I'd been using for athletes-foot and jock-itch.<br /><br />On first glance I was unimpressed by this product. It's rather plain looking, and the label is even kinda wrinkled up like it was badly glued onto the cardboard tube.<br />HOWEVER, after evaluating all of the powders, this one is BY FAR my favorite one!<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice is that it doesn't poof clouds of powder everywhere. Secondly, it has a pleasant tea-tree oil scent - not too strong - just right. It does an excellent job of cooling, relieving itch, and healing and preventing chafing.<br /><br />It is labeled as foot powder, and it does that job well, but it's great for an allover body powder - not too strong even for the "sensitive" areas!

review/text: Rich lemon flavor.  This extract makes it easy to add that flavor you get from lemon zest when you don't have fresh lemons around.  I've used this in a lemon cake and a batch of sweet rolls, both of which turned out great.  The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the lids on the bottles seem to be a bit brittle -- one of the 4 lids cracked in shipping, and another after the first time I used it (maybe damaged in shipping as well?).

review/summary: Kiwi Strawberry That Sparkles
review/text: I am a fan of sparkling water and this is one of my favorite sparkling waters. Sparkling Ice has a great product line, the water has Vitamin B3, B5, B6, B12 and D3. Plus it has zero calories. The taste is kind of soft drink like more than natural but it is naturally flavored according to Sparkling ICE. It is sweeter than other sparkling waters but it not overly sweet in my opinion. Amazon's price and being eligible for free shipping makes it a great deal. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because it goes flat too fast in my opinion. It is better if you drink the bottle in one sitting. It is  also sweetened with Splenda, if it were sweetened with a natural sweetener it would get 5 stars despite not being able to get through a Veronica Mars episode without my drink going flat.

review/summary: Not So Much
review/text: My husband and I love the Sparkling Ice line and have by now tried all the flavors but Pomegranate (see my other reviews).  I have to say that Kiwi Strawberry, tasting of neither kiwi nor strawberry, is my least favorite (I much prefer Diet Snapple's version of that flavor though I don't drink it when I'm dieting because it does have some calories).  My husband, though, doesn't mind it, so I'm pawning all those off on him while I glom the Orange Mango and Pink Grapefruit and the occasional Raspberry, though that's a bit sweet for me; he loves it. We also tried the Lemon Lime, which came in the 18-bottle assortment, and although I liked it I think it's going to be lots better as a mixer with vodka or tequila...can't wait till summer!<br /><br />I'd like to emphasize, though, that it's the Kiwi Strawberry flavor, not the product line, that I'm not crazy about. I'm thrilled with Sparkling Ice in general.

review/summary: Absolutely LOVE these drinks!
review/text: I can't buy enough of these at Kroger's and HEB. The kiwi-strawberry and orange are my favorites out of the bunch. Sparking ICE drinks are great for us carbonation junkies but don't necessarily want to keep pumping 150+ calories, 30-40 g of sugar, and 60-80 mg of caffeine per soda can/bottle. There are some I don't like. The lemon-lime, lemonade and grapefruit don't taste very good but that's largely personal preference against those flavors. An added bonus are the trace amounts of vitamins and green tea extract you get per bottle. The best of all worlds when you need something carbonated, but don't want all the other garbage in sodas :). I've tried a ton of the zero calorie sodas and with the exception of Sprite Zero (which loses a significant amount of taste after a few sips), there's nothing quite like these Sparking Ice drinks.

review/summary: Refreshing and Versatile for Kids and Adults
review/text: The Kiwi Strawberry flavor of "Sparkling ICE Spring Water" is my favorite flavor from this group of products! "Sparkling ICE Spring Water" comes in a variety of flavors but can be hard to find! I was delighted to find it on Amazon by the 12 pack and available as a recurring purchase on auto-delivery.<br /><br />As it's name says, it is a "sparkling" water and I prefer it over ice. While tasty and refreshing as a stand-alone beverage at any time of the day, it also mixes well with flavored liqueurs (especially Kiwi) or other adult beverages and compliments food of many types.<br /><br />Whether being served in it's 'natural' state for kids or 'spiked' for adults, it's great color and sparkling style looks "dressed-up" in specialty stemware and can help make a simple meal special.

My college age daughter drinks it by the cases, she does not drink sodas but loves this drink. She puts it in the freezer to get a bit slushy n it's her drink of choice. I order six cases n have them sent to her each month at UT.

review/summary: Good, too!
review/text: You might have seen my reviews on three ICE flavors. This one is good. It has less bite than the pink grapefruit, but it's not overly sweet like the pineapple and coconut. I'd consider it a light taste, in the middle of the grapefruit and pineapple. There's no "diet drink" aftertaste with this flavor, either. I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything, like sugar, with the ICE drinks.

review/summary: Love Sparkling ICE Brand (Stay away if you're sensitive to Splenda)
review/text: The Sparkling ICE line up are all extremely addicting, this one included. I love that they are all flavorful, calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, caffeine free), and carbonated. I used to have periodic cravings for one of my husband's cokes and always hated myself for giving in. I always thought it was the sugar I was craving until I tried these a year ago and realized that it's actually the carbonation I would crave. These are a guilt-free way of feeding those cravings.<br /><br />The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.<br /><br />The Kiwi Strawberry flavor isn't one of my absolute favorites (that goes to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P00PGQ">Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FUL4AE">TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>) but it is delicious all the same. It's probably the sweetest out of all the flavors though so when I have a bunch of flavors to choose from, I don't reach for it as often.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs." Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: Having spent 20 years working on the Pacific Rim I can state that Indonesian fried rice is far and away the best fried rice that you can get.  In most places fried rice is just a way to use up leftovers.  In Indonsia fried rice is an art form called Nasi Goreng.  Nasi=Rice  Goreng=Fried  Istimewa=Special which means that there is a fried egg on top.  Nasi goreng istimewa is usually served with Satay which is BBQ'd meat on a stick.  The ABC brand Kecap Manis (sweet soy sauce) is a key ingredient in the fried rice.  It is also the BBQ sauce that is used to make the Satay.  This is wonderful stuff and is a common table item in Indonesia.  It is a fine addition to many meats and vegetables either during the cooking stage or added at the table.

No supermarket in my area carried this product and I probably could have gotten it at one of the Asian markets in the city, but ordering it seemed a sure thing.  The bottle is huge;  I will have to will it to my children upon my demise as I will never use it up, hence the 4 star rating.  It really is very good, much sweeter and thicker than regular soy sauce. If a recipe calls for this ingredient, get it and don't substitute soy sauce...the taste and texture is very different.

review/text: Two stars is generous for this item's DESCRIPTION. I (and apparently MANY others) cannot find the details of what exactly one is purchasing here. The title is pretty clear "1 piece" which obviously is a misrepresentation, since no one in his right mind would want a 4 lb single cow ear (imagine what the size of the manure pie from THAT cow would look like!!!). I know Merrick is a reputable company, so I don't understand why Amazon has not demanded a detailed description of what is being purchased from them. According to some of the reviewers, they really did get just a single ear in a big box, and that's just ludicrous. Can we get this straightened out once and for all?

I paid $8.64 for each item & order 2.  The website said the list price is $39.95. And today, the day they arrived, the Amazon price has nearly doubled to $16.29 each.  But all I got was TWO COW EARS--not 2 boxes.  One was about 7" long, the other was 3.5".  They came packed in a box that was 16"x21"x26" full of Kraft paper.  And on the bottom--2 cow ears!!<br /><br />Another Amazon listing for Merrick cow ears offers 12 cow ears for $18.99 and gives the list price for the 12 as $199.50--is some one delusional?  I am returning the 2 cow ears in the box they came in at Amazon expense--and would tell every one not to buy this product--and I would question buying the 12 ears for $18.99--even though they are apparently worth $16.67 each ($199.99 divided by 12) or about today's price for each cow ear listed here ($16.29 each).

She will chew on it until there is nothing left but when it comes for potty time her stools are totally loose.<br /><br />It took a little while to realize what was up and after a visit to the vet he asked if i was doing anything different, changed her food suddenly, odd/different behavioral issues, picking and eating stuff from the floor, feeding from the table, etc....And since we ruled all that out i started monitoring it until i figured out it was these raw hides.<br /><br />We are both heartbroken but health is more important than anything else for me. I am not saying there is anything wrong with this product because i honestly don't believe there is but Labrador Retrievers are known for their sensitive stomachs and that is all.<br /><br />I would definitely have bought these again if my little girl wouldn't have had an issue with them. I will definitely recommend them!

review/text: My Catahoula Leopard Dogs love these. I like the fact that they are a product of TEXAS. My dogs also eat the canned Merrick food. This is a high quality product. More importantly this is a product produced in the great USA by a family in the 1980's. Let's all give the little guy the Entrepreneur's of our great country the first of everything we purchase. 5*****stars!

review/text: Great product for the busy dog.  Good for their teeth, and they don't swell when wet like rawhide products.  They arrive individually wrapped which seems to keep the  dirt and bugs off.
