review/summary: buy it cheaper directly from the store
review/text: This product isn't bad if you don't mind the sweetness of stevia. There is something just slightly off with the flavor tho--maybe it needs more citric acid or something to offset the overt sweetness. But buy it direct from Target--its much cheaper.

review/summary: Tastes Good on Popcorn.
review/text: Kernel Season's are a good choice for sprinkling over hot air popcorn.  The Nacho cheese is one of the better flavors.  If you really want a tastely cheese topping for hot air popcorn try the Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning by Reese.  Also, the Kernel Seasons are cheaper at Marc's.

review/text: I love this flavor and "cheese" lovers will be delighted.<br /><br />In an effort to lose weight and get away from potato chips I air pop popcorn and use this and Pam Butter spray to season it. It's great, good source of fiber and has few fat grams or calories. If you are a muncher, as I am, this is a good way to have your munch and lose weight at the same time.

review/text: This is one of our favorite flavors from Kernel Seasons.  The other favorites are BBQ and Ranch.<br /><br />This one is a bit strong, so you can be a little bit more conservative with it than some of the others.  Quite tasty, though!  You can usually find these at your local grocery stores, but the six packs at Amazon are a better deal if you order enough to get the free shipping.

It's one of my favorite very low-cal snacks.

review/summary: Strong flavor, great on popcorn
review/text: I purchased this because I'm trying to get out of the habit of using real butter on my popcorn. I was going to purchase the butter flavor but wanted to try nacho cheese because it sounded like a stronger flavor. I've used this 5 or 6 times now and I really like it. I also add nutritional yeast for added nutrition but this seasoning makes my popcorn taste delicious and unhealthy (even though the seasoning is low-calorie). You will have to use something to make it stick to the popcorn (I've been using cooking spray-not the greatest). The one drawback for me is that it tastes very salty. The saltiness might be a positive for some people who add a ton of salt to popcorn anyway but I wish it was just a little less salty. I will probably try the other flavors at some point too.

review/text: None of the Kernel Season' s Popcorn seasonings stick to popcorn. ALL the flavors taste great, I think we have tried all of them. BUT you end up using tooooooooo much and it stays at the bottom of the popcorn bowl. For some reason even trying various brands of popcorn these seasonings do NOT stay on the actual popcorn.

The flavoring is very nice, not to strong, and not to weak.  I sprinkly it on as the popcorn is being popped.  For a small container it last pretty long as well.  We dump alot on to our popcorn and one container last us about a month of eating popcorn almost every night.  I love the nacho cheddar flavor so much I'm going to try another flavor next time.  Super happy with my purchase.

review/summary: Should be called cheese salt
review/text: This is not cheese to sprinkle on popcorn.  This is cheese salt. If you are looking for that cheese popcorn that turns your fingers orange, this isn't it.  Add that much of this product and you'll end up with very salty popcorn you can't eat.<br /><br />Retail stores offer very few popcorn topping products, but you can find this Nacho Cheddar flavor and many other flavors locally.  Try dog/bullseye and rollback where it's only $1.99.  The internet has a ton of products, but you are either going to pay dearly for one bottle of something, pay outrageous shipping, or have to buy in bulk and possibly be stuck with 6 bottles of something you don't like.<br /><br />So know what you are buying if you order this product. Check your local bullseye or rollback first.  You can try many different flavors without buying in bulk, yet pay roughly the same price as if you did.

review/text: I air pop popcorn and mist with pam spray as it comes out, then toss and coat with this wonderful product.  In 2 1/2 cups it has about 65 calories.  Don't drench in Pam, just mist lightly.  I like this flavor better than white cheddar or kettle so far.  Those are the ones I've tried.  Jalapeno is on its way!  If you don't want to spray your popcorn with an oil product of some type, this probably wouldn't stick to the popcorn very well and would not be worth it.  BUT OH MY, WE LOVE IT!

review/text: I had wanted the Kraft Mac 'n Cheese Topper but my local grocery store did not have it.  So I decided to try this one, and was sorely disappointed.  My 4 and 6 year old girls also did not like the Kernel Season's seasoning and prefer the other one.  My 4 year old actually said "Can I have the cheese in the blue thing?"  The Kraft cheese topping tastes more like real cheese, and whereas the KS seasoning is a much finer powder that has an odd taste to it -- we use the topping mostly for popcorn, but since the KS tastes odd, my girls will take plain popcorn over popcorn flavored with this.  However, I lucked out and found that Amazon carries the Kraft cheese toppingg and got it on sale.  Cannot beat the deal.  Amazon is awesome!

review/text: Tuna is easily one of my favorite lunch options. Not only is it healthy, but depending on what you add to it, it can be quite versatile. That's part of what I like about the Lunch to Go meals- you get a plain pack of tuna to flavor as you see fit rather than a pre-packaged tuna salad like you get with Bumblebee or Chicken of the Sea.<br /><br />Nutritional-wise, this product is great. At only 240 calories for the entire package, it won't break your diet & there's enough in here that most people will feel satisfied. There's a little more salt than I'd like, but it isn't too over the top. The tuna itself only contributes 300 mg, so if you want to go "au naturel" with the tuna & crackers you can avoid some of the sodium by cutting out the relish & mayo.<br /><br />Taste-wise, I love Starkist tuna. It's always consistently good & I've yet to open a bad pack of tuna with these meals. (Hey, sometimes bad tuna happens if you get a pack that has too much air in it or was improperly sealed.) I like that the meal comes with a napkin & mint as well- it makes for a truly self-contained dish, so if I'm far from civilization or have one of those "eat in my car in a parking lot" moments (we've all had them), I know I'll have a napkin & a mint with me.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps me from making this a staple is the price, which at my local stores is always higher than the cheaper alternatives such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030CYIRQ">Bumble Bee Tuna Salad Kits</a>. (Especially if I want to get the albacore!) Still, this is what I'll get if I have the money for it.

I recently bought an entire box of PowerBar Gels to train for a marathon in January and I can't see myself ever switching.  Here are the pros/cons:<br /><br />PowerBar PROS<br /> * thinner consistency which makes it easier to swallow<br /> * great taste - I have the Strawberry/Banana and found them to be the best tasting gel I ever had yet. 9.5 out of 10<br /> * easy to open - the packaging is very easy to open, even with sweaty hands during a run<br /><br />PowerBar CONS<br /> * haven't been able to come up with one yet<br /><br />Clif Bar PROS<br /> * Litter Leash on side of package to keep from ripping the top off.  Keeps the entire package in one piece to prevent littering.<br /> * Overall I can't complaining about the taste.  8 out of 10<br /><br />Clif Bar CONS<br /> * Hard to open - these Gels are almost impossible to open once your hands get wet.<br /> * Thick consistency - these Gels get thicker in cold weather and become very hard to swallow.  Plus the gel itself is a bit more powdery (Chocolate) then PowerBar.

review/summary: Buy Gu.
review/text: I must preface this review with: I am a Gu fan. I've tried so many different brands, flavors, and types of gels/blocks/cubes, whatever, and I love Gu to get the job done. For PowerBar, I've tried the Vanilla, which is really delicious. It tastes like cake frosting! However, the vanilla does not have caffeine, so this does not fill my needs. I have tried the Double Latte, which I abhor--I thought it was AWFUL. It just stuck to my teeth and wouldn't go down, and yuck yuck yuck. I love coffee, too. But as a liquid, in a mug! :) I have heard from many runners that they enjoy the Green Apple, so I might try these in the future. The PowerBar brand is a thinner consistency than Gu or Clif, so sometimes I think it goes down a lot easier, especially if you're not near a water fountain or aid station. If the vanilla had caffeine, I would probably stick with that one. I couldn't run the distances I do without gels. I take one on a daily run of 7-8 miles, I'll take 2 gels on a weekend run of 14-16 miles, and I'll take 3 on a run longer than 20 miles (in addition to Clif Bars). I hope this helps someone make a gel decision!<br /><br />Oh, in addition, I want to point out that PowerBar gels are made in a facility that manufactures dairy products, whereas Gu does not. I hope this helps the allergy sufferers out there!

review/summary: Best tasting caffeinated gel. Flimsy on a bike.
review/text: If form factor was not a concern, the tangerine PowerBar Gel would be hands down my favorite all around gel. The taste is great, it packs enough caffeine to pick you up if you're about to bonk, and the wrapper is thin enough so that it is easy to squeeze out every last drop of gel from the wrapper. The thin, low profile wrapper is great if you put gels in your pocket, as most exercise clothing is thin and low on space. It's also less likely to poke you than other rigid gel packages.<br /><br />That said, if you tape gels to your bike frame like I do, the thin wrapper that works so well for squeezing works against you if you want them to stay flush on the bike frame. They end up sagging over the side of the bike which not only can be an aerodynamic issue (okay, maybe not a major concern for everyone), but the added stress on the side of the package ends up prematurely tearing the gel open. I haven't actually experienced the wrapper leaking on my bike yet, but I have noticed the beginnings of a tear on the wrapper.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you don't tape gels to you bike post, the tangerine PowerBar gels rock. If you do, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFW9RM">Hammer Energy Gel (12 pack)</a> instead (but Hammer Gels are a little more difficult to squeeze and get the gel out, and have a thicker texture).

I think the benefit comes mainly from the sugar, but I do tend to buy the flavors with 25mg of caffine.  In general I give PowerGel 4 to 5 stars, but I'm giving the Tangerine flavor two stars because I didn't like the taste.  All the other flavors are much better.

Like most gels this has all the clean burning fuel one needs for a quick boost pre-ride or, most importantly, during an endurance experience.  The taste is great, but what I like most of all is the texture...not at solid as the others so it goes down much easier, especially when one is gasping and grasping for breath and water bottle to wash it down.  It feels more organic and easier on the gut also.  It's the best I've found.

review/text: I used them when training for my first marathon and took them every 30-45 minutes on my long runs. I felt great. They have a good taste too, like eating strawberry banana yogurt. They really kept me going. I definitely recommend them.

review/summary: The Anti-Fatigue
review/text: This is a fantastic product.  I'm relatively new to long distance running (my long runs are only 10k) and this is the first gel product I've used, but it did not disappoint.<br /><br />It's hard to credit my gains solely to this, so I will give a wrap-up of my experience and let you decide.  The first time I ran 10k, I had a time of 55:25 (I know that's slow, but I'm a bigger guy).  The second time I tried it, there were a few differences: I wore running shorts (the first time I wore basketball shorts) and I had a fuel belt equipped with a 20oz water bottle and two Strawberry Banana PowerBar Power Gel Packets; temperature and environment were similar during both runs.  Anyway, I popped these gel packs at around the 20 minute and 40 minute mark and my time dropped to 52:21!  I don't know about you, but I think an improvement of over 3 minutes is fantastic...  Especially if you consider that is nearly 30 seconds per mile.<br /><br />Okay, so I know the shorts (they were quite a bit lighter and didn't get soaked with sweat) and liquid helped quite a bit, as well as my muscles being a little more broken in from the first time I tried 10k, but the biggest thing I noticed was my consistency.  My third mile on my first run was a horrific 9:37 and way off the rest of my mile times.  During my second run, each mile ranged from around 8:17 (my 5th mile) to 8:37 (my first mile); I think the fact that my mile times improved as my run went on also illustrates the effectiveness of this product.  I track my time and distance with a Garmin Forerunner 205 (another fantastic product).<br /><br />Anyway, I highly suggest this product if you are new to long distance running or a veteran that competes.  If you dont' want to commit to an entire box, I bought a couple of individual packets at REI for $1.25 a piece just to see if I noticed an improvement.  Compared to the other reviews, I don't think this is hard to swallow at all.  If you spray a little water in your mouth before consuming the packet, it goes down even easier.  My one and only con would be that it is kind of sticky, so if you get any on your hands it's quite annoying; small price to pay in my eyes.

review/summary: Nice flavor and viscosity
review/text: I like PowerBar gel more than most other brands, mainly because of the viscosity/consistency. Competing brands like Gu are way too thick for eating on a run I think - especially in cold weather. The formulation I think could use improvement - it's a little sugary for me, and my stomach feels a little upset after consuming 3 or more on a long run, but it's not too bad (I don't know of anything better at the moment).<br /><br />The Banana strawberry flavor is one of the best, and has just the right of caffeine (1 shot), if you're looking to consume many during a long run.  Vanilla (no caffeine) and Tangerine (2 shots caffeine) are also among my favorites as well.<br /><br />Product came very quickly; I'm happy with the purchase.

review/summary: My goto fuel source for endurance training
review/text: I've tried a number of different gel brands and flavors as well as other energy products and found the Powerbar Tangerines to be my favorite.  Here's why I like them:<br /><br />- Flavor - The tangerine isn't too sweet and doesn't leave a bad aftertaste.<br />- Consistency - The gel isn't too thick so it's easy to get down even with a dry mouth.  I still suggest chasing with fluids.<br />- Caffeine - There's just enough to help get me over the hump on those tough days.<br /><br />This 24 pack is a great deal if you are training for marathons or other endurance races and plan on multi hour training sessions.<br /><br />See you on the trails!

review/summary: Not Yummy, Package Reacts in Mouth
review/text: I have been cycling a few hours in the heat on weekends, and using this type supplement to get what I need while riding, so I bought a case of the Tangerine with Caffeine. I have to say they seem to do the job and give me what I need, and the boost from the caffeine works as desired. The problem I have with the product is the taste is pretty bad, like concentrated children's aspirin. Also, the container/package seems to react with the my teeth or fillings, like having a battery on your tongue. So, basically consuming these is not pleasant, and I dread having to do it (like taking medicine). So, I will stick with the main competitor in this marketplace "Gu", which taste great.

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: I use before and during long rides. I prefer the PowerBar in part because it has 110 calories, not just 100 or 90 like some of the other brands, and at 20 mphs I want to get as much as I can when going thru the hassle of opening and consuming a gel. As to the effect: It seems to work as intended. Certainly gives me a bit of energy when I start to sag.  I've also used Gu and Hammer, and don't have any complaints about them other than much fewer calories per package. Suggest you try a few of each to come to your own conclusions.

review/summary: Packaging makes it unusable
review/text: I received the above product with 3 of the 24  units already leaking heavily. I figured that they burst in transit. No big deal, right? However, while cleaning the rest of the units I noticed, that with gentle pressure the seams were leaking very easily. One that didn't leak I took for a run......that burst in my pocket...no pressure applied as far as I could tell. Contacted the seller, they told me that "this happens". Wrote PowerBar more than a week ago, no response.  I will not be buying them again.<br />That being said, I was able to try 2 units. I love the stuff. The gel is thin enough to slide down a dry throat on a hot day. The taste isn't that bad, the citrus helps you salivate a bit to help it down. If it weren't for the poor packaging and horrible customer service, these would be my go to gels.

review/text: This product can be purchased anywhere and in a pinch whereas products like Gu have to be purchased at specialty stores. The other product works a bit better for me at keeping my energy level where it needs to be...that is not to even remotely say that this is bad because it's not. Also it tastes better than most(if you've ever used any of these energy gels during an intense workout you know they are all 1 step away from unpalatable). One of the packets had broken open in the box (it wasn't the shippers fault...the outer and inner boxes were in pristine condition) and dried causing all of the other packets to stick to the inside of the box. What a mess! I had to soak the box in water to get the packets loose, which also makes them more difficult to store. I'll go through them fairly rapidly, and the other box I received was in perfect condition.

I prefer the jolt of caffeine, but you can get these with less if you prefer.

Since I require supplementation every 6 miles or so, I like something that provides long-lasting energy and tastes decent, and this gel does both.  The taste is orangy with an undertone of caramel, which may sound a bit strange, but it's actually pretty good.  I'll buy this again.

review/summary: Can Cause Stomach Upset
review/text: The directions state that water should be consumed with this gel, so I consumed 4-6 oz of water with each gel. On some 10 to 24 mile marathon training runs I noticed only slight gastrointestinal problems, but on others real cramps and diaria were a severe problem. The common variable during the bad runs(no pun intended)was cold, rainy weather which drasticly reduced my sweat rate. Normal gel ingestion rate is one every half hour. At 75 years old my 24 mile run lasts around 4 hours or 7 gels. That is a lot of sodium even on a hot day. Next run is 16 miles and will also be cold and probably wet. I will try one gel every 45 to 60 minutes. THe next marathon is in 2 weeks so no chance to experiment with another gel. During 7 other marathons I used another gel with no upset and may go back to that gel if problems persist. This powerbar gel is easier to swallow(not as thick and gooey)and very close to the same ingrediants as the other gel, so<br />gave it a try.

The taste is exactly as you would imagine if you mixed strawberry jelly with artificial banana flavor and added a bunch of salt.<br /><br />Which leads to often, a pack of warm sweet and salty goo.<br /><br />While appealing to some, it never ended up appealing to me, as such I still have most of the box in the drawer which it will probably stay.

review/summary: Very tasty and very performance enhancing
review/text: I was very hesitant to try energy gels.  Many energy bars and gels have a bad taste.  I am training for my first half marathon, however, and often suffer from "brain fog" during the long runs.  I took my first gel before a shorter run and found it to be very tasty.  I thought that the gel was sweet and not salty tasting (which was perfect to me!).  I also felt a real increase in my energy and noticed I was running easier and faster.  I plan to use these during my training and then on race day.  I would recommend this energy gel!

review/summary: Easier to carry than to open, tangy flavor, strong caffeine
review/text: So far I have only tried this gel on bike rides. Convenient if you run out of sports drink before you run out of water. The tangy flavor made the gel easier to swallow.<br /><br />The packaging on this gel seems to be either thinner or more flexible than some others I have tried. Good because it is not scratchy in the back pocket of a jersey. Hard to tear the top off without losing it while riding, however. I had to stop to avoid littering.<br /><br />Double caffeine is perhaps too much if you take more than one gel. Again, depends on your reaction, though. (I get above average stimulation from caffeine.)

That and the price at our local bike shop was $1.27. So not only was this convenient - free shipping with two boxes (no gas expense) - it was only $1.00 per packet. Now I have enough for 6 months when his braces come off. SWIM FAST!

review/summary: product good, shipment arrived damaged
review/text: This product arrived 24 packs in a box. Two packs had leaks which caused a big mess upon opening. The damaged packs were identified and discarded. The clean up required gallons of water as the sticky gel surrounding most of the packs had to be washed thoroughly. I cannot imagine how the damaged packs could have been opened enroute, so the shipment must have left the dealer broken. Lesson learned, never buy bulk through the mail. It is too tempting for a unscrupulous dealer to unload damaged goods. So I saved nothing over retail cost by buying from this source. BTW: The gel taste great, that's why I gave it 3 stars.

review/summary: Not sure I'm using this gel to its full potential; easy to use and carry
review/text: I'm still learning how (or whether) to use these gels in training or racing.  I just downed a PowerBar Gel (strawberry-banana, 1X caffeine) following a 10K race plus an extra 4 mile training run.  I do forget the exercise physiology here... am I supposed to use DURING the run, before, or after?  I've got a half marathon coming up next week, so I'm most concerned about injury and cramp prevention at this stage.  But I've also got a 188 mile team race coming up, where I have to run 3 stages.  Last year, I used this gel between my segments (plus peanut butter sandwiches and gobs of fluids).<br /><br />Here's what I know.  This PowerBar Gel is easy to consume (even the green apple flavor... you won't treat it as a candy).  I haven't had any leakage problems yet, and it is easy to use: squeeze and swallow.  However, I really can't tease out any real benefits due to the product, or whether I'm experiencing a placebo effect.  In fact, I wonder whether you have to be a very fine athlete, pushing your body to the limits, for there even to be a measurable effect.<br /><br />In other words, are these gels just adult pacifiers?<br /><br />Well, I probably need all the help I can get.  I'm not sure about the 0, 1X, or 2X caffeine content.  The caffeine can't be for recovery, can it?  So it is a minor, legal stimulant?<br /><br />As long as I can get these for about a dollar per unit, the taste isn't bad, and they don't break and leak, I'll keep using them.  Helpful comments, observations, and use instructions welcomed!

review/summary: Taste reminds me of black coffee
review/text: The Tangerine doesn't taste good at all, haven't tried other flavors. I suspect they got the caffeine from coffee, not tea. Almost seemed like a black coffee taste. Some people who are sensitive to coffee might then get a stomach ache. I even tried adding sugar to it and it was still bad. Maybe the other flavors are okay since many don't have caffeine. FYI, it only has a little more caffeine then a 20 oz Coke does, try the shots if you want more.
