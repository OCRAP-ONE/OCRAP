review/summary: OK tea on demand
review/text: If ou don't have the patience or care how your tea tastes, these capsules will work fine.  However, you can get the same effect by putting a tea bag in your Keurig.  PG Tips bags make a nice stout cup even in a Keurig.  Me?  I favor boiling water and steeping for five minutes in a pot.  Wife and son are fine with the Keurig brew.

review/summary: Great for Hot or Iced Tea
review/text: I've tried a number of tea brands in my Keurig, and the Twinings English Breakfast tea by far provides the best flavor for a black tea. The tea has a very mild citrus flavor and has a smooth less bitter finish than many other teas. I drink several glasses of iced tea and the twinings k-cups are perfect for brewing over a glass of ice. I add sugar or artificial sweetener to the glass before brewing which makes it dissolve faster. Simply great tea.

review/summary: Great Choice
review/text: Up to the arrival of our third cat, I had always been sold on Wellness brand products. They were pricey, sure, but I got the guarantee of human-grade meats and careful production that tends to be sloppily handled by lower-end brands and producers. However, it soon became clear that, between the dog's food and my cats', we were rapidly reaching an untenable position in terms of financing the food bill. I needed to find something a bit more cost effective, and Solid Gold was the answer.<br /><br />I had seen the packaging in stores before, and it was always a "maybe next time" afterthought as I hauled another big bag of food to the register. The somewhat gaudy purple packaging (for some reason they have a picture of Indigo Moon) had always turned me away in favor of the more muted tones of several other companies. But, no longer having those options available, I finally gave the brand serious consideration. The ingredient list is pretty good, primarily chicken meal, lamb, and barley. I'll hardly say this is ideal--barley is believed to possibly be an allergen, dry foods' carbohydrate levels are almost as a rule too high for our specialized carnivore friends, and there is a small faction of people who believe meat meals to be of inferior quality--but at the same time, it stacked up pretty well pound to pound with my old foods, and with a similar ingredient list. It was also notably cheaper, however. I bought it, and my cats were immediately made fans. My male cat is much pickier than his female companion, but he was more than happy to chow down.<br /><br />**I was going to leave the review as stated, but I have found out something that may be troubling to fellow pet owners. Solid Gold apparently lets its production be handled by Diamond, which, as I'm sure you know, has had multiple screw ups over the years, including the salmonella outbreak in their Taste of the Wild dog foods. I'm letting my review stand as is as I haven't had any problems healthwise with either myself or my pets, but if you are a person who boycotts food produced by Diamond, then you may want to look elsewhere. When money perks back up, I might do so.

I mixed their current food with this just as I did with the other. Maybe I switched them to this too quickly after trying the CSS. Oh well, I am not going to try this again unless I have to.

I'm actually on the phone now with Amazon to resolve the issue.<br />I can't attest to the Katz-N-Flocken because I didn't feed it to my cats.  It contains a lot of "junk", like rice, and barley, which are known to cause food allergies amongst cats, as well as "meal" type of stuff, which is just ground up junk.  If you can afford it, please feed your cat whole meat, and not "meal".  That's why I am upset they send me this junk instead of the Indigo Moon.

review/summary: Strangely addictive
review/text: I had purchased Eden's umeboshi because I'd long heard of its positive health benefits. I suffer from chronic heartburn, so I thought maybe these would help. Odd that something that initially tastes like pouring salt into your mouth could somehow benefit digestion, but it does actually help a bit. Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating that you discard your heartburn/antacid pills...but my stomach does seem to settle after eating one of these plums. The packaging is excellent, as always, and both packs arrived with not a spill in sight. I believe Eden did change its policy on the number of plums per package though, as I had quite a few in each pack...I'd say more than 20 per carton for sure. On top was a little wad of shiso leaves, which gave it a lot of visual appeal. The plums were moist but not lying in a lot of juice, which I liked b/c I'd had plums packed in the pickling juices, and they were extremely mushy and fell apart. These had a nice and firm skin, though you could tell the insides were a paste-like texture from the feel of them. Initially, you really can't taste anything other than the salt. Very, very salty...which is proper for this type of food. However, after a few days, I noticed the actual taste of the umeboshi and shiso. Those first few I pitted by hand and choked down as quickly as possible, but now I find myself leisurely sucking on the plum and savoring the flavors before extruding the pits. I don't eat more than one a day because of the salt content, and I don't really like it on rice, but it tastes fantastic on its own and is truly great on corn on the cob. Squeeze a little out and rub on the corn, and it gives it a sweet/sour taste that's a low cal substitute for the slathering of butter I previously used. As soon as this last pack is done, I definitely plan on buying more.

review/summary: A Healing Drink
review/text: During a period in my life, when my health was poor, I was introduced to the Macrobiotic Way of Life. One of the healing drinks includes the use of Umeboshi Plums. Salty and different from anything I'd ever tasted, I was almost afraid to try them. The drink includes, 1/2 of an Umeboshi plum, (there is a pit which you use the following day along with the other half of the plum), 1/2 teaspoon of Kuzu Root, in 10 oz. of water. Chop the plum into small pieces, add a few drops of Shoyu Soy Sauce and bring it to a slow simmer. Keep it on low, stirring constantly until the water turns from a milky white to opaque. Pour into a coffee cup and drink like a tea. This drink balances the body and strengthens the entire digestive system. It cleanses the blood. It is to be drunk only once a day, in the morning on an empty stomach. This, along with a vegan diet helps to heal many blood disorders. I would suggest also reading, The Macrobiotic Way, by Michio Kushi to understand the principles of the diet.<br /><br />As a diabetic, this drink became extremely important to me. It lowers my blood sugars dramatically. I have reduced my need for insulin to less than half of what I was using. Consider using them if you want to reduce blood sugar readings, or simply cleanse the blood. They are somewhat expensive. However, there are enough plums to last more than a month.

review/text: I ordered these because my acupuncturist said they were great for promoting healthy digestion - and after only two days of eating them, I can say that they do seem to be helping.  The reason I'm giving them a three star review is because of the packaging.  It arrived squished and leaking - despite the sealed plastic cartons and an additional sealed plastic bag, they had leaked through the box itself.  It is also hard to distinquish how many plums I got because they were so squashed together in the containers.  I've become an Umeboshi plum convert, but I'm going to try to find them at a local Asian store rather than ordering them online when they can get so battered and messy.

review/summary: Not a good rendition
review/text: I fell in love with the taste of umeboshi plums in Japan, not knowing that they were supposed to have health benefits.  They are delicious, but a bit of an acquired taste.  When I saw the reviews, it seemed like most of the negative reviews were from people who had purchased them for the health benefits without ever tasting an umeboshi plum.  I assumed that they did not like them because they are an acquired taste.<br /><br />I was wrong.  These plums are not sour, are too salty, and lack the haunting umeboshi flavor.  I would buy them from an Asian grocery store instead.  I went to a local Korean grocery store and was able to get ones that weren't quite as good as some that I had in Japan, but were still tasty.

review/summary: No plum taste, just full of salt
review/text: This is very cheaply created Umeboshi and no true taste. It has uncured runny meat, just full of salt. Obviously it was not sundry - typically at least for 7 days which will shrink the meat more compact and has to be cured for 6 month or more with each shiso-wrapped in ceramic barrel. That's the way it's done in true Japanese Umeboshi which bring out great Sour flavor in the first bite as well as true health benefit of Umeboshi and will not have the taste of salt.<br />My family or many of people who really know how to make Umeboshi in Japan, will cure Umeboshi for at least one year and some are up to seven years. You only eat the one from the prior year harvest not from the same year harvest.<br />Most of health benefit of Umeboshi can only be true in well cured Umeboshi of 6 month minimum, otherwise you get the symptom of uneasy, queasy stomach taste. Normally children are advised not to have more than one Umeboshi for this reason.<br />Hope Eden people rework on how to make Umeboshi properly.

review/text: I can't give  this product a rating as I am so sorry I ordered 2 packages.  I can't get through one package even, it is so salty it is hard to eat one of the plums. There is 520 mg of sodium in one plum. I don't know if they showed this information or not. Just be sure you know before you buy.  My body is very acidic and I heard they would raise your PH which I have tried very hard to do and have had no success, finally thought this might work.  No luck!

review/summary: The Marriage of Sweden and India
review/text: Cardamom is the essential spice in Swedish sweet breads and pastries; without cardamom, a Danish pastry is just a Missouri sticky-bun filled with jam. Adventurous Swedish cooks - both of us - also use cardamom in fruit glazes for roast chicken.<br /><br />But cardamom is quintessentially an Indian spice, one of those that Vasco da Gamba and Cristoforo Colon sailed over the edge of the world for. It's included in most "garam masala" spice blends. It's also one of the prominent flavors in 'tom ka gai', the Thai chicken-coconut soup. Indian shoppers in San Francisco buy it in one-pound sacks or larger. Some Indian people, especially older men, chew cardamom like candy or gum, to improve their breath and their amative fervor. Cardamom ice cream is rapidly becoming popular in Cambridge, Masssachusetts, as well as in the SF Bay Area. Coffee drinkers from Austria to Afghanistan, and especially in Turkey and Lebanon, often flavor their beloved drink with cardamom. Chocolate and cardamom also blend well; adventurous Mexican cooks - me - sometimes add cardamom to 'mole poblano', the chocolate-chili gravy used with turkey and chicken.<br /><br />Once ground, cardamom loses its flavor very quickly; a small bottle of cardamom powder is convenient but should be used within two weeks at most. Serious cardamom-lovers buy it whole, in the pod, and grind the small black seeds as needed, in a 'dedicated' coffee mill or with a mortar-and-pestle. The green outer pods shouldn't be wasted; they can be used to flavor stocks that will be strained, or added to the grounds in a filter cone to make coffee. More intense cardamom flavor in coffee requires adding the well-ground seeds.<br /><br />Cardamom and most other 'aromatic' Indian spices lose their flavor with prolonged heat. They should be added very near the end of any cooking process, especially in curries. Anglo-American curry powder is a debasement of culinary art; it's mostly turmeric, which should be stirred into the frying oil early in the process while the aromatics are reserved for finishing.<br /><br />There are two sorts of cardamom available in American stores and here on the amazon: the small green pods and the larger black pods. They have somewhat different flavors, the black ones being stronger and earthier, but in most dishes they are interchangeable. Both kinds of cardamom are more intense when fresh, so a 4 to 7 ounce package is appropriate, assuming that it will be used up in two months or less.<br /><br />Here's a puzzle for bold chefs: what large bird should always be served with a glaze of lingonberries, chipotle chilis, cardamom, and shallots?

review/text: Let's compare Premium Bigelow Green Tea 100% Organic 160 Tea Bags Individually Wrapped, which is priced at $13.66 with FREE Super Saver Shipping, against Premium Bigelow Green Tea 100% Organic 150 Tea Bags Individually Wrapped, which is priced at $14.99 with FREE Super Saver Shipping.  Both boxes contain tea that is extremely healthy for us to drink.  Both boxes contain tea that was grown and very slightly fermented in China.  Both boxes have tea bags that are exactly the same size.  Both boxes contain tea bags that are individually wrapped in sealed, easy-open, metallic foil pouches.  Although different, both boxes have attractive designs.  Bigelow includes 160 tea bags, not 175 tea bags as falsely pictured, in this product but only 150 tea bags in the other product.  Yes, the design (picture) on each individual tea bag is always exactly the same as the design (picture) on the outside of the box that it came in.  The box provided for the 160 tea bags is slightly more rigid and easier to open and close than the box provided for the 150 tea bags.  After buying both boxes of Bigelow Green Tea, I couldn't find any reason why the 150 tea bags were priced higher than the 160 tea bags.  Although Bigelow Organic Green Tea is still a good deal today, 3 years ago, Bigelow Organic Green Tea was priced at only 6.1 cents per tea bag and had substantially more organic green tea in each metallic foil wrapped tea bag.

review/summary: LOOK OUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I haven't tasted this product yet.  At least in the way I would LIKE to taste it.  Perhaps the best way I can help anyone else with this product is to provide what I would like to have had printed on the label of this can:<br /><br />WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING: CONTENTS MAY BE UNDER PRESSURE.  OPEN WITH GREAT CARE AND CAUTION.<br /><br />Or if you must open this can, point the area of the can that will first be exposed to the air AWAY FROM YOU, much like a gun.  I did not do this, unfortunately.<br />First, for whatever reason, I was in our bedroom at the foot of our bed.  I was anticipating smelling the aroma of the chocolate, just to see if there was any unusual smell.  When the factory seal came loose at the closest point to my face, the pressure finished the opening with an explosion of about 1/3 cup of cocoa.  Into my face it went, all over the front of my shirt and onto the blankets of the bed and floor.  I called my wife back and said "Do you think I have a complaint with someone?"  After surveying the new face she had to look at, she said she thought I did.<br />My verdict on this product is still not decided for its taste in my hot chocolate cup.  But judging from the raw cocoa in my mouth, I would say I won't have to sweeten it too much.

review/summary: Different but delicious
review/text: This cocoa powder is lighter in color than most (kind of a warm tan) but has a wonderful chocolate flavor closer to rich, smooth milk chocolate than bitter dark chocolate. If you are avoiding this because it is not dutch-process, know that the quality of this particular cocoa outweighs any such labels. It makes the best hot chocolate I've ever had, short of hot chocolate made of actual melted chocolate. It worked great in baking as well and I had no problems with leavening when using a recipe calling for dutch process. Despite the light color of the cocoa, cupcakes baked up to a very dark color just as you would get with dutch process cocoa but the flavor was superior.

I never could drink natural cocoa powder before this as I found the taste too bitter but this was different. In addition to making cocoa drinks, I've used it in making muffins and they came out great. I would have given this 5 stars but took off a star because the price has literally doubled since the last time I bought. As much as I like it, I feel it is now overpriced and will have to find a cheaper option. I am disappointed since it was unavailable on Amazon for a period of time and I even signed up to be notified when it became available on Amazon again.

review/summary: Acai Lemonade is a good alternative to soft drinks (and other powdered beverage packets)
review/text: I received a free sample of this through an entity that sells products made by NOW Foods.  I was very hesitant to try it because most powdered based beverages are simply awful.  This particular flavor by NOW Foods is very drinkable and has a nice lemonade (more of a pink lemonade) taste.<br /><br />This product is sweetened with "Better Stevia" and lacks aspartame and acesulfame potassium, which are two additives that have been linked to cancer in rats.  Many flavored powdered beverages, including those bearing the Crystal Light, Wyler's and Hawaiian Punch names, have these additives.<br /><br />The directions note that the packet should be poured in a bottle and then shaken.  When you mix this in your water, it is a shade of pink. I didn't find that any of the powder floated to the bottom or lumped together.  It seemed to disperse evenly throughout the water and dissolve.<br /><br />The product has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins.

Compared to other powdered beverages, I found this powder to be made easily airborne. At the present time, there are external providers selling this for a much lower price (iherb.com is one of them - if you want a discount, search the internet for codes or you can use my code LEK375) and many health food stores carry the product as well.<br /><br />As a powder-based beverage, this is a decently flavored product.  It seems to offer a lot of vitamins and has minimal calories.  I would recommend it.

review/summary: Perfect for giving water flavor without the Aspartame!
review/text: I am trying to avoid too much sugar, but aspartame makes me feel gross and well, it is gross!  This is sweetened with Stevia (a plant) and Xylitol (from fruit fiber).  I bought the Berry Tea flavor and I think it tastes good.  I think it is too strong/sweet mixed full strength, which is great for me, because one packet lasts longer :)  I put 1/2-1/3 packet in a 16.9 oz bottle of water when I know I need to drink water but would rather have a soda, lol.  I don't taste an aftertaste at all but it's too sweet mixed full strength.  Great option!

review/summary: This Has Become A Staple At Our House
review/text: So far, we have only tried the Acai Lemonade, Pomegranite and the Berry flavor, and I love these little, inexpensive packets that make a delicious and refreshing sugar free drink.  As a diabetic, it is hard to find foods and beverages that are not loaded with sugar or artificial sweetners.  These NOW sugar free drink sticks are small and portable, so I can take them with me into restaurants that have limited choices for people like me.  Just order water and add the packet!  They are also good for children because they are yummy and sugar free.  I feel good about giving this drink to my grandkids.<br /><br />One other reviewer stated that she didn't like the Berry Tea flavor, and everyone in our family agrees with her.  Don't waste your money on the Berry Tea, because it tastes artificial and watered down - no one around here likes it.  The Acai Lemonade if very good, though, and the Pomegranite is positively delicious!  My personal favorite is Pomegranite.  It is pretty, too, and festive looking for a luncheon gathering.  Four little packets will make 1/2 gallon for a group.<br /><br />I did find the powder to be a little difficult to dissolve, but it only takes a few minutes to stir most of it into a glass of water.  I always pour the water into the glass first and then add the powder - otherwise it makes a mess and the powder will never disolve if you pour the drink mix into your glass and add the water last.  It is important to add the powder to an already full glass of water.  I have never gotten ALL of the powder to dissolve and there is always a small bit of residue in the bottom of the glass.<br /><br />The flavor is delicious as long as you don't mix it with more than 16 oz of water.  I hope they will eventually offer this in half gallon size packets, like Kool Aid.  But as I said before, it only takes 4 packets to make a half gallon.<br /><br />This is one of the best finds I have made, and if they keep this level of quality and price, I will keep buying it.<br /><br />UPDATE - 5/25/11: We have now tried the Fruit Punch flavor and do not like it.  We all thought it was really watered down tasting, and had no special flavor that would motivate us to buy it again.  Pomegranite is still the most favorite variety at our house, with Lemonade coming in second.  I will continue to update this review as we get the opportunity to try other flavors.

review/summary: Berry Energy Tea is loaded with vitamins but has a bad flavor
review/text: I tried the Acai Lemonade powdered beverage by NOW Foods and really liked it. With confidence, I purchased this product and I have to say this product represents why I am always hesitant to try powdered drinks.  They usually taste awful.  This has a very poor flavor with an aftertaste that reminded me of a pink liquid medicine I had to drink as a kid.<br /><br />The directions note that the packet should be poured in a bottle and then shaken. When you mix this in your water, it is a deep pink. I didn't find that any of the powder floated to the bottom or lumped together. It seemed to disperse evenly throughout the water and dissolve whether used in a shaker or just poured in a glass and and stirred with a spoon.<br /><br />This product is sweetened with "Better Stevia" so it is healthier for you than other low calorie beverages.  A lot of diet beverages have aspartame and acesulfame potassium. Both have been linked to cancer in rats and both were deemed one of the top ten worst additives by the Center for Science in the Public Interest.<br /><br />The product has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins. It has 100% of you daily vitamin C, 25% of Vitamin A, 50% of Vitamin D, 50% of Vitamin E, 50% of Thiamin, 50% of Riboflavin, 25% of Niacin, 50% of B-6, 50% of Folate, 50% of Pantothenic Acid and 8330% of Vitamin B-12.<br /><br />You need to use a little caution when opening the packet. I've found NOW's powdered beverages to be much more airborne than other powdered products.  Don't breathe it in or let it blow in your eyes.<br /><br />As a powder-based beverage produced by NOW Foods, I had high hopes.  Nutritionally, this is far superior to other diet based beverages because it seems to offer a lot of vitamins and has minimal calories.  The flavor is just awful so I cannot recommend this flavor.  Try the Acai Lemonade.

The coffee is excellent and much cheaper than k cups. Not sure it is as good as Java One Sumatra coffee but pretty darn close. For those who own pod brewers this is worth a try. For those of you who own keurig k cup brewers be a little smarter and don't knock the product because you can't read or don't know the difference between k cups and coffee pods.It is not the products failure.

review/text: I have been searching for coffee pods that will fit my Senseo supreme coffee machine, since my favorite Senseo pods have been unavailable for months.  I have tried two or three kinds which would not fit in my machine, due to the pods being too full.  Fortunately, those pods barely fit.  The quality of the coffee is very good, but not quite as good as my favorite Senseo Sumatra, which I hope to get eventually.  I have become hooked on coffee from my Senseo machine and won't drink any other kind, so I am happy to find pods that fit and also taste good.

review/text: I drink my coffe black with one sugar.  I enjoy coffee with a strong, dark roasted, complex flavor and when I bought a simple pod brewer for my desk I was very disappointed with the initial weak tasting coffee that I purchased with the machine.<br /><br />I recently purchased this 3 pack with the hope that this coffee brewer was not bought in vain...<br /><br />This is only my second brew but I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Lets not confuse a quality drip or perculator with this pod coffee, but for what it is -- it is convienent and tasty.<br /><br />The one common down fall with these pod coffees is the strength to water ratio... I can overfill my machine with water to get a decent cup of coffee.<br /><br />I recommend this coffee pod.

I use one pod in the one cup holder, twice to make a full delicious mug of dark rich coffee.  Senseo has since become available and like a fool, I ordered it at $12 more than my last shipment. . . DUH!  That will be my last order for senseo, seems like it was the plan, be unavailable and then jack up the price.  Not with Wolfgang around. Its fills the bill . . . And my mug perfectly.

The light balsamic is more flavorful than its oil laden counterpart, which is near impossible to say about any "light" dressing.  In comparing both versions, the oil volume in the original is about 50%.  That doesn't leave much taste to go around.  If this has piqued your interest, but you are unsure about spending money on something that may not appeal to your taste buds, McDonald's offers packets of Newman's Own B.V. with their salads.

review/summary: A Mai Tai must, My favorite commercially available orgeat
review/text: I use this for original Trader Vic recipe Mai Tai cocktails.  Don't be scared that this is labeled "Almond Syrup" and not "Orgeat", it has a great Orgeat color, texture/mouthfeel, and flavor (actually the newer bottles say "orgeat" in small text under the "Almond").<br /><br />I have personally tried the Fee Bros and Torani and this is superior.  The Trader Vic's syrups are no good either, but I recommend their Mai Tai glasses and shaker.  I have gotten nerdy and made my own orgeat, but this is the way to go for consitant top shelf cocktails.  I like that it is made with cane sugar and natural flavors for the same price as the others with HFCS and artificial flavors.<br /><br />To take this over the edge, I add a tablespoon (or two) of orange blossom water and a teaspoon (or two) of rose water to the bottle.  This gives a great, subtle smell.  The Mai Tai recipe on the bottle is no good, though I can see why it would be in Monin's interest to have you use a full ounce of orgeat.  There are many good (and even more bad) internet sources for Mai Tai recipes, but a search Robert Hess on Small Screen Network is a good start.  Use fresh limes and fresh mint (the mint is not for appearence, it is for olfactory experience and adds a lot). Use a good orange curacao (I like Marie Brizzard or Seniors).  Please never put pineapple, orange juice, or granadine in a drink and call it a Mai Tai.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.  For the record I've never put this in coffee, I'll defer to others there.  From the home bartender point of view, this is a winner.

review/text: I remember this product as a child.  Living in New York and having lots of brothers/sisters and cousins, coke was too expensive to give to us.  Instead of coke, my mother and her sisters would put some in a pitcher and add water.  Alittle goes a long way.  We would drink this all day.  It's a great way to for people to drink water that usually don't like to drink water.  The taste is very refreshing.  Taking vitamins is so much easier too.  I don't use in coffee, I don't care for that, but, with water.  Wow!!.  Just makes drinking water wonderful.  Kids love it too.  So if you want something that is not coke or those artificial drinks, just mix up and give it to the kids.

review/text: This was a nice pack to bring on a family trip, though do wish they had sold more then 3 per pack since the kids and both Adults loved this snack. maybe next time will have to buy either a smaller pack multi pack so everyone could have their own package. otherwise a fairly good deal. and worth the price. will buy from again.

review/summary: Olewo works!
review/text: I have been using Olewo carrots and beets for about a year now. The difference in my dogs is like day and night! Their coats are now shiny, luxurious and soft. Color and pigment are vibrant. I love the deep reds and dark blacks on my German Shepherds. Olewo also helps regulate the digestive system and their stools are better than ever. No more anal gland or digestive issues. Very simple to prepare and extremely cost effective as well. To top it all off, Olewo is very palatable and the dogs LOVE the taste. Bowls are licked clean after Olewo!

review/summary: The Best product for Dogs !!!!!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083QBVEC">Olewo Dehydrated Carrots Dog Food Supplement, 5-1/2-Pound</a>I have now used Olewo Carrots on all my dogs for about 10 years! I depend on the product to add fiber to their diet and shine to their coats. We have 4 breeds in our home (Boston Terrier, Lab, Great Dane and 2 Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs) and they have all seen the benefit of using the Olewo Carrots. I have mentioned this product to numerous breeders and all agree that there is nothing else like it on the market! With litters on the ground, I love sharing my Olewo Carrot product with the new puppy buyers! Thank you for making this great product available.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: My wife and I have included Olewo carrots and beets in our Bearded Collie's diets for over six years. All three have beautiful coats and virtually never have digestive issues. They love the taste and wait patiently for each meal. I know of many friends that started their dogs on these products and feel the same as I do about their value. I like the products so much that I order extra so I never worry about running out.

review/summary: Lovely product and company
review/text: As a breeder and exhibitor of Great Danes, our dogs are always on the go. Utilizing Olewo Carrots, our dogs have firmer stools, easily handle stress of traveling & showing weekly, and are rarely ill despite the multitude of dogs they come in contact with. They have amazing shiny coats which require no additional products. We wean our puppies adding in Olewo Carrots to their kibble to aid in digestion, boost immunity and to naturally worm. We share the benefits of Olewo Carrots with everyone we can and believe every pet owner should add it to their pet's diet.
