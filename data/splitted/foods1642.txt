review/summary: Steak seasoning that's spectacular.
review/text: Lindberg and Snider Porterhouse seasoning is the best.  I ordered it online because I hadn't had any luck finding it in stores.<br /><br />This stuff is great on any meat product.  We use it with roasts, steaks, pork chops, and even chicken.  It adds just the right flavor, and inhanses the flavor of the meat.  I have even used as seasoning for my fried chicken.  I guarentee you'll love it.

review/summary: Amazing!!!
review/text: This rub is amazing!!! I saw it in Bristol Farms and asked the meat guy if it was any good and he gave a rave review. I'm always on the search for great rubs and marinades and this will be a keeper. I have used it twice now, once on a porterhouse and on a flank steak and it's divine. I used to spend so much time making my own rubs but this rub takes the guess work and saves me so much time in the kitchen. It's a win win.

review/summary: The best seasoning and rub for a Prime Rib in the world!
review/text: I've been using this product since I was first introduced to it in 1980, when I worked as an apprentice meat cutter at Herb's Quality Meats in Boulder, CO for Herb Dillard - Charlie Snider's nephew.<br /><br />It is a great seasoning for a simple grilled steak, but it is especially good for seasoning an entire prime rib roast.<br /><br />Taylor's Market delivers exceptional service, especially due to the fact that I am now living on the East coast, where nobody sells this.

review/summary: For beginner cooks
review/text: I am not a very good cook and have been banished to the grill by my family as a way to minimize the gustatorial impact of my cooking on friends and family. Even a bad cook can grill a piece of meat if you can simply remember how chared or raw the interior was from the last time you messed up.<br /><br />The best piece of meat for a bad cook to grill is the tri tip because no matter how badly you cook it, there is still a section well done for those that like it well done and practically walking off the plate for those that like it rare. (Like me) The butcher told me to sprinkle Lindberg and Snyder roast seasoning on the tri-tip and lo and behold, my family ate every piece of meat and then I caught one of my recalcitrant sons licking the chopping block in the kitchen! I havn't yet been promoted back to cooking inside yet but last night I put three tri tips with lindberg seasoning on the grill and my boys attacked them like great whites hitting pup seals off South Africa.. even my girls were growling at each other when the pickings got slim at the end of the meal.<br /><br />Thanks much for making me look like I know what I am doing! Now do you have a seasoning that will make my family choke down my efforts at Zuchini Casserole?  Appreciativly,  BJ in Santa Barbara

review/text: If you have never tried this, you are missing out!  I first received it as a gift and loved it. I tried to purchase more only to find that it is sold in only one place in all of Phoenix--and nowhere near my home.  Amazon came through with flying colors.<br /><br />It is delicious on roast beef, pork, and chicken.  My absolute favorite way to use it is on diced potatoes fried in olive oil.<br /><br />My only complaint is that shipping is costly; I found that ordering several at a time made it a little easier to handle.  I wish this qualified for Free Super Saver Shipping.  (Amazon are you reading this???)

The packages are great she said for taking to bed with a glass of milk for a before bed snack. She said none of the cookies have been broken in the packages which is a relief. So this was a real big hit with my friend and her visiting family. Will order again ! (I do hate that the price has increased a bit much in just a few weeks.....)

review/text: I have been drinking a Thai version of Nescafe instant coffee and loving it, so when I saw the Memento Mocha mix I was eager to try. With anticipation I opened the package, filled with hot water, stirred and took a sip and was immediately greeted with a flavor of chocolate syrup and chalk, if there is such a flavor. I tried adding additional half and half to save the cup of coffee and that did not mask the gritty chalky flavor. I will be giving the rest away of the box, they were that bad. I am disappointed and will not even finish the 1 cup I did make.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: I got a sample of this in the mail, along with the Caramel Memento Coffee.<br /><br />I coudln't taste much of a coffee flavor here.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was a hot cocoa beverage, without the sugar.  What I really like about the two Memento flavors I tried is that they don't use too much sugar, unlike most of these types of coffee drinks.  They kept the sweetness turned way down.  Unfortunately for this particular Mocha flavor, I didn't taste much of any flavor.  Was it coffee?  Not that I could tell. Was it chocolate? Mocha?  I would have been hard pressed to say exactly what flavor it was had I not already known it was supposed to be Mocha.<br /><br />However, it was pretty good anyway.  It was very creamy tasting.  This one won't compete with any Starbucks offerings, but it's OK, because there is a hint of something along with the cream, I'm just not sure what.<br /><br />The other flavor I tried, the Caramel one, was delicious and I will purchase that.  This one let me down, but I still enjoyed it.

review/text: Trying a sample pack, and using a Keurig to measure the 8oz portion of water, I found this product to be VERY mild in flavor. I actually went back to the Keurig to make sure I didn't use too much water. Memento does not compare to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018VDKHU">Caf&eacute; D'Vita Mocha Cappuccino Hot or Cold Cappuccino Mix 64 Oz</a> that I got from the big box "C" store.<br /><br />I did not compare the ingredients, not any nutritional numbers. It could be that the D'Vita simply packs on more sugar. But, in the morning, when I want a something more than plain coffee, I'll be sticking with D'Vita.

My daughter LOVES Chicken and Pork Katsu but was recently diagnosed with a wheat allergy.  We are so glad to have found this product in our local health food store! Not only did the food taste great fresh, we made a large batch and froze half of it to eat later.  After one week, we took the frozen katsu out and baked it for 20 minutes to heat it.  It was just as good as it was fresh- nice and crunchy just like it should be!  Why only four stars?  This mix could be improved on.  It's a great start, but it's a little more like breadcrumbs in texture than actual japanese-style panko.

review/summary: Great GF product for fried chicken
review/text: My spouse is gluten-free and we'd tried Kinnikinnick (try saying that 5 times fast!) bread crumbs for chicken in the past, when they were sold in a plain white plastic bag, and been very satisfied with it, and were dismayed when it became no longer available. We happened to be shopping at our local health food store when I spotted this product and bought it immediately over an alternative GF product based on the Kinnikinnick name and our past experience. We followed the directions as shown on the box: dredge in sweet rice flour (aka mochiko, very cheap at any asian grocery store), then dip in egg wash, and finally in the bread crumbs. Bake for 40 minutes at 375 and yum! Very crispy coating, and as another reviewer said, you'd never guess it was GF. The only thing I would have done differently, as other reviewers have also said, is to add some seasonings for taste -- out of the box it's good, but a tad bland. To be fair, the box does suggest using your own seasonings or parmesan cheese.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a good GF breadcrumb for chicken or other meats, you need look no further. It does contain egg, so those with egg allergies need to avoid it, but it's GFCF so perfect for us. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Once burned, twice shy.
review/text: I got these breadcrumbs to make a special birthday meal (paneed chicken) for my boyfriend this past weekend. I scooped some out of the package and they looked, smelled and tasted great! I was so excited to be able to make this favorite dish of mine after not having it for nearly a year. After marinating the chicken and dredging it in the breadcrumbs, I put it in the pan which was on the usual medium low, and turned my back for literally 15 seconds. When I turned back around to stir the sauce next to them, the breadcrumbs were ALREADY burnt! So I scrapped that piece of chicken and lowered the heat before trying again. The same thing happened. Maybe I can use them for stuffing or something, but I'm a little nervous about trying to fry something again. And if it was just an operator error, someone please let me know what I did wrong/what I can do to fix it!

review/summary: Tooth breaking!
review/text: My 12 year old dog was never touched these treats... that is, until I had to put him on steroids (prednisone) and anti-seizure medications (phenobarbital) that made him ravenously hungry! Previous to his medications, he would turn up his nose to any of Science Diet's dry treats - they weren't palatable, were too hard and dry, and were hard to chew into. Now that he's on his medications, he'll eat them, but with no real zeal. He jumps and begs for other treats, but simply carries these dry, hard treats onto his bed, where he eats them at his leisure.<br /><br />So, if you have a chowhound who will eat anything, go for it. That said, if your dog has dental disease, I'd avoid them - these treats are so hard and crunch so loudly, I worry it actually hurts my dog's teeth to chew on these.<br /><br />My dog's review of this treats palatability: two thumbs down.

review/summary: Great tasting sardines
review/text: Very good tasting sardines.  No strong fishy taste or smell.  Reasonable price.  My last bulk order was the Reese sardines, but I like Roland better because they are more mild tasting.  There are 4 tightly packed sardines to a can with no wasted space.  These are the best sardines I have had in a long time.

review/summary: Fabulous!!
review/text: As an athlete/fitness freak I'm always looking for a new source of protein thats easy/convenient so when a friend told me about these my curiosity was piqued but I instantly remembered the sardines my father used to eat. They were small, mushy, and tasted awful. So, I bought one can and haven't stopped eating them since. These are really nice sized and meaty. They are in a light olive oil to which I add some basil, oregano and black pepper and then eat it right out of the can most times. I go through the 20 pack in about a week. For anyone looking to add some healthy protein to their diet along with some omega-3s, you simply can not go wrong here.

review/summary: A trusted brand
review/text: These are one of a very few select brands of sardines that I consider top of the line. They are consistent in quality and have a very long shelf life. They do not have a strong "fishy" taste like some brands. They are packed nicely in a light olive oil. This is a great high protein meal/snack. I have purchased many different brands of sardines to find the best and we always come back to Roland. It does pay to try more than one kind so you will know that these are the best! We order these through Subscribe & Save so that we always have them on hand.

I noticed the younger dog was emitting a nasty odor through his coat and the older dog was itching all over.<br /><br />After doing some research I found this food highly recommended online. The difference in the foods is the ingredients. This food contains REAL meat and by-products. Though I was skeptical because it was more expensive, it was well worth it. Both dogs gobble it up and they smell normal with no skin irritation.<br /><br />I recommend giving it a try and see the results!

review/summary: Great Results from Natural Balance Dog Foods
review/text: Although my rat terrier-beagle mix came to me eating Purina Puppy Chow, I quickly switched up to Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula for Dogs after reading various pet food reviews that panned Puppy Chow and praised Natural Balance foods.  And I am here to tell you that the praise is justified.  Although my puppy had been prone to occasional diarrhea prior to the switch, his stools have become solid, his coat has become very soft and thick, and he seems better filled out and more energetic.  He eats the food well, finishes his meals quickly and has done quite well on this food.<br /><br />I am very happy to have found Natural Balance Dog foods and intend to continue to feed my dog this product for the foreseeable future.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CST8PM">Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula Dog Food, 15-Pound Bag</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C5TCYU">Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula for Dogs, 33-Pound Bag</a>

review/text: I purchased the Ultra Premium dog food to help with my dogs allergy issues. I have tried all kinds of food to help with my Beagle dogs allergies and none worked as well as this, I have even tried much higher priced food and none did the job. She eats it easily and has no problems going outside to potty. Her allergies have cleared up a lot and I've had no repeated visits to the vet. Shes been on this food for awhile now and really loves to eat. I highly recommend this food for any dogs that have allergy issues or who are just picky eaters. I think any food that your dog likes to eat and has no issues with is a big step to a healthy happy life for your pup.

With both our dog was having digestion issues (vomitting, etc.) and had itchy skin.  A pet rescue recommended this food and since changing her to it, she is like a brand new dog.  No itchy skin, and she has a beautiful silky coat.  Not sure if it is the food but she even lost her doggie odor.  I give the food a 10 on a score of 1-10.

review/text: Our dog is a rescue and when we rescued her, the previous owners were feeding her beneful (which is supposed to be one of the worst dog foods).  We switched to Hill's Science Diet, but found out she didn't like that and would pick those out of her dish and lay them outside of the dish and not eat them.<br /><br />Our vet suggested our dog start eating a grain free diet because beagles are prone to allergies and skin dryness and itchiness.  This is when we found Natural Balance.  And our dog loves it!  She isn't picky about it at all like she was with the Science Diet.  I also feed her now using the fun ball so she has to work for her food and she really enjoys getting her food that way.<br /><br />This is a great dog food!

review/text: I recently became vegan due to my position on animal rights and I hated funding animal cruelty when buying dog food, so I tried this product. I made the mistake of mixing my dog's previous food with gravy and olive oil to the point where he refused to eat dry food and would prefer to starve. Well, I just poured him his first bowl of Nature's Balance and he immediately ate every bite, then asked for seconds, which I gave him! I actually have to end this review early because he is currently guarding the dog food bag from my other dog, which he has never done before. Must be good stuff! I hope my dogs will have healthier skin and teeth as I have heard from other users. Will keep you posted.

I wasn't able to immediately find this brand and variety locally and wanted to try it. My dogs loved it and it got high ratings for quality and ingredients in an independent study. Better than the usual grocery store brands I had been buying but the cost of some of the other brands put me off. If you cannot find at a reasonable price locally, I'd recommend this supplier.

review/summary: My dogs have never begged for their food before!
review/text: Duke and Chunk love this food.  I had been feeding them Beneful for a couple of years, but once I discovered the quality of the ingredients (or lack thereof), I decided that my furbabies deserved more than that.  Beneful is horrible for dogs, and made my lab constipated all the time.  Since the switch to Natural Balance, I realized how much they disliked the old food, because they actually get excited when I fill up the food dish and they look happier when they eat.  I now realize that they only ate the Beneful because that's all they had.  Imagine eating something you thought was gross for years on end.  I felt so bad.  I'll never switch back!  This food actually fills them up faster, so I actually spend about the same amount of money as I did on Beneful.  The better quality ingredients fill them up faster.  I am converted for life.  It's extra money, but it's so worth it to know that my dogs are healthy, happy, and full.  Plus, Duke poops like a champ now.

review/summary: My puppy loved it, but it gave him bad gas
review/text: My puppy (3 months) loved Natural Balance Ultra, but it gave him stinky gas (and lots of it). I noticed that the gas moving through his intestines was making him feel uncomfortable too. I tried feeding him probiotic yogurt and it helped a little bit, but not enough. One night, as his flatulence slowly suffocated me in my bedroom, I decided to order a small bag of Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul, and over the following week, I slowly transitioned him over. It seems to have solved his problem. Of course I can't speak for other owners, but for my puppy, I think that the lamb in Natural Balance gave him digestion issues. All other ingredients seem more or less comparable between the two brands. From this experience, I learned that figuring out what food works for a new puppy could take quite some time. I made the mistake of buying the 30lb bag, thinking that my puppy would take to it just fine as long as its high quality. Now I'm left with over half a bag of dog food that will never get eaten. New puppy owners: don't make the same mistake! Buy a smaller bag as a trial period!

review/summary: Great Food Delivered to My Door
review/text: I used to purchase this food at a local store, but saw it on Amazon for around the same price, plus Amazon had free shipping.  I ordered it on a Monday and it was at my door on Friday.  Beats having to go to the store, lug it to the car, and then bring it into the house.  I was a little worried that ordering it online would give me a close expiration date, but when I received it I saw that the date is still 10 months away, so I'm relieved the food is fresh.  Natural Balance is a great food.  I only buy dog food on the Whole Dog Journal approved list, and this brand makes the grade. No corn, byproducts, glutens, etc.  Plus, I try to stay away from foods containing turkey and rosemary, as I read that these ingredients may bother dogs prone to seizures (I have one such dog). No one dog food is perfect for every dog, but Natural Balance is worth a try!

review/text: Two years feeding Natural balance Ultra Premium formula to my fussy American Eskimo/Beagle shelter doggie and she still greets it favorably, even if it lacks the glamor of squirrel, which is her dream nourishment but she can never catch them. This "blue bag" variety is Natural Balance's least expensive, have tried the fancier limited ingredient varieties like Duck w/sweet potato, but I swear the dog prefers the basic. Amazon's low pricing and me buying in bulk cut my dog food grocery bill in half. Also owe my thanks to Amazon Prime free shipping (30 pound bags used to cost quite a bit in freight costs)free month's trial that I got with my new Kindle Fire. Oh, and I almost forgot the reason that I am writing this review is that I am still in delighted shock that the delivery arrived at my apartment building steps in less than 24 hours. Amazing.

review/summary: Great Food, Better Poop!
review/text: This food is GREAT! I adopted my two Pomeranians and they'd been on IAMS - pretty crummy stuff. I switched them over to this and not only do they eat less of it, but their poop is much healthier looking (firmer, not runny anymore.) Their coats are fuller and the eye gook they used to get seems to have really gone away. A friend of mine told me he feeds his dog blueberries to get rid of eye slime, so I'm wondering if this food has a similar nutrient. Really great stuff! The only thing that would be better is if you actually cooked for your dog!

review/summary: A Godsend for Dogs with Allergies
review/text: I rescued two puppies with a slew of health problems (mange, allergies, etc. etc.) Neither the vet nor myself could figure out why they were sick until we realized that it could be their food.  I was feeding them what I thought was high quality (Nutro), but it was tearing up their stomachs.  A fellow dog lover recommended Natural Balance and they've been on it ever since.  Two years with nearly no vomiting or soft stools.  I am very thankful for Natural Balance and recommend it to anyone who owns pets with allergies or stomach sensitivity.  Or anyone just looking for a healthy alternative at a great price.

review/text: For some reason the trip to the petstore is not one that I look forward to so when I found Natural Balance on Amazon I was excited.<br /><br />I have two yellow labs and my younger one didn't like this flavor at all. I usually buy the Lamb Natural Balance and it gets gobbled up but not so with this one. My other lab is not picky at all and will eat anything. If you don't have picky dogs then I'm sure this product will be fine for you.

review/summary: Saw good reviews. Made my puppy sick
review/text: This product came highly recommended by my friends and the vet so I decided to purchase a 30lb. bag for my 6 month old puppy. I fed it to her the first day I got it after inspecting the good 'til date and for any contamination. Within a few hours, she had blood in her diarrhea after I took her for a walk. My dog has never had diarrhea in the month that I've had her. On top of that, she was constantly gassy throughout the day after being fed this product. On my 2nd walk with her, she had diarrhea again despite not being fed anything after the first episode. I took her off the food and her stool returned to normal. I fed this to her again today and she's passed liquid stool once more and is extremely lethargic and gassy right now. Amazon was nice enough to take care of my problem, but this item needs to be pulled. After my pup's issues, I did some more additional research and found many consumer complaints filed with consumer affairs regarding several of Natural Balance's product including this one. It's possible that I received a bad bag, but I don't know....I'm just really bothered by the similarities between my experience and what other's have posted.

review/text: I have a one year old Labrador mix and I decided to give her premium dog food to better her over all health. She has been eating it for the past 5 days.... Every day she would have diarrhea and then the 5th day she actually started puking it up. I don't know if this is a recalled bag that amazon sent out by accident or what... But I can promise you that I will not be buying this EVER again. The only time my dog puked was after she had gotten fixed and was in the car for the ride home.

review/summary: Not good with my dog!
review/text: I guess I am going to be the 'Debbie Downer' when it comes to the so far perfect reviews of this food.  My dog...who is a major eater...didn't seem to care for it much, though he did eat it always seemed to be hungry and begging for treats, after the fact.  There too, he started having two bowel movements a day instead of one.  I've always heard that two bowel movements means the dog food has more filler in it.  Not sure if it was just the abrupt switch...his old brand changed formulas which did not set well with him...or if it's the food itself.  But based on the other foods, I think it might just not be setting well with him.  That said, I would suggest trying a small bag first, as I do know it will be different from dog-to-dog.  For the record, I did receive prompt and free shipping!

review/text: Order received quickly - within three days of order.  I was surprised to see them delivered in a four foot rectagular box, but upon opening, the 40 purple carnations were very pretty and the size was due to the length of the stems.  Shipped with a single cold pack that sufficiently cooled the flowers for delivery during weather in the 80s where I live.  Would recommend planning to have vase or other similar items ready to arrange upon delivery rather than shipping directly to the recipient, however, as they are not shipped as final aesthetically pleasing arrangement.  I suppose that is dependent on purpose.  Mine was as a gift to my girl, so we ended up cutting and placing in vases upon arrival.  Would order again!

She will eventually eat."<br /><br />Well, she proved HIM wrong!  $1,000 in vet bills later - unconscious pup with IV's, xrays, special meds - we learned that all dogs DO NOT EVENTUALLY EAT.<br /><br />Which is why I am putting all this nonsense in this review:  EACH OF MY PICKY PUPS WILL CHEW YOUR ARM OFF TO GET AT THIS FOOD!!

The real advantage is it is very healthy and nutritious, unlike many of the wet dog foods that I have bought. It does appear to look like human food. I suppose it is sad to admit that my adopted dog is so picky, but she is. Now I don't have to be concerned about her not eating or eating products that are not healthy.

I used to  try  and feed her expensive "good for her" dog food, but she would only eat the really cheap stuff like Beneful.  Then all of a sudden she would only eat the red and green kibble in the Beneful...no to browns and oranges!  Recently I started mixing the Three Dog Entree into the Beneful dry food and now she licks her plate clean.  I had been buying it at Walmart, but the price on Amazon is much better and I don't have to make late night runs to the store to stuck up.  Now that I know that Three Dog Bakery makes a dry kibble, I will try mixing those two together.  This is the best food ever!

That being said, I like this gum.  It is very strong-flavored, so weak gum-likers need not apply.  It is true that the flavor does not last as long as other Orbit delights like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZ8P62">Orbit Citrusmint Sugarfree Gum, 14-Piece Packs (Pack of 24)</a>.  You can't win 'em all.  Truth be told, that is a better gum.  This is more of a special occasion gum, when you're really feeling the need to take the vacation to flavor country.  I keep this gum at work so that I can make sure that my oral fixation always has 12 x 20 pieces on standby.  Review over.

It was a good tasting soup and, together with a couple other items, made a good nutritious lunch.<br /><br />I like to find items like this because I can store  them in my pantry and have a good meal prepared in no time at all. Plus, I worry about proper nutrition and so many of the things you can store are so high in salt, sugar and fat. Not here! This is a good item.

Trouble is we haven't had enough hurricanes where I live to do a subscription, but I subscribed to monthly deliveries, anyway.<br /><br />Why? The stew is decent when doctored, that's why. With 4-5 cans, you add a stalk of celery, 2-4 carrots (depending on size), an onion, and some other vegetable. Add one smallish potato per can (keep the skins), cubed. Cook the vegetables in red wine and a little water. Mix in bay leaves, and Herbes de Provence. Add pepper to taste. Add the stew when the vegetables look done, and heat through.<br /><br />What you don't do is add salt. There's plenty of that in the stew, already.

review/summary: Remember "Where's the Beef"?
review/text: I was looking for a can of Dinty Moore's "Beef Stew", and found one with the original style label.  In checking the ingredients, I looked down the long list of names and found "beef" second from the bottom.  Not good in anyone's book.  Let alone a kitchen.  The main ingredient should be beef.  Not an afterthought.  Same here.  And there's always the big spoon with a large chunk of beef in it.  The beef gravy (keep in mind "gravy")here is made up of:<br />  "Beef Gravy (Water, Beef Broth, Beef, Tomatoes [Water, Tomato Paste], Corn Flour, Salt, Modified Food Starch, Caramel Coloring, Sugar, Flavoring), Beef, Potatoes, Carrots".  Gravy is only thick soupy stuff meant to hide what ever else is in the pot.<br />  Well, there it is again!  Beef at third from the bottom this time.  And the "Beef Gravy" is a joke!  Water is the first, then "Beef Broth, Beef".  This beef ingredient is nothing more than pureed pieces of beef to give the gravy some better flavor and maybe some substance.  And this stuff is much like the original.  Of course, everyone's taster is different.  And who knows what the formula changes have caused in the flavor?  One thing I do know.........My dog LOVES it!  He only got a taste and I threw the rest out.  Not good for him either.

review/summary: Tasty peanuts. Terrible packaging.
review/text: Before I ordered these peanuts, I read the other review and hesitated before ordering.  "Would the peanut containers actually explode in the shipping carton?", I wondered, but I took a chance and ordered these.<br /><br />The peanuts are packaged in thin plastic tubs with flimsy plastic snap-on lids which split easily.  There's a freshness seal under the lid.  When my order arrived (shipped in a box with some books and some cookies), I noticed that the carton with the 6 peanut tubs had been shipped on its side, which caused some of the lids to crack and the tubs to buckle.  Three of the freshness seals had broken, so some peanuts had come out of the tubs.  Since the 6 tubs of peanuts were packed inside a cardboard carton with plastic around it, none of the peanuts were loose with the rest of the items in the shipment.<br /><br />I checked the unbroken freshness seals to make sure the seals were tight enough to keep the peanuts fresh after I stored them in the pantry. You might consider just removing the peanuts from all of the plastic tubs and putting them into zip lock bags and freezing them.<br /><br />So, I would give 5 stars for the peanuts (which were very tasty and fresh) but drop it down to 3 stars for the flimsy peanut packaging (which is the fault of Klein's, the peanuts manufacturer).  These plastic containers do not ship very well through the mail or UPS.<br /><br />By the way, I received these peanuts the first week of January 2012 and the expiration date on the peanuts tubs read October 2012, which is a reasonable expiration time for this item.

review/summary: SPARKLING DRAIN CLEANER
review/text: This stuff is terrible! It tastes like a homemade fortified wine. We served it at a dinner party of ten and nobody liked it whatsoever...at all....not even a little bit. Thank God we had plenty of real wine and real alcohol to serve, as if we had solely relied upon this beverage, the dinner party would have been a bust!<br /><br />In fact, I am a trained chef and the other chef we served it to also thought it tasted like sparking drain cleaner...<br /><br />Great bottle...nice marketing...very poor product. I cannot believe they actually did any market surveys on product taste whatsoever...!<br /><br />Very...very disappointing!

review/summary: Wow - It's so Almond-y!!!
review/text: I love Bubble Teas and I wanted to make them at home. I figured the almond flavor would be versatile enough to mix with my husband's protein powders (chocolate, vanilla, and even peanut butter) to flavored coffees for me for our special Bubble "teas". The powder does mix well but FYI - the almond flavor is a strong artificial almond flavor. A little scoop goes a long way. It's tasty but a little strong for me.

review/summary: Good Loganberry jam
review/text: A good overall Jam with good berry flavor. The larger size makes this a good value. Loganberry Jam is getting hard to find as the berries are not as commercially viable as others, but the flavor of these berries is outstanding. I have had Loganberry Jams that were "truer" to the berry's flavor but this one is very good.

review/summary: Great, but a tad expensive
review/text: I like Folgers, and I usually buy the huge container at Costco.  Even though I drink alot of coffee, I still found that towards the end it was not quite as fresh as when I first opened it.  I thought the idea of having several  smaller bags versus one large contaner would mean that I always have relatively fresh coffee (nothing better than that smell when you first open a bag or can of coffee).  From that standpont, it has worked out great.  The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because you pay a small premium.  If you buy your coffee from the grocery store you will find that the 6 pack here on Amazon is actually cheaper, but if you buy your coffee in the large container from a a warehouse store, you will find the 6 pack to be more (for me about $.75 on the big can).  To me, the extra $.75 is worth opening smaller packs of fresh coffee every 2 weeks or so, versus opening one big can every 2 months or so.

review/summary: Java Java Java
review/text: I love coffee, however I hate going to the store every week to buy it. I ordered this product because it comes in a 6-pack, I have free prime shipping, and its the coffee my local store seems to run out of frequently. I prefer the classic roast rather than the darker French/Columbian roasts. I don't like strong coffee. Best Java for my buck right now.

review/summary: Great way to buy coffee
review/text: These compact little bicks fit in the freezer door perfectly. I always know when I am running low. Great fresh taste having 11.3 ounce container open. I was buying the 30+ounce containers at the stores but they get stale after a week. This is better and the price is wonderful!

review/summary: Beginner's Lapsang Souchong
review/text: I am a Lapsang Souchong fan.  I enjoy the smokey flavor.  This particular version has nice subtlety to its flavor but lacks the "smoke" I desire.  I know most people are not fond of a "barbequed tea".  This brand may be one of the best for those who wish to test Lapsang Souchong but don't desire a lot of smokey flavor.  For true fans I would recommend the one from China Mist [[ASIN:B0000V1BEI Lapsang Souchong Whole Leaf Loose Black Tea].

review/summary: lovely, beautiful tea
review/text: Lapsang Souchong is what some might consider an acquired taste, because the smokiness and aroma of it are quite strong. Its aromatic reminiscence of woodsy smoke does not take away from the taste of the tea itself, which is rich, flavorful, and not at all bitter as one might suspect from the first overwhelming sniff. The taste is actually mellow and yet refreshing, the color a golden amber, and, as the reviewer below mentions, it is best when not steeped for too long. It's also best served without milk, as this takes away from the taste...but personal taste is personal taste.<br /><br />I must admit, I am not what you'd call a lapsang souchong snob, but I have tasted several brands, and Taylors of Harrogate offer the best I've ever tried. Their tea is divine, and I'm going to order some more of their other teas.
