review/summary: How the mighty have fallen...
review/text: My wife and I have been drinking various Celestial Seasonings� teas for a long time, and have always found them to be excellent, flavorful blends. There is also a sense that the company's philosophy -- natural ingredients, healthy teas, sustainability, etc. -- gives consumers confidence that  consuming Celestial Seasonings� products will always be a satisfying and wholesome experience.<br /><br />That's how we felt... until today.<br /><br />A few days ago, I bought a new type of Celestial Seasonings� tea -- "Sweet Harvest Pumpkin" -- which I'd seen on display at the local Big Y supermarket. Knowing my wife has a liking for things pumpkin, I bought some. (I don't drink caffeinated tea anymore, so I wasn't going to try it.)<br /><br />Today my wife told me about the odd taste left in her mouth after she'd had a cup of the tea -- she said her mouth felt "puckery" after drinking it, and there was an unpleasant aftertaste which lingered even after she brushed her teeth. This experience prompted her to look at the list of ingredients on the box of tea... and to her surprise and dismay, she saw that one of the ingredients was "stevia extract".<br /><br />Stevia is a so-called "natural sweetener" derived from the Stevia plant. Here's what Wikipedia had to say about that plant:<br /><br />"The species Stevia rebaudiana, commonly known as sweetleaf, sweet leaf, sugarleaf, or simply stevia, is widely grown for its sweet leaves. As a sweetener and sugar substitute, stevia's taste has a slower onset and longer duration than that of sugar, although some of its extracts may have a bitter or licorice-like aftertaste at high concentrations."<br /><br />I've tried a couple of drinks sweetened with Stevia... and I think they're vile. Worse than stuff sweetened with Saccharin or Aspartame, in my opinion... and they're pretty bad. That Celestial Seasonings� could think it was a good idea to put this wretched crap into their tea... well, it just boggles the mind. Not only that, they don't warn you that this junk is in the tea -- you have to read the fine print, and that's something I never expected to have to do with the products of this once-excellent company.<br /><br />As someone who gave up adding sweetener of any kind to his tea many years ago, I find it extremely offensive that Celestial Seasonings� has taken it upon themselves to sweeten their teas for us, especially with something as loathsome as Stevia. Really... do we need this? I don't think so. -- PL

There was no apple caramel pie, and it was substituted for Vanilla Hazelnut. My husband hates vanilla. He said the Creme Brulee was just alright, and told me not to waste $$ buying it again.

review/summary: Finally, Krupuk in my pantry.
review/text: I was so thrilled when I found Krupuk on Amazon of all places. I have a friend who used to drive to L.A. (from San Diego) to get ingredients for a lavish Indonesian meal he would cook.  I especially liked the Krupuk but was not going to drive 3 hours to get it.  This is the same brand he used and it is so good.  I must disagree with the review that said to microwave them because the oil adds to much fat.  I fry mine and put on paper towels.  The paper towels have very little oil on them when finished and most of the oil in the pan is still there. As for the fishy taste, well they are shrimp.

review/text: Havent had Kurpuk in forever.  I lived in Indonesia as a child and we had this all the time w/ Satay.<br /><br />This particular product is excellent and very easy to prepare.  Simply fill a wok w/ vegetable oil bring it the oil up to 300F or so (don't let it smoke).  My wok is big enough for 2 or 3 at a time.  they cook really fast.  Once it expands out (about 4" in diameter) flip it over and give it a few more seconds.  They'll get sort of a dull brown - pull them.  I'm used to them being either bright pink or yellow.  oh well.<br /><br />Oh - the instructions on the back make for entertaining reading.<br /><br />No go make peanut sauce.

review/text: The fishy taste is undeniable, but I like fish.  There's a sort of whatcha might call "refined" shrimp cracker on the market, and they're good, too, but with enough of a salty taste added that my wife won't  join me in eating them.  She likes these, however, as do I.  Incidentally, we don't really deep fry them: too much fat-intake if we do.  We microwave them---cautiously, so as not to burn them much---and then work around the unexpanded fringes.  There are lots of ways to spell krupuk, for example kropok, kuropok, etc. When searching for these (or other kinds), that's a good thing to keep in mind.

review/summary: Not so great but alright for a one time thing.
review/text: I'm going to be honest here. These aren't anything fantastic and are overpriced as far as I'm concerned.<br />I couldn't wait to get them but when I did cooking them was the best part.<br />They're very hard to cook perfectly, if you leave them in for a 5 seconds too long they become hard and chewy to the point they're inedible.<br />The taste is just "okay" but after two or three chips they lose their charm and you find yourself not wanting anymore.<br />Beware cooking any amount of these will stink up the entire house. We couldn't get the smell out for 3 whole days and the smell is not pleasant. It's a lot like burnt rubber.<br /><br />If you're just looking for a fun party snack with an asian theme than go ahead and get them but don't be surprised when people complain about the smell or ask what they're supposed to taste like as they definitely don't taste like shrimp and at $8 a bag they are not cheap.

review/text: For $7.50 a bar I expected something really good, but these chocolates were marginal at best. Out of the 6 people who tried it, not one liked the taste or combo. We couldn't even give it to the dog to finish (chocolate is toxic to canines). Disappointing for sure and now I'm scared to try any more products from this company because of the high prices. Too bad, they have what seems like interesting chocolate combos. To be fair, maybe it's an aquired taste?

review/text: I purchased this as a gift, but there was enough to share.  I kept some and used it in my chili recipe.  We don't like real spicy food but the smoked paprika gave the chili a great taste without too much spice.  I have used it in several other recipes since with great results.

review/summary: Excellent Coffee
review/text: Have been drinking Stewart's Private Blend for many years even though it isn't available in grocery stores on the East Coast. Stewart's is a Chicago based tradition. Once tried, could not go back to the old "household" brand name coffees seen on grocery store shelves all over the U.S.  You know the ones.  The bottom line: it's great tasting, perfect strength for me (at recommended scoops) and not bitter. Additionally, Stewart's Private Blend Coffee is finer ground and as such will save you money. You will need less coffee to make a pot. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Disappointed with expiration dates
review/text: These are great if you use the right oil and temperature, but I am disappointed as the expiration date on all 6 boxes is January 1, 2012, less than 3 months away.  I would have expected at least 6 months grace period on the expiration dates.  My last purchase of the same 6-box set had an expiration date 9 months away.  Disappointed that they would be selling something with such a short shelf life.  Not worth my time to return.

review/text: Easily makes great beignets! Plus I was surprised to find it made more than I expected even though I like my beignets somewhat doughy. I roll my dough out a little less to have thicker dough.<br />If you have not made these before, to make them puff you have to hold them under the oil for a few seconds. After you drop them in and they start to rise to the top, just use something to hold them just under the oil. It usually takes just a second or so and you will see the dough start to expand. Then just let them go and let them finish cooking. Flip to cook both sides if necessary.

review/summary: Zotz the way I like it
review/text: Classic Zotz fizzy sour candy - kind of like Pop Rocks in a hard candy, or a lozenge filled with sour Pixy Stix powder.  The box contains 48 strings of 4 individually wrapped pieces, for a total of 192 pieces.  This is basically the same as the Zotz candy that was popular back in the 1970s, but it's now imported from Italy.  The flavors in the box I received from Amazon Grocery weren't as pictured in the item listing (cherry/orange/lemon/lime); instead, it contained equal numbers of cherry (red), apple (green), and watermelon (pink).

review/summary: Childhood favorite!
review/text: I loved Zotz as a kid. You get 48 packs, which has 4 pieces, so you end up with 192 Zotz. At the time that I purchased these, it was around $10.00 for the whole box, which ends up about 5cents per each Zotz which is reasonable, especially for something I have not seen in a store in a long time. The candy arrived well-packaged and protected. I have not found any broken pieces. My 13-year-old really likes them too. This candy would pose a choking hazard for young children though, so I would not recommend them unless your child is old enough to suck on hard candy without accidentally swallowing or choking on it. The candy is very sour, so you better have a taste for sour stuff :)

review/text: My husband and I love these candies!  They start out like a normal hard candy with a bit of zing in their flavor.  Then the little hole on the side of the candy (where they put the fizzy solution into the candy) usually starts to fizz.  I try to wait at this point to eat more of the hard outside but I usually can't.  Once you bite through the hard outside the entire inside is fizzing and has a similar flavor to the hard outside.  The fizzing is similar but more prolonged that Pop Rocks and these have much better flavors.<br /><br />Delicious!

review/summary: CHILDHOOD MEMORIES (AND THE INTERNET) CAN BE WONDERFUL THINGS
review/text: When I was growing up, penny candy was one of the simple joys of life.  Even if you were 5, you didn't need a lot on money to go into the neighborhood penny candy store by yourself and purchase a bag full of sheer decadence!  And although I found candy in general to be completely irresistible, ZOTZ were, by far, my favorite.<br /><br />Talking about childhood memories and the candy we enjoyed with a friend of mine recently prompted me to go looking for this simple sweet treat on the Internet.  Having not seen the candy in over 40 years, I was only really expecting to find a brief history/write-up, if that, on the item since I didn't think they were being made any more.  Imagine my pure elation when I discovered they were still around (and could be ordered on AMAZON!)  I couldn't order them fast enough!<br /><br />When I finally received my package and popped that first ZOTZ (in decades) into my mouth, it was like being transported back in time.  The anticipation and exhilaration of that explosion of fizz and flavor to overtake my mouth when I finally bit into the hard candy shell and released the flavorful fizz inside ...  pure rapture!  I have to say, while the experience on the whole was certainly wonderful, the 'fizz experience' was somewhat less than I remembered (as a child, it was all I could do to keep my lips together so the fizz didn't escape my mouth), but all-in-all, well-worth the price of admission.  Would I do it again?  Oh yeh!  Would I recommend it to others?  For sure!  (DISCLAIMER: INDIVIDUAL RESULTS MAY VARY).

review/text: I ordered this item and it was shipped the same night, I recieved it in two days!  The zots weren't in multi-colored strings like the picture, but I wouldn't expect them to be, I've never seen them sold like that.  I normally buy a couple strands from "Hot Topic" but I'm saving a lot of money by buying it this way.  I'm very happy with this purchase!

review/text: I have loved this candy since my Junior High lunch days, many,many years ago...It is so hard to find except from specialty stores where it was very pricey.  I was excited to see it so affordable and with free super saver shipping from Amazon!!!  Good sour flavor with that surprise of fizz!!  I have my kids hooked on it too, but I find it hard to share!!  Well worth the money for the candy and the memories...

review/text: Four stars because you don't get what the picture shows, you get what the title says -- you get strings of all green, all red, all pink. We REALLY wish we would get the four flavors as shown.<br /><br />However, these are still really cool candies. Though if you haven't had these before, you should know that after eating a bunch (hard to stop!), your mouth gets somewhat "raw" or scraped, kind of like eating a bunch of sour patch kids (but zots are more fun).

review/summary: Took off a star for emotional damage
review/text: As the clock striked 6pm, and the winter sun's mere glint disappeared, I braced myself for yet another Metra commute into the burbs. Winter, you see, is a tricky season since it's even harder to tell who's a true pale skin (ancient term for blook sucker) and who's just a pasty ol' Joe Shmoe. Monday - Fiday for those 5 cold months (Chicago winters are like mini comas) I took every step with precise caution and eerie tremble, knowing that at any second the white devil could strike.<br /><br />But that was the past. Here I am today, 2012, bite-free and rested (no more sleepless nights). The garlic mints may have ruined my 5 year relationship, destroyed any possiblity of being invited to happy hours with my co-workers, and caused some additional emotional downfalls, but hell, I was vamp free!<br /><br />If you have some thick skin for name calling (sticks and stones people!), a tolerance for garlicky night sweats, and being okay with a lone 45 minute ride on the Metra quiet car, then these are perfect for you.

Luckilly, about the same time,<br />Coke was experimenting with a diet-<br />cola that they just didn't want to<br />actually CALL "Diet Coke" until the<br />public noticed that THIS stuff didn't<br />taste TOO bad, and you could actully<br />lose some weight DRINKING the stuff.<br />I did. Enough to go from a 4F to a 1A<br />and get drafted by the Marines. Luck-<br />ily, I ran down to the NAVY recruiting<br />station--first--but didn't avoid Viet<br />Nam at all.<br />Well, anyway, this stuff is very hard<br />to find, and rarely SEEN. I've always<br />prefered the taste to other diet colas,<br />and recommend it whole-heartedly!<br />Oh! And it is featured in an Abbott'n'Cos-<br />tello-like routine in BACK TO THE FUTURE.<br />Remember?<br />Soda Jerk: "Waddelya have, kid?"<br />McFly:....

There are a couple of stores in my area that carry this delicious beverage so that's where I buy my TaB, I'm not gonna spend 20+ dollars for ONE case here on amazon. If you can find TaB in your area, you should give it a chance, I know it's not everybody's cup of tea, but it certainly has developed a cult following.<br /><br />7,846,213,416,816 stars out of 5

No but they do taste really good, our entire family likes them.  Nice to leave in the diaper bag so you bring them out when little ones get cranky.

BUT, when I mixed up my first batch, and took that first sip, I was simply amazed at how good this product tasted! And when I read the Nutritional info, I was simply astonished that not only was I getting all the benefits I get from the fruits (I would normally be blending in my juicer) but I was getting all the added vitamins and proteins that help to balance out my diet!

review/summary: I Love this Flavor and Don't Miss the Caffeine
review/text: The first time I made a pitcher of the Green Tea Raspberry flavor my 15 year old step-daughter was skeptical. It didn't look like anything she'd ever experienced before! Being from the South, we know what "tea" looks like and the green tea blend is very light in appearance. One taste later and she was raving over how good it was!  Now we have them in the portable pouches and can enjoy them wherever we go.<br /><br />Not only do I appreciate the health benefits that the Green Tea offers, but I am also delighted to find a great tasting thirst quencher that doesn't have any caffeine! The antioxidants are a welcome addition to our diets and now my step-daughter's palette has been expanded a little bit more to include the green tea experience.

I mix it at less than full strength, about three fourths of a packet in a 22 oz glass, and find it to be quite refreshing.  The packets are so convenient, too.  Like it so much I put it on subscription delivery for once a year, along with several other flavors.  Peach and White Grape are tasty, too.

review/text: I love Crystal Light On the Go.  I really like the Green Tea Rasberry flavor too.  At home, it is so easy to grab a bottle of water from the frig, put a packet of Tea into it, shake it up and enjoy.  I carry a couple of packets in my purse for when I'm out and about and I always take it with me on trips.  I am never without a tasty drink.  Just add water.  Also, I don't drink enough water (according to my Dr.) Crystal Light On the Go helps me get my water down, I  can easily drink 4 or 5, 16oz glasses a day and at 5 caloriies per serving and no carbonation, it is perfect for me.

review/text: I was never really a tea fan, but this is awesome! The color may look like dirty dish water but with the tea with raspberry flavor it tastes great! It is nice on the warm Spring days! Some Crystal Light flavor packets don't always mix well with the water but his one does a good job, it tastes great with having no caffeine too! The one downfall is once it is mixed the top of the water bottle has almost like a foam residue at the top it's nothing bad or anything but looks like pop when it has been shaken up! Once again, I love that you can get it subscribe and save!!!
