review/summary: Okay, I taste the jalape&ntilde;o, but what happened to the BOLD?
review/text: Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce is ok for what it is. If you're wondering what it is, then I'd say that summing it up as jalape&ntilde;o-flavored mayonnaise is about right. It's probably not quite that thick, but the flavor is similar. You definitely taste the jalape&ntilde;o, but it's as if someone put jalape&ntilde;o into a bottle of mayo, or to be honest, Miracle Whip-style salad dressing is probably even more on point. It's not awful and lends itself well to burgers and sandwiches where the meat is warm (steak, breaded-chicken), but not as well to cold sandwiches, and, oddly enough, not to tacos. On a taco it just seems out-of-place, especially compared to Taco Bell's store sauces.<br /><br />With anything like this, how spicy is it is always an important question to ask. To answer, I've got to say that this is some of the least bold BOLD sauce that I've had in a long time. There's a little spice there, and admittedly, I like it hot (El Yucateco Kutbil-Ik Habanero when I can get it), but there didn't seem to be much heat at all (which I had confirmed by my significant other and a friend, neither of which are as fond of heat as I am). Overall, the Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce is too short on flavor to recommend. Given limited options, I'd probably eat it again (though not on a taco), but I wouldn't go out of my way to have some, much less purchase it.

review/summary: Spicy, but not something I'd want on my Tacos....
review/text: As a huge Taco Bell fan, I was pumped to try their new line of sauces, but I've been underwhelmed. The Jalapeno Sauce has a nice Peppery kick, but the flavor was really lacking. I found myself leaving the bottle untouched on Taco night, which surprised me. So far, I'm having to content myself with using little packets of Fire Sauce left over from my Taco Bell visits.

review/summary: Not going to be a regular go to condiment.
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of spicy foods but I love the flavor of peppers and thought that this would be a good blend because of the creamyness of the sauce.  Surprisingly even I was underwhelmed by the flavors found in this sauce.  It tastes like a watered down version of something that could have been delicious had it been made with a stronger jalapeno flavor. When putting it on tacos the flavors got lost between all of the other items on the taco and it really wasn't much different than putting sour cream on it.  I think you would need a significant amount on each taco for you to be able to really notice that it has a different flavor than sour cream.  I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, there just wasn't enough flavor for me to really care weather it was on my taco one way or another.

review/text: I love this stuff.  It has a little spiciness to it, but it is not super hot.  My husband thinks it has 'avocado overtones', but that might be just because it is light green and avocado-looking, however there is no avocado in the ingredients.  We happened to mix it with some hummus (half and half) and it made a delicious chip dip.

review/summary: More depth and flavor than I was expecting; recommended
review/text: If you ever come to Austin some of the best 'Tex-Mex' food is from a local chain called Chuy's. You have to ask for  creamy jalapeno sauce that goes wonderfully with their chips. I was hoping this sauce would be as good as the Chuy's one. It is better. The sauce has surprising depth; it is fresh tasting, and well balanced. Not too spicy at all, but the spice mixture definitely comes though, garlic, onion, bell peppers. It is very easy for packaged sauces to lose their spices with the preseratives and packing. The jalpeno sauce does not. It has a lot of uses for me. You can use it as a full flavored salad dressing. As a diping sauce. You can add it to other sauces. You can dress Mexican food items, etc. It is also a decent price on Amazon for a 6 pack especially with subscribe and save. Recommended.

review/summary: Great taste, but not very spicy!
review/text: My family loves spicy foods, so I was anxious to try this.  The flavor is very good, but Jalapeno? I would say this has a spice level of zero.  Even my toddler could eat it. BUT, it has a wonderful flavor, and was quite good on tacos.  Then we tried it again as a topping on baked enchiladas, and it was super!  This would be really good as a dip for jalapeno poppers or even chicken fingers.<br />Would I buy it again? Yes! But I'll just toss in some fresh chopped jalapenos, and make it really good!

review/summary: Not so bold, but it is creamy
review/text: There isn't a lot to say about this sauce.  It is supposed to be bold, but is still fairly mild for those that don't like spicy food as much.  It has good creamy flavor and maybe tastes a bit like sour cream or even mayo with some spiciness mixed in.  I prefer making this type of sauce to get the level of hotness I like, but I still like the flavor.  It would be good spread on the top of some homemade enchiladas or used anytime you want a cream sauce with a bit of spice.

review/summary: Cheap and bland
review/text: First of all I hate Mayo... any recipe that calls for mayo I substitute ranch dressing.  I like Mexican food and I love spicy things... but I don't eat fast food and especially don't go to taco bell.  I wasn't sure if I would like this sauce or not... but figured what the heck, I dig jalapenos.<br /><br />This is runny like a dressing but without the flavor... the flavoring reminded me of a very bland peppercorn ranch, the store brand.  I hated it on my tacos because it tasted too much like mayo.  We tried it as a chip dip but it was too bland to add anything but moisture to the chips.  I couldn't figure out what to use it for until I made some chicken salad, and rather than subbing ranch, I subbed this stuff.  It was alright, made for a nice change but isn't anything I would ever buy again.<br /><br />I didn't sense any jalapeno flavoring to this, it really tasted like a cheap discount brand ranch dressing.  It was not spicy so I would guess some people may like it on a sandwich.  After reading the label I discovered there was no health benefit to subbing this for ranch or mustard so you would just really have to like the flavor.<br /><br />This wasn't to my flavor.

review/summary: Least favorite of the new Taco Bell Sauces
review/text: I have actually tried all three new Taco Bell Sauces, the Jalape&ntilde;o which I am reviewing now, and also the Spicy Ranchero and the Chipotle sauces.<br /><br />Of the three, the Jalapeno is my least favorite because it has the flavor that seems to miss the mark.  It's got a little spice in a creamy base but it just doesn't seem to mesh together well.  Maybe because it's refridgerated and if it's going to be creamy and spicy I'd prefer to have it warm.  It just does not seem to work well and I can't figure out what food this sauce would taste best with.  The label says to use it on Taco Salads and tacos and things like that.  And you could use it on fries.... but I am not sure that it would taste all that great considering there are so many other options.  I would urge you to try one of the other two new Taco Bell sauce flavors first, the Spicy Ranchero or the Chipotle.  Both of those were much better in my opinion.<br /><br />The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle. You have to store upside down in the fridge or be forced to really shake the bottle to get the sauce to be forced down the the top. Sauces are thicker than traditional salad dressings.

review/summary: Hot and Spicy but Not Too Hot
review/text: This new sauce by Taco Bell is certainly tasty. What it has going for it, at least for me, is that it is hot and spicy but it does not make sweat pop out on my forehead, something that often happens when I bite into a real jalapeno pepper. I am at a loss, however, as to what to serve it with. I tried it with tortilla triangles, but something was missing. The suggestion on the bottle is that it is "a perfect finishing touch for your tacos, Meixcan salads and sandwich wraps." These possibilities do not appeal to me either. If you can figure out what to eat this really tasty sauce with, you should be quite happy with it.

review/summary: If you like Ranch Dressing with a kick you will like this.
review/text: First of all I have to say I personally do not like Ranch dressing and that is what this tastes like with a little zing of jalapeno. So for me this is just OK but if you are a big Ranch fancier then you will probably love this. It's not hot just a little spicy. It's not bad even for a non Ranch liker and it is surprising how it compared in nutrition to mayonnaise, not bad except for the cholesterol and sodium yet lower in fat and calories go figure. The bottle is small at only 8 ounces so it won't go far as a salad dressing. This would be good when you just need a little extra something on a wrap or maybe on a Philly cheese steak. Here is the breakdown compared to Hellmann's real mayo:<br /><br /> 2T.serving---  Mayo---  Taco Bell jalapeno<br />Calories:  180---  110<br />Total Fat:  20gr---  11gr<br />Sat fat  4gr---  1.5gr<br />Chol  10mg---  20mg<br />sodium  180---  310<br /><br />Give it a try especially if you love Ranch dressing, it's not bad. I am just not big on Ranch but thats just my taste.

review/summary: Jalapeno minus lip blister-Nutrition similar to Lt. Mayo
review/text: TASTE:<br />There is a reason why BOLD & CREAMY are caps and Jalapeno is lowercase lettering on the label. This is a creamy mayo-like sauce and bolder than any mayo. The Jalapeno is not bold, it's a hint, but it does grow as you consume more sauce. This Jalapeno carries almost identical labels as the Taco Bell bold & Creamy Chipotle. There's little difference, other than the different peppers included. Both also add red & green bell. So it's merely a matter of choice, and color. I like Chipotle for taste, but green Jalapeno will serve fine on the relish tray at Christmas.<br /><br />HEALTH:<br />You can't buy a manufactured "sauce" that your doctor will endorse. So if you're lucky, not on a low salt, calorie, fat, etc. diet, this may prove to be a staple on the condiment shelf of the fridge. Being a nutrition facts reader, I compared Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Sauces against a favorite Chipotle Mayo and Mayo LIGHT, all four being products under the KRAFT label. You have to adjust for serving sizes, but by the tablespoon, the Bell Sauces are only 15 cal ahead of the Chipotle Reduced Fat Mayo and 10 over the Light Mayo. Other label amounts are similar in comparison, hardly significant in a difference when compared with the Daily Percent Values. Thus I was surprised to find that anyone using the Light Mayo or other products promoted on the labels as "LESS FAT" could almost as healthily use the Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Sauces.<br /><br />RECIPE:<br />Fry pre-baked potatoes with cooking spray after slicing thick, adding half a bell pepper, onion, and a bit of Feta cheese. Top your plate's serving with the sauce of your choice. I like it for a hearty breakfast with dry toast and a fruit.

review/text: I'm not sure what a Jalapeno sauce is supposed to taste like, but this one isn't as spicy as something with 'Jalapeno' in the title would imply. It does have a nice light Jalapeno and creamy flavor, which isn't too bad, just not my favorite taste. It seems more suited as an accompanying flavor than a primary sauce. I found it was fairly tasty spread on sandwiches along with another sauce, such as BBQ sauce.

review/text: On the plus side, my dog adores these (but then again she adores just about anything that isn't a mushroom).  But, on a Jackie scale of 1 (delicious) to 10 (super-duper-climb-on-the-counter-yummy-delicious) this appears to be an 9.03.  She Really Likes These.<br /><br />For a training treat, they will break up easily.  For a snack in the dish, they are not messy (even when A Certain Dog runs away with it in her mouth to munch down elsewhere).  It is a quick snack though, definitely  not a chew.<br /><br />Some dog treats are stinky or disagreeable, but these are not...except that in the old packaging (the photo still up on Amazon) it is NOT clear this is a lung treat.  My husband is having a severe case of 'yuck' over these and I would not have bought them if it had been clear, but in the mean time, the dog gets to enjoy this bag.<br /><br />Speaking of the packaging, it does appear to have changed.  The Merrick website shows this treat as having a recall, but what arrived was NOT part of the recall (it was a theoretical risk, no ill dogs reported).  The new packaging also makes it more obvious it's a lung product.<br /><br />Overall, recommended, but do not be surprised by the Lung content and by the change in package.  I am taking my dog's word for it (so to speak) that these are quite delicious.<br /><br />JTG

The majority of the pasta's we tried were mushy - yuk.  But Hearland's pasta products are far from that.  They are the closest thing to "real" pasta that we have found.  We can even eat them as left-overs, which we could not do with the mushy pasta's.  I used to buy Heartland's pasta's at Wal Mart at a much cheaper price than I am buying it at Amazon for, but they stopped carrying it.  It is worth the exta money that it costs not to settle for mushy pasta, though.

Anyway, I prepared the spirals with grilled chicken and an olive oil garlic sauce. It was delicious! I even fed it to my family members who are not gf and do everything to avoid gluten free foods as much as possible. No one even suspected that the pasta was gluten free. It was the perfect tenderness, and had the look and taste of ordinary wheat pasta. If you cook gluten free, and you are a pasta fan, don't pass this item up! It is affordable enough to feed the whole family, and tastes great! I plan to make cold pasta salad with it this afternoon, which will be a first since I became g free. I'll let you know how it turns out!

review/text: This is the best GF pasta on the market. I have tried most others and have been disappointed. This taste just like regular pasta. The box says made in Italy so I wonder if that means no GMO. That would be an added bonus.

review/summary: Taste just like wheat pasta!!! Al dente and stays together!!
review/text: I put this pasta to the test...fed it to my 4 kids & husband!!!! No one noticed that it was any different than the wheat pasta we usually buy! I didn't tell anyone until after dinner was over! I'm on a gluten-free diet and really didn't want to have to make two separate pots of pasta...now I don't have to! ONLY NEGATIVE: it's probably made with GMO corn :(  Only reason for the 4 stars! I wish they made it an organic/GMO-free variety! For that reason, I probably wouldn't use this pasta more than 2-3/month. I try to keep GMO foods to a bare minimum in our house!

review/summary: The best GF pasta!!!!
review/text: We actually found out about this brand while dining at a restaurant that offered GF penne pasta. When we got the dish we called our waiter and told him we believe they made a mistake and served us the regular pasta instead of the GF pasta and the chef came out with the pasta wrap so we can see for ourselves.  Needless to say that was the end of the rest of the brands 'try outs'. It can't get better tan this.

review/text: This is great pasta!  I did homemade Mac & Cheese with this; tasted great!  I wish they had elbow macaroni, but that is just tradition.  There is no aftertaste and I kept eating some as it was cooking.  I expected it to slightly resemble cardboard, but it tasted like real pasta!!!!  This was the very first GF pasta I tried and I'm glad I tried this.  You find this online or at Walmart...it's actually cheaper at Walmart.  I highly recommend it!!!!  My family enjoyed it :)

review/text: I first found these at Wal-mart, but I have moved and can't find them in my area, so I'm glad to be able to get them on Amazon.  I am very gluten intolerant, so this is a life saver for me.  I use it in homemade chicken soup and just with spaghetti sauce.  It holds up well in soup.  It's got a great texture and taste.  My whole family likes it and can't tell the difference from real wheat pasta.

review/summary: Great Gluten Free Pasta at a great price
review/text: I found this GF pasta at WMart recently, and since it was inexpensive ($2.99) I bought a couple of bags. We had it last night for dinner. I was really suprised! It was firm (almost too aldente) and had a nice flavor. When compared to DeBoles it is no contest; Heartland wins. Tinkyada is what we normally buy, but with the price of Heartland & good taste I think I would choose it over Tinkyada for the pastas that are similar in shape. I only saw the Penne at WM, so Amazon has a better variety.<br /><br />I still will buy Tinkyada GF Pasta for shapes I need that I have not found in Heartland.

review/summary: Crackers are GREAT, Expiration date is not
review/text: PROS - Wheat Thin Reduced Fat crackers taste great for a low fat cracker! We've tried other low fat brand crackers and think this one is the best low fat.<br /><br />CONS - This is not a con for the cracker, but for AMAZON. Ordered the pack of 6 with the Subscribe & Save special price. Received the crackers on 1/26/11... BUT, the Best Used/Expiration date on the crackers is 2/20/11, in just 24 days!! So they've been sitting in a warehouse for a long time.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE - The crackers and price were very good; but beware of possible short expiration dates on food when ordering from Amazon, especially if it's multiple packs and you might not use them right away.

review/summary: Good price, bad expiration date
review/text: The price was awesome, much cheaper than what I'd pay in the grocery store, so that's good. The crackers themselves are also good, crunchy and wheaty with a little salt... basically what you'd expect from Wheat Thins. On the downside, the expiration date on them was about 15 days away when I recieved my six pack of these, that was a huge letdown. Honestly it's not like this is the type of product where the expiration date has to be taken extremely seriously, I mean it's not like it's eggs or milk, but at the same time I'm disappointed that Amazon would send me six boxes of these when they're just about to expire. So overall, good price, good product, and shame on whoever decided it's alright to pack these up and ship them out when they're days away from expiring.

review/summary: much too salty
review/text: This mushroom bruschetta is extremely salty - too salty to taste any actual flavor. I definitely do not recommend it.<br /><br />The jars are tiny, so think twice how you feel about spending over four dollars on a small 6-ounce jar.<br /><br />Apparently food returns are not allowed on Amazon, even if the packaging is still intact. I contacted customer service about the remaining 3 jars that I never touched, because they are really too expensive for me just to discard (and I certainly would not feel comfortable giving away something so inedible to friends and family), so we'll see if anything comes out of that.<br /><br />But again, unless you are familiar with this flavor and are sure that you will be able to eat it, you might want to refrain from ordering a pack of four.

review/text: When I initially opened the package, I was disappointed. I thought the bones would be larger; I guess the picture made them seem bigger, but the dimensions are clearly listed so shame on me. I opened the first bone and gave it to my 17 month pitbull boxer mix puppy who loves to chew. He went to town on it almost immediately so I guess it tasted good and that's why I gave it three stars. However, it lasted only about 30 minutes before the bone was completely gone. Given a "do-over," I would pay the same amount for one larger, longer lasting bone. These bones would probably be best for a smaller, not powerful chewer.

review/summary: Where have you been all my life?!?
review/text: Hello. My name is Rachel, and I'm a chocoholic. I have a little bit of chocolate at least once a day. My mom actually introduced me to this product and I've not been able to put it down since. She discovered it in France where I guess it's a pretty hot item.<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I love this product. It's creamy and smooth. About the consistancy of peanut butter. It has a rich creamy chocolaty taste with a hint of hazel nut. It's great on crescents, wheat or white bread, crackers, it goes well with peanut butter, it's good on fruit like pears, apples, or banana's. If you like chocolate, you will more than likely like this product.<br /><br />The down side is chocolate, in general, usually contains a lot of calories. However, new research has shown that moderate consumption can actually have health benifits. So, go ahead and enjoy your chocolate, but in moderation.  :)

Everyone I've ever introduced to this sublime treat has never turned down seconds (or thirds).<br /><br />We're not talking American dry, crumbly, pasty chocolate here. We're talking high quality, smooth as butter, European milk chocolate. It doesn't get any better than this! :) Buy one jar, you'll be hooked for life!

I've always loved peanut butter and while this is similar it's definitely sweeter, but with a peanut butter like consistency.  maybe just slightly thicker.  Works well on various types of toast but on toasted, breakfast style bread it's amazing and turns bread into more of a pastry/sandwich, however you'd like to look at it.  Overall quite satisfied.

Nutella is  made with roasted hazelnuts, skim milk, and cocoa. There are over 50 hazelnuts in one jar of Nutella spread. Nutella is also a peanut free product. It doesn't even come in contact of peanuts during manufacturing.<br />I throw a party of my family today.<br />They tried the Nutella samples and loved them. Even my daughter loved the great hazelnut and cocoa taste.All and all my party was great. Everyone loved the Nutella spread. It definitely has changed the way we look at breakfast.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: So much easier on my babies tummy.
review/text: When we switch my daughter from nursing to eating her first solid foods we started with rice cereal.  The misery that caused will be forever emblazoned on my memory.  Colic, gas, and it backed her up right proper.<br /><br />My wife and I started researching alternatives on the Internet.  We found a bunch of references to how Barley was easier on a tummy.  That Barley soup/broth is often what is given to people recovering in hospitals etc...  I went to every local store looking for some.  Family and friends that had used it used to buy it locally.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  I found it here on Amazon and bought this pack of 12 boxes.<br /><br />We found rather strongly that this was much easier on my daughters tummy.  She continued to eat without distress after we made the switch.  We started using it just as cereal and then as she got older we started using it as a thickening agent and filler when mixed with pureed vegetables etc...  She liked things better when they were less runny and we liked things better when she was happy.<br /><br />We will be ordering more here shortly for the twins that have now joined our family.  For us it worked great.  I really do recommend it as a far better option that rice cereal.

review/summary: Always have this on hand
review/text: I keep Gerber 'Mixed' and 'Barley' on hand all the time. The 'mixed' consists of rice, oat and wheat so I mix a box of that with a box of the 'barley' and have a completely balanced breakfast cereal. I don't use it for people: I keep it handy for when the dogs have upset tummies and their regular food is too harsh on their digestive systems and they need soft, easy to digest food that fills them up and is healthy for them.  As their tummies return to normal, I reduce the baby cereal a bit and add in some of their normal foods and as they continue to improve, the baby cereal gets reduced while their normal foods eventually return to full bore.<br /><br />This is good for them, too, after dental cleanings/extractions, surgeries, when they need a little help in the 'bowel' department (fiber), or just as an added treat to change it up a bit in their daily diet.<br /><br />I have used this in place of bread crumbs when making a meatloaf (ok, I was desperate), but didn't care for the texture of the meatloaf once cooked. It was too soft for our liking, but still quite tasty.

review/summary: Wild Sardines review
review/text: These sardines are meaty and filling, and there is no fishy taste.  The additional of the olive oil and lemon makes a lot of difference.  They are delicious with crusty bread, or in a salad.  Sardines are listed in many reports as being extremely nutritious for the Omega 3s, plus they are an excellent protein source.

review/text: I got this for my wife the other day. There is a large variety of "tastes" available and the on-line price is very reasonable as compared to purchasing it at "Whole Foods" or some other natural food store. The sardines are not "fishy" tasting and they are fresh. Other pluses to this product is the fact that they are sustainably caught. My wife particularly likes that they offer the Olive oil and Lemon option. I would recommend this product anytime.

review/summary: Eat a Sandwich; Save the Planet
review/text: Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about. Unless of course BPA free packaging is your primary purchase criterion. If so, buy em now and don't read any further.<br /><br />If not there are some issues to be aware of...<br /><br />I understand that Wild Planet is the brand. But what about the "wild" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that there's no other kind, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Then there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're "sustainably caught along the California coast". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are "processed in Viet Nam". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, "These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, "Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk...". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these "delicious meaty portions" are "cleaned and scaled". Buyer beware: this is quite different from "skinless and boneless". "Cleaned" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. The lemon juice in which they're packed adds a bit of zip, but these babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but "aqueous natural smoke" that they're treated with...

review/summary: Wild Planet Sardines
review/text: I decided to give sardines a chance after reading about how high they were in omegas, protein and calcium.  My mother has been eating them for years as has one of my co-workers who swears by them for her health- she is a straight up fitness guru.  Initially I was a bit apprehensive that sardines might be too fishy, smelly and salty.  However, to my surprise they were fresh tasting (really surprised by the reviews that said they were metallic and fishy) and not really fishy at all -no more than eating smoked salmon. What I liked was that they are very lightly smoked, packed in extra virgin olive oil with a little sea salt, are in a certified BPA free can had all recognizable and minimal extra ingredients and were sustainably caught.  They tasted nothing like I expected and I will definitely buy this brand again.  It is really hard finding sardines or many other foods in a BPA free can and this company is really thinking about the health of it's consumers.  I will stock up on these when at the store next.

review/text: I had never had sardines before, and these are the only ones I've tried so I can't make comparisons.  I am pleased with how tasty they are, and my 11 month old son likes them too!  They are pretty "fishy" if you don't like fish, but I like fish and find these pretty mild.  I like having the skin and bones, there's lots of nutrition in there and it turns out I like the crunch.  They do look revolting though.  I knew sardines were tiny fish in a can, and was relieved to see that they do remove the heads and guts.

They are also from domestically caught fish, and even though canned in Asia, the cans are BPA-free which is not common in the industry. The lemon juice helps a great deal with keeping your breath fresh (usually an issue with sardines) and the lemon slice found in each can is an added and very enjoyable bonus.

review/summary: Company NOT allergy conscious
review/text: I purchased this product for my daughter with multiple food allergies.  The ingredients listed were all things she could have.  Unfortunately, the ingredients list is inaccurate.  I checked both amazon's list and the ingredients list on the company website.  Neither listed citric acid, which can be a corn derivative, but it was listed on the box when I received it.  Corn is one of my daughter's allergens, so I could not feed her this product without knowing the source of the citric acid used.  I have tried calling the company for a week and keep being told an ingredients specialist will call me back, but they NEVER do.  I have written the company via the contact us form on the website, but no one will contact me to give me the information I need to know.  Fortunately, amazon.com was very helpful and issued me a refund, but Bremner cannot be trusted if you have food allergy questions.  I am very upset at the lack of concern from this company.  Those with corn allergies or citric acid sensitivities should not purchase this product.  The ingredients list really needs to mention this!  I will not purchase any Bremner products in the future.

review/summary: Tips
review/text: 1) Price: Should be about $25. Amazon doesn't always stock this themselves, so be careful. Some other merchants try to charge upwards of $35 plus shipping on top of that. (Should say at top "Ships from and sold by Amazon".)<br /><br />2) Add lots of sweetened coconut directly to the pudding mix. Makes the filling go from pretty good to awesome.<br /><br />3) Cook & Serve - Be careful when opening the box. Last case I ordered actually had two boxes of no-cook randomly mixed in (weird right?).<br /><br />4) Availability - This is old school. I can't find it anywhere but online.<br /><br />5) Flavor - I'm big on coconut pies. They are my fave. I've only ever had two "from scratch" pies that beat this pudding with coconut mixed directly into it. My tastebuds give it 8 out of 10. Note: In runs a bit on the sweeter side of the spectrum.<br /><br />Enjoy / Good Luck.

review/summary: Merrick cow ear
review/text: I ordered one of these cow ears for my dog, and they seem to be very high quality- much better than some other cheap, generic ones. It has a lighter texture than rawhide. However, mine had what seemed to be a blue tattoo on it. I'm assuming that was used for identification on the cow, not added during processing. Also, my dog would not chew this. I even smeared peanut butter on it, but he just licked that out of the crevices and then ignored the actual cow ear. But, my dog is the one who won't eat rawhide or bully sticks either. I'm guessing dogs who like these types of chews would love this. My dog is just a bit weird. So- 4 stars for quality; 1 for (picky) pet satisfaction

review/summary: Spookylicious Pop-Tarts: A Cautionary Tale.
review/text: Spookylicious Pop-Tarts: A Cautionary Tale.<br /><br /> Once upon a time, a long time ago in the far away land of last October, a good wife and a bad husband bought Halloween Pop-Tarts and they were spooktacular.<br /><br />Upon first bite these pop-tarts were deemed good and right and even more than that, delicious.The good wife and the bad husband agreed to split these pop-tarts which consisted of 6 packs containing 2 each. The box can only hold 12 of these seasonal delights.<br /><br />"Fair is fair, said the good wife, and even split is just the thing."<br /><br />Husband agreed in an instant, but after eating these delicious Spookylicious Pop-Tarts the husband could not contain is greed. Lost in magic and sugary delight the bad husband quickly finished his 3 packs. It took less than a week but he  hungrily ate all 6 tarts without a thought as to what he would do when they were finished. He was not satisfied. Meanwhile, the good wife slowly enjoyed her pop-tarts savoring each and every one of them enjoying them through the whole month of October, unlike her husband who had stuffed his face and finished his all too fast.<br /><br />The good wife is a nurse, and it is her job was to see new babies arrive safely into the world. As is the nature of babies they will come when they will and given that October is a rich month for births, it is with no shock that the good wife was whisked away to work for 5 days straight, as stork after stork arrived with bundles full of new born babes. With great care the good wife unwrapped each bundle and helped bring joy to many new mothers and fathers across the land.<br /><br />At home the bad husband stalked the kitchen greedily licking his chops as he stared at the final packet of Spookylicious Pop-Tarts they were the only two that remained. On the 3rd straight day of work  for the wife, the husband's food stuffs had food ran short.  With the wife so busy at work she was unable to complete her duties and do the shopping, this meant the husband had grown hungry and weak. On this terrible day the husband's will ran as short as the food supply, without further though the husband strode into the kitchen, threw open the cupboards and set upon on the pop-tarts, scarfing them down with no thought of his wife's disappointment, his broken word, or the the folly that would surely follow.<br /><br />When the good wife arrived home on the morning of the 6th day, she was famished delivering babies is exhausting work and leads to a powerful appetite. When she went to the kitchen to fetch spooky treat, the cupboard was bare. She exclaimed in shock "Husband we have been robbed, someone has stolen my last packet of  my special pop-tarts."<br /><br />The husband grunted and went to the kitchen,  "Don't be ridiculous, you silly girl. I ate the last tasty tart."<br />"No" gasped the wife, we agreed to split them fair and square. The bad husband laughed a bellowing laugh as he rubbed his all too full stomach. "Calm yourself woman" he said "I will hunt you down more Pop-Tarts, fear not your famine will soon be over, it is not as if these are the last Halloween Pop-Tarts in the land. The bad husband  had no idea just how wrong he was.<br /><br />The  good wife could only nod as she was far too hungry and weak from lack of tasty Halloween pop-tarty treats.<br /><br />The bad husband looked at the sad state of his good wife and in that moment he felt guilt, and remorse for what he had done. He took what was not his, and he broke his word.  He knew his wife was good and deserved better, so he resigned himself to hunting for more of these seasonal treats. He would make good on his word no matter what the cost, but in the dark secret place of the bad husbands mind he also knew this would mean more Spookylicious Pop-Tarts for him. He tried to push away the thought but couldn't. We must be careful for what is easily made is hard to unmake. The husband set out and made haste, leaving his good wife with an empty stomach. The wife could hardly sleep for the hunger pains stabbed at her terribly The good wife had worked 5 days straight and was so exhausted that despite the hunger and disappointment sleep did take immediately take her. Her last thought was that her husband would do right, and would make good on his promise, and it was this thought that finally eased he enough to let sleep come, but it was not to be.<br /><br />husband despite his bad ways, did search long and hard. Every Grocer in the land was called on, and everyone had the same tale. "Alas poor Sir" they said, "Spookylicious Pop-Tarts are a might popular and tasty as you obviously know. We have sold through our stock and surplus. We expect no more shipments." The bad husband raged, "But it is only 17th day of October, we still have a fortnight of this cursed month. What will we fill our stomach with if not SPOOKTACULAR POP-TARTS?" Despite his anger, despite his threats no grocer could help him, the husband would have to return home with only another broken promise in hand.<br /><br />When finally he returned to his home, he paced dreading the moment his goodly wife would awake, dreading the moment where he would have to explain. A short time later she awoke and brought herself from her chambers and came to him. She beamed, joy and expectation shining in her face "Hello my good husband, did you find them, did you do as you said you would?" The bad husband frowned at her, she knew the truth before the words were spoken, Her smile faltered and turned upon itself and became a frown. The husband did not speak, he only stared at his feet as if they might offer up some advice. He dare not break the silence. The good wife was not afraid of the silence and so she spoke and said, ' it is okay my dear, I can just have something else." She had released him from his promise but the not from her disappointment. He tried to attend her, The bad husband asked, "Are you okay?" Her response was the practiced lie that every woman is taught as a young girl. "I'm Fine, she lied. With those words the husband knew his fate It would be another full turn of the seasons before another batch of Spookylicious Pop-tarts could be had and the year would be long, and cold, but he must endure.<br /><br />10 Months later<br /><br />10 months ago on that weary October morning the once good and kind wife had a shadow placed on her and in that shadow her normal kindness was dulled and her warm and tender nature frosted. The good wife that the Husband remembered was almost gone, the shadow wife had grow prominent and with her prominence  came many joke and jibes about Spookylicious Pop-tarts and the husbands greed, his weakness and his failures. These thorns had been brought to bear on the husband by the wife for reasons the he could not fathom. No friend was spared the tale of the husbands misdeed either, every guest was regaled and delighted by the loathsome tale. Husband bore this shame as foil wrapped treat on his heart, but with the dawn of harvest, the husband would soon  be able to lay his shame down and reap his forgiveness. Husband had a plan and began his search early. He looking high and low, questioning every grocer but none knew if the Spookylicious Pop-Tarts would ever return. This was troubling news for Husband he began to despair. The key to the life he once knew lay in a box of foil wrapped seasonal delight. Husband must find them no matter what the cost.  Days went by and September shrank into nothingness and finally the calendar turned and the date read October 1st. The formerly bad husband had become thoroughly desperate as no  Spooktacular Pop-Tarts seemed destined to appear.  As the sun plunged behind the mountains finding it's nightly resting place he knew what he had to do. In a  delirious rush he ran for the Electric Church, on the plinth at the base of the alter Husband  prayed to the Great Trader. His prayer rang out with a  clickety click click clak, "Great Trader hear my prayers and deliver me from the sorrow I have wrought upon my family and deliver unto me with the power of prime an answer.<br /><br />What happened next, none could say<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Kelloggs-Spookylicious-Tarts-Limited-Editon/dp/B005WBETRC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1349143571&sr=8-1&keywords=halloween+pop-tarts<br /><br />Moral of the Story: Don't eat your wife's last pop-tart or you may spend the next year stalking the cereal and seasonal aisle of every grocery store and target you enter. I know these pop-tarts were reissued but for whatever reason never made it to my area of California. As a last resort to end the constant ridicule I did indeed pay nearly $20 for a box of Pop-Tarts.<br /><br />This account is mostly true,  my wife is awesome, and I did eat the last pop-tart. The parts of this story that aren't true are how my wife reacted. She has teased me for a whole year and yes, she has told our friends but never ever in a mean spirited fashion. These Poptarts are really good and I hope you buy some.

review/summary: Surprising Hit at My House for Halloween........
review/text: My daughter loved these poptarts with a Halloween theme.  We have now purchased the chocolate fudge Poptarts because she liked these so much.  I bought these as well for my niece and all my nephews who love Poptarts as well, some of whom are poptart deprived.  I just hope they liked as much as my daughter and husband.

review/summary: So much less gas
review/text: Every baby is different, but for us, Similac is a much better fit than Enfamil. Babies are gassy and formula will give them gas, but there is no blood curdling screaming or writhing in pain with Similac like there was with Enfamil.

review/summary: Similac formula
review/text: The product is fine but<br />I was disappointed with the shipment<br />I ordered six containers of this product & I was shipped about 16 of the sample tins<br />the formula amount was the same the packaging is annoying<br />if I order the six containers I expect to receive the same packaging<br />as what I ordered not sample sizes. These sample size containers are not for resale either<br />I don't think I will order from amazon for this product again

review/summary: Works Well for Us
review/text: This formula works really well for our baby.  We've been using it for the last 7 months, since our baby was born, and haven't had any issues with it so far  The powder in this size is more economical than the other Similac options, especially when purchased as a 6-pack.  However, if we were to have a water emergency (has happened in our area before!), we would be SOL with only the powder option, so we always make sure to have a couple of 6-packs of the premade liquid formula on hand, too.

review/summary: It's Similac.
review/text: My first child didn't do well with Similac Advance, had to go soy based for him. The second one seems fine with it.  The pricing on Amazon is regularly the lowest I can find it without having to jump through hoops: finding coupons, waiting for local sales, driving all over town. Time is money. Point. Click. Order. It shows up in bulk. If your kid likes Similac and you value your time, order some right now!

review/summary: Great price
review/text: We recently switched to formula and I have been looking all over for the cheapest price on our preferred formula. This was the cheapest price that I found anywhere, including the manufacturer and local big box stores. My package came in the advertised packaging, unlike some other reviews. I was very happy with the price, the product, and the value.

review/summary: Good formula good price UPDATE: Good formula NOT a good price
review/text: My breast milk wasn't coming in while we were still in the hospital so my baby came home on this formula until my milk came in.  It was easy for him to digest and he thrived on it.  He lost a lot of weight in the hospital because my milk wasn't coming in.  Being on this formula for a little over a day made him gain enough weight that the pediatrician felt comfortable discharging him to go home.<br /><br />Now my milk came in but my baby won't breast feed from being bottle fed for so long.  After pumping for 3 1/2 months and trying to take care of a developmentally delayed 3 year old with no one to help me I am giving up pumping and my baby will be formula fed again.  Needless to say I will be using this formula again since I know it was easy for him to digest and he thrived on it.  I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />edited 8/29/09:  When I wrote the comment "good price" the seller on this link was amazon.com and the price was $[...].  It's still excellent formula but with a coupon it's probably cheaper to get from your local store.  We also tend to find lots of sales at local stores.

review/summary: Similac Advance
review/text: I ordered Similac Advanced for my newborn on the recommendation of my sister (she had used it for her daughter) and of my mother (she had used it for me when I was a baby many years ago). My daughter tolerated it extremely well and within the first month, when other newborns lose weight, she has gained one kg!!! Overall I am extremely happy with it and will continue feeding my daughter with Similac for her whole first year. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E534MG">Similac Advance Early Shield, Formula, Powder, 23.2-Ounces (Pack of 6)</a>

review/text: after comparing prices, this came to be $21.33  each, this seems to be a better deal afterall, although not too much of a difference but even a little helps in term of saving.  Unless you have similac coupon, this is so far the cheapest i can find.
