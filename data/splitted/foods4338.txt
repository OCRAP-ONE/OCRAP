review/summary: Best Bagged Tea I Have Ever Had!!
review/text: One of my favorite things in this world is black tea.  I do not drink coffee or fruity teas.. but I love a simple cup of black tea. I have struggled to find a good full-bodied tea in the form of a tea bag... until now. I enjoy my tea with milk and sugar and when the milk is added, the tea has an inviting gold color to it.. which must be where it gets its name.  My best friend (also a picky tea drinker) puts honey in her tea and she said this tea is amazing with honey also.  So no matter how you like your tea, I promise you can't go wrong with Yorkshire Gold!  I can guarentee your typical store bought teas (Tazo, Bigolow, Lipton) will pale in comparison to this tea.. you will love it! I look forward to having a cup every morning.  You get the great taste of loose leaf tea but in the convenience of a tea bag.  I am so glad I found this tea! :)

review/text: Some time ago I got to try this tea when my mother brought it from England.<br />I absolutely loved it and as I could not find it locally, decided to order from Amazon.<br />This is the best tea I ever tasted, hands down, strong, rich and great with milk.

review/summary: Best Tea Ever
review/text: I've been drinking hot tea for years now, but this is the best I've ever had. This tea has an EXTREMELY strong flavor, and the caffeine content is plentiful... If you need an extra kick in your day, this is the tea you're looking for. I don't see why there is any point in messing with loose teas, when you can find a quality bagged tea like this. I find that the best brewing times is 3 minutes, and if I go over that, this tea can turn slightly bitter.

review/summary: The best black tea I have had in the last 20 years
review/text: I am from the British West Indies, where we constantly drink hot tea, regardless of the heat.<br /><br />When my family moved to the States we were horrified by the bitter, harsh "Lipton" teas served everywhere.  Disgusting! No wonder everybody drinks coffee and colas.  After several years I settled on Tetley "British blend" which was decent, not great, and varied in taste and quality from batch to batch.  I also consoled myself with many high quality herbal teas that you CAN find here in New Jersey.<br /><br />Anyway, to make a long story short, somebody gave me a box of this tea as a gift, and it is hands-down the best black tea that I've had since childhood.  One bag, steeped in one tea cup for 3.5 minutes, sugar (or Splenda when I feel fat)  and about 3 tablespoons of evaporated milk is the most enjoyable part of my morning.<br /><br />Well I ran out today and frantically searched the internet for it.  Thank God Amazon sells it!

review/text: I am a tea drinker and this is my 2nd box (subscribe and save) and I must say that the tea is very good.  The only thing is that I use a mug for my tea and as this says it's a 2 cup teabag it must meant the small teacups since it won't make 2 cups on a mug.  Overall great price for some UK tea.  Hope this helps.

review/summary: My favorite morning brew
review/text: My morning doesn't start until I've had my 20 oz. mug of Yorkshire Gold.  It's the perfect everyday tea.  It's a robust black tea blend that brews up dark and strong with good body and without much tannin.  The malty flavor is courtesy of the Assam in the blend.  Takes milk (or half & half or cream!) well.  Good value for money in the 16-count box.

review/summary: The best cuppa
review/text: An English acquaintance gave me just one piece of good advise many years ago, "If you want real English tea, you must find Yorkshire Gold." I've tried a lot of English and Irish brands up to that point, but some of the teas seemed to be geared towards yanks - hence weak, characterless and mass produced; others were unbalanced or too strong. Taylors Yorkshire Gold is well balanced, clean, deep and pure with a beautiful tawny color. This is really best all-around cuppa out there. Depending upon where you live it can be nearly impossible to find YG, so it's nice to be able to buy it through Amazon at an awesome price.

You can make an entire pot of tea on one tea bag (steep it for like 7-8 minutes and it's delicious) and easily make multiple cups of tea on one used repeatedly.<br />In short, just try it. You won't regret it.<br />Really.<br />I mean it.<br />I live off this stuff.

I looked forward to having this whether in the late afternoon when back after a long day touring, to warm-up on the cold/wet rock of an island or when first up in the morning.  I went to several grocery stores to find Yorkshire Gold and made my purchase to bring this back home.  When I went to look for this at my locale stores it wasn't carried.  Specialty stores charged an outrageous price.  Thanks to Amazon ... I don't have to worry about going without this gem!

review/text: I couldn't agree more with the rest of the reviewers.  I am American, but have visited and have family in England.  And everyone is right, English tea is better.  I love America, but they have better tea!! (I loved that comment regarding the American Revolution/Boston Tea Party!! Oh, yeah, our Founding Fathers were brave to give up tea like this!  That must have been PAINFUL!!!)  :)<br /><br />Relatives from the UK have sent me tea for decades and I really enjoyed every tea that I was fortunate to have received.  But it wasn't like this one.<br /><br />I stumbled across it in Whole Food's market and just tried it on the whim and IT'S THE BEST TEA I'VE EVER HAD.  It is malty, and it's definitely malt - but not overpowering.  It's a very warm and relaxing, decidedly "British" comfort-malt that does go with milk and sugar.  I tried it once with imported short bread cookies and promptly went into a tea drinkers coma.<br /><br />And I love that we could buy it in bulk!  It's not that easy to find in stores.<br /><br />And this price is delightfully reasonable - far less than you'll see in stores.  I've seen it for almost $7.00 per 40 bag box - so this really is a deal.  I'm glad that I'm not the only one who "snapped it up". :)

review/summary: Another strong black "British" tea...
review/text: This isn't a bad tea at all. Another one of the strong, robust black teas we expect in a "British" tea, and definitely able to hold up to the addition of milk and sugar. My only issue with Taylors Yorkshire Gold is that it tastes a tad more astringent than its competitors - and that's not just something that I have observed in one or two batches.<br /><br />This tea not as rounded in flavor as, for example, Ty-phoo but not as unidimensional either as, say Tetley's. "British" blends aren't as bright or sharp as some of the Ceylon teas (if you want bright, try Twining's Ceylon) but I can definitely see why lots of people love this tea.

review/summary: Good, but strong
review/text: Personally, I would give this five stars. However. This isn't...ahem, 'everyone's cup of tea'. To my family, they thought it had a intolerable bitter and strong taste to it, when there are no additives. Not unlike those who seek more spicy foods, I sought for more flavor in my tea, and this was it. Now, I cannot be satisfied by Lipton's plain ol' black tea.<br /><br />Also, I've noticed that it becomes tolerable to my family when I brew the tea bag a second time. (Them Brits will probably pummel me for that) I have tasted it, and the flavor is still there, but not as overwhelming as the first brew. This may be the best way for some people; if they like it without complementary additions, but find it too strong.<br /><br />Note:<br />Why is this 4/5 stars?<br />Reply: That's because this isn't for everyone, unless of course, you add sugar and milk.

One bag will make a full pot for 2, about 8 tea cups. Any leftovers can be used the next day for iced tea. Just remove the bag before cooling.

review/text: It is great that I am able to purchase Yorkshire Gold Tea through Amazon.com. In the city in which we live the near-by grocery often doesn't have Yorkshire Gold Tea, so we have to drive across the city to their other store to make a purchase. Then we can find only a 40-count box, for nearly as much as it costs to purchase 160 bags through Amazon.com. A real bargain!

review/text: I am not a sophisticated tea drinker, but I have been trying to develop my appreciation for tea (mostly because I decided to give up coffee). I have tried Barry's, PG Tips, Typhoo, and the standard American fare. I ordered Yorkshire Gold because I heard it referenced on Homeland (Showtime). Since I'm a novice, any recommendation would do. Though my experience is limited, this is by far the most delicious tea I have tried. It is bold and strong but smooth and not at all bitter. I will continue to experiment, but I'm hard pressed to think I will find a more delicious tea.

This is a strong cup of tea, but much better than the black tea from the local supermarket.

review/summary: Really great tea. As a coffee replacement: 1 cup coffee = 2 cup tea
review/text: Bought this as a coffee replacement / substitute and very happy. Caffeine wise you are looking at 2:1 ratio with coffee (I drink strong coffee) to get the same effect i.e. 2 cups tea for every 1 cup of coffee.  If you drink weak coffee you may be satisfied with a 1:1 ratio.  There is another tea with more caffeine called PG Tips.  Brews bitter the longer it steeps.<br /><br />As far as flavor, it a subtle malty flavor and brews to an amber brown.  Great tea.<br /><br />Yorkshire: good caffeine, great flavor, can be bitter<br />PG Tips: great caffeine, ok flavor, not bitter, may need lemon/milk/sugar/etc

Shame, Shame on the makers of Prince of Peace!!!

review/summary: No caffeine kickback
review/text: Like others, I saw this product on the Dr. Oz show.  I decided to try it because I have not been able to drink coffee because of my blood pressure.  For some reason coffee messes with my head.  I started drinking this tea in the morning and noticed immediately that I felt alert all day.  In fact I have not had to take a nap for weeks.  I love the taste of this tea even though I usually only like flavored teas and not the regular flavor. This tea has the same texture as coffee and I like that. I also noticed that I don't have the caffeine kickback headache that I used to get if I didn't drink coffee everyday or at the same time.  Coffee also kept me awake some nights.  I don't have that problem with this tea.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  I even sent some to a tea drinking friend.  I was disappointed to find out that they had raised the price and I am trying to find it locally although shopping on Amazon is so convenient for me.

review/summary: GREAT LIGHT TASTING BLACK TEA
review/text: My sister recommended this tea to me after watching a Dr. Oz program and I decided to try it. I love teas of all kinds, especially flavored tea. This black tea is light in flavor and very refreshing as an ice tea. I have not tried it hot as yet but I am sure I will enjoy it just as well. It does help in keeping my blood sugar levels down and at the same time quenches my thirst and hunger. I drink it during a meal and then again about an hour after the meal as is recommended for fat burning purposes. I have not seen any significant results in the fat burning properties but then again all things do take a bit of time. I do like the purity of the tea and I was pleased to learn that Prince of Peace is a Christian company and I like the fact I am helping support a Christian business. If you like tea and enjoy black tea then I recommend this tea over any other.

review/summary: Think my Pu erh was bad
review/text: This is (was) my first time to try Pu erh so I have nothing to compare it to but from everything I read, it is supposed to aid in digestion which is just the opposite effect I got every time I drank it. Every time I have drank the tea, I get a pain in my diaphragm like I have to burp but can't. I thought it was something I ate so I tested the theory. I quit drinking the tea and felt okay, I have drank the tea every few days without changing anything else in my diet, and every time I have drank the tea the same thing occurs.<br /><br />Not sure if this has happened to anyone else while drinking this brand. I probably should buy some other Pu erh and try it but I'm a little hesitant now.

review/summary: You get what you pay for and maybe less!
review/text: Yes, PoP more than doubled the price of this tea after Dr. Mehmet Oz talked about it's health benefits, but the high-quality Pu-erh teas found elsewhere cost several times more, and for good reason.  Prince of Peace can barely get away with calling this Pu-erh because it is of such low quality.  If you really want to enjoy an exquisite cup of Pu-erh, try the higher quality loose or cake type Pu-erh.  It's a little more work to brew properly but the benefits and superior taste are well worth the cost and your time.  In a pinch, you can brew the tea leaves in a drip coffee maker.  When the brewing stops, carefully lift out the coffee filter with the wet leaves, tie it closed with a piece of string and hang it over the side of the pot so the packet is in the tea.  Steep it for 3 to 5 minutes on the heat plate of the coffee maker.<br /><br />As for the health benefits, I've never experienced such dramatic results so quickly.  The second day after I started drinking a better quality Pu-erh tea my high blood pressure was gone and so was my expensive prescription!  I was absolutely amazed at the fast results and an added benefit is that it is the best tasting tea on the planet.  I have never found any tea that has the natural sweetness of Pu-erh and the exotic, earthy taste is almost intoxicating.  I expected something this healthy to taste awful or, at best, tolerable but the opposite was true.  Some of the other health benefits may take longer to become obvious, but even if my lowered blood pressure is the only benefit that results from drinking this tea, I will be overjoyed.  If you've never tried it, do yourself a favor and shell out the bucks for the high-quality Pu-erh.  If you are drinking it to loose weight or burn fat, try brewing a 6-cup pot using equal parts Pu-erh, white and green teas.  They are all beneficial to your health and will help you attain your weight loss goals faster.  They taste great together too but you can drink them separately if you prefer.  Then drink a cup or two of chickweed tea in the afternoon to help remove the toxins from your colon.<br /><br />I wanted to give this product one star because of the low quality, but since it is Pu-erh and the taste is acceptable, I am giving it two stars.  If you want to try the better quality Pu-erh, buy a package from rishi-tea.com or teagarden.com. I like the option of buying different sized packages of tea offered by rishi-tea.com.  I also recommend the brewing instructions video on YouTube by Doctor Tea.  Try the real deal and you won't mind paying more.

review/text: I ordered this tea because I saw something on Dr. Oz about drinking Pu Erh tea as part of a weight loss tea drinking regimen. I liked the flavor of the tea. I did not however see the supposed weight loss effects of the whole tea drinking thing. I will not blame the tea for that, though. there are too many variables as to why I did not see the results. As for the tea, it seemed to be a little stronger than a regular black tea such as Lipton's or something comparable and I enjoyed that. I would definitely consider ordering this tea again when I finish the box I have.

It cost a few dollars more, and I thought maybe it's even better than this brand, but I was disappointed with the King of China brand.  The Prince of Peace tea has a darker, richer taste.  I will keep buying this (Prince of Peace) brand from now on.

review/summary: Shipper not reliable
review/text: I purchased this tea on the advice of Dr. Oz.  It, when combined with white tea, is supposed to increase the body's metabolism and help in weight loss.  I had reached a plateau after losing 65 pounds on Weight Watchers.  After drinking this mixture for one week, I had lost another four pounds.  I keep drinking it, and the weight continuing to drop.  As of today, 72 pounds gone.  I purchased my first shipment from Amazon.com.  It arrived almost a week after the promised delivery date.  I ordered another shipment to arrive well before the initial supply ran out.  I kept contacting the shipper and was promised delivery.  I found it elsewhere on line and cancelled my order, only to be told at that point that they were sold out of this tea.  Too bad.  It's the only time I have had a problem with shipping at Amazon.com.

review/text: These pops are truly delicious.  The shape of the pop also conforms to the inside of the mouth pretty well, so they're easy to eat.  The flavors are all distinct and there are several to choose from.  I wish they were a little less expensive, but I will order them again.

review/text: I was looking to buy "Chicklet" gum and this is actually "Double Bubble" brand gum. Gum is a lot harder to chew, which was no good for me since I have to chew "Chicklet" brand gum. "Chicklets" are a much softer gum consistency. And there were no near 1,000 pieces. Bag was very small. I would est. 500 pieces no more.

review/summary: These are RAW cashews.
review/text: These are raw, whole, natural, cashews. Much like raw almonds, they do not have the crunch of a roasted nut.<br /><br />So if you are used to Planters, or otherwise "roasted" cashews, you will be disappointed and more likely to call them "stale".  I love these because they aren't roasted, have no salt, and I can actually taste what cashews are supposed to taste like.<br /><br />2 pounds of cashews look like more than you think. At this price - you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I eat a lot of raw cashews (mainly when I'm trying to diet) and thought I'd save myself some money by ordering these in bulk.  Unfortunately they were no good. I read the reviews on Amazon for this item and one person felt the same as I do but another review pawned the first dissapointed review off on the fact that of course raw cashews aren't as good as roasted ones. I'm here to tell you that I know what raw cashews taste like and these were no good!!

review/text: I have never used better salt.  It is better tasting, prettier, and has more real salt flavor than any other salt even though you use less to get that salty taste. Other  salt always gives me endema and raises my blood pressure.  RealSalt does not give me endema as do other salts, and my blood pressure has even gone down rather than up.  My whole family feels better.  We will never use other salts again.  We just finished using our first 25 # box, and love it.  By the way, we have found that it pours better than other salts, too.

I just know that Real Salt is healthier than table salt and I can't tell the difference in taste.

review/text: The anchovies are outstanding.  So is the packaging.  the price was good but not outstanding.  About 30 cents per can less than the grocery.  The problem is that they have an expiration date of something like 2/11.  Hello???  Who can go through 18 cans of anchovies in less than 12 months?  Perhaps that is the reason for the very reasonable price but at that point I think rather than being sold by Amazon, they should be at the dollar store or deals.com.  Note: I purchased these about 6 months ago.

review/text: In my opinion,  this is the next best thing to coffee, and since I can't drink coffee because of the caffeine, Teeccino is my beverage of choice.  I've tried many other of their flavors, which are all good, but the Hazelnut is the best.  It tastes so similar to the hazelnut coffee I used to drink, that I don't even miss coffee anymore.  I brew it in a French press for the fullest flavor and add coconut milk for creamy richness.  Sometimes I put it into the refrigerator for a couple of hours for an iced coffee.  Very delicious!!

I use ground cinnamon in my natural applesauce(no sugar added) protein poweder mixture and I have that everyday and it added a wonderful cinnamon taste! I would reccomend you lightly sprinkle it carefully or spoon a lil but out because if not this bottle wihich has no shaker top can come out fast and then you have too much cinnamon on your food and it can be very spicy or over powering flavor when you have way too much! If you have just enough its a yummy delicious flavoring for your food!

review/summary: Would not recommend. Adverse reactions.
review/text: Both myself and my gf tried this for the first time. I thought the taste was bearable, she didn't like the vitamin B taste, too overwhelming. Besides that, we both got very depressed and angry after drinking this. We are normally mellow fun loving people, no bickering, just enjoying life. After drinking this it felt like the world was over. WEIRD! I know. Maybe it was just us but we don't act that way. I'm thinking the combination of Guarana, Yerba Mate, Rooibos, Ginko Biloba, Taurine & the other added "antioxidants + ADAPTOGENS" (what ever that is!)may not be a good combination for consumption. Also the label is misleading. It says 100% Juice which we thought meant 100% FRUIT juice (since those words are the same color and so near to each other). It does, however, warn: Not recommended for children, pregnant women, or people sensitive to caffeine. (Which I am not).

I think it probably fell out of the box causing the bag to open or something. It took about a week to get here so I don't know how long it was open. The cats still eat it but I don't know... I just get a feeling that they don't think it's as good as it usually is. I hope there is no penalty if I cancel my subscription for this. Something like this though is why I was worried about starting Amazon subscriptions to things. I've started to buy a lot of every day items through Amazon after I found out I could have them delivered to my home so conveniently, but I am still a fairly new member.

review/summary: Silly me!
review/text: I feel a little silly reviewing Jell-O because it always reminds me of the most sterile of foods. The kind of thing you find in Institutions in general. I do not mean to be disrespectful but it does depress me a little bit. Kind of like meatloaf. You know you reached the bottom of the culinary world when certain types of food arrive to your table. Jell-O Sugar-Free Gelatin Dessert, Orange, 0.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24) is perfect for me: almost no calories, sugar free and tricks the mind into thinking dessert has been served. So let's give Jell-O its due for being a no guilt end of a meal. I bought 3 flavors: Orange, Peach and Black Cherry. Of course I am aware there is very little if any actual fruit but they manage to duplicate the flavors somewhat. How much more elaborate can I be about this product? Silly me! 4 Stars for the good ole' Jell-O!
