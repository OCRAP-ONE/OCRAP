review/text: I love the smooth taste of this green tea mix the hint of honey just blows me away! I drink about 2 liters a day but I'm thinking of cutting down on it especially in the evening as it contains 17mg of caffeine per 8oz serving and when you drink as much of it as I do it can affect your sleep!

review/summary: Tastes homemade
review/text: I've made many waffle recipes from scratch, and I've tried a bunch of mixes. This is the only mix that literally tastes home-made, to the point that I basically don't make homemade waffles anymore. It's totally simple to make (just mix + water + egg + oil). Unfortunately it's hard to find in grocery stores, so it's great to see it on Amazon. Cooking tip: undercook it a little to keep the waffle light & fluffy. When the waffle gets crispy it's not quite as good (but still very good).<br /><br />I have also tried Krusteaz pancake mix, which is easier to find in stores. It isn't as good, and doesn't work well for waffles.

review/text: I tried this mix when I bought my  Belgian waffle maker in hopes of creating the taste of the light crisp Belgian waffles that I had eaten when I stayed at a hotel. This mix was easy to make however it seemed a bit thick. The final product had very little flavor and was dry. I would not recommend this product to friends.

review/summary: This is not Irish Breakfast Tea
review/text: I have been drinking really good Irish Breakfast tea for the past ten years and when my provider was backordered, I decided to give this tea a try since Irish Breakfast has to be Irish Breakfast right? Found out that this is not true with this tea. The tea comes well packaged and is very much a whole leaf tea but when I took a smell I smelled something that suggested it was tea. I immediately became worried and made a cup the next morning and soon discovered how bad the tea was. The tea has the orange color of Irish Breakfast but there is scarcely any aroma or flavor. The tea was very weak and it doesn't get any better by adding more leaves. I liked the idea of a subscription for tea but this one loses my vote.

review/text: I have several of the Coffee Bean Direct bulk loose teas. They are all good. The standouts for me are this one- the Irish Breakfast, and the Jasmine. I also have the English Breakfast, which is good, but I slightly prefer this Irish Breakfast tea. It is a great stout, complex tea, with enough kick to make coffee unnecessary.<br />Many people add milk to Irish Breakfast. I prefer it "solo"- no milk and certainly no sugar. If not drastically over-steeped, it remains smooth and full flavored.<br />The quality/price ratio of this tea is outstanding.

review/summary: Allergies
review/text: My shih tzu mix has extremely bad allergies to certain foods, fish, venison, and a prescription food he should be taking that has corn in it.  This food has really worked well after trying so many different combinations, without grains, with grains, on and on.  Even rabbit and buffalo. He's also allergic to mother earth although fish is his worst.  He loves the Duck and Potato Pinnacle food and I add some things to it for his prescription food alternative and it works fine.  He is down to 1/4 pill 2x a day of Temeril-p.  I've tried to take him off of T-p and tried benadryl, claritin, zyrtec, Hydroxizine and another newer pill I can't remember but it costs a fortune and is really supposed to work great, did not work on Joey. The nice thing is that it doesn't cost as much as many other foods we've tried.

review/text: I absolutely love this tea. I have tried many other spice tea blends but could not find one I enjoyed. They either had too much clove or were lemon based. This one is perfect. The clove is mild and in perfect balance with the cinnamon and the orange gives it a lovely aroma and a nice sweetness. When I want a little extra spice, I use one of their honey cinnamon straws. It is even good with milk added which you can't really do with lemon blends.

review/summary: Another marvel
review/text: My first taste of Taza chocolate was their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L9WI76">chili-flavored</a> candy - don't laugh, it works! That impessed me so much that I had to try more in their product line. This vanilla-infused offering meets the high standard set by my initial Taza experience.<br /><br />With only three ingredients (organic sugar, cacao bean, and vanilla), the flavors come through crisply and well-defined. They open up in layers, starting with the bittersweet darkness of the chocolate itself. The vanilla note follows, pronounced without overwhelming. The finish includes a fruity tartness, possibly with traces of citrus. That last flavor helps remind that chocolate is a flavor from nature, and that natural flavors have complexities that reveal themselves differently to different parts of the palate.<br /><br />It didn't surprise me this time: the sandy texture of the stone-ground cacao bean. Don't looks for Godiva silkiness here - the texture calls to mind the ancient Aztec preparation of this wonderful flavor. If you can learn to like that, Taza could easily become your favorite chocolate.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

I'm having a difficult time not eating it all in one night. I can taste the bitterness of dark chocolate, but there's definately vanilla in it. And not fake vanilla; you can really tell all of the ingredients are 100% real.<br /><br />Also the seller provided large bubble wrap (I love bubble wrap), and a free tin of caffenated mints. It's a small object, but a huge gesture. I will definately be purchasing this chocolate again, and definately from this seller.

review/summary: Good Chocolate (I think) - bad packaging/preparation
review/text: I'm a little reluctant to rate this at three stars although what I salvaged tasted pretty good.  Since the picture of the product here on Amazon, and what I received are two different things, I believe three stars might be fair for misrepresenting it.<br /><br />I expected to receive a box of small individually wrapped disks.  What I got was one large 2.7 oz disk saying it contained two disks.  If there were two disks, they had merged during multiple melt downs.  The product had been melted a number of times (some before they were shipped to me I believe) and had re-solidified since the wrapping was buried deep inside the chocolate.  The outside of one of the wrappings had a white oily substance on it (?).<br /><br />I might suggest not ordering these during hot summer months unless you Overnight it - then you still run a risk.  I Overnighted them although UPS misrouted the package on a Friday and I didn't get it until the following Monday.<br /><br />A UPS miscue may have exacerbated the melt downs although packaging chocolate in a single box wrapped in a "ready to ship" plastic bag may not have been the best during summer months.<br /><br />Amazon refunded the shipping (it was late) and the price of the chocolate since it was, among other things, also firmly attached to that "ready to ship" plastic bag and a disaster.  They have always been good about this kind of thing and I've been using them for items hard to come by locally, since the beginning.<br /><br />Packaging type management could use some training.  There is also the possibility that the product I recieved was stored and handled incorrectly.  It was within it's "use by" date.<br /><br />I think these are good chocolate, although after being beat to mush, I'm not sure.  At least these do not contain a forced GMO Soy product.

review/summary: Great "Half and Half" Tea with a Kick
review/text: I never liked energy drinks before tasting Monster Rehab.  When I finally got around to trying Rehab at the suggestion of friends, I was pleasantly surprised.  Unlike the green label "regular" Monster drink, Rehab is very light.  It does not have a syrup-like feeling going down and it only has 20 calories per can compared to about 200 in the regular drink.  The flavor is mostly lemonade with a hint of tea (much like the "Half and Half" teas on the market).  Unlike most drinks sweetened with sucralose there was no chemical aftertaste.  The energy rush from the drink took about 10-20 minutes to set in and lasted about 2.5 hours.  Although most of the people I know use Rehab as a coffee replacer in the mornings (lemonade with the effects of coffee is a great way to start the day), I drink this every weekend so I can stay up late with my family.<br /><br />As much as I like this drink, I wouldn't buy it from Amazon at the price they are listing.  Once a month Rehab goes on sale in grocery stores and you can get a can for $1.50-$1.99 vs. $2.30 being charged by Amazon.  Wait for the sales then stock up.

I personally can't pick up the tea taste, which I don't mind, as I am not crazy about tea.<br /><br />I don't notice any particular energy boost.

review/summary: Mellow and fruity!!
review/text: Moroccan Pomegranate Red is a nice break from hibiscus rosehip flavored fruit teas.  The bouquet is wonderfully fruity. After steeping you have a ruby brew that tastes great.  The flavor of pomegranate is very authentic without the bitter taste of pomegranate seed.  Rooibos provides a healthful and mild base for the fruit flavor without any sourness or ashiness.  Altogether a satisfying tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"One that would have the fruit must climb the tree."

I don't drink a LOT of tea, but I find that when I'm having allergy and sinus problems, a hot cup of this tea really brings me some relief.  I drink other teas for that reason too, but so far this has proven to be my favorite.

review/text: Still waiting on the rum back order but tried both butterscotch and caramel with skim milk/protein powder smoothies. Half a capful is about right, too much will ruin it. Adding an apple banana with the caramel gave the smoothie a bananas foster flavor. Maple is next with frozen blueberries. I have a hunch the pancakes I gave up for lower glycemic choices won't be missed. Using these extracts is an delish tool to increase satisfaction when making healthier food a permanent lifestyle.

review/summary: Perfect portion control on a favorite snack
review/text: These chips are tasty and very fresh and pair perfectly with a whole grain pita sandwich to add crunch to my mid-day meal.  I know that extra packaging is less than desirable because of landfill concerns and I usually never buy single-servings of anything, but I make the exception with these Baked Lays Potato Chips. These are the perfect amount of chips to go along with my sprout-laden lunch so that I am not tempted to dive into a bigger bag.  I find that things like these chips have been key in my new eating habits that have let me lose 30 pounds in 8 months without problems.

review/summary: 5 Times Less Fats
review/text: I like the subtle taste of Baked Lay's Potato Chips.  They are thinner and easier on the bite.  They are also more fragile that you see more crumbs inside a bag, no wonder they put more air in it as an added cushion.<br /><br />Compared to the original Lay's, the baked chips has 3% fat compared to more 5 times of the original with 16%.  Also, it does not contain trans fat while the original has 6% of guilt on it.  The baked Lay's has tad more sodium though.  Honestly, nothing taste better than actual slices of fried potatoes,  But it is great to have a choice if you are conscious about your health.

review/summary: So nice to have healthy portion control snacks at home.
review/text: These are a great value I got them at a sale price but even this current price is good as these size bags at our local "SUB" shoppes are $1 each.<br /><br />These taste great have only 130 calories, 2 gm of fat and NO trans fat. Even 2 gm protein. They are very salty which I need as I have a condition that requires I eat salt and drink water to keep blood pressure up.<br /><br />They came in good condition and a long outdate. Three months. At one per day that will be no problem. It's great to have a healthy good crunchy snack ready when you are watching what you eat. Nice to grab a bag and leave in the car so you don't get tempted to go thru the drive thru.

review/text: Since I have become wheat-free, Baked Lays has been my go-to snack (pretzel withdrawal needs a 12-step program, for sure). Keeping me relegated to a single portion is a huge deal, since I can munch my way through the large bags in two days. These are handy for travel, too. Cannot in all good conscience give 5 stars; who are we kidding? There is no nutrition here...only a lack of seriously high-fat chips (even popcorn can claim fiber) Enjoy it for what it is!

These are just the right size - I can satisfy my cravings without blowing a day of calories. I keep the box in a hard-to-get-to spot in my house so they aren't too handy. My family is grateful they can have chips again. The product arrived quickly and in good condition. We live fifty miles from anywhere so the convenience of mail delivery is worth it for us.

review/summary: Great Warehouse deal
review/text: I haven't seen these in sale at the local supermarket in a while, while browsing Amazon's warehouse deals I saw these. $[...] for 64 bags not bad at all. I ordered on 1/10/11 and it came two days later, the expiration date for all of them is March 8th. Not too shabby considering these will be consumed by two growing boys lol. I mainly bought them for my brother, since he buys crisps at school anyways and a little bag like this will cost $.75-$1.00 pending whether he buys at school or at a petrol station.<br /><br />The only compliant I have is that the box arrived smashed up a bit on one side, but I just had a bag of crisps from that side and it seems perfectly fine and whole. There also isn't anything that protects the bags of crisps. As soon as you open the box all you'll see is the bags of chips and your Amazon receipt.<br /><br />While I think this is a great deal, you should be aware of the short shelf life, it's a good deal because they need to unload expiring products. So if you live by yourself, your probably better off buying from the supermarkets. If you have a ton of kids, or just really enjoy in indulging in DELICIOUS BBQ CRISPS these are for you!!!<br /><br />If you would like to buy these crisps you MUST click on "See more buying choices". Or else you'll be buying these crisps for $[...].. PLUS $6.95 shipping!!!!

review/summary: Not bad but not quite there
review/text: These pickles are spicy but to truly enjoy the ghost cili pepper you need to get burned. Unfortunately these pickles are diluted with the flavors of other chilies (habanero, jalape&ntilde;o, serrano, etc.) so it's difficult to enjoy the ghost chili's flavor itself. They come sliced and in a thick salsa like sauce. Not a bad flavor but not quite what I was looking for, which would be a more spicy, simple pickled flavor.

review/summary: best potato chips
review/text: I love these potato chips.  I've been eating Season's potato chips for years.  When I buy the unsalted ones, I add a little salt on my own.  They're cooked with peanut oil, which doesn't leave the slight aftertaste that many oils other than this and canola oil do, in my experience. These chips have a great mouth 'feel',light and crisp, not too hard or crunchy.  I highly recommend giving them a try.

review/summary: Michael Season's Ripple chips are a hit with wife!
review/text: We first discovered and bought Michael Season's at Fred Meyer because they are reduced fat and salt, and the taste and consistency are great. But FM stocks only Thin and Crispy and my wife wanted a sturdier version to use with dips. After getting product descriptions from the Michael Season's web site we discovered that they also make reduced fat and sodium Ripple chips. Found that Amazon had them in stock, ordered and received them promptly with free shipping. My wife says that she likes the taste as much as the Thin and Crispy and that the Ripple also stand up to using with thick dips.<br /><br />Also we found that Michael Season's are almost entirely whole chips, whether ordered online or bought from a store, unlike Frito-Lay. After I watched a Frito-Lay sales and stock person literally crush each bag of F-L chips apparently so that he could get more bags into the allotted space I could understand why. Michael Season's is a winner for several reasons. And with Amazon, the price per bag is lower than if bought locally.

review/text: I bought the Ripple lightly salted chips. I find that the chips are very good as other reviewers have said. I like that that they are lightly salted and it is still enough of a salted taste. The chips were not broken (any more than when you get them in a store) or crushed. They are packaged quite well for shipping. This is February and the expiration date on them is 6 months from now (Aug.). 12-8 0z. pkgs. to a box is a lot of chips but for those who don't know it, the chips can be refrigerated for quite a while, even past the expiration date, and still be as fresh and crispy as if just bought. I put extra crackers and cereal in the fridge too with the same results. I have a fridge in the garage so I can do this. I do recommend these chips.

review/summary: For almond maniacs (or mai tais) only
review/text: I keep six or seven flavors of these Torani syrups on hand, right next to my beloved Jura-Capresso F9.  I've had to go elsewhere to purchase a "starter" bottle that's made of glass for each flavor, as these bottles on Amazon are plastic and pour spouts (like those in bottles of liquor at bars)fall right out of their necks.  I use these as refills for the glass bottles.<br />  The flavor of this syrup is very strong, so unless you think you might like a cloyingly sweet amaretto in your coffee, you might want to steer clear.<br />  However, if you like mai tais, this is  very good orgeat to use.  It's one of the cleanest flavored ones I have had.

review/summary: perfect for sodas
review/text: In my experience, all of the Torani syrups (the ones with honest-to-goodness sugar, anyway) are very high quality and have very intense flavors.  While I do occasionally put the orgeat syrup in steamed milk or coffee, I mostly use it to make almond sodas.  A dollop of this, a splash of lemon juice, and seltzer.  Yum!  The lemon cuts the sweetness of the syrup and provides what I think is the perfect balance.<br /><br />Shipping was fast, and the price can't be beat.

review/summary: the only decent Orgeat I've found
review/text: I bought this syrup for mai tais; specifically to recreate the "original" mai tai made by the Fairmont Kea Lani. Most people familiar with mai tais use orange or pineapple juice. The "original" mai tai from the Kea Lani is not nearly as sweet as what you get if you walk into any bar in the world and ask for a mai tai (even at the the Kea Lani you have to ask for the original to get this drink, otherwise you get the standard sweet mai tai). It is too bad that so many people think that sweet mixer from the modern brand Trader Vic's is what a mai tai is supposed to taste like. The mixer is not even close to what the classic drink invented by the person Traver Vic.<br /><br />The Torani Orgeat syrup is just sweet enough and has plenty of almond flavor. I was surprised that I could not find it locally. I found the sugar-free orgeat from Torani locally but it has a terrible splenda aftertaste. I did not want to buy from amzn because I did not think I would need 3 bottles but I do believe I will have no problem using this up during the holidays. But after failing to find it locally I ordered from amzn. Let me say that this product is SO much better than the sugar-free variety I found locally.<br /><br />If you like mai tais I highly recommend you invest in quality curacao. I like "Senior Curacao of Curacao" clear (it also comes in orange and blue). And please remember that a mai tai should never be blue, red, purple, or green. Enjoy!

review/text: Like others, I have trouble finding this syrup locally and MUST have it for Mai Tais and other mixed drinks.  This three-pack means you won't run out any time soon, and may find yourself trying new drink recipes just because you've got so much on hand.  The flavor is very sweet almond, as others have noted, so I'm not sure I'd add it to coffee or soda.  That said, you've got enough in this pack to experiment liberally.

review/text: Not long ago my husband and I went to a small coffee shop for breakfast. We ordered almond flavored French Toast. It was amazing...but very expensive. I have since tried to duplicate the taste but it, too, was expensive trying various almond flavored products with no success. I came across this syrup and decided to order it. Since it arrived I have been making my husband almond flavored French Toast every weekend. He says it tastes as good as the coffee shop's. Success!

review/summary: great flavor, great price!
review/text: Since Starbucks stopped carrying almond flavoring (which was actually labeled "almond syrup"), I have NOT been able to find it locally (Dallas). So I was not only thrilled to find it on Amazon, but at a very reasonable price AND with free shipping. With each 750 ml bottle weighing in at 2.27 pounds, shipping is significant and can double the price from most other vendors... As for being called "Orgeat" vs. "Almond", Torani's web site states "One of Torani's original flavors, Orgeat (OHR-ZHAT) is an old English word related to the Italian "orzata", meaning almond. Decades of experience create the distinct aroma and sweet nutty flavor." The bottle's label lists the ingredients as: "Pure cane sugar, water, natural flavors, fractionated coconut oil, ester gum, citric acid, sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (to preserve freshness)." While the syrup certainly smells and tastes like almond, I might imagine that the "natural flavors" actually includes almonds :-)

review/text: Of course orgeat is a key component in the classic Mai Tai, but so was 17 year old, high ester Jamaican rum.  You can bet Vic's Garnier Orgeat was made with real almonds.<br /><br />This product does not contain any almond or even almond extract.  It is chemically flavored.  Now if you love artificials then this is your product.<br /><br />But as for me, it's way too easy to make your own. A great and easy recipe is available at kaiserpenguin, though you have to find your own link.<br /><br />But it's easy, much better and real!

The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00. I also ordered the chicken with rice and the dog food for all life stages.  My dogs love them all the same. I had never purchased food with lamb in it before but the one for life stages has it. i do not like the way veal or lamb are treated and have never eaten it myself either. However,having said that, I will be ordering this monthly for my dogs. Just wish there were more choices without lamb. It is impressive that their cattle are free range grazing cattle and fish are ocean not farm raised. I believe my dogs are eating better than us!

That being said....15 month old, female German Shepherd with a sensitive stomach seems to love it. Had her on it for 5 months now. Half a can mixed with your dry food of choice 2X a day and you'll have a pretty darn wild dog at and post feeding time. Just bought a pack of the chicken grain free to see if it elicits equal enthusiasm. Inevitably, some of the cans always wind up at my doorstep dented, but I don't think that has any impact on the product.

review/summary: My dogs love it, and love the combination beef and fish!
review/text: I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan "all the time", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it.

review/text: I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged.

review/text: I switched to the smaller cans because I have a Yorkie, and it took too long for her to finish the larger cans.  But to me, all Canidae products are great.  Let me tell you what happened.  Three years ago, my little dog had hot spots all over her.  She was miserable, itching, scratching, moping around.  I took her to the vet who gave me a cream which didn't help.  Then one time, I went to my groomer who told me the truth:  SHE'S ALLERGIC!  These hot spots are Alergies!!!  Huh?  Why didn't the vet tell me this?  (Was it because he was also selling the other dog food I was using?)  The groomer suggested I look for a product that had no corn.  I liked the Amazon reviews about Canidae products and tried it.  Not only did she take to the change right away, (although I gradually changed food) but her hot spots cleared up.  Needless to say, Canidae products are all I use now.  I don't care that they are a little more expensive!  They cleared up my poor dog's misery, and that's all that counts!

review/summary: Great dog food!
review/text: Our 2 dogs love this food. We supplement it with the same variety of Canidae dry dog food. Never gives them bad breath. Seems to be perfect for our dogs.

review/summary: Canidae Canned Dog Food
review/text: It is a great product.  Our standard poodle has a problem with keeping weight on even though he is a ravinous eater.  He put 5lbs on and looks great.  We add the canned dog food to his dry with a little water. Also never a problem with shipping or packaging.

review/summary: Quality dog food
review/text: My dogs are picky but they do eat Canidae, not the no grain Canidae, but this one.  Canidae has a premium dog food, canned and dry. Get what you pay for with this product.
