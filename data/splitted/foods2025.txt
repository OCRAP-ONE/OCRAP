review/summary: Just Average
review/text: This body wash has a nice masculine scent.  The tiny abrasive beads are nice, and not nearly as "rough" as a lot of other microbeads I have felt.  Unfortunately, they are still too rough (and the scent probably too strong) to be used on the face.<br /><br />To get the full effect, I even purchased the oddly-shaped <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TSA90C">Dove Men + Care Active Clean Shower Tool, 1-Unit Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that Dove markets alongside the body wash.<br /><br />I don't think we'll stick with this body wash, as it doesn't seem to provide anything special in comparison to the existing favorite.

review/summary: Clean and soft but....
review/text: First of all, I'm not a dude. But I am the wife of a dude.<br />And as the wife of a dude, I like my personal dude to smell fantastic.<br />But not cologne-y, and not like a bottle of knock-off drakar noir exploded in his midst.<br /><br />AND because I am demanding. I like his skin to feel soft and smooth.<br /><br />Dove Men + Care definitely left his skin soft and smooth- for that I would give it maybe 3 or 4 stars... My husband uses regular bar Dove quite a bit, and if anything this seemed to rinse "cleaner"...<br /><br />The fragrance though... I give that a 1 (by the way, I love the fragrance of regular Dove).<br />It's an odd match for a dude...  It's more than a hint of perfumey fabric softener, fairly chemical-y.  As far as comfort goes- the fragrance was so strong that it was not comforting in the least, but I have a very sensitive nose and sensitive skin and with the combination of the two I ordered my beloved back into the shower to hose himself off with plain ol' awesome Dove bar....<br /><br />Perfection! And now he smells clean and that is sexy.

review/summary: Does what it says it does
review/text: The beads provide a nice tingly texture to the lather and it has a nice smell, which isn't too overpowering. I don't care for it as a face wash, but for a body wash it does what it advertises. The smell isn't too feminine or overpowering, it lathers up well, and does a good job of cleaning without leaving a residue or film. Four stars because it doesn't work for us well as a face wash, but does a good job of cleaning other bits.

review/summary: Smell not unlike the man your man could smell like
review/text: I understand that "body washes" are all the thing these days, especially among younger and more active types, and one of the most pleasant things about this product is that the refreshing scent is also mild, and doesn't make you smell like a hormonal teen who doused himself in Axe body spray. I've used Dove soaps and shampoos for a long time, so making the move to a Dove body wash wasn't that big of a risk. This is a nice cleaning and mildly exfoliating gel sort of thing, that notably does not leave feelings of either dryness or residual soap film. On the whole, I wouldn't have expected myself to become a believer in the utility of a body wash. But if anyone could convince me to give it a try, Dove would be it. And I think it's worked.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: This body wash lathers extremely well and has sort of a moisturizing feeling.  What I mean is that I don't feel as dry when I get out as I do with my Old Spice.  It also has these little granules (pebbles, scrubbies, whatever you call 'em) mixed in to if makes you feel like you're really scrubbing yourself clean (but it doesn't hurt)!  However, in reality I don't think it gets me any cleaner than any other body wash (but it does lather up thicker, which I like).  I usually use Old Spice hair and body wash, and I will continue to do so for these main reasons:<br /><br />1. Hair AND Body wash - This dove product is not intended to be used in hair.  Therefore i use it when I have to apply head and shoulders a couple times a week.<br />2. This Dove stuff smells very girly.  My wife likes the smell better than the Old Spice, but I don't.  So I guess if you're a single man and want to pick up chicks, this will work better.  However, if you're married and don't care what your wife thinks (she's going to think you stink 99% of the time anyway), then stick to what you like.<br /><br />Overall, a good product.  I just prefer my Old Spice, because I want to smell like the man on the commercial.  You know, the one on a horse!

review/summary: Good quality cat food
review/text: We feed this food to our almost grown kitten. He loves it.  Since cats are carnivores, this food fits the bill as it is mostly JUST fish, not fillers like corn and grains that really are not good for cats.<br />I really didn't like feeding the cat canned food because it grosses me out.  This food smells just a little fishy but is really not bad at all - compared to some cat foods which smell disgusting.  It's also very convenient and not messy.  You don't need to use a spoon to get it out of the pack.  Just rip it open and squeeze it out.

review/summary: Cats love the food (Hooray!) I hate packaging
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Slop.
review/text: Maybe my cat is spoiled. We've fed her "Soulistic" brand pouches since the day we brought her home. I saw this product when I last shopped for her food. It looked like a real gourmet scene, so lovely was the image of the food on the packaging. Now, I know there's always a disparity between the box image and the actual fare, but this has to be the most glaring, bald-faced LIE in the history of marketing.<br /><br />When I opened the package (which showed a expiration date well into 2012), I felt confused! Almost like I wasn't sure if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me! The entire brown, gelatinous mess slid out like a giant leech into her bowl. After some desperate prep work, mashing things up, I managed to get this glop to a state where it more resembled something that you'd see sliding down the wall in a monkey's cage.<br /><br />My cat took one sniff, and regarded me with a glance that can only be described as a "how dare you", and strutted away. Hungry, but with dignity in tact.<br /><br />I WILL get a refund for this gunk. Mark my words.

review/summary: The cats love the food, I hate the package (cats win!)
review/text: I have four cranky senior cats who never seem to enjoy the same food (picture an older, more crotchety male cast of the golden girls). One likes fish, the other eats it and throws up bright pink everywhere; one was open to trying a raw diet, the others wanted to eat canned food - though usually just the juice or gravy. Anyone who has cats knows that they will starve rather than eat something they don't like - just to prove their point. Because one of my cats is diabetic, I've been trying to keep them on a grain free diet, only, they don't seem to enjoy any of the fancy grain free canned food from the local yuppie pet store.<br /><br />I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef).

review/summary: Finally a food my finicky feline will finish!
review/text: My cat is 15 years old, and has NEVER liked a kitty treat in her life - the only non-dry cat food she would ever eat was REAL tuna fish juice, drained from the can (and never mind the tuna). She has also had what I affectionately call a "tender tummy", meaning that every few weeks, since she was a kitten, she has had vomiting episodes that last a day or so and then disappear again. No explanation. Basically, I've just had to find cat food for her that matches the carpet on the way back up. Ew.<br /><br />About a year ago, she stopped eating all together, and I was worried that she and I had reached the end of her long life. In actuality, she had just decided she no longer liked the IAMS senior she had eaten for 10 years, was going on a hunger strike that put her in the ER Vet with failing kidneys due to dehydration.<br /><br />Enter Wiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna (in the pack of ten, with the sardines and Whitefish/tuna mix). She instantly started eating again, and her health returned in a matter of days. AND, no more random vomiting!! She even deigns to eat dry cat food once a day to supplement the moist stuff - I'm using IAMS young adult (orange bag), and have had no problems there either.<br /><br />She has her preferences with the Wiskas, don't be deceived. She will ONLY eat the purrfectly fish, NOT any other flavor, and really doesn't prefer the sardines (neither do I). The tuna entree with the whitefish is often only halfway eaten, but the tuna entree alone is always finished, which is why I was so happy to see it for sale here by itself.<br /><br />One complaint, though. My kitchen now smells like dead fish. But, to save my carpets, her health, and my sanity, I'll sacrifice a little smell.

review/summary: Whiskas Won
review/text: My cat has developed an increased appetite since I changed her diet from ONLY dry food to moist food.  She is 17 years old and has lost so many teeth that dry food was becoming too difficult for her to eat.  After two years of serving her "wet food" I never made a distinction among the different brands of wet food until recently.  I always buy different brands of wet food, and she seems to enjoy the ones from a packet rather than a can.  However today, with WHISKAS, after devouring a whole packet,  she wanted another one.  Not only that, but she licked the plate entirely clean.  She kept begging for more and I finally gave in to her wishes. I was very surprised when I just went to look at her plate because she consumed an entire second package.  I better check this out with her vet.  She is not overweight, but I don't want to overfeed her.

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: My cats are 10 years old, and have eaten dry food their entire life. I would give them wet pouches once in a great while as a treat. However, about 6 months ago, the female started puking on a daily basis, and let's just say it was not a "normal" type. I tried different brands (they had been eating Cat Chow Indoor Formula), but she is no longer interested in dry food (the male will still eat it). So I started buying Friskies pouches, and they seemed to really like it, but I noticed that little by little, they started leaving more and more food. They would only lick the gravy and leave the food.<br />Finally I tried this Whiskas item, and they seem to really love it, and they eat every bite. I'm glad I finally found something she will eat, because she has visibly lost weight.<br /><br />Oh, and Amazon's price is more expensive than a grocery store, but unlike some other people who misuse these ratings, I am rating the PRODUCT, not Amazon. The 5 star rating is for the cat food alone.<br />I'll go to a message board if I want to discuss Amazon's business practices.

However i am NOT a fan of these pouches-i think they are a mess to deal with and no matter how careful you are to keeping your kitchen counter neat-some of the gravy always ends up there.A tip after getting the food out of the pouch with a spoon--add some water to the pouch and swish it around and add it to the cats plate to make a little more gravy. I wouldn't buy this again unless it was on sale. That said my cats do LOVE the whiskas fish pouches-you just open up the pouches and the food just slides out-no spoon required.

Once you peal back the top, the contents almost always spills onto your fingers, floor, counter, wherever you happen to be.  Then, when you are trying to pour the contents into a bowl, about a 1/4 to 1/5 of it get stuck down in the bottom and you have to dig it out with a spoon or cut the sides open and scrape it out.  Very messy process.  If they would fix the packaging, this product would be a real plus.  As it stands, I hate to use it because of the mess.

review/summary: Not Cheap, but Worth It!
review/text: While I'll acknowledge that shipping catfood can be a pricey proposition, with three cats, and an upper-floor apartment, the convenience of home delivery makes it a desirable option...and Amazon's excellent reputation for on-time deliveries makes it a far more reliable choice than the other 'autoship' providers I've used.<br /><br />Whiskas Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree has been a favorite of my babies for over two years (surprisingly, it's the only 'seafood' item they like), and when you find something they love, you stick with it! While all the grocery chains in my area only offer it in a multi-flavor box (forcing me to pay for food the cats WON'T touch), through Amazon (and other carriers), the Tuna Entree pouches can be ordered individually for shipment, which is another reason I accept the increased price, without complaint.<br /><br />So consider what your options are, and if the 'pros' outweigh the 'cons', I recommend Amazon as your choice!

review/summary: Purrfect!
review/text: A few years ago I bought a few packs of this at Walmart to give as a special morning treat for our 4 cats.  I would give them each a small spoonful and they were happy.  It quickly became a regular morning ritual with the cats sitting patiently in the kitchen each morning when I entered.  As time went on it became harder and harder to find The Tuna Entree at Walmart.  Sometimes I would drive to two different stores looking for it.  I tried some of the other 'flavors' and my cats let it be known they didn't like anything except this particular one.  They don't like any chunks of fish or whatever in their wet food.  In December when I was back in the U.S., after not being able to find this in the local stores, I turned to Amazon and I was so happy to not only find it available on here but we can get it shipped automatically  every 4 weeks.  Now, the cats always have their special morning meal and my daughter doesn't have to drive around looking for it.  I even haul 24 pouches in my carry on bag each trip back to Venezuela with me so my cat here can have her special morning treat.

review/summary: Whiskas
review/text: My cats love the food. The food is formed in the shape of the pouch so I do chop it up with fork to make it easier for them. The food looks and smells like fish. They like the snapper the best. Not to much moisture that had one cat throw up. No more wasted food. They eat it all. I wish it came all snapper but they probably like variety.  Price beats local stores. I buy the auto. delivery method and it saves even more. With auto ship the following deliveries come USPS.  They do notify of up coming shipmnt and you can postpone if need be. You can also get an early one.

review/summary: White meat chicken with dark bits
review/text: This product is made in Thailand with what appears to be really nice white meat chicken and some sort of dark bits.  The dark bits I guess are made out of chicken, but appear to be manufactured - like hot dogs - you know fillers and dyes.  Plenty of juice and chewy looking.  I purchased the cheaper pouches - Choice Cuts -, but those do not compare in quality to this one.

review/summary: My cats love this food
review/text: We have two cats, one of which is 16 years old and had lost quite a bit of weight.  She looked like she was ready to die any minute.  I purchased this food for her in a local store and she loved it.  She has trouble chewing and this food is easy for her to chew, plus it has juice that she licks up every drop of.  This food has made her start eating again and she has put back on some of her weight and is looking really healthy.  Although we have dry food out all the time, the cats run to the kitchen every time we are in there hoping they will get a serving of Whiskas.  I now buy it on Amazon's subscribe and save program - we never run out and it saves me money.

review/summary: Kittties Liked at first, Then Turned Up Nose
review/text: When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is "THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says "Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on "Subscibe and Save" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off "Subscribe and Save" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something "different" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year! (Even if the economy tanks and things go to pieces, we can all rest assured that Amazon will continue to thrive and let us pass our thoughts on to complete strangers for many years to come)! Thank you for your attention to my review.

review/summary: My cat loves it
review/text: My cat loves this stuff! The nutrition is fair and it has alot of juice in the packet. It is a mixture of chunks of meat along with some shreads. It looks like real shreds of chicken. The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better.

I haven't been able to find much nutritional value of this particular wet food, but there are real bits of fish and chicken in the pouch.  Sometimes, the chicken pouches almost make me want to taste them.  The rich gravy and flaky bits of white meat smell like Thanksgiving.  I haven't tasted it yet, but if I do I'll update my review.

review/text: But i wont be buying any more variety packs from Amazon anymore, as they raised the price by $10. Too bad. I can get it local for much cheaper now.<br /><br />Tip for the people who have problems with the packages. Grab the package firmly above tear line, shake the package back and forth a few times until all the food and juices get pushed down to the bottom. Then open, hardly ever have the "squirt" or "dribble" anymore, after giving it the shakes.

review/summary: My picky cats love Purrfectly Fish
review/text: Having owned cats for about 4 years now, I know that they all have their likes and dislikes, just like any animal. With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over. I was glad to find that Amazon carries the tuna entree, so I know that my cats will eat it. Add in Subscribe & Save, and you have a winner.

review/summary: Great product for older cat
review/text: We found this product when we were looking for something to supplement my elderly cat's diet.  She had gotten pretty thin, had lost interest in eating, and had problems with keeping food down.  She went crazy for the chicken, and we started feeding her three times a day.  We had problems finding it locally until we located it on Amazon.  We liked the autoship option and signed up.  My little old lady has put on weight and is clearly feeling a lot better now that she has something that she likes to eat.

review/summary: My cats LOVE all 3 of the chicken flavors
review/text: I have four cats who all love any flavor in the purrfectly chicken multipack.  I always leave dry food out for them and only feed them the wet food twice a day, before I go to work and as soon as I get home.  Whenever they smell the food them come running to me, purr, and rug against my leg.  It is super cute.<br /><br />Although I agree with previous reviews it is a little annoying to open.  I cut the pouch open, empty the food onto a shallow bowl, and then spoon the rest of it out (definitly worth it, there is always ALOT left within the pouch), I then add a pouch full of water.<br /><br />Adding the water seemed to really help alot.  Adding the water made the wet cat food smell much less noticeable and helped to get the last pieces of chicken out of the pouch ( I add a tiny bit of water and shake it really good). My vet stressed that my cats needed to drink more water he was the one who suggested adding the water.

review/summary: Four Paws up
review/text: I have owned cats all my life, and over the years we have tried a variety of canned, dry and frozen foods with mixed results. So I feel fairly confident to provide a review of the Whiskas Purrfectly Fish line.  Here are my observations:<br />1.) ALL the cats I've given this to seemed to like it. Even my picky eater quickly devours the food, and now that we've switched back to this he will remind me if I am running late with dinner.<br />2.) From my point of view the image on the package is slightly misleading. Yes, there is obviously fish in there, but do not it expect it to be all slices. I say this because some of the newer cat food products out there, such as Fancy Feast Appetizers, do look like chicken or fish chunks. Rather it is a combination of mush food, fish slices and jelly.<br />3.) On the nice side, while it is fish based the smell is not over powering (I hate fish), so dishing it up is not overly offensive.<br />4.) It has also been my experience, that unlike most wet cat food that contains fish, I have yet to find the small bones.<br />5.) While my cats seem to like the Fancy Feast Appetizers much better, I like the price of these much better.  I can buy two of these for the price of one of those.<br />6.) Storage.  If you buy it in the packs or boxes, they are easy to store and it is compact.  If you buy them by the package in the store, you will need something to keep them from sliding around (they don't stack well like can do.)<br />7.) Easy to open for most.  For most people they will easily tear open.  However, I suspect some people with arthritis might have some difficulties gripping the package enough to tear.  The bonus about them being pouches is that there is no aluminum lid to cut yourself on.

review/summary: Cats LOVE the food, I hate the mess of packaging...cats win.
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/text: My 4 cats seem to prefer the "Whiskas Purrfectly" brand to any other wet food I've tried.  These fish flavors are not sliced; there are big blocks of pate in each sack that I have to break up with a knife so they can eat it.  My cats like this flavor set for a change, but really like the same brand in "Chicken" flavor, which is sliced.  If you have trouble with it splashing when you unzip each sack, try keeping a pair of scissors by your cat food area and cutting the bags; it's less messy and you can get more of the food into the cat bowl.

review/summary: great cat food
review/text: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish is a good quality food and our cat seems to really like it.  It is mostly fish with very little grain filler.  This is healthier for a cat as they are carnivores.  Some of the fish varieties have chunks of actual fish and others have a more mashed tuna-fish like appearance.  We found that the pouch is convenient - you can just tear it open and squeeze it out without using a fork.  It kinda pops out in a big  lump so it's not too messy.  Thankfully, even though it's fish, the smell is not too obnoxious.

review/summary: Not the best for your cat's long term health
review/text: I started buying these after another brand discontinued. I refuse to buy by-products for my cat so of course I was drawn to Puurfectly because it has real meat. The downside, 2 "magical" ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />Both useless to your cat and in my case eventually cause my cat to develop an allergy to corn and wheat. After a few months of her loving this food, she now refuses to touch it after throwing up repeatedly from it and having severe diarrhea.<br /><br />So now being more informed that corn and wheat aren't great for cats I've move on to natural cat foods. No more throwing up and a happy cat. Hooray! I suggest you do the same if you want to avoid vet bills and chronic health conditions in the long run.

Anyways, a few days later we realized that both our cats who ate this food began throwing up in agony. Initially we didn't take it too seriously but they did this repeatedly two days in a row right after they ate this food. Hence, we have now switched back to the food we used to give them before and they are doing much better now.<br /><br />We also found that this food is NOT made in the USA but imported from Thailand, which they have not mentioned on this website.

review/summary: Purrfectly Chicken NOT!  Purrfectly Mystery Meat is better
review/text: Once upon a time Whiskas Purrfectly items were not too bad, our 3 cats loved them.  But the product has gone down hill, WAY DOWN HILL!<br /><br />The cats like an evening snack, and Whiskas was at the top of the list.  I used to go 3 days on, 1 day off (no treats).  This kept them eager.<br /><br />But today I failed to purchase any more.  Why?<br /><br />Here's why:  First, look at the picture on the pack,,,, see all that lovely white meat?  I DARE you to find even one package out of the whole box that matches that picture.  You will not find one.  Now all you find are bits and pieces of red / brown mystery meat, with perhaps, if you are REALLY lucky, 2 or 3 small slivers of white meat.<br /><br />The last box I tried was a total failure, the cats would look, sniff,,, tentatively lick the sauce and maybe nibble a piece of white meat if they could find it, and walk away, allowing me the pleasure of throwing it away.<br /><br />No more.  They need to take a serious look at this product.  DO NOT BUY!!

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: That's what my cat would say. This is the best food that I've found for my cat, and the extra cost shows it, but my cat's worth it! I was suprised to see the big chunks of real fish. I agree with other comments about the packaging, so it didn't take me long to figure out that if you use scissors to cut the top off instead of tearing it, you avoid all the mess. Just squeeze the contents away from the top first before you cut it. I actually prefer this package over a can, because since I give her half in the morning and half in the evening, I can just fold over the top and put the rest in the fridge. I have always bought the cheaper Whiska's pouches because, well, I'm a cheapskate. But at this point in both of our lives, I figure it's time to enjoy ourselves, and treat us both to the good stuff! Steak for me, Purffectly Fish/Chicken for her!

review/text: The Purrfectly Chicken is the only pouch variety all the cats love. That's 5 inside spoiled rotten princes and princesses aged 6 to 13 and anywhere from 2 to 5 outside feral cats.I can deal with the inconvenience of pouches spilling chicken juice but wish I were sure they were eating a quality product. The fact that they're from Thailand bothers me. The dark pieces are always left in the bottom of the bowls.

review/text: I have 3 kitties.  One of them is very finicky with food in general, and she only likes the liquid (I like to call it broth, haha) in these pouches.  It's good though, because that way she still gets something other than the dry food.  I give the rest of the meaty chunks to my other kitties who are happy to devour it.

review/summary: My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!
review/text: My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled. It seems like he enjoys juicy textured food in his mouth. He is primarily on wet food because of his stomititis. I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more. But he still likes his fancy feast grilled. So I guess I have to keep searching for alternatives...

review/summary: Whiskas Purrfectly Chicken & Beef Pouches
review/text: My cats love this.  The meat does not look like chicken or beef to me. However the Whiskas "Cat Chefs" know what the kitty cats like.  My picky bunch love to pig down on it. I was even able to sneak in their monthly flea meds with it with no problem.  A first ! The only down side is the juice runs out on the top of the package when you open it. So I just snip the top a tiny bit first then, hold a second and pull open. No mess to clean up then.<br />Will purchase again.

review/summary: Whiskas Tuna Entree for Cats
review/text: After Wal-mart discontinued the tuna packets product from Whiskas I turned to Amazon and found that I could purchase this product by the case (24).  This has been the best wet food our cat has ever had, and this is how we deliver his medicine, pulverized into the tuna!  He is a picky eater and has rejected every other wet product we have found.  So, I am very happy with this product and by subscribing for an automatic monthly delivery, using Amazon Prime, I am saving money and paying less than I did at Wal-mart.  Amazon Prime takes care of the postage and the automatic subscription saved me even more.  I know I sound like a shill, but I am a happy cat owner.

review/summary: my cat prefers this over the other Whiskas brands
review/text: My cat is a fussy eater.  I have to cycle between two or three different varieties of cat food in order to keep her happy - and eating!  She'd much rather yowl all day long, than eat the same meal twice in a row.<br /><br />So, when I discovered that she actually likes all three flavors of this Whiskas Purrfectly Fish variety pack, I was very pleased.  (Incidentally, she doesn't like two of the flavors in the other Purrfectly fish variety pack, but oh well...)  Also, this is a pretty good price for 4 packs of 10 pouches.<br /><br />I would have been happy to give this food five stars, except for a few minor issues.  For starters, pouches are always difficult to open and the food inside tends to often be messy to serve.  I've often gotten my hands splattered in juice, whilst I'm trying to feed a hungry cat.<br /><br />The major issue I have with the food is that it comes in one big piece.  When you open the pouch, it kinda slithers out - which is a bit less messy than feeding chunks (and at least all of the meat does come out of the pouch) but my cat won't eat this stuff until I chop it up for her.  Usually, that's not easy when she likes to shove her head in the bowl and start licking up the juice.<br /><br />She'll probably tire of this brand given a few more months, but for now, she definitely really likes it and I appreciate that I have three varieties of flavor to offer her.

When I mixed the Whiskas Chicken and Duck with his Whiskas dry about 10 minutes later he licked his plate clean.

She did a lot of throwing up and had the runs so I immediately switched to a natural canned cat food, all back to normal - no more sickness.<br /><br />My even greater concern with these flavors is the tuna/salmon - not only are you feeding them things they can't really process{wheat/corn} but your also feeding them a daily dose of mercury. Worth it?? You tell me when you get the vet bills that could have rather been spent on good food.

They did not do this when I served competing National Brands. My Cats also love Wiskas dry Cat Food which I make available to them 24 hours a day in a special serving bowl for that.

However,  when I brought this flavor of Whiskas out all 8 of them gathered around the food dish and gobbled it up as if they were starving.  I realize kitten food is said to have the nutrients kittens require  but there must be something to this formula for the kittens to take to it that well!

review/text: Okay, so I admit I spoil my cat.  These Whiskas Purrfectly Tuna pouches are hit with my furry kiddos. The pouches are easily to open, just simply grasp at the notch and twist.  The food is relatively easy to get out of the package.  I found it easier to massage the bags first before opening to mix the filling up, otherwise you'll end up with one blob of congealed cat food.  Sometimes I'll still need to use a fork to separate and clean out the pouch.<br /><br />These pouches per ounce maybe more expensive than some of the other canned food, but the convenience of not using a can opener and easy at putting the food in the bowl are worth the extra nickel or two you might save.<br /><br />Truth wise, my cats love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283K02K">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Chicken & Beef, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 12)</a> and if given a taste test would probably prefer, but at about $1.46 per tub, they don't get to eat it very often.

review/summary: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken Improved My Cats' Health
review/text: I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.  I tried many brands including the most expensive, but my three cats prefer Whiskas Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken to all others.  I mix them together in the bowl.  All three of my cats run to the bowls to gobble up the food and they don't leave a morsel.  Also, my cats do not throw up this food like they do dry food.  I can't believe the change in their health.  In just a short time my two older boys went from being round fatties to having shape and nice healthy curves.  And their coats are absolutely gorgeous.  The oils in the food obviously create a nice sheen.  Also, the shedding is way down.  Thanks Whiskas and keep it comin'.

review/summary: shipping cost high, product excellent
review/text: Received 24 packets of cat food - quantity was unclear in advertising.<br />The packaging protected against damage as if the packets were crystal glassware.<br />The shipping cost was too high for the amount of product received.<br />My cat loves it, so I will find some alternative to keep a supply.

review/summary: Great service
review/text: This is the only wet cat food that one of our cats will eat and we have been having problems always finding it in our local Wal-Mart.  So I was really pleased when I found that I could order it online and was also able to set up a schedule for monthly delivery.  I was even more pleased when I found that I could adjust the schedule when I needed to order it sooner than expected.  This is a great service for us and we have since set up another schedule for two of their other chicken products.

review/summary: Finniky Kitty!
review/text: I have to say that I have tried all kinds of expensive catfood for my grown cat.  He does not like the good stuff!  He prefers the cheap stuff so I have just adjusted to that.  I thought this tuna entree would be great, but he does not like it.  Sorry for the bad review since I am sure there are cats out there with all different pallates of taste.  If your kitty likes tuna which looks like it came from a can - bon appetit!

review/summary: Watered-Down Flavor - Not Much Energy
review/text: I was not a very big fan of these energy shots. The taste is sort of like a bland fruit juice with ice in it that melted and watered it down. They are pretty inexpensive, so they get my vote there, and thus the two stars. Other than that, I feel that there are better tasting shots out there for even less.

review/summary: My Dog Loves these!
review/text: I have a Red Doberman Pinscher with a very sensitive stomach.  Most treats give him the runs.  These Breathies are wonderful.<br /><br />He likes them very much and they do not upset his stomach.  They do smell minty too.  It improves his breath somewhat, but it can only do so much for a dog that will eat poop if he gets a chance!  :-)<br /><br />I give him the choice of which treat he wants and he always picks the Breathies.  I would recommend these to anyone that has a dog with a sensative stomach and bad breath.<br /><br />Also, the 3rd party seller of these treats were wonderful too.

review/summary: Salted Peanuts in Shell.
review/text: These are really good peanuts and a fun food for the kids. They enjoy cracking and eating these although they would be best for snacking on at an outdoor event.They are tasty and as stated elsewhere in the reviews they do come in two 5lb bags. Still a great bargain and a fun food but not for someone on a low sodium diet.

When I received the package all the candy looked like it was melted and then cooled down and the shape of the candy was gone.  I am not really happy about that.

review/summary: Quality Unique New Tea by Superior Tea Company
review/text: *****<br />This is a yummy and unique tea. It's sort of creamy (the real vanilla is a luscious taste), but not spicy like chai. It is absolutely perfect and I'm drinking it all the time because the taste is beyond belief, plus there is no caffeine!<br /><br />Indian Night is certified organic and contains fair trade certified organic Fatrikcherra Estate black tea, and organic vanilla beans---that's all---and oh, what an incredible combination! There are no oils or natural flavorings used at all, unlike many flavored teas, and thus no funny aftertaste.  It is also kosher. This tea is sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used.  Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags". The reason it is called "full leaf" is that Numi black teas do not contain tea dust or fannings, which tend to make tea taste bitter; instead, they contain the full leaf, expanding when they are brewed, "releasing a robust and long lasting experience".<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Inspired by an ancient Aztec culinary secret, Numi has chosen aromatic whole vanilla beans to blend with premium organic black tea. The tea grows in northern India on a bio-dynamic and Fair Trade garden surrounded by beautiful tropical forests. It is decaffeinated by a revolutionary organic CO2 process, called 'Effervescence', the only chemical-free method that does not extract flavor or health properties. As Indian Night steeps a vibrant bronzy hue, its seductive fragrance, flowery yet familiar, flirts with your senses. Magnificently smooth, exotic vanilla harmonizes with black tea for a creamy, rich and satisfying cup." This is a new (as of 2007) tea for Numi, and this description romantically describes the tea experience, and doesn't oversell it at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Strong vanilla smell and taste.
review/text: I recently started drinking organic, decaf black or green tea because of the antioxidant health benefits, and not because I was fond of tea. I am mostly a coffee drinker, and I like a very strong cup of coffee. I tried a few teas, but most of them weren't strong enough and had to be doctored up with lemon, or vanilla soy milk. This tea has a very enjoyable and strong smell, and taste, of vanilla, so I can enjoy it with both senses.<br /><br />The instructions say to steep the tea bag for three to five minutes. Longer could result in a naturally bitter vanilla taste. I let the tea bag steep in my cup for much longer than five minutes, and keep it steeping all the time while I am drinking it, and even squeeze the bag a few times, and don't find the taste bitter, but an enjoyable treat, whether steeping for five minutes or twenty minutes.

review/text: I love this delicate, delightful, decaf black tea.  For me it is another organic favorite from the wonderful Numi tea company.  How thrilled I was to discover it at Amazon because I cannot find it at my local health food markets. I love a good black tea and wanted something exactly like Indian Night Decaf for my later in the day and evening tea enjoyment...and I do so enjoy this mellow vanilla scented blend. I have to also comment about how much I enjoy the lovely artwork on all the Numi packaging...such a nice touch to such a wonderful product.

review/summary: Yummy tea
review/text: I discovered this tea when I was in Seattle - yes, the land of coffee.  I wanted a basic cup of decaf black tea but nobody in the NW sells regular tea!  It's all latte this and grande that.  I finally ended up in one small coffee shop practically begging for a cup of regular tea, and I was given this Numi decaf Vanilla Black.  WOW!!  It is soooo good. Kind of has a hint of a black raspberry flavor even though there isn't any in it. I've placed 2 orders from Amazon so far since I can't find this particular flavor in my area.  Thanks to being desperate in Seattle, I am now a Numi customer through Amazon!

review/summary: Dreamy Vanilla Tea
review/text: Numi teas are blended to an elegant perfection. Numi Decaf Black Vanilla is no exception and will please anyone who loves mild black tea with a hint of vanilla. For a richer experience, use two teabags per 8-ounce cup. This tea is perfect for drinking at night when you are relaxing, reading poetry or starting a new novel. The vanilla flavor is enhanced with a dash of cream or even an little vanilla syrup from France. I can recommend Rieme All Natural French Vanille Vanilla Syrup - 8.46 Fl Oz (250 Ml) or even a natural cane sugar to add a caramel twist.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
