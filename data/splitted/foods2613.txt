review/summary: Best Chip
review/text: Kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market. I don't care for the "fancy" flavors and these are salted just right. Thick, super crunchy and full of flavor, they are the best!

review/summary: Not low salt
review/text: These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a "low salt" item.  They seem as salty as any "regular" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy.

review/summary: Best Chips I've Ever Tasted
review/text: Fantastic tasting potato chips. I love the individual bags, great for kids and adults too. No trans fat, no cholesterol, no artifical stuff.<br />Low in sodium and high in potassium, which is great for people like me with HBP.<br />Only problem is Amazon is out of stock some times and price is high.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: The chips come in a large box with individually wrapped bags of chips. The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.<br /><br />I reccomend them!

review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/summary: I made a mistake.....
review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/summary: Do they have to "bite back"?
review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

review/summary: These chips are awesome if not best but....
review/text: I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

review/summary: Great flat bread
review/text: There isn't anything extra ordinary about this pita/flatbread except it's large size and low cost.  It tastes good and arrived soft although commercially made; plus the shipping for multi packs is NOT that outrageous compared to other breads here on amazon.  You could definitely do better at a local deli or bakery but if buying in bulk for an event then this pita is great.  I have since ordered more from this company as my 1st order of 3 sets really NEVER got hard nor moldy even after 3 weeks !  I actually like this bread as far as commercial bread goes.  You can make mini pizzas from this as the base crust and thats what I use it for or slice it up and use the wedges for dips...possibilites are endless. Bread tastes great and incidentially this is not the sliced pita but rather the whole unleaven loaf.  ( You will need to slice this if making pocket pitas and its thin so its best left as is unsliced )<br />I like this bread and the company. 5 stars

review/text: I shopped at the local market for veal stock and all the products contained sugar and "natural" flavorings.  The sauce I made from the supermarket product was terrible.  So I searched for a recipe on the Internet and found a recommendation for this product.  I decided it was worth a try and I'm so glad I did.  The wine sauce recipe on the package made a beautiful, smooth and delicious sauce for our grilled steak.  I will certainly order this product again and recommend it to others.

review/summary: Product Arrived Damaged Twice- UPDATE!!!
review/text: I had the same experience as another reviewer. I love this dressing and my local supermarket stopped carrying the product so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. My shipment arrived poorly packaged. All the bottles were leaking and the seals had been broken. Considering that the dressing needs to be refrigerated after being opened I did not want to eat it. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement order free of charge. The second shipment was no better and I had to discard all the bottles. I wonder if Amazon is responsible for the poor packaging or if it is the vendor and whether or not it may be the heat during shipping that is causing all the seals to be broken.<br /><br />UPDATE: The manufacturer/company contacted me after this review and offered to send me a case of their dressing for my troubles. It arrived in a matter of days and all the bottles were undamaged. Their customer service is impeccable, making sure to follow up with me after I had received the delivery to ensure all was ok. I loved this product before and love it even more now. Wonderful experience! Thank you, WAFU!

review/text: I do cat rescue work, which means I get to keep the special needs cats.  Most of my gang is over 12 years old.  I started them on this because it sounded like a better cat food than the commercial stuff I find on sale, and the money for it was in the same ballpark.  Since I have put all 15 on this food the "Hawking up Hairballs" has went down to a small fracture of what it has been for years.  And they eat much less, which means litter boxes are not as busy, and they are more healthy.  Its a good deal for me, and a great deal for their health!  For the price, its the best I can find!  And I would know after 30 years of cat rescue.

He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy.

As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.

review/summary: Healthy Food For Our Feline Friends
review/text: When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best-friend.

review/summary: Not the best, but better than most
review/text: I have two boys...well first we had one. He was a little panther zipping and yowling around our house and would anything, especially bagels...I still can't keep bagels in my house. Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or "silky" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat. I am not concerned on wheat/corn debate as my cat goes after my bread, my bagels or anything tasting like wheat.

review/summary: Very Happy with it!
review/text: We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything. "Their" favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife brand, for indoor cats. They took to it well and before we knew it the 2 fat cats are down to a healthy weight. The skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff. It's been about 5 months now and they are all still very healthy and I am very Happy with this brand and this particular recipe (indoor). It has been a perfect balance for all 4 of our cats. We did try the all ages a couple of times but it doesn't seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it.

review/summary: The Goodlife Indoors!
review/text: I have three adult indoor cats, and I feed them Goodlife indoor formula in the chicken flavor. I wanted a moderately priced cat food that wouldnt make me go broke, but also wasnt full of ingredients that were unhealthy for my kitties. I used to feed them Iams, but at 17 bucks a bag I knew there had to be a food out there that was comparable!<br /><br />Goodlife Indoor with Chicken has high quality ALL NATURAL ingredients that taste good (well I dont know that they taste good but my cats LOVE it)<br /><br />Inside it has:<br /><br />*REAL chicken and skim milk for strong bones and teeth and lean muscle mass.<br /><br />*WHOLE grain brown rice that has alot of good vitamins<br /><br />*Natural Garden Peas and Spinach with Iron and Folic Acid that helps metabolism<br /><br />*High quality protein and taurine needed for a healthy heart and eyes.<br /><br />*Whole Grains rich in fatty acids and fiber for healthy digestion and a shiny coat<br /><br />*Colorful veggies that provide antioxidants for a good immune system<br /><br />My cats have a clean bill of health, shiny sleek coats, no plaque on their teeth, and my oldest one who is 12 has a healthy urinary tract system which we all know is the number one killer of senior cats!

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.

review/summary: My Sensitve Stomach Cats Love it!
review/text: I want to start by saying I am not a professional, just an average cat owner. I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it.

review/summary: Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities
review/text: One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!

This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.  I kid you not, after two weeks of this cat food the cat's butthole was actually protruding.  We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.<br /><br />Never again.

My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!

review/summary: It's Corn. Cats can't live on corn.
review/text: This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is "animal fat." It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime.

Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food

review/summary: Cat Killer!
review/text: I fed this to my three cats. Within a month one of them began getting sick, throwing up his food once a day then every meal. Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!

review/summary: Love These Crackers!
review/text: Very hearty, crunchy and satisfying. Pretty low carb for a snack, of couse not like my usual bran cracker but sometimes a person wants flavor! I have had these with chili (can't crunck them up on the chili though) soup, salmon dip, cheese etc and I have really enjoyed them. They taste good plain also but be careful, you might eat the whole thing;0)<br />I think that if you can eat any cracker you like on the market and are not looking specifically for a high fiber, lower carb (not the lowest but pretty low) cracker perhaps you wont feel as I do, this is no Ritz cracker, but then you never knnow. Give them a try!

review/summary: The Red Rain Energy Shot tasted good but the drink did not give me a shot of energy.
review/text: First off, let me say that the Red Rain Energy Shot, Berry Flavor is the first energy drink I have ever tasted that tasted good. Unlike most energy drinks the berry flavor masks the acrid taste of the all the other ingredients that energy drink makers put in their drinks to give you that burst of energy you need to make it through your day. The only problem I had with this drink is that it did not give me the increase in energy that I was hoping for. I drank the whole (smallish) bottle in the early afternoon, the time of day I have the most problems staying awake, and it just did not wake me up, indeed, an hour later I had to fall back on my old stand by, coffee. I would have liked to give this energy drink a positive review, it really does taste good, but the Red Rain Energy Shot just did not do what it is designed to do, at least for me anyway.

review/summary: Works OK...probably
review/text: My only previous experience with energy drinks was as an observer of someone who used them regularly, and what I saw there didn't make me want to rush in. When I had the chance to try this Red Rain Energy Shot, I thought, why not? but I moved it from shelf to shelf for a while before drinking it down in the middle of a challenging afternoon at work.  The taste was fine though with a bit of an aftertaste; you really don't choose these products for their yummy-ness, do you?<br /><br />That one experience didn't give me a high level of expertise, but I can say that I got through the afternoon, didn't have any bad effects like jitters or crashing, sort of forgot that I'd even taken it, and then decided maybe it was effective and unobtrusive--a good combination. I'd consider using it again, as one of several ways to get an energy boost.  I do question the ingredients, though. I'd want to do some research on what all these ingredients are, and what they do, before relying on this product or any other like it. (And yet....I'd have a cup of coffee or some peanut M&Ms without hesitation for an energy boost: go figure...)<br /><br />Probably not my energy-booster of choice, in other words. But nice to know it's out there and that it probably does no harm.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2011

review/summary: Excellent Choice for an Energy Drink
review/text: I've always been into vitamins and natural health, but haven't jumped on the energy drink bandwagon, even though my dad swears by them. As a naturally high energy person (helped even more by coffee), I figured I might as well give Red Rain Energy Shots a try.<br /><br />It tasted great, with a nice tarty berry flavor, but had some aftertaste. It also worked well. I'm not surprised. Pardon the pun, but it's a perfect storm for energy creation. The ingredient list includes various B-vitamins (especially B-12), Taurine, Tyrosine, etc. These B vitamins and amino acids have been shown to increase alertness, which in my experience, is a different beast than physical energy. The energy component from Red Rain comes from the caffeine. The bottle even says it has the same caffeine as a cup of coffee. Also, the drink is basically calorie free (sweetened with sucralose aka Splenda), a plus since many energy drinks are loaded with calories.<br /><br />I liked this product a lot, but I'm not quite an energy drink convert yet. At the cost of a dollar a bottle, Red Rain is very reasonable by energy drink standards. However, a cup of coffee (brewed at home) costs a few cents and various B supplements bought at an online health food store will set you back a quarter a day at most. But, if your daily Starbucks habit has gotten in the double digits or you just want a quick, easy boost, then Red Rain Energy Shots are ideal.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this product. It tasted great, gave me both energy and mental alertness, and for energy drinks, was priced reasonably. I still prefer my morning coffee and my supplement pills, but if I wanted an energy drink, I'd pick this one.

review/summary: Great taste, great price, but not too much boost
review/text: I thought the product tasted good.  It was kind of sour, which I like.  I could not read the label because the packers put stickers all over it, so I do not know if it contains caffeine.  If it doesn't, it needs some.  If it does, it needs some more.  I didn't really feel an energy boost.  I do however take a lot of vitamins, which include a lot of B.  So my vitamin intake might already be giving me all the energy I can get from B vitamins.<br /><br />This may be a great product for someone who does not take vitamins.  The taste is really good and so is the price.<br /><br />All in all, I would say they are worth a try.

review/summary: Morning eye-opener
review/text: First I feel compelled to comment that I only drank two ounces of this product on a one-time basis (which was the sample size) so I cannot speak to any long-term negative effects that it might induce. One would speculate that they *might* not be positive as is true with most short-term, highly-fortified energy boosters. There's really no substitute for a good diet and daily exercise. I did show it to my brother's physician (my brother has heart trouble) and after reading the back label of ingredients he said to never give any of the product to him for an energy boost.<br /><br />I tested the product when I first woke up in the morning. I didn't drink any coffee prior to drinking it so I could accurately determine its uninfluenced effects on me. It tasted good, (wakes up your taste buds!), it goes down easy, and seemed to work in bringing me to life. I'm 57 and I don't exercise so I always require some artificial energy stimulation, usually caffeine in tea or coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, the overall effect did surprise me because I always viewed claims about these over-the-counter elixirs to be so much snake oil. I fell no negative effects at any point such as indigestion or the jitters. On the other hand, other than a nice change of flavor, I'll stick to my single cup of coffee in the morning which has pretty much the same effect and is notably cheaper. This product might be convenient for busy people to carry in a pocket (I'm retired and travel little) for when they require an energy boost.<br /><br />Some of the ingredients might tend to fool the average consumer a bit. The B-12 vitamin component, in particular, is listed at about 4,000+ percent of the daily required intake -- but B-12 is so very poorly absorbed into your system when taken orally that I'd be surprised if this dose actually infuses the minimum RDA. So don't be overimpressed with the back label.

review/summary: Better and cheaper than 5-Hour Energy
review/text: I'm not an "energy-shot" kind of person generally. You won't find me rappelling down mountainsides, kayaking over rapids, or hang-gliding over Death Valley. I have an office job, and my stimulant of choice is coffee or tea.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />There are times when I really need heightened concentration and I'm already exhausted. I can't just drink coffee indefinitely, because it makes me irritable and makes my heart race if I overindulge. That's when I use energy shots. I've been in the habit of using 5-hour Energy. But 5-hour Energy is... well, how shall I say this... yucky. I've tried every flavor, and they all taste metallic and leave an aftertaste reminiscent of boiled-down Diet Dr Pepper.<br /><br />Thankfully, Red Rain has the exact same effect on me as 5-hour Energy (the regular strength, not the extra strength), but tastes far better. What is the effect, you ask? For me, it's a very gentle lift. It's not so much a caffeine jolt as an improved ability to focus on creative or technically-demanding tasks. And it's a lot cheaper than 5-Hour Energy, too, even if you get your 5-Hour Energy at a warehouse store.<br /><br />If you're looking for a kick in the pants that helps you party all night long, I can't recommend Red Rain. If you're looking for a subtle pick-me-up that will help you get through the tasks at hand, this could be the one.<br /><br />Now, if only the name of it didn't constantly make me think of the Peter Gabriel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00471F6PW">song</a>....

review/summary: About the same as other brands
review/text: The Red Rain energy shot (berry) seemed to work the same for me as another brand I've tried (5hour energy).  Neither gave me extreme amounts of energy, but I've heard other people say they really help them a lot.  I have found it beneficial when I need to travel in the car for a few hours or am having trouble making it through the afternoon at work.<br /><br />I think the taste is extremely strong, just as it is in other brands.  It is a small size, but I still have trouble getting it down.  I have a strong gag reflex, so it might not bother other people.  It is just a super strong, candy-like taste -- similar to other brands.<br /><br />All in all, I would probably choose Red Rain Energy over 5hour Energy because it affected me similarly but costs much less.

review/summary: Very Sweet, Good Flavor, Mediocre Energy
review/text: This zero-calorie energy shot is a cloyingly sweet berry flavor with heavy overtones of artificial sweetener.  For an energy shot, the flavor isn't really too terrible, and I didn't mind it very much.  Other than the artificial sweetener taste, it actually was quite good.  The rub is the energy kick it's supposed to give--which I didn't notice at all.  I was extremely tired at the time I tested this product out and could probably have taken a nap an hour or so later (though I didn't).  I'm a regular coffee drinker and routinely drink espresso, so perhaps that's why I didn't notice a strong effect from the caffeine content, which is apparently quite high.  Unfortunately, since I only received one bottle of this energy shot through the Amazon Vine program, I wasn't able to try another at a different time to test its efficacy.  This is by no means a comment on the Vine program, but a disclaimer that I don't feel I was able to fully test this product to my liking.

review/summary: No unpleasant buzz, but not as much boost as I like.
review/text: I use these small 2-oz energy drinks several times a week, and have bought them from various sources.  I've paid anywhere from .88 cents to $2.98 for them, depending on where and when I buy them (Lately, my local dollar store is carrying them!).  Over the years I've found the taste varies from brand to brand, and so does the energy level. Some brands give more of a "buzz" than others (which I don't care for), while others give a nice, steady boost during the day.<br /><br />Upon opening the package, I noticed two things about Red Rain right away, one good, one not so good.<br /><br />Good:  The label was VERY easy to read!  On most of these 2-oz energy drinks one needs a magnifying glass or maybe a microscope to see what's in the bottle. Red Rain makes their labels very easy to read.<br /><br />Not so Good:  According to the label, the vitamin B levels in this product are exactly 1/2 of the 2-oz drinks I get at the dollar store.<br /><br />That said, I wanted to give it a fair trial. Main main question: Would 4166% of my daily recommended B-12 (Red Rain's numbers) give me enough of a boost, or would I notice a difference from my usual intake of 8333% of recommended B-12? (per the drink I get at the dollar store).<br /><br />For my preferences, the test produced both good and not-so-good results.<br /><br />Good:  The product tasted rather pleasant with very little medicine flavor.<br /><br />Good:  No unpleasant buzz.<br /><br />Not so Good: Half of the B vitamins gave me about half my normal energy boost. I like a good boost, and although this product provided some, it wasn't what I normally shoot for.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you like a mild-tasting energy drink that provides a mild boost, this would be perfect.  If you prefer more of a boost, you probably want something with more B-vitamins.

review/summary: Pretty good.
review/text: Personally, I've never tried an energy shot before this Red Rain Berry Flavored Energy Shot. I like the taste of Red Bull, Amp, Full Throttle etc. so I buy those and drink them (although not very regularly) if I need to stay up late or wake up. Overall, this does a similar job -- although it gives you less of a jolt than drinking one of those, so if you're really tired, you probably want something with a bit more kick. Nonetheless, seems more effective than a cup of coffee alone (it has about as much caffeine as a single cup) and is considerably cheaper than the competition, with 5 Hour Energy costing almost twice as much. Again, having never tried 5 Hour Energy, I can't say how the effects of the two compare, but Red Rain is definitely cheaper (and it works)!<br /><br />Taste:<br /><br />A little sour/bitter. If you can't stand artificial sweeteners, you probably won't like the taste all that much, but it's pretty much done with before you can savor it too long. Taste is kind of like berry flavored Orbit chewing gum. Not bad, but I prefer energy drinks with sugar in them.<br /><br />Value:<br /><br />Pretty good. $1 per shot seems to be the cheapest you can find any brand of these type of things. Cheaper than buying a latte or regular energy drink, too.<br /><br />Energy:<br /><br />Seemed to provide a reasonable boost. No caffeine buzz, but I consume a fair amount of caffeine, so your mileage may vary if you don't. Not a big instant rush, more steady and sustained. Some people might like the initial sugar/caffeine buzz that kicks in about 30 minutes after downing a Red Bull etc. You don't get that burst of super energy from this, which could be viewed as a negative or positive, depending on what you're looking for. If you're running on 2 hours of sleep, something with more caffeine and sugar will definitely be more effective -- I doubt this would do much. However, if you're not overly fatigued, this will do the job fine (better -- I can do without the jitters and buzz unless they're a necessity to keep me awake).<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />4/5. Good value and good results. Docked a star for taste -- I'm not a huge fan of the flavor (again, your mileage may vary), but it's a small enough container that it really isn't too big of an issue.

review/summary: Tastes better than 5 hour, bitter aftertaste
review/text: I've tried a plethora of different "shot" energy drinks. 5 Hour (way too bitter, horrible taste), Red Bull (tastes just like Red Bull - not bad) and others.  I still had not found one I actually LIKE the taste of. If you like sweet, this one is for you - I'm a Cherry Twizzlers fan and *I* like sweet. I took a sip to test the taste, and before I realized it had finished the bottle.<br /><br />It has the same 'kick' as the other energy shots, and is much more affordable. I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because of the aftertaste. About 10 minutes after drinking it I noticed a very bitter taste. A mint took care of that, but it's something to keep in mind.<br /><br />Hungry? Eat. Tired? Sleep or pop an energy shot. Eating rarely gives you an energy kick - it often slows you down. Remember those holiday meals? If you're tired, do you grab a Banana or eat an Apple? Nope - it's a cup of coffee or an energy drink.  On the go? Unlike a Banana, these small bottles fit anywhere! I keep one in my camera bag and a couple in my car. Driving home and starting to feel tired? Pop an energy shot!<br /><br />I recommend trying these - they taste a LOT better than the other shots out there! My ski jacket has an energy shot in one pocket and a granola bar in the other.

review/text: I don't normally buy energy drinks (I never liked the taste, caffeine, or the way they settle on my stomach.) but I had the opportunity to sample this product and thought it was certainly worth giving it a try.  The Red Rain berry flavor is delicious.  Yet, 2 ounces is not more than a couple of swallows.  It did not leave any after-taste at all.  However, I'm sure most people wouldn't buy this product just because they think it tastes good.  The taste is secondary to the desired results of an energy boost.<br />I sampled one bottle and I can say that I did not feel any boost of energy at all.  On the bright side, I didn't get the jitters either like most caffeine/B vitamin energy drinks.<br />So, ultimately, as it is currently priced, I would be much better off buying a Coke and taking a B vitamin.  I'd save about ten dollars.

Having never tried any of the little energy shots, I was unsure what to expect beyond assuming that I would become more alert.  However I experienced - NOTHING - not even the shakes or a feeling wound up or jittery (the typical side effects that you hear about when you drink too much caffeine or sugar.  Well that isn't totally right, I did get to experience the completely awful tast of the Red Rain Shot which was akin to drinking really sour cherry caugh syrup mixed with carbonated water mixed with a wonderful after taste that lasts for awhile.  Obviously these drinks aren't marketed for their taste, but geez it wouldn't hurt if they could be a touch above disgusting.<br /><br />So to wrap up, I felt no noticeable affects of the drink other than a bad taste in my mouth.  Yep - that's worth the money...

review/summary: Even The Overly Caffeinated Can Notice A Difference!
review/text: I was needing to accomplish some much needed catch up in order to prepare for month end. I sat down at my desk to do some input with a Red Rain Energy Shot at hand (instead of my normal afternoon cup of joe) and broke the seal, twisted the cap and finished it in one gulp.<br /><br />As far as energy drinks go, I found Red Rain (Berry Flavor)to be amazingly better tasting than any other tried to date. Sweet and lip smacking good, it had none of the bitter aftertaste I have immediately experienced with other brands.<br /><br />In the energy burst department, I discerned no noticeable buzz. However, after hunkering down and keying away for about ten minutes, I realized that I felt more alert and it seemed I was plowing through the data a bit more quickly. Two hours later I was completely finished and proofing my entries. No errors!<br /><br />If you brew your own with a French Press every morning, or regularly line up for a Vente sized caffeine fix, you might not notice much of an energy burst from a Red Rain Energy Shot, but I think you will notice better focus and attention to detail as I did.<br /><br />Maybe it's Red Rain's combination of B-Vitamins, amino acids, and enzymes that make the difference as compared to just drinking coffee. Maybe it's all in my mind. Either way, I feel as if I worked smarter and faster with the help of Red Rain and intend on keeping a few of these puppies in my desk drawer for crunch times.

review/summary: Took my mt. biking energy upto another level
review/text: I try to ride my mt bike every weekend.  I usually eat a granola bar before riding to give myself some energy.  I tried this shot and i felt better when climbng the hills.  I'm not sure if it's placebo effect, but i honestly felt more energetic and less tired when climbing up the hills.  I didn't experience any crash afterwards. I didn't mind the taste.  I just expected the worst taste and took a shot, but the taste wasn't that bad.  I wouldn't drink it for the taste, like i do with Red Bull, but not bad.  Anyways, if you need that extra ummppphhh in energy, this will do it for you.

review/summary: Nice taste but little punch
review/text: There really isn't a lot to say that hasn't already been covered. A energy shot needs to provide a boost of energy and (hopefully) be decent tasting. This is decent tasting, better than 5 hour energy but perked me up for a hour or less when 5 hour seems to give me around 3 hours of boost.

review/summary: Not as effective as 5-hr Energy
review/text: I didn't find this product as effective as 5hr energy. I typically use these when I'm working on a big writing project that requires more time and more late-night hours. But I didn't find the energy boost from Red Rain that I typically do from 5hr Energy. It was somewhat effective-but not nearly as long-lasting.

review/summary: I did not feel tired, but I did not feel particularly energized either
review/text: I thought I had the perfect opportunity to try Red Rain as I had come home after a late night flight and got about 4 hours of sleep before I faced a very challenging day.  Naturally, I woke up with a big sleep debt and felt terrible.  I used the Red Rain and made it through the day.  I did not get drowsy, but neither was i particularly energized.  Just felt about the same, but at the end of the day I did make it through.  So while Red Rain did not meet my expectations that I would be jazzed up like I was on Caffene, but I stayed alert throughout the day.  I am sorry but I have not tried other energy drinks to compare them with and based on these resuls I am not sure that I will need to purchase some in the future,

review/summary: Dynamite comes in small.....
review/text: Yes, we've all heard that dynamite comes in small packages. Well, in this case it's certainly true. I'm a regular user of energy drinks and the Red Rain shot clearly gave me a good punch to get through an afternoon. After trying it a second and third time with the same results, I can confidently say that Red Rain is a GREAT choice for an energy shot. I'll be a regular.

review/summary: A nice pick-me-up.
review/text: Red Rain Energy Shot, Berry Flavor is a nice two ounce little pick-me-up that give you some quick non-crashing pep.  Tired in the afternoons or you need a little get in your giddyap then you'll want to give this stuff a try.  It wont burn the hair in your nostrils but it'll give you an extra boost.  If you don't like those sixteen ounce cans of Rockstar or don't want to drink several cups of coffee then this product is right up your alley,  Doesn't taste half bad and it does the job.

review/summary: Seemed to work in a mild, sustained way
review/text: Most energy drinks like Rockstar, Red Bull, and Monster don't seem to do much for me other than at best make me jittery for a bit, but the problem is they seem to cause a big crash after just a short period. I have tried some of the other energy shot brands, and they just didn't seem to do anything to give me more energy or keep me awake. This past weekend, I had to go to an afterhours party that lasted from 2AM-7AM, so that was the perfect time for me to try the new Red Rain Energy Shot. The taste was OK in a tart berry way, but given it is just 2 ounces, you barely taste the one gulp it takes to finish it. As for the effect, I have to say I guess it worked. I didn't feel any jitteriness or any other overt sensation that it was doing anything, but at the same time, I wasn't feeling tired even at 7AM. Normally, when I do afterhours clubs, I am tired by about 4:30-5AM, so I have to say either the Red Rain worked well or else I just was less tired than usual. Since I only tried one shot as that was all Amazon provided me for review, it is hard to tell from the one test how much it was the shot that helped versus just an unusually alert night. But, it looks good for now, enough that I would certainly try the product again.

review/summary: Keeps me energized for an entire day
review/text: The product does the job it claims to do. However, like any other energy drinks, I feel concern about the content.  The bottle is small and the letters on the bottle on the ingredients section are very hard to read.<br /><br />No one knows what is in the 1600mg of what they called "Energy blend", and you just don't know what non-you are swallowing, or whether it will hurt your body down the line.<br /><br />Again, it does boost my energy, but I will take it consciously, and do more research if I were to continue taking it.

review/summary: Tastes Better Than "5-Hour", BUT Less Apparent Effect
review/text: I have mixed feelings regarding the Red Rain Evergy Shot (Berry Flavor).  It is about the same size and shape of every other energy shot bottle available.  I found the flavor to be preferable to the equivilant 5-Hour Energy shot, tasting less like cough syrup than 5-Hour Energy.  (It DOES have a medicine-y aftertaste that became apparrent about 2 minutes after drinking the shot, and though it's mild, it lasted for about 10 minutes.)<br /><br />One takes these energy shots for, well, a boost of energy, mental acuity, and/or alertness.  I experienced no uptick in any of these departments.  I did have a slight flushing in my cheeks (facial cheeks, mind you), but that's about it as far as discernible effects.  (There was no resultant caffeine crash, either.)  From that perspective, I'd do better with other products.  Every person's body chemistry is different, however, and this product may work well for you.  I didn't notice any of the intended positive effects.

review/summary: Icky Taste
review/text: I'm not one to use energy drinks much, so I don't have an extensive basis for comparison. I guess I got a decent energy boost, but this stuff tasted like cough syrup. I can't imagine wanting to drink it on purpose on a regular basis, given that I'll even avoid drinking cough syrup when I'm sick. Even if it provided a great boost, I don't think I'd be willing to choke it down.

review/summary: Good and cheap
review/text: This review is based on a sample I received from the Amazon Vine program.  I only received 1 bottle.<br /><br />I'm going to compare this to 5 Hour Energy, because that's basically it's main competition.  The concept is the same.  Small bottle, big energy.  The taste was a bit sweeter, and more berry-like than 5 Hour Energy.  Not too sweet, and not too Cool-Aid-ish, but still sweeter.  The energy effect felt similar.  It's hard to know from only one sample.<br /><br />We don't do too many energy shots, but at this price, it's probably worth buying a pack or two to keep around the house.  The price definitely makes it worth it.

review/summary: More of the same, at a better price.
review/text: Generally, when I've taken energy shots, it's been during the last half of a long day of driving, at a time when another 16oz energy drink would create overwhelming restlessness and jitters. These little shots--whatever the brand--seem to foster a calmer sense of awake alertness.<br /><br />Today, I took one of these instead of having my morning coffee. The taste was about what you'd expect from one of these, chock full of sugar substitutes that I've never found pleasant.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it gave me energy, but it did keep me awake during a stretch when skipping coffee would have made me sleepy and logey. And, sure enough, when five hours was up--almost to the minute--I conked out.<br /><br />So it works pretty much like the others I've had, but at the present cost here on Amazon, it's about a third of the usual price.

review/summary: Pick-me-up Mystery.
review/text: This item claims to contain as much coffee as a cup of premium coffee. I had never had it before, but I had had 5-hour-energy before, and it seemed similar.<br /><br />It contains 10mg of niacin (50% dv), 20mg B6 (1000% dv), 200mcg folic acid (50% dv), 250mcg B12 (4166% dv) and 1600mcg of an "Energy Blend."<br /><br />I only received one to review, but I took it on a day I was tired, and then I was not as tired afterwards. It is hard to give an accurate review though having just had it once.<br /><br />I prefer to know what I'm eating though, so I don't like the fact that it has an unexplained "Energy Blend" There are sparse regulations on dietary supplements that are "natural" or "herbal" and you don't really know what you're going to get. One thing I liked about 5 hour energy is they didn't mess around with that. This one apparently does.<br /><br />Taste was fine.

review/summary: Great Natural Energy Drink
review/text: This is an excellent little zero calorie energy drink. That's right ZERO and it works. It contains a lot of good natural products that would probably benefit you if you bought them from a health store such as Niacin, Vitamin B6, Folic Acid, and B12 as well as some caffeine which really gives you a little kick and helps you jump start your day. Overall I think this is a great product and only down side is I just wish 'the kick' lasted a little longer.

review/summary: Work good for a great price
review/text: I've used a few different types of energy shots and I would say these work just as well. Plus you can't beat the price of these compared to paying 3 to 4 times as much at a convenient store. A co-worker and I compared these to 5hour energy shots and noticed these regular Red Rain shots are about half the strength. The Extra Strength Red Rain shots are about the same ingredient levels as the regular 5hour shot, FYI.<br /><br />Overall I feel these work good, no jitters and I tend to have more focus at work than if I didn't have one. I'm not sure why people complain about the taste, it's not that bad. Just down it and quit crying already. One other thing I have noticed after using these though is that I tend to be more thirsty than usual so I find myself drinking more water, which is probably a good thing anyway.

review/summary: A bit of a kick in the pants
review/text: I see a lot of this type of energy drink on infomercials and truthfully have never been tempted to buy them because I think they are generally overpriced. I also wondered if they were any better than my beloved cup (or three) of coffee each morning. I have to say this stuff packs a punch in its tiny 2 ounces, probably more than in a 12 or even possibly 16 ounce cup of coffee. It doesn't give me that "comfort food" feeling like coffee does, but on the positive side you wouldn't have to drink as much if your goal was just a wake up call.<br /><br />Also, this berry flavor was quite good. Frankly, it tasted strong even going down (before it had a chance to act on my system). I actually liked it quite a lot. But I admit I don't think anyone should pay a dollar per 2 ounce container. It's simply overpriced unless the ONLY reason you drink it is to wake up and not for length of refreshment or the comfort of a warm caffeinated drink. I think I'll be sticking to coffee.

review/summary: I didn't notice any difference in my energy
review/text: The Red Rain Zero Calorie Energy Drink is a tiny, 2oz dose of pure energy. It contains caffeine and several vitamins and claims to give you a great energy boost without the sugar crash. With its tiny serving size and pleasing taste, it is easy to gulp down in one swallow. The price is right and very favorable when compared to the 5-Hour Energy Drink. Does it work? Well, I guess. I'm not a regular user of this type of product, so its hard to compare it to others. I did feel a little more pep after taking it. If you are considering it, then buy it because it tastes good and is a good value, but read other reviews to see if it works.

review/summary: Lots of B vitamins but too sugary a taste.
review/text: This drink was really sweet, overly so, to the point of tasting like straight sucralose.  I had the berry flavor, would prefer a different flavor next time.  I noticed no increase of energy, I still wanted an afternoon nap.  But the upside is it's loaded with B vitamins and folic acid so if that's your vitamin deficiency then this drink is for you.  They're about a dollar each so the price is reasonable, especially compared to Monster or 5 Hour Energy.  It's a small 2oz. size.  I would probably get a lemon flavor next time and actually pour into my iced tea.  The jury is still out on this product but it is safe, there's no ginseng or other harmful stimulants in it.

review/summary: Eh... not bad, not good, just "meh".
review/text: Sweet and simple.<br /><br />Ingredients wise, it's a 4. Fairly simple with only one "what the heck is that" ingredient. No corn syrup in it (I have an allergy to corn) so I was glad to see this product not have it.<br /><br />Taste, it's a 2. Less than desirable with a somewhat lackluster generic berry taste. Would rather have something that tasted more strawberry, raspberry, or blueberry. A mixed berry is hard to pull off and they sure in heck didn't. And personally I found it too be WAY too sweet and could have used much less sucralose than what they used. It also kinda burned my throat because of how sweet it was.<br /><br />In terms of energy, 1. No energy boost whatsoever. Found myself dragging all day.<br /><br />I guess the only good thing that came out of it is the fact that you get all of your B vitamins.<br /><br />I'll be sticking with my Guru Lite energy drinks.

review/summary: Comparatively, not bad...
review/text: There are a lot of energy drinks, shots, bars, etc. out there, and this isn't the worst.  It didn't leave me feeling like I'd crashed a few hours after drinking/taking it, but it also didn't exactly turn me into a tiger, full of energy.  The taste is vaguely berry-like, albeit not like any berry found in nature.  If I was looking for energy shots, I might try this again; I've had better luck with a 10-minute walk and/or a cup of coffee or tea (even decaf) followed by a tall glass of water.
