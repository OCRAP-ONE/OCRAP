review/text: These little nuts are so delicious, I can't even describe it.  When I think of glazed nuts, I think of overly sweet totally crystallized with sugar.  It almost held be back from buying these, but they are nothing like that. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to sample them before buying, otherwise I never would have.  They are the perfect amount of sweetness with real fruit pieces that taste like fruit and vanilla!  I would highly recommend these to everyone. Very filling too, unlike most snacks.  You only need to eat a few pieces and you don't feel icky after eating them.

review/text: Swedish Fish is some of the very best candy I've ever had--and you can take that from me, an old man who's eaten a lot of candy in his day! LOL Seriously, though, these little red fish shaped candies are indeed every bit as soft and chewy as they say they are. They also have a great sweet cherry flavor to them that you can easily get hooked on--stock up on these before any big storm hits! SMILE<br /><br />Of course, although they are a fat free food they contain sugar; and sugar can turn to fat in your system if you're not an especially active person. Eat these with that caveat in mind. Moreover, sugar can be bad for your teeth. If you need a sugar free food for health reasons, then you should pick another type of candy.<br /><br />The Swedish Fish come in an easy to handle 14 ounce bag; the bag is easy to open and you don't have to close it tightly up again for the candy to remain fresh. I wouldn't worry about freshness--as long as you don't expect the Swedish Fish to stay fresh more than several weeks after opening the bag, I suppose.<br /><br />Overall, this candy is great to munch on when you're at the movies or if you just get a craving for chewing on some really delicious chewy candy. Enjoy!

review/summary: A staple in our house
review/text: I was thrilled when Amazon started carrying these aseptic milk cartons; they are great to keep around the house. Normally I buy either 2 percent milk or skim, but occasionally we will run out of milk and my toddler always wants milk first thing in the morning - we just pull one of these out of the fridge and no problem. Also great to keep around for those recipes that call for whole milk, when you don't want to buy a whole gallon. We've also used these to take with us on trips for cereal, coffee, drinks, etc. and it's great because you don't have to refrigerate the carton until you open it. We've saved a lot of money on restaurant breakfasts on vacation by taking milk and cereal with us, using the hotel fridge to keep the milk cold, and eating breakfast in the room every morning. Great for general household use, travel, cooking, or whatever you can think up!

Chill a carton of it, shake it up, pour it, drink it -- and I defy anyone to tell it from fresh whole milk from the store.  In fact, it's much better than some of the milk in the grocer's dairy case.  This is rich, flavorful milk from cows on good pasture.  We use it for drinking and for cooking.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I hope we'll always be able to order it through Amazon, too, because it is wonderful have it delivered right to the door.

review/summary: Best boxed milk I've tried so far
review/text: This brand's boxed milk tastes great.  There's not much to say really; it's convenient to have boxed milk on hand, even if you still buy regular milk, in case you run out.  These boxes are definitely easier to handle overall too; they take up less space in the refrigerator and because of the shape they are easier to tuck in amongst the other contents.  The flip-top is also convenient.  I will note that when you first open one of these, when pouring it might chug a bit if you pour such that there is no air opening left at the spout end.  I suppose you could poke a hole on top somewhere to alleviate this; but I don't find it to be a serious problem.

review/summary: This milk is a winner!!
review/text: I love the convenience of having the asceptic carton. I ordered this for the first time a month ago and they fit so nicely in my pantry. I am thinking about using this as my primary milk. It sure frees up fridge space because I usually buy 3 gallons at a time. Those gallons sure do take up space in my fridge. I also like the fact that Organic Valley is one of the real organic milk out there. It gets 4 cows out of 5 in Cornucopia.org (the site uses cows instead of stars), the official site for all things organic when it comes to dairy products. They get my 5 star here on Amazon because it is rather difficult to get a 5 cow rating milk where I live in NYC.

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: I love this tea.  It has a mellow smooth flavor and definitely better tasting than the average supermarket tea.  I like the way it makes me feel good almost instantly.  It does rev up your metabolism even though it is caffeine free...you can feel the difference!  If you have searched the Net, you will know that Amazon has the best bargain for this tea.

review/summary: Kinda pricey ...
review/text: As for aiding in the slimming process?  Nope, not a bit.  It does have a nice hint of lemon, very light.  The tea bags are connected, so one must use caution in separating them, otherwise the bags tear apart.  For a nice cup of tea, Slim Tea is okay.  For weight loss, not so much, in my opinion.

review/summary: It Works
review/text: Most diet teas always make my stomach hurt and I spend the whole night throwing up & having diarrhea, but this tea doesn't do that. I recommend to drink one cup of this tea every other day. It takes anywhere from 30 mins to 4 hours for it to work. Never drink a cup right before going to work.

review/text: I have not been drinking as much as the box suggest but it tasted good to me. One interesting fact: after been drinking it for few weeks now I've noticed some funny aftertaste. Not every time even but you feel kinda like you've smoked a cigarette. And I'm not a smoker so how would I know. Probably from being a second hand smoker:)  Anyway I've yet to tell you if id did what it advertised to do.

review/summary: E L I X I R.....O F.....L I F E....? ? ? ?  ( Yet ...One....More....Testamonial ...! )
review/text: I have tried to lose weight for a long, l o n g, time.  Also for a long, l o n g time, I have seen newpaper advertizements for this tea.  It seemed ridiculous to me at first.... I mean, lose weight by DRINKING TEA?  This idea had just about as much credibility to me as some of those sauna belts, (which can help you lose weight for a full 24 hours....after which time it comes back again!)<br /><br />Well, last year I was getting pretty desperate.  I had somehow managed to lose 40 pounds....by drinking only regular tea, instant coffee, and home-made lemonade, and eating only Bird's Eye Vegetables and turkey. (In fact, I have invented the "Turkey Diet"! It's very simple: Eat Turkey, Fall Asleep (from the tryptophan!).....and if you fall asleep, you can't eat, you see.  A variation, I guess, on the "Hollywood Diet", which can be used only on weekends....because most people need to stay awake during the week to go to work!)  Anyway, this diet worked for me....but it was pretty boring....took most of my free time away, and....turkey is expernsive!  I gradually stopped this diet, and gradually got back 20 of those 40 pounds.  I looked desperately for another way to lose weight....but drinking tea to do it just didn't logical....<br /><br />However, no other method presented itself that was as inexpensive as drinking tea....and after all that expensive (but delicious!), turkey, it seemd a good way to go.  Now, this particular tea itself IS quite expensive -- $43 for 4 ounces, (on sale....ouch!)....but the 4 ounces of lose tea would make at least 60 6 ounce cups, (360 ounces...and I'd of course be adding my own water and sweetener)....so I figured, why not?  (Well...because of the possible bad taste, that's why not.  I've tried herbal teas in the past, and -- with the delicious exception of Jasmine Tea -- thoroughly disliked each one.)  But even so, I decided to risk it...I've tasted far worse things than herbal tea, after all....<br /><br />So, about a year ago, I sent away for it.<br /><br />When the Wu-Long tea arrived, (in a lovely little transparent green plastic bag, lined with aluminum foil, giving the impression of a crushed green diamond), I made it and drank it.  Hmmm, (or rather, "Mmmm!")  Not bad tasting at all!  It tasted like the best black tea...the kind, (other than Jasmine), that I like the best.  But,,,,as the tea was SO expensive, I decided not to drink it too often....<br /><br />As the owner of a "healthy refrigerator", (one LOADED with vitamins, which I take only in emergencies, because I can't afford to keep buying them), I now had this "healthy tea", which I put in the refrigerator to keep it fresh), to sort of keep the vitamins company!  I did throughly read the literature that came with the tea, however....and noticed that many people had praised the MEDICINAL qualities of this tea, along with it's weight-loss abilities.  Hmmm....  I decided that I had happily gotten more than I bargained for....a weight-loss tea AND one which helpoed with other health problems.  Nice to get such a bargain -- but, at $43 for 4 ounces of lose tea, it was still quite expensive.  And so, after that first cup, I restrained myself from drinking it, for quite some time.....<br /><br />Actually, I didn't drink another cup until about two weeks ago!  I was beginning to feel as if the minor cut I had gotten the week before had somehow let an infection in, (though the cut itself didn't look infected.)<br /><br />Anyway, I was beginning to feel very, Very, VERY w....e....a...k.....  Two years ago, in fact, I was hospitalized with an infection....the very same infection that killed my mother the month before!  My mother, in the hospital, had said that she "felt like a vegetable", and, having gotten the same infection, I knew how accurate that description really was: I was SO weak, then, in fact, I had had trouble raising my arms above my head!  And now I felt it was starting to happen again!  My first thought was to call 911.  But my second thought was, strangely, concentrated on those glowing testimonials I had read from other customers who had used Wu-Long tea.  I figured I'd try to make myself a cup....if the tea didn't work, I could always call 911....  After all, though I felt very weak, I didn't feel totally paralzyed....yet, anyway.  But I knew I had to make and drink that tea fast.....before total weakness engulfed me.  Did I feel up to doing so?  Yes....I F...took my time, I F...I was very careful, and...I F.. I stayed very near the telephone as I made the tea....just in case....<br /><br />I managed to make myself the cup of tea....to wait for it to cool down a bit....and to drink it.  Within an hour, the feeling of weakness had left me!  And, as of this writing....taking place a full two weeks later....the weakness, (and presumably the infection), have not come back!<br /><br />(OH, IF ONLY I HAD HAD THE COURAGE TO BUY THIS TEA ..T W O.. YEARS AGO, AND GIVE IT TO MY WONDERFUL MOTHER!!!!!!)<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying this tea will work miracles for everyone, and in every circumstance.  The tea did NOT transform my looks to those of Princess Grace, (whom I consider the most beautiful woman of all time), and have NOT cured me of a very slight case of Myasthenia Gravis...a neuro-muscular ailment which I have had since the age of four.  I DOUBT very much that it has made me immortal, and I know for a fact that it has NOT granted me super-powers, or the ability to fly, or to transcend time.<br /><br />(No one has ever accused me of not having a good imagination! : )  HOWEVER, UPON DRINKING THAT TEA, MY FEELINGS OF INFECTION, (a feeling of weakness quite different from that of Myasthenia Gravis), DID GO AWAY!  I don't remember what the other testimonals for this tea were....but I'm sure, now, that at least 98% of them are true!<br /><br />Perhaps there is no real "fountain of youth".  But this tea...which seems to cure many ailments, and most probably helps one lose weight as well, if taken often enough, seems a very close second.  Ponce de Leon would have been happy with it, I'm sure.  I don't know if it will help everyone...but I do know it helped me, (and probably the other people who gave testimonials, too.)  And that second cup of tea -- even the whole 4 ounces of lose tea -- are certainly less expensive than going to the hospital!  For those on a budget, like me, Wu-Long tea is, it seems, destined to be used as a luxury, and/or in an emergency.  But I really feel it belongs in every home.....just like aspirin does.  And -- for emergency use...PLEASE take the same precautions I did: 1) Be sure you do have the energy to actually make and drink the tea, and 2) Be near a telephone, so you can call 911, in case the tea doesn't work for you.<br /><br />The tea did work for me, in the above circumstance, anyway.  An elixir of life?  Perhaps and perhaps not, depending on the person and the circumstances.  All I know is, that for me, and under the circumstances described above, it certainly seems to have saved mine!

review/summary: JUST THE FLAX, MA'AM
review/text: I wanted flax and, boy, did I ever get it!  The reviewer who said only one 40-ounce canister is included in this offer was wrong.  (Maybe he should inquire further about his order.)  I received TWO 40-ounce canisters, and that is a lot of flax!  Included inside each canister is a 2-ounce measurer (like you use with coffee), which is very convenient.  Also, I was pleased to read that because this is a cold-milled flax. it does not require refrigeration, unless you want to.  I am enjoying it mixed in my applesauce (gives it a thicker texture that I like) and sprinkled on my peanut butter on toast (gives the peanut butter a nutty texture).  This is an introduction to flax for me (and I guess I will be a pro at using it by the time I have used 80 ounces!).  I am glad I chose this particular product as my first experience with it.

review/summary: Croutons?
review/text: First, I want to preface criticism with a compliment...I've tried a variety of Kay's Naturals products; pretzels, protein chips, cereal, etc... including their Almod Delight flavor of their "protein puffs," which are probably among my favorite snacks. Kay's Naturals does a great job at making deceptively high-protein snacks with no disappointment in taste ( Depending on your expectations going in of course..)<br /><br /> I would say I was surprisingly satisfied with all the products I've tried - this one being the exception. Perhaps because I had higher expectations from my previous experiences with KN. I did finish  the bags I ordered, but for those looking for a more savory or satisfying flavor, this particular product by Kay's may not be the best.<br /><br />The taste (and texture) I would best describe as that of a crouton - a little bit lighter, depending on the kinds of croutons you've consumed -  less crunchy and more like a "puff" - but overall fairly bland alone. This may or may not be what your after - if you want a way to get more protein without a bunch of extra sugar or fat ( though most of KN products don't have an excessive amount of either of these anyway) it might be a perfectly fine choice. However, I would warn against having high-flavor expectations.

review/text: I first bought these peppercorns as a present for my boyfriend's grandmother. Initially I bought them because of her love of pepper. After smelling the peppercorns and tasting them, it was apparent that they were unlike any other. To this date she keeps one peppercorn grinder to herself and keeps another for her guests. While this may seem selfish, I can understand her interests. These peppercorns have the initial pungent sting of the peppercorn but then follow and finish with a clove-like aftertaste. These peppercorns are absolutely amazing for anyone trying to find something different within the realm of peppercorns and seasonings in general.

review/summary: Wonderful flavor; easy to brew
review/text: This is simply one of the best teas I have ever had.  The only green tea I've had that was better was Jasmine Pearls, also available through this merchant on this website.  But this stuff is the best among the plain green teas.  It has a sweet, fruity flavor with a hint of bitterness that adds wonderful complexity.  This is definitely the right tea for any green tea lover!<br />It's also great for anyone who's been a little wary of looseleaf tea, since the leaves are large enough to fish out with a fork if they escape the infuser.  They are quite large, about half an inch across when fully brewed.  I used a teapot with a ceramic strainer built into the spout, not an infuser, but I still had no problems with "floaters" in my teacup.<br />Gosh, this stuff is so good that I drank at least 16 ounces the first night.  I sat there for over an hour with my teapot and little two ounce cup.<br />HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!

review/summary: The best for chip dip!
review/text: I use to use the regular Lipton Onion soup mix for chip dip until I came across this a few years back.  This is far and away the best for dip.  The other was too salty and too strong.  However, the Golden Onion is far less salty and more subtle.  Lipton suggests using one packet for each pound of sour cream.  However, I buy a 3 lb of Daisy sour cream at Walmart and mix two packets (2.6 oz's) into the container and it makes the best dip.  I have literally caught guests dipping their fingers in it.  I hope they never quite offering it.  I like it best with big thick pretzels.  It's also delicous with vegies too.  My husband and I are active in the motorcycling community and and we like to entertain.  People literally look forward to our gatherings because they know we'll have the dip.  My husband tells our friends it's his "secret recipe".

review/summary: Finally, my crock pot roast tastes "right" again! :)
review/text: I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong with my crock pot roasts. They suddenly became almost too salty to eat when I used onion soup mix (along with a can of Cream of Mushroom soup) to cook them with. Then I realized that I had switched to Lipton's regular Onion Soup mix because my local stores stopped carrying the Golden Onion. I was betting that was the problem and purchased a case of the Golden Onion from Amazon. Now all is right with the world. :) What a difference - my roasts taste perfect again now. If you use Lipton's Onion soup in any of your foods (dips, mixed in hamburgers, roasts, stews) and find them way too salty, switch to the Golden Onion.

review/text: I have a specific dish that needs the Golden Onion Recipe specifically and the supermarkets don't seem to carry it though they carry the other Lipton products.<br /><br />It is a lighter color, and seems slightly less salty, than the regular Lipton Onion Recipe. Try substituting it for the regular version in your recipes calling for the Onion recipe.

review/text: This soup mix is the key ingredient for my favorite soup recipe, and I can no longer find Golden Onion in my local grocery stores.  So I bought a whole case.  I've never tried it as a soup on it's own, but it also adds some great flavor is you add a little to your breading mix for homemade chicken tenders.

review/summary: bitter bitter flavor.
review/text: hmmm.  maybe i received a bad batch?  i made a stew with this product, and it turned the entire pot extremely bitter.  so much so, that i had to actually throw it all away!  i even had my mother taste it, in case it was just me.  She was disgusted.  it had a really strange medicinal taste, that i don't understand for a food product.  i've used lipton soup mixes before, so this surprised me greatly.  i opened a 2nd box, just to check, and the powder itself is extremely bitter.<br /><br />i can't return the 12 count box, unfortunately....bizarre experience, and i'm very dissapointed and even somewhat nervous that i ate something chemically poisonous, in the golden onion recipes product.

I was very happy with the product when it arrived to my house it was everything was expecting, I was not disapointed. If there is a down side, it was the fact that I wanted to use the soup mix for a family reunion that was to happen two weeks from the day I ordered the product and it took nearly 4 weeks for my order to arrive. I was not very happy. But I am still satisfied anyway.

There are not words to describe how disgusting the new version is.  The change in recipe was unnecessary, uncalled-for and is ruining the brand name Ovaltine after so many generations of loyalty.  This change reminds me of "New Coke!"

review/summary: DELICIOUS!
review/text: I have not eaten pea soup in a long time because peas are a high glycemic index food but the picture on the can looked really inviting so I thought I'd try it again.  And it is truly delicious!  The peas are el dente and most are whole halved peas not just a mushed up mess.  The flavor is that of definitely fresh peas with enough ham pieces (though very little in size) to be perfection for the taste buds in every mouthful.  The salt content is really high though so one must not eat more than one can every other day at the most.  The flavor is really delightful and I highly recommend this soup if you can tolerate the high salt levels.  It is truly a scrumptious soup!
