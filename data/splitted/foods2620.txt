review/summary: Poorly packaged--0 stars when purchased from Amazon--5 Stars when purchased from Company's website
review/text: I usually order Really Raw Honey directly from the manufacturer, but saw it on Amazon and wanted it quickly. I got it in two days, but when it arrived it had been so poorly packaged that both jars broke and there was glass and honey everywhere!! They were in a small box with just one layer of bubble wrap on one of the jars! I requested a refund from Amazon, and I'm sure they'll take care of it, but this was disappointing. Recommendation: Order Really Raw Honey directly from their website...it's cheaper there anyway, and they know how to safely package their products.<br /><br />I love Really Raw Honey and it's the best honey I've ever tasted!! Has lots of great healing properties as well.  When my daughter and I get a cold or our allergies are bothering us, it's the first thing we reach for!  Love it...just wish Amazon could've packaged it properly<br /><br />Update:  Amazon gave me a full refund.  Thanks Amazon! Best customer service EVER! Hate to say though, I'll still be ordering this honey from the company's website in the future.

review/text: I've gotten Yummy Chummies many times before for my dog who loves them.  This time I ordered them on line and paid quite a bit more for them including shipping.  When I received them I opened them to give one to my dog I found out they were very hard.  Not soft and chewy as they advertise and I'd found them in the past.  :-(  I'm not sure I'll order them on line again.

review/summary: Dogs love it
review/text: I have two Yorkies, a 10 year old and a 7 month old.  They love these treats.  My oldest dog is allergic to so many food and that would include most snacks.  This does not bother him.  He hates his prescription snacks and prescription food which is venison and sweet potato.  I'd give them a five star rating except they are so soft, they tend to crumble.  By the time we get to the bottom of the bag, its just a lot of dust...which they lap up on a plate. :)

review/summary: Marinated morsels are his favorite!  Subscription shippping is mine!
review/text: The combination of tiny bites and gravy makes Fancy Feast Marinated Morsels our little Burmese cat's choice of moist food.  Fish is his favorite (he finishes it all at once) but we limit that to twice a week for reasons of his urinary tract health.  However, Simba enjoys all the FF Marinated Morsels and I recommend this product for all kittys.  I've always read labels on cat food and Fancy Feast has decidedly more protein than any other name brand.  The frosting on the cake is the free shipping and convenience of subscription for this and all the other Marinated Morsel varieties.  These are not always available at the pet store, frequently not available at the grocery store -- and almost always more expensive, even if on sale.  I LOVE this subscription program!

review/summary: Decaf Delight from the Garden State!
review/text: I love coffee and lots of it. Wary of over-caffeinating myself, I blend decaf and regular beans in my grinder. It's tough to find a decaf with substance, and being budget-minded I try to buy in volume. I'm from the coffee mecca of Seattle, so When I saw that this coffee was from New Jersey, I thought oh, no! - would there be an acrid taste of smoke reminiscent of factories and Tony Soprano's cigars? (Not that I don't like a smoky aspect to my coffee.) Though wary, I decided to take a chance when I saw that Coffee Bean Direct offered an impressive variety of beans, even though most were not decaf and a few were of the dreaded flavored variety. Well, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised - no Jersey-industrial taint at all! I will order this again.

review/summary: Great tasing, good price, fresh, but chemical decaffeination
review/text: I have been using this in my espresso machine for about six months now. I like a dark roast for espresso, I don't want a lot of caffeine, but I like my morning coffee. I have my own grinder for freshness.<br /><br />This makes a great tasting cup of dark espresso. It is not too acidic, has a rich but not biting flavor sort of chocolaty, and is 40% or more cheaper than similar quality dark roast decaf coffee beans locally.<br /><br />Some are concerned about minute chemical residues from the decaffination process, and prefer and water-decaf coffee. However I figure they wash out the chemical pretty well and this has very little caffeine compared to most decaf (which can have up to 30% the normal caffeine level).<br /><br />Also note that some "water process" decaf coffee also uses chemicals. Only the "Swiss water" process does not use any chemicals and that is not that common. CO2 process is the safest. I would guess if a company used Swiss water or C02 process decaf that they would say so in big letters, because they do not use any toxic chemicals.<br /><br />This same company makes a CO2 process decaf espresso roast which is 10% less expensive, and is a darker roast than French but lighter than Italian.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UOA23M">Coffee Bean Direct CO2 Decaf Espresso Coffee, 5-Pound Bag,Net 2265 g.</a>

review/text: I don't like decaf. Call me crazy but I can always tell decaf by taste. It just isn't the same as real coffee.<br /><br />That is in the past. This decaf has all the flavor of regular coffee without any decaf aftertaste. It is full bodied with a hint of chocolate flavor exactly like my favorite espresso roast. I decided to cut back on caffeine so I mix this decaf 50/50 with my espresso and I can't tell the difference when I make espresso or latte. In the late afternoon when I want the taste of an iced latte but not the caffeine I use 100% decaf.<br /><br />To make this coffee an even better deal you can use subscribe and save to get 15% off and free shipping.

We have tried a variety of brand's (Jeremiah's, Eight O'Clock, etc.) and have not been satisfied as the coffee never tastes good. I found Coffee Bean Decaf and decided to try it. Ever since, it has been our solution - it is a good price and has a bold, deep taste that is not acidic.

I have been getting this item on subscription for a year, and have compared it to the decaf expresso I get in the real world. For someone who drinks a lot of coffee, the subscription price is unbeatable. I have no clue as to why a few people gave this product one-star -- my guests (usually sophisticated coffee drinkers) love it and so do I. Maybe it's the type of expresso machine one has .....<br /><br />Old review<br />----------<br />Price was great. Crema, flavor, and aroma very good. Minor problem is that beans seem to have a bit of external oil, and they sometimes do not all slide down the shallow slope of my expresso maker.<br /><br />P.S. I signed up for monthly deliveries, and they arrive like clockwork (but also make it easy to skip a shipment!).

Worried about being disappointed, however, I put off trying this product until today. I wish I hadn't waited so long!

review/text: The best veggie jerky on the market. period. As a former Tofurky Jurky junkie, and not being able to find the tofurky brand jerky anywhere (including Vegas!) at whole foods, online, etc. . I was on the hunt for some high protein TASTY jerky. I tried cactus jerky, primal brand jerky, and a few others and they just didn't measure up and didn't taste anything like beef jerky.<br /><br />I was super excited when my order arrived (I got the variety pack) and I tried them one at a time (one per day) and loved every single one of them.<br /><br />While the flavors aren't vastly different, there are subtle differences, giving folks who like spicy, sweet, smokey all a "favorite".<br />Cowgirl tastes the most like the Tofurky brand jerky. I honestly love all of their flavors and will be ordering more and some extra to take with me to Burning Man this summer.<br /><br />Amazing stuff! So happy to have found them. :)

review/text: I'm not a vegan - although I did try a vegetarian diet for about 8 months. I just didn't like all the weight I gained, and I had a really hard time finding adequate and flavorful replacements for the things I love - like cheese - so I went back to eating meat. Even so, I can say that this is a great tasting snack! Yes, it's dry (like "regular" jerky) and is pretty chewy (again, like regular jerky), and some people (me included) prefer the softer versions of jerky.  Having said all that, I still like this jerky and eat it about as often as I eat regular jerky! I love that it comes in so many different flavors - something for everyone I guess, although Cowgirl is my favorite.  I haven't tried Teriyaki yet, but since I love Teriyaki (and Soy Vey) I'm looking forward to that one, too.  I also like that I can pick it up locally since the stores in my area stock it.

review/summary: Mixed Feelings about it...
review/text: I'm a long time veggie but I still miss jerky and need something to up the protein in my diet so it makes a great snack!  The texture of this jerky is VERY close to the real thing!  It's got the best texture of any of the other jerky that I've tried so it definitely gets 5 stars for texture.  On to taste... well the one I was hoping would be really great - the spicy one wasn't spicy - well not to my taste anyway.  Like another reviewer I got rather a strange aftertaste and although I liked it well enough eating it, I didn't like the aftertaste.  On to the Cowgirl flavor - this one was a bit better for me as far as flavor and aftertaste.  The original flavor was quite good also as was the fourth flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line... even though this one was the best textured jerky I can't say that the flavors bowled me over.  Actually I think I'm probably headed back to primal even though I don't love the texture :(  So like I said I'm mixed on this jerky - some good - some not so good but nothing really negative.<br /><br />If I wasn't fairly happy with the jerky I was eating I would definitely recommend you give this one a try - all our tastes vary and this may be the right one for you.

review/summary: Ehh..
review/text: The texture is exactly what the other vegan/vegetarian jerky companies (that i've tried) went wrong on..Vegan dream jerky got it to almost perfectly mimic the jerky I remember from my meat eating days. Unfortunately, those other companies got one thing right that vegan dream just didn't quite get right for the most part: taste. I was looking forward to trying each of them, and I started with teriyaki. My girlfriend said it tasted like paper, and that was surprisingly accurate..Next I tried the hot chili pepper. I was excited about it because I LOVE hot foods. It was both not very good and a huge disappointment as far as spice goes. Not very hot at all, not very great tasting. Next was the hickory pepper..This was by far my favorite, and I will probably be placing an order for JUST this one soon. Last was the cowgirl..It claims "hint o' spice, hint o' sweet" but I got a hint o' neither of those things..Taste was very bland<br /><br />All in all the hot chili pepper, teriyaki, and cowgirl tasted almost exactly the same and I do not plan on buying any of them again..As stated, I will most likely be buying the hickory pepper again, and it is the only one of the 4 that I would suggest to anybody..I was going to give this a 1 or 2 star, but the hickory alone made it worth a 3.

review/text: The different flavors are interesting, and I enjoyed all of them. This is a drier, chewier version of veggie jerky, in thin, flat pieces like a fruit roll up. It's alot different from the Primal veggie jerky, which is juicier because it has a sauce added to it (at least the hickory smoked flavor did...that is the only flavor I have tried of that brand).

Trader Joe's makes a similar cheese stick, for a dollah less.  Both are equally wonderful. This is the grown-up version of Cheese Nips.  Leaves all the other products in the dust.

review/summary: I am an adult with GERD
review/text: I recently ended up with GERD and a really bad bleeding ulcer, due to stress and grief.  I have problems keeping food down and went on a baby food diet for the sake of thriving.  Some types of baby food stay down,  where as other types cause me indigestion just as bad as adult food.  This specific sweet potato one seemed to ease my acid refluxing and indigestion and sooth my throat.  I'm not at the point where I can eat the whole container yet,  but this is a good start.  This also has a pleasant taste.  Some of the baby food is just bland and boring,  but this one is alright.  Not the best but still alright. Please be weary if you're having gastrointestinal problems.  Babyfood is such a great idea if you're having problems keeping things in,  and need to retrain your stomach and intestines.  Just be careful,  some are more acidic than others.<br /><br />By the way,  this doesn't have all the nutrients you would need to survive.  As a adult you'd need about 12-16 small jars a day and you'd need to make sure you get enough protein.  So be careful,  this is only a temporary fix for people with ulcers and GERD.

review/summary: Something Nice
review/text: Ito En Sencha Shot is a very decent product and a nice departure from the current run of energy drinks. Following the wildfire success of Red Bull, company after company has come up with energy drinks involving high concentrations of caffeine and taurine. Caffeine has known long-term effects on health, while taurine has barely been studied.<br /><br />Sencha Shot is a refreshing departure from the common approach to sports/energy drinks. Instead of loading it with strange things that produce a big lift in the drinker's feelings of overall physical energy, Sencha shot takes a milder and much more sensible approach giving the drinker a quick dose of chilled green tea with some vitamin C added, offering the *positive* health effects of the green tea's antioxidant properties. To put that another way, in comparison with other "proper" energy drinks like Red Bull, Amp, MDX, Rock Star etc, etc, drinking Sencha Shot is a lot less like getting hit with a hammer.<br /><br />Now it's true that you could for all intents and purposes get all the effects of Sencha Shot by brewing a big pot of decent-quality green tea, and then eating an orange, but it wouldn't be portable and you'd look very strange if you offered it to someone.<br /><br />Be that as it may, the most I can tell you about it is that I like it. It's good and good for you and it's not expensive. In fact, when bought by the case, on a per-can basis, it costs around half what Starbuck's doubleshot espresso does and there's not a thing wrong with it. It may be the only "energy drink" on the market that you could give to a child with a clear conscience.

You can drink it hot or cold. When it is hot it is a smooth, earthy and strong tea. Perfect for mornings. When cold it is about twice as strong and almost tastes like grass. Which I think is good in the afternoon. You will get a boost of energy and get a full feeling after drinking this. It is a wonderful drink and it is really good for you!

This is a nice alternative to traditional energy drinks.  The rest of the day after drinking the Sencha Shot I felt alert and well rested.

review/summary: Great Tea in Dented Cans
review/text: I love this tea and often stick a chilled can in my bag when I leave the house. I just wish the company could solve their packaging problem. When I received my last order, 21 of the 30 cans were dented--some only slightly, some badly. That means only 9 cans were undented. Yet I will continue to order it because I love it (and can't find it in any local stores).

review/summary: The best bottled/canned green tea out there
review/text: I've tried lots and lots of bottled and canned teas, and I can say with confidence that Sencha Shot is the purest, best-tasting green tea out there. It's full of healthy catechins. And zero sugar. For those who are used to sugary iced teas, the taste may take some getting used to--might even seem bitter--but once you do, you'll never want to return to sugary teas. I feel awake and healthy in the mornings when I've had my can or two of Sencha Shot.

review/summary: Drink it for your Health!
review/text: Like the "Dr. Andrew Weil For Teas", the Sencha Shot first tasted a bit strange to me.  I likened it to drinking liquid grass!  We Americans are not used to drinking such powerful Green Tea.  (Ours is so diluted, by comparison.)<br /><br />But I tried it.  And I kept thinking about the fact that it was highest in the amount of antioxidants in it.  And I kept drinking it, and got used to the flavor.  This tea is just plain good for you.  Eventually, I grew to like the flavor.  (It's really big in Japan)<br /><br />I will say though, that I DO prefer Dr. Andrew Weil's Tumeric Tea, also brought to you by Ito En.  So I buy one case of this, and two cases of the other.  And BEST of all is the FREE SHIPPING from Amazon!<br /><br />To your Health!

review/summary: Lovely way to start my day
review/text: I was trying to be good and make my own green tea overnight for the next morning, but I only have one coffee cup, and carrying my own containers around in a hospital is pretty gross, so...I was at Whole Foods spending my entire paycheck when I found this Sencha Shot.  I'm on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, so can't take all those weird energy drinks as they make my intestines want to escape my body--too much sugar, or syrup, or fake sugar, and mysterious ingredients that have no research behind them--it all makes me sick (and probably makes other people sick, but subclinically).  Tried the Sencha Shot this morning as I began to study for a big exam (the last of the USMLEs! yess!) I have this afternoon, and wow, I feel wonderful!  It's got a bit of bite as others have said (I think of it as the "hops" of green tea), and it is delicious.  If you like green tea at all, you will enjoy this.  Very convenient, small enough to fit in a white coat pocket, or purse, or briefcase if that's your style.  I'd like to test the antioxidant levels and compare them to the green tea I make and home and see which was better, but I don't have that kind of equipment at home (do have a yogurt maker and an egg cooker, so maybe antioxidant assay is my next purchase).

review/summary: Not delicious but not bad either
review/text: First let me say that I was concerned about getting all those dented cans, but it appears that Amazon fixed that problem by putting the case in a box so they were fine.  Only one can was slightly dented, no big deal.  The taste at first is "yuck" kind of like eating grass or weeds, then you get more used to it.  I drink it because it's good for you and not because it tastes so awesome.  And I am a fan of caffeine without drinking coffee, which I hate. Also like the anti-oxidant factor.  My boyfriend who is into health likes it too, likes ice tea but wants to eliminate the sugar.  I have another case coming soon, I got on the automatic shipment plan where you save a few bucks if it automatically comes to your house every month or so.  So yes I will continue to drink this, not every day, but in place of Lipton or other sweetened teas, I never liked packaged ice tea but this product is a good healthy alternative.

review/summary: Dented Cans, Potent Tea
review/text: Trust me, you are more likely to get dented cans than to NOT get dented cans.  This comes packaged as a flimsy box within a slightly more sturdy Amazon delivery box.  No other padding.  Your delivery man does not have any idea this thing should be treated with any type of care.  So it's mostly a matter of HOW MANY dented cans you will have as opposed to IF you will have any dented cans.<br /><br />As for the product itself, this stuff is potent.  Again, trust me, if you are not a fan of straight brewed STRONG green tea, you're going to have to just suck it up and drink it because it is good for you OR cut it with some sugar, honey and/or lemon to make it more palatable for you.  Someone mentioned that if you're a fan of unsweetened black tea this would be comparable, but he/she is 100% WRONG.  I absolutely LOVE unsweetened strong long leaf Black Tea and drinking this Green tea is an entirely different taste experience.  Not exactly bad, but definitely different if you are not used to the unsweetened Green tea taste experience.<br /><br />One funny note, this drink kinda has an aftertaste that hints of Mary Juana if you catch my drift.  Not exactly a bad thing depending on your tastes.  Rock on.

review/summary: Healthy Energy
review/text: I had never heard of Sencho shot until I ran across these at my health food store.  I decided that this may could replace my daily addiction to an energy drink, LIMU Blue Frog, so I ordered a case from Amazon.  Sometimes one is perfect and other times I drink 2, but the best thing is the cost!  I was paying 3.50 per can for my Blue Frog and these are only .96 per can (free Amazon Prime shipping) which is a<br />good reason to drink in lieu of my other healthy fav.  Taste is smooth and these are endorsed by Dr. Weil, so I will continue to use.  I am wondering why they are made in China and would prefer that we had these here in the US, but will keep drinking anyway.

review/summary: Very refreshing and just the right bitterness
review/text: I've tried many different brands of green tea, mostly the brewing kind, and it's always difficult to find one in the US that's actually "green" the way I remember it from my childhood. So imagine my surprise when I found this tea in a can that had just the right color, with a hint of bitterness and a whiff of refreshing aftertaste. I drink this all the time now in the morning instead of my morning coffee, which has the disadvantage of leaving a bad aftertaste throughout the morning. This tea wakes me up with its slight bitter taste, and I feel so refreshed and energetic even though I imagine it has half the caffeine as most coffee brands. The small size makes it ideal for me to pop one or two in my purse to drink while I'm out and about at work when it may be difficult to grab a quick cup of coffee otherwise.<br /><br />And I also tried putting a dab on my cotton pad to refresh my face during the day at my desk. It's great for astringent, and given the price cheaper by the bucket than those I buy at drugstores.....<br /><br />So many uses, the right taste, and so convenient to use since it's in a small can. I highly recommend this for those who love green tea. For those not used to green tea, you'll start to love the bitter taste but it may take a few to get used to it.

review/summary: Taste is not like fresh sencha, but OK cold
review/text: I am used to and enjoy the taste of fresh sencha, which is very bright, grassy and fresh.  This canned version tastes dull and bitter-like if I brewed sencha for a half hour instead of for a minute or two and then let it sit for days--and also has that indescribably nasty taste that canned products sometimes pick up from the can.  I will not be purchasing another batch . . . although I could be persuaded to try it again if a version in glass jars was available.  Update: it does taste much better with ice cubes.

The consistency of it is almost like a peanut butter, nice smooth and thick. The flavour definately is different than the "honey" at the grocery store, but my kids love it with a tea or dissolved in a warm milk with cheerios for breakfast. You can get the same honey in whole foods and probably some other stores, but I find out that amazon has the best price. I read a lot about the numbers of honey and it says the +10 is the optimal, so that's the one I go with. One teaspoon a day does miracle. I didn't get sick at all this season. This honey+ neti pot are your best friends!
