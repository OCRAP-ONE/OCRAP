review/summary: A mite disappointed
review/text: I originally purchased the Mauna Loa chocolate covered macadamias from the Walgreens store in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  They came in small PACKAGES. The ones I am reviewing came in small can containers.  The difference between the two is very surprising.  The nuts in the PACKAGE were most delicious with nice large nuts.  The nuts in the can are quite small and the chocolate is not as tasty and extremly sweet.  If I had my druthers, I would purchase only the packages from Walgreens but sadly they no longer carry them.  Suffice it to say, I was most disappointed in the nuts in the can container.

review/text: I love these! When I was a little girl in Hawaii we got these on special occasions, only. Even now, I save them for special days! The nuts are smaller now , though.I'm not sure if they are not allowed to get bigger due to high demand, or if it is the environment. Perhaps because I was only a little thing!

review/summary: More chocolate than nut
review/text: I'm a big macadamias lover and generally speaking, Mauna Loa makes some of the best products out there. When I saw that Amazon had the chocolate macadamias on sale, I jumped at the chance to purchase these wonderful treats. Unfortunately these particular chocolate macadamias are covered in so much sweet milk chocolate it all but obliterates the taste of the macadamias. To illustrate, I've uploaded a picture which you should be able to find under the customer images at the top of the item page.  As you can see, the nut is covered with up to a quarter inch of chocolate.  On the plus side the chocolate is pretty good, very similar in flavor to the Hershey's Symphony line - but since that's about all you'll taste, you mine as well go for the Symphony bar with almonds and toffee instead - they're a lot cheaper.<br /><br />While I understand that these may be exactly what some people are searching for when they think "chocolate covered macadamia," I would have preferred a much lighter coating.  Hopefully the picture helps guide some buyers out there so you know what it is you're buying.

review/text: I expected a cheese wheel labeled "Wisconsin" to taste somewhat good however it was a strange dark orange color, did not taste good and the rind stained my cutting board. I did not want to waste food and throw it in the trash so I put it in the refrigerator however due to the taste, that is precisely where it ended up.

review/summary: A Staple at Our House
review/text: Nature Valley bars are a natural source of energy to fuel healthy active lifestyles. One bar has 140 calories. That's not bad for a bar that satisfies our cravings for candy bars. We keep a box of Fruit & Nut bars on hand. When we get ready to leave on a road trip, we take some with us. That way we can travel further without having to stop along the way. Sometimes we grab a bar in the morning when we are in a hurry. They make a good breakfast.<br /><br />Fruit & Nut Bars contain almonds, raisins, peanuts, and cranberries.<br /><br />In 1975, Nature Valley created the granola bar category. Since then Nature Valley has continued to set the standard for granola bars.<br /><br />Now it is possible to buy Nature Valley granola bars in all sorts of flavors, such as Apple Crisp, Strawberry Yogurt, Vanilla Yogurt, Blueberry Yogurt, Mixed Berry, Banana Nut, Oats and Honey, Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar, Roasted Almond, and Peanut Butter. We started with Fruit & Nut bars, and so far we have not managed to buy anything else. I suppose we should try other kinds, but Fruit & Nut bars are too good.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.

review/summary: Keep in the refrigerator
review/text: I always keep a box of these bars in my refrigerator.<br /><br /> If I had never seen the Fruit and Nut bars before, one look at the label would tell me that they are not particularly healthful.  The ingredients include corn syrup, honey, and sugar listed twice.  In fact, there are 14 grams of sugar in every 34 gram bar.  That is forty percent!  Although the label does claim all natural ingredients, that does not necessarily mean that the contents are all good for you.<br /><br /> The sugar seems to be what holds the fruit and nuts together.  The reason that I keep them in the refrigerator is that when the bars get warm, they do not hold their shape.  You do not want to put one in your pocket on a warm day.  They become a sticky blob.<br /><br /> So why do I keep a big supply of them around?  I like them.  When cooled, they keep their shape as a crunchy rectangle of nuts and fruit.  Their nutty texture is very nice.  The taste is great, although the sugar does make its presence known.  I do not eat them every day or take them with me to go hiking.  For that, I like the Oats and Honey, Almond, or Peanut Butter varieties of Nature Valley granola bars.  Those varieties have a more reasonable sugar content.  However, I like a Fruit and Nut bar as an occasional treat to go with tea or coffee.  Maybe I am addicted to them.

review/summary: Molasses...
review/text: One tbsp of Wholesome organic molasses offers 20% iron, 18% calcium which is more in compare to milk for every calorie, 15% potassium, 11% magnesium, and 10% copper. With 50 calories and 11gr sugar, I only use one tbsp a day in my green tea daily as well as when I am in need of fast energy, without any additives, right exactly before or in middle of of any sport like weight lifting, mountain biking, surfing, etc. if I have no access to banana or grapefruit. Potassium stops cramps and this is my life saver... This is a necessity just like I consume raw honey, Bragg's apple cider, organic flax-sesame seeds, etc. as super food. Once opened, I place some in a smaller tightly sealed container and keep it in refrigerator, refill as needed, but consume it within 6 months. I am into sports, diet and nutrition and blackstrap molasses' nutritional value varies depending on the quality of the sugar cane or beets from which it was extracted. For that reason organic form and brand is extremely important to me. Honey looses its medicinal value when added to hot tea or heat but since molasses is a by product which was heated during the production, further heat does not impact the nutritional value. With all that said, you it still takes some getting used to since the taste is somewhere around bitter, beet juice like which changes the taste of the tea. Bravo.

review/text: A glass bottle would have been better, it looked like glass in the photo, I didn't pay close enough attention. I usually avoid plastic AMAP especially after going to the expense of buying organic! I do not use molasses THAT much so I am not a good judge of the quality.  I figure organic is the safest way to go.  I use it mostly to make brown sugar (regular sugar + molasses = brown sugar.....I don't even mix it, just put both in my recipe....careful, a little goes a long ways!)

review/summary: Say no to stingy!  Say yes to Coffaro
review/text: Rarely does a biscotti ever have in reality all the goodies that the picture on the box promises.<br /><br />Coffaro's Almond & Cherry Olive Oil Biscotti deliveries the detail.<br /><br />Visit their website and discover that Coffaro is a family-run business, with only one product - allowing them to do one thing, and to do it very very well:  they make biscotti.<br /><br />There's no stinginess - the ingredients are top notch. The variety of almonds they use are fat, slightly rounded and a little bit small.  Small is plentiful and small is good in this case; these aren't the big mild-flavored things that show up in your bridge mix.  Instead, these almonds are so rich with the Amaretto flavor, that almond note of pure almond extraxt - that you'd swear that you smell the almonds before you crunch them.  They aren't broken bits of almonds either - that's for lesser manufacturers.  These are whole, fresh and delicious.  the most striking thing is how many of them turn up in each package - tremendously impressive in a world where other companies wave a single almond at the vat of cookie dough and call it good.<br /><br />The cherries make for a tender chewy punctuation between all the crisp, wonderful biscotti and crunchy, flavorful almonds.  The biscotti itself is slightly smoother than most, slightly denser than many of the crumbly bars offered up in premium coffee shops, yet the bite, the mouthfeel, all perfectly craggy, crunchy and satisfying.<br /><br />The Coffaro's traditional recipe is easy on the sugar, which is another factor that lets the texture and the almonds' flavor shine through as the top stars.  Do not fear the olive oil; this is clearly the second or third pressing elixir, containing all the healthy lipids, but none of the chlorophylls nor savory flavors of the extra-virgin type.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next Subscribe-n-Save shipment of these terrific bites of Italian tradition - already gave a box away to friends and they want more too.

review/text: I love biscotti and I always keep an eye out for new bicotti to try.  I found this on Amazon while doing a search and have to admit that the packaging really caught my eye, and the ingredients (hazelnut, orange zest, and olive oil) intrigued me.  My three boxes arrived yesterday and I couldn't make a cup of coffee fast enough to try these with.<br /><br />They did not disappoint!  In fact, they are divine.  They have a delicate hazelnut flavor with a dash of exciting orange zest that aren't lost when dunked in coffee. They're also not too sweet, they're just right.  They are the small-sized biscotti (a bit bigger than a man's thumb) and have a nice texture that is different from your typical super-hard crunchy biscotti (they have a smoothness that I'm guessing is the olive oil).<br /><br />These are an indulgent treat that I'd feel proud to serve to friends with coffee or tea.  I'm looking forward to trying their other flavors.

review/text: My pup absolutely adores these Veggie Life Happy Hips Chicken & Sweet Potato treats, and I feel good giving them to him since these are the real thing.  They look exactly like chicken and sweet potatoes that have been dehydrated. I also feel good that these are fortified with glucosamine and chondroitin to maintain healthy hips for my small cockapoo. Although large dogs often have hip problems, my combination of a cocker spaniel and poodle got the long legs of a poodle, so I give him these to make sure his hips stay in good shape for as long as possible. (I myself take a glucosamine and chondroitin supplement, per the recommendation of my sports medicine/orthopedic surgeon, to promote and support my own bone health and strength.)  "Miltie," my dog, is thrilled with the taste of these Veggie Life Healthy Hips Chicken & Sweet Potato goodies, as well as the Chicken & Apple flavor of these same treats.

review/summary: Simply Delicious! What Else Can I Say?
review/text: I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market, a company that has only recently invaded the southern California grocery business. It's an English company and they feature a lot of British and European things that you probably wouldn't find in most American stores. One of the things they feature is a variety of British candies. My wife tells me that European candies are better than American and I think she's right. In any case, I discovered where they keep the British candies away from the regular candies and in the baking section of the store so I'm trying them out, but only one bar at a time and only on the day I go shopping. This trip, I bought a Yorkie Original chocolate bar. Mmmmmm! Is it good! The flavor goes far beyond the typical American chocolate bar. Simply delicious! What else can I say? I suppose you'd have to discover this by yourself but if you ever get a chance, give it a try. Make sure it's imported from England and is marked ORIGINAL. Enjoy!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Excellent Rosehips Tea
review/text: I am not generally a big herbal tea drinker, but I do enjoy drinking rosehips tea.  I found it next to impossible to get good tea - rosehips tea bags are generally too dry and filled with by-products, often just flavored with rose hips.  I ordered Tao of Tea Rosehips with my fingers crossed.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The package contained two 3.5 ounce tins.  Each tin is sealed to protect the freshness of the contents inside.  I was hoping I would not find any twigs or other by-products (as added to teabags), and I definitely did not want hibiscus in the tea, as I find hibiscus to be too sour.  Rosehips are fruits of rose plants and they are generally sweet with a slightly tangy flavor.  When I first twisted the lid open, I saw that there was an additional, smaller lid inside, which definitely sealed the product.<br /><br />The tin seems too big for the product, as the tin looks half empty - but the tin does contain the 3.5 ounces of rosehips.  The rosehips themselves are fresh, dried, soft to the touch (freshly dehydrated).  I steeped one teaspoon of rosehips per 8 ounces of water (at 205 degrees) for seven minutes.  The tin does instruct a shorter steep time, but I like a stronger brew of rosehips.  Unlike the green tea (in which case one would add more tea leaves for a stronger brew), with rosehips one needs to brew the fruit longer.  The brew came out perfect.  Even when I made a whole pot of tea, and after standing for a while, the brew tasted great.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Very good product, high quality, but very expensive without a sale going on
review/text: When I ordered this sauce for the first time, it was on sale, so I dared to jump in and give it a try.<br /><br />In case you are worried to mail order glass jars with sauce, don't be - they were professionaly wrapped in bubble wrap (I mean, really each glass individually, as they should), and these bubble-wrapped jars then are swimming in a sea of packing "peanuts". So really, these people know how to pack! Unlike other amazon-packed items which have been delievered in desastrous conditions, THESE seem to come directly from the selling family, and they take pride and care in packing this well.<br /><br />The sauce is very mild and delicate, and I just love the feel of not-processed sauce, just like homecooked. For example the tiny seeds of the fresh tomatoes are still in it! I love to bite on them!<br /><br />I guess these are homecooked by the family selling them, at least they really taste like that.<br /><br />Nothing at all like the industrial (crappy!) jarred products from Unilever or Procter & Gamble! If you like Bertolli, Hunt's, Rinaldi's, Ragu, Prego or the like, DO NOT BUY THESE! Your taste has been destroyed by these processed industrial items, and this fine sauce would be a waste on your taste buds. I bet you would not even like it, as people who are conditioned to like processed industrial food products are no longer able to taste delicate things like this.<br /><br />Usually I am cooking pasta sauce from crushed Marzano tomatoes (I get Cento bottles for 3,50$ locally) and fresh ingredients. But when I am in a hurry, these Cucina Antica sauces are just as good as my own sauces.<br /><br />The problem (and REALLY the only reason why they are not getting all 5 stars in my rating): we are financially not wealthy and cannot afford the regular price. I would immediately buy them again, if only a new deal (sale) would come up. I am checking at least monthly on them, but it doesn't look like anything is coming. So I am waiting, and in the meantime I am cooking my own sauce with Marzano tomatoes.

review/text: I've been making my own sauce for over twenty years but sometimes I need to make things happen quickly in the kitchen.

Excellent balance of fresh tomato flavor, acidity and sweetness.<br /><br />I thought the basil note could be a little stronger so I added a little chopped fresh to the plate.<br /><br />This sauce is very good on its own or could be a quick start to a bolognese if you add meat; would be a terrific addition to a lasagne, baked ziti or pretty much any pasta dish that begins or ends with a red sauce.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and recommended.

review/text: You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25.<br /><br />Nespresso makes GREAT machines and GREAT coffee pods. These pod offers on Amazon however are mostly from third party vendors. They prey on people who don't know better, charging you 2x the price of ordering the pods directly from Nespresso. I have been ordering through Nespresso's website for a couple of years now and their shipping times are always fast and reliable. I buy many things through Amazon, but not Nespresso pods.

review/text: This is one of the tastiest instant noodles I have tried.<br /><br />Available in most oriental stores, "Lucky Me" brand has several flavors but this is by far, better tasting than the other ones. It has 4 individual packets, the meat, flavor, toasted garlic, and the aromatic oil.<br /><br />The "La Paz Batchoy" flavor is very popular in the Philippines.  The taste is unique; the aroma alone makes you feel hungry.<br /><br />It says it only takes three minutes to cook.  All you need to do is pour boiling water up to half inch below the top lid. Put the packets and you are ready to sup.  I prefer 5 or more minutes because 3 minutes seems the noodles are still half-done.

review/summary: Solid Beer Kit
review/text: I have brewed this beer and feel compelled to offer a counterpoint to the previous review, as it had nothing to do with the beer itself. I noticed or experienced a couple of common things as the first reviewer. First, oddly enough, I ordered this kit to be my 2nd brew. Secondly, I too was surprised when I read the instructions and found that they were not as detailed as my first brew. Thirdly, I was a little surprised that there was no priming sugar.<br /><br />But my experience with this kit was very different. The included instructions are a complete boil schedule. No, they're not detailed step by step instructions, but Rite Brew is clear in them that you should know how to brew or should familiarize yourself with brewing procedure. For instance, I had already read 'The Complete Joy of Homebrewing' cover to cover, so was not uncomfortable with the instructions. That's not to say I didn't make any novice brewer's mistakes.<br /><br />Regarding priming sugar...the item description does not mention it at all. This isn't false advertising. Besides, the instructions tell you exactly how much priming sugar or table sugar to use to prime it. I didn't get around to ordering priming sugar so tried using table sugar...more on that in a moment.<br /><br />The other thing I noted which the first review did not is that this did not come with Liquid Malt Extract, but rather with Dry Malt Extract. Not a big deal at all, but if you expect LME, getting DME is a bit of a surprise.<br /><br />So with that out of the way, about the beer. It is an easy brew. I used a rigid whisk to break up and incorporate the DME. During a brain-fart, I pitched the yeast before the wort had cooled enough and killed all the wheat beer yeast. Repitched with the yeast from another kit I ordered from Rite Brew (The Full Sail Amber Ale clone) and it fermented completely.<br /><br />When it came time for bottling, I realized I hadn't ordered any priming sugar so I went with the table sugar route (actually, organic evaporated cane juice). 2 weeks later the carbonation was perfect.<br /><br />Initially I didn't like the beer. It had many of the same flavor notes that I don't typically like in the Bavarian Wheat beers I've tasted. My wife, who I brewed this beer for, LOVED it. I've given several bottles to neighbors and have received HIGHLY positive reviews. After a few of these beers over the last couple of months, it has really grown on me. It has great fruity notes and is very smooth. I would definitely try this beer again and recommend it to others...but just be sure you know how to read a brew schedule.

review/summary: VERY DISAPPOINTED...10 Word Instructions?? No Sugar?
review/text: This beer is going to be my second beer batch that I have made. When buying these kits, you assume that these will come with certain things. The first thing  I noticed was missing from this kit was detailed INSTRUCTION on how to make the beer. I contacted the seller and they told me to read the first two chapters of a brew book that were free online.<br /><br />I was really dissapointed that I was now going to have to find detailed instructions on the internet, with the exact ingredients for the beer I had.<br />Also there was no SUGAR, which in my opinion is FALSE ADVERTISING because you buy a kit based on the assumption that your going to get everything to make the beer....this is false and you do not. You have to buy the sugar extra. I just thought I would let future buyers in on this, since its not stated in its description.<br /><br />My first kit was from Monster Brew Home Brewing Supplies. I would recommend them, and I personally will use them from now on for all my future brewing activities.

Jollytime was $1.50 for 2 lb bag and I'd say the quality and tenderness was about as good.  So even though this is a fine product, don't think I'd pay this premium when I can get something pretty similar at the local grocery store.

review/text: While a bit spendy, I have to say that getting an organic product that tastes this good is worth the extra price (which is still a pretty good deal).  One of my sons and I really like granola and yogurt for breakfast, and we both find ourselves snacking on this product throughout the day.  I will be adding it to my regular orders.  Is very tasty, and has a very light crunch for granola.  It's fairly sweet, as other posts have pointed out, but mixed with an unsweetened or plain yogurt, it works great.  I have also taken to eating it with unsweetened non-dairy milk replacements (coconut, soy or almond) and it's very good.

review/summary: Talisker Distillers Edition - a superb marriage of Arctic desolation and Mediterranean sunny splendor
review/text: Over the past decade the Diageo Classic Malts have each offered a "Distiller's Edition" where the primary malt receives additional aging in a second fill cask that once held a vinous product. In Talisker's case they use big grape Oloroso sherry butts. They have a release each year. Reviewed today is the 2005 vintage.<br /><br />Color: rich orangey amber<br /><br />Nose: candied orange peel, white raisins, sherry, brine, band aids, and the characteristic Talisker old hatbox wood.<br /><br />Intense vinous sherry sweetness that builds into midpalate with toffee, citrus and Turkish delight and hard candy flavors. At midpalate the citrus explodes into juicy intensity. At the turn to the finish there's a burst of floral essences - confused and humid like a quick tuck into a steamy raucous flower shop. Then the finish brings the cavalcade of classic maritime flavors up: salt sea air, mineral rock, old attic hatbox wood and a final bitter medicinal iodine note. Wow. I'm dizzy just writing it down. This is a tour de force of delicious flavors melded with maritime weird ones. It's totally recognizable as Talisker - the terroir of Skye is all over it. But the second fill coopering in oloroso sherry casks marries in rich sweet fruits that elevate, not detract. Wonderful!

review/summary: Shouldn't have listened to a "Helping" comment on a recipe post!
review/text: Posted my delicious buttercream frosting on a recipe website.  Someone commented that I should add Creme Bouquet... MISTAKE.  It may taste okay, but it added a strange taste to my frosting. I shouldn't have bought this.  I shouldn't have added it to the frosting and ruined that huge batch!

review/summary: NOT ENOUGH PROTEIN
review/text: One of my dog has MANY food allergies so it has been very hard to find a dog food w/o something she is allergic to in the ingredients.  I thought I had found the almost perfect dog food. (dry food is better for keeping teeth clean and strong) Both of my dogs LOVE this dog food and rarely need other water sources. BUT, both seem to ALWAYS be hungry...and one of them has lost 5 lbs and is shaky and started eating poo out of the yard. I can not clean it up fast enough.  They eat 2x's per day but poo 4-5 x's per day. I was told that they are not getting enough protein in thier diet. It is quite an expensive dog food to not contain enough protein. Sadly I will have to find another food that will work better for our dogs. It will be a good treat to add to their new food...unfortunately the new food is almost as expensive.

review/summary: When your doggie cries for his food- you know it's good!!!
review/text: I had initially tried this food on my pup from a sample pack (can be ordered online at grandmalucys web site) and was a little skeptical...  Freeze Dried?!? Hmm...  well, let me just tell you how much my little guy adores this stuff.  He cries and begs for it at feeding times, waiting patiently for it to cool down.  (you add hot water to it)<br /><br />My little guy is a 10 pound doxie and is a very finicky eater.  I have tried EVO, Merrick (which he does enjoy in Rainbow Trout flavor), Innova, Lotus, California Gold and more-  but what he really truly loves is his Grandma Lucy's.<br /><br />It is a no nonsense food.  No added junk- it's just freeze dried food- straight up goodness!<br /><br />Also, don't be put off by the bag size 10 pounds will make like 75 pounds of cooked food.  It's amazing stuff!<br /><br />I highly recommend this- it's easy to whip up (just add water), is the real deal, doggies love it and if you are traveling- the stuff is light weight and won't parish.<br /><br />I also recommend Grandma Lucy's Tiny Tidbits- my little furry friend will do anything for one!!!

review/summary: Drink up
review/text: What can I say about Ocean Spray?  They make some of the best cranberry juice out there.  However, a few years ago they changed the ingredients to their cranberry juices that are mixed with other juices, such as Cran-Cherry, Cran-Raspberry, Cran-Blueberry, etc.  I used to buy these all the time, but then one day I bought a bottle and it tasted funny (meaning bad).  I looked at the ingredients and discovered that sucrose was added, something that was never in their old formula.  The labeling/packaging looked exactly the same as it did when it had the old ingredients, but nothing was printed on the bottle indicating a new formula.  You had to read the ingredients in order to notice.  This change of ingredients occurred around 2006, and I haven't bought any of the above listed old favorites of mine since.  The only Ocean Spray cranberry drink I'll still buy is this regular straight cranberry juice because the ingredients haven't changed.  When I want mixed cranberry drinks, I buy Northland, Old Orchard, stuff like that.<br /><br />It seems that every product I like is either discontinued or changed.  Why?  It's because the stuff I like isn't selling well.  Or, people don't like the taste of something, so they change the ingredients.  Or, the ingredients are changed because they want to eliminate high fructose corn syrup.  You know those Vitamin Water drinks?  There are many many flavors.  The only one I drank, the light green drink called Perform, was discontinued.  It's the one that's recommended for dungeon masters.  But all the other ones are still on the market.  I don't drink them.  It seems that everything I like, people don't like.  Everything I don't like, people like.<br /><br />Anyway, the only Ocean Spray cranberry drink I recommend is this regular straight cranberry drink.  Now go to the store and buy the mixed ones, because I know you like them.

review/summary: A waste of the macadamias
review/text: I liked these nuts a little bit, and the quality of the nuts themselves was what I expect from Mauna Loa. Unfortunately, the chocolate made up most of the mass and volume of the candy, and was not particularly good. I found the chocolate to be particularly bland. I think next time I will try a darker chocolate coating.

review/summary: Good Cold Shipping by Amazon
review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

review/text: I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging. The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

review/text: When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert "3-4 mm" to inches and consequently discovered the "Coarse Grinder Salt" was almost 1/4" (1/6" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.  That's amazing customer service!

review/text: This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a "rounded" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.

review/text: Yes, I do use this product for salting some of my foods, but it also has another handy use. Because the grains of salt are much larger than normal, I use this salt to clean my cast iron grill and skillet. I pour one or two tablespoons of salt on the slightly warm grill or skillet, and rub the salt into the bottom and sides of the pans with a wadded up paper towel. The salt even quickly makes short work of cleaning the RIDGED bottom of my cast iron grill pan. Works perfectly. I usually keep two or three packages of this product on my spices shelf because I use it frequently both for salting food and cleaning the cast iron.

review/text: placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).<br /><br />as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping).

review/summary: the only salt I use--except herbamare and trocomare
review/text: I have not purchased this from Amazon yet as still on what I purchased elsewhere BUT I noticed many people buying the one pound bag. Just to let you know: one kilo equals 2.2 lbs. Why would you buy the one pound bag on something that never goes bad when you can get more than double for just a few dollars more.<br /><br />Dr. Mercola's comments regarding Himalaya salt benefits are what started me using this initially a few years ago. Many micronutrients, great purity. One person questioned the iodine: no salt naturally contains iodine unless it is iodized or contains some sort of seaweed. You can easily see his comments at mercola.com.<br /><br />Himalaya salt has a very 'clean' taste--add at the end of cooking.

review/summary: Wonderful product
review/text: I was very pleased with the Himalayan salt. It really does taste much better than ordinary salt and you can actually taste some of the other minerals in it. I would describe it like licking a salty rock, but in a good way. Very pleased and will be buying more.

review/summary: Himalayan course salt
review/text: I have never ordered sea salt before. i thought this was great. I was afraid it would have some additional flavor that I wouldnt like. Instead it was fresh tasting & natural. I like the pink color, but glad it doesnt come out pink.

review/summary: Very good salt for a very good price
review/text: I'll certainly be a repeat customer. I had a tough time finding large salt crystals to refill a grinder, but this fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />Flavor is clean with slight minerality. The color is not a deep as some other himalayan pink I've seen, but it's a very good finishing salt, and a good conversation piece when put on the table in a clear grinder.<br /><br />Also, the seller included a coupon for a future purchase in the package, which was a nice bonus.

review/summary: so yummy!
review/text: This salt has a slightly earthy taste. It is moderately coarse. I bought a ceramic grinder for when I would like to have it a little finer. I love this salt!

review/summary: Great for cooking and baths
review/text: Great salt! Though now that I know how great it is I will have to buy a bigger bag next time. Mixed with some epsom salt and essential oils this makes a great bath salt. Ground up a bit finer it is wonderful for cooking. Will certainly buy again.

review/summary: Love this salt!
review/text: I had been told that Himalayan salt was much better for you.  After shopping around, I found the best deal was through Amazon.  It came in a heavy resealable bag and works great in my salt mill.  I would buy this again and recommend it to my friends.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: I use this salt very liberally now especially after finding out that its table salt you really need to avoid.  Our bodies need salt to live and this is the purest kind out there.  I plan to make this salt a part of my regular diet.
