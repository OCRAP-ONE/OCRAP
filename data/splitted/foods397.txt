review/summary: With Honey
review/text: Keep this cereal vac sealed after opening, as the surface area with the little holes will absorb air moisture faster than you can eat that cereal. That cost is terrific!<br /><br />OK - try this...add some real honey, not honey with lemon, etc., and mix it up.  Also, let the milk work a little with the honey. Wait a minute... honey and milk? "Honey Milk" - Say is that what they mean when they talk about the land of milk and honey? - SWEET! Now sing it! "Honey Comb...breakfast sweet as honey ...Post Honey Comb...la la la...

review/text: I used to eat this all the time when I was little. It had an uniform flavor and a fun shape that I really enjoyed. It doesn't taste very strongly of honey as one might think, but it's really nice, and is a great cereal for kids and adults.<br /><br />Boy, I sure do love the shape of this cereal, it was always fun for me to look at the honeycombs in my bowl...

review/summary: Feed Raw!
review/text: The previous reviewer is obviously unfamiliar with the benefits of feeding freeze dried and raw or low processed foods. Most dogs cannot easily digest kibble and those that seem to don't get all the nutrients they are meant to have. Consider living on a diet of fast food versus cooking at home with whole foods. Your pets are meant to kill, scavange and eat whole foods, NOT ultra processed kibble! Yes it is more expensive then kibble....but it is so worth it. I have a dog with chronic allergies and digestive problems, the only thing that has helped is keeping his diet as natural as possible and supplimenting with digestive enzymes and an essential fatty acid. Please don't read the previous review and dismiss the wonderful benefits of freeze dried raw diets. Do your research, then decide which food is best for your dog.

review/summary: Nutty nutrition
review/text: Because the grains of teff are small, the bulk of the grain is the bran and germ. This makes teff nutrient dense as the bran and germ are the most nutritious parts of any grain. This grain has a very high calcium content, and contains high levels of phosphorous, iron, copper, aluminum, barium, and thiamin. It is considered to have an excellent amino acid composition, with lysine levels higher than wheat or barley. Teff is high in protein, carbohydrates, and fiber. It contains no gluten so it is appropriate for those with gluten intolerance.<br />It bakes like buckwheat, so it is best to mix it with other, lighter, gluten free flours.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: I received this tree this week.  I have purchased Bonsai trees from other online vendors, but none have compared to this starting with the packing of the tree, you could tell it was packed with great care, it arrived in perfect shape.  The tree is healthy and beautiful, far more beautiful than the picture shown on Amazon. The tree has a wonderful aroma, it smells like your in a forest, on a fall morning.<br />I could tell it was healthy immediately.  Sometimes when you order things on line your disappointed, but not enough to go through the trouble of sending the item back.  The minute I saw this tree I had wished I had ordered more.  I will order other items from this company, I hope they are as fine as this purchase was.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DGG22">Brussel's Dawn Redwood Outdoor Bonsai Tree</a>

The pot and base of the tree were wrapped tight in a thick plastic and the soil was damp upon arrival.  The rest of the space inside the box was filled with a biodegradable type of foam peanuts (watch out, they get everywhere when you take the tree out).<br /><br />Fantastic tree!

review/summary: Stunning
review/text: Back in March I ordered four dawn redwoods from a nursery on Ebay, all about 2-3 feet tall.  They arrived bareroot and healthy.  The plan was to plant three in the ground to replace trees uprooted by Katrina.  The fourth was to go into a pot to be trained as bonsai.  All four trees were thriving, but the one in the pot looked like a plant that yearned to join the rest of its family out in the yard, rather than being forested with my bonsai collection.  Clearly, it was going to take time, patience, and training to get it to look like a bonsai.  I decided to put it in the ground and order a Brussels Dawn Redwood.<br /><br />And I'm glad I did.  The Brussels tree is a long way from a specimen, but it already looks like a bonsai, a mature-looking but minature redwood with beatuiful tapered trunk and gorgeous lower branching, all of which was lacking in the nursery tree, which had arrived pruned to favor topgrowth.  The Brussels Dawn redwood is absolutely stunning, far superior to the tree pictured on Amazon.<br /><br />Sure, the nursery tree would have acquired this look--eventually, and after much training.  But it loves growing with its kinfolk in the yard, and meanwhile I have this beautifully shaped little tree from Brussels to marvel at every time I sit outside with my bonsai collection.  Frankly, I can't take my eyes off it.<br /><br />I'm neither impatient by nature nor a champion of acting on impulse.  But there are times when instant gratification and acting on impulse has its rewards, and this was one of them.  The Brussels Dawn Redwood looks like a tree, not a seedling.  It is nothing short of breathtaking.

review/summary: Nice tree.
review/text: I received my Dawn Redwood a couple of days ago.  I don't think I got the same impression as others when I first saw my tree.  I ordered it early in the year so I am assuming it is just now starting to get its leaves for the spring.  My wife's first impression was that it looked like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.<br /><br />I love the bark on this tree and how it makes it look older.  The trunk of the tree and taper is probably about average.  From soil to the top of the tree it is 21 inches tall.  The color of the bark and the color of the leaves is really beautiful.  I am anxious for it to fill out.<br /><br />Overall it looks like it has some potential for a nice tree.

review/text: I received my Dawn Redwood today. It looks wonderful. I was initially nervous about purchasing more plants online because I have had bad experiences from nurseries. But I read the reviews on this particular tree and they convinced me to try again. The tree arrived in great shape. It actually only spent about 3 days in the box. It was well packed it looks very healthy and the soil was still damp on arrival.<br />Thanks you for the care that was taken in selecting, packing and shipping my tree.

I wasn't expecting something as perfectly manicured as what is shown in the picture but I definitely wasn't expecting the Hackjob that arrived on my doorstep.  It looked like it someone had just lopped off about a foot in order for it to fit in the box...  I just got it an hour ago and I'm seriously debating returning it because I don't know if I have it in my to make this look like anything other than a diseased, half-dead stick with some leaves glued on.<br /><br />The trunk is very straight which is nice, and even with the free shipping it still arrived with moist soil.  The pot is also very nice.  The reason for a 2 star instead of a 1 or less.

I had it mailed directly to my Mother as a gift. Like the other reviews say, it arrived quickly and was packaged extremely well.  Not a single branch was damaged and the pot also made the trip in perfect condition.  Given the fact that this is February, I expected it to arrive baren of any foliage.  It actually is so healthy it's full of little green buds.  The branches are pruned to give the tree a very nice shape, and the soil (according to my Mom) is the correct type of soil it SHOULD be in and not just some temporary crud made to last only as long as the shipping time.  Thank you for making my gift a nice one.  My Mom really loves it.

It was sent in the middle of winter (a Christmas gift from my mom and dad I might add)But it was still hadn't droped it's leaves. It was poorly potted, like they were going for a root over rock style with out the rock.the top was cut off and it had 2 leading shoots. Needeles to say it it held on to it's needles all winter and never really went through a dormant peroied. It finaly droped it's dry as bones leaves near the end of winter but then spring came and it strugled and tried to bud out but failed and is dead very dead...I checked. This was the worst attempt at a bonsai I have ever seen, for this type of tree I could not think of a worse specimen then the one this company (and I use the term companay loosly) sent me. Stay away form this company! If could give a less then one star rating I would!!!

I can understand that this happens, but the plant was in horrible condition. It looked like nothing in the picture. I understand that this was not the same tree but it was apparent that the grower just lopped off the top of the tree and grew it like a plant. It looks horrible. My roommate was against me displaying it in our living room because of the crappy look it has. I was so disapointed I am an avid collector of  bonsai trees and it will take years for this bush to look like a tree again. I contacted lou who told me he was going to reship but that never happened. DO NOT BUY FROM LOU'S BONSAI. They totally ruined everything about this transaction

review/summary: A Little Taste of Heaven
review/text: Taking one of the world's largest trees and turning it into a small wonder for anyone with even a balcony is truly a wonder, but Dawn Redwood does make a fascinating bonsai subject with it's delicate foliage turning Autumn yellow/brown and regrowing bright green in Spring. Mine arrived even better looking than the photo, with a larger trunk base which tapered nicely to the top. The soil surface was covered with fine, bright green moss while the tree was in its dormant state for December delivery. Brussel's has been reliable over the years and getting free shipping via my Amazon Prime membership is an extra bonus. Whether the tree lives or dies is now my responsibility and will require daily watering and continual pruning, but I've been doing this for some years now. Be prepared for a very large box filled with peanuts but that serves to secure the tree as well as insulate it during shipping.

review/text: Soooooo upset by this order.  Ordered this as a christmas gift for my brother-in-law who LOVES the redwoods.  When it arrived, it was deader than dead.  It was the saddest looking stump I have ever seen in my life.  Charlie Brown's Christmas Tree looks lush and full by comparison.  Never have I been so upset by a purchase through Amazon.

review/summary: Dried, Green, then Dried again.
review/text: Quick review:<br />When I received this bonsai, it was well-packaged but very brittle and dry. I unwrapped the packaging and watered it. I did notice some spider mites in the soil but I don't know how to get rid of those.<br /><br />Also, I had to remove some brittle branches and within 3 weeks it finally green some new ones and very nice green leaves. But about a month later it quickly dried up and it seems to be dry again. I did water regularly and gave it plenty of sunlight (without ever burning the leaves). I will try to revive the tree again and will update this review in a month.

review/summary: Mine was dead.
review/text: The tree was well packaged and came quickly, but was dead. I would have liked some written instructions about the tree rather than a recommendation to call the seller. I was also not sure whether the tree was dormant and was perhaps supposed to look the way it does (in December.) I'm still hoping it may revive, so I'm hanging on to it. It was intended as a gift to celebrate a marriage, but I couldn't give a dead looking tree in that circumstance.

review/text: So i don't normally give product reviews on Amazon, even though i tend to buy a lot of stuff here, in fact this is the first time. I've wanted a redwood bonsai for awhile and was a little skeptical about what i would get at this price through an online vendor. Boy was I in for a treat. This is by far the best deal ive received for a bonsai. Coming in at about 30 inches and meticulously packaged, this was much more than I expected. Heck, the huge ceramic pot it comes with could easily set you back $15-20 at some places, not to mention beautifully accented with moss. Really content!

review/summary: Excellent Starter Tree at Any Price
review/text: Received the Dawn Redwood quickly and very well packed, tree was in perfect health. I truly wonder how they ship that nicely, half way across the country at this low price.  Nice nearly 2 inch diameter root base, with one root crossing the trunk (easily fixed.) Many branches allowing one to determine the style they would like out of this nice tree. At the sale price this is an extraordinary buy, the pot and shipping alone would cost more.  But even at it's full retail, you will not likely find a better deal anywhere.  This is not a completed bonsai (are they ever complete?) But an excellent starter tree that in a year or two will look spectacular.  After two months I already get many compliments on it's beauty and potential.  There are three more on the way right now, I think I can make a fantastic forest planting, at a very low price.

review/summary: Very Large Bonsai! It's Beautiful.
review/text: First, before you order, get a tape measure and measure 20" like the description says. This is a beautiful bonsai and it is quite tall. Absolutely beautiful for a deck or outdoor table centerpiece (Which is what I'm using it for). The packaging was good, a lot of peanuts but it shipped in great condition so that's nice. I work for/run a nursery so I'll be taking good care of it. It requires time-release fertilizer (which is very important), and you have to water it daily especially in the summer. It came with a nice booklet with accurate instructions. If the tree shows any signs of changing I'll come back and amend my review because I've only had it one day, but it seems like it will survive just fine. It looks very healthy.<br /><br />As a general rule: If it dies in the first month with proper care then it could be a bad plant, if it dies after that then it's from improper care.

review/summary: Good quality food for special needs dog
review/text: My dog has developed bad allergies (first skin, later asthma-like) when he was 5-6 years old. Naturally I've tried several premium dog food brands, and feeding methods. 'Natural balance' special formula foods are the only kind I found that my dog's skin tolerate. He was on the fish formula for over a year, but after a while it started  to trigger his asthma. Lately I feed him with the potato & duck - so far works really well, his fur is perfectly healthy and shiny.

review/text: I love that this product has rather few ingredients.  The size is perfect for our little 9 and 15 lb dogs.  Our small one is down to only 8 teeth left thanks to 3+ years of malnutrition at a puppy mill, and this allows her to eat the kibble without need to chew (that's what most dogs do with kibble that is small enough to swallow).  Also, after two years of using this kibble, they still like it.

If I had to say something ever tasted like a dirty Sock, This Would Be IT!!! When you microwave these noodles, they go from looking semi edible, to completely rancid. I wish I could go back and return this but I don't think I have that option. I'm not sure how the other flavors taste but I'd suggest staying away from this one. P.S I also feel sick right now after eating it. Wish me luck, might be sick and vomiting from this in a bit.

review/summary: Pocket Coffee = Best. Candy. Ever.
review/text: Used to buy these candies at a local Italian cafe, but now buy in bulk thru Amazon.  Those individuals who enjoy "juicy" chocolates (i.e. liquid centers) will find the squirt of espresso is rich and satisfying, and beautifully combines with the decadence of the chocolate.  A definite MUST BUY if you, like me, are a certified chocoholic who also enjoys his or her coffee.<br /><br />One word of warning, though -- it's tough to eat just one of these candies at a time; however, the espresso IS strong, so don't eat more than a couple in one sitting unless you're accustomed to downing many cups of coffee at one time.<br /><br />Best to savor this candy and space out its consumption.

review/summary: So much easier on my babies tummy.
review/text: When we switch my daughter from nursing to eating her first solid foods we started with rice cereal.  The misery that caused will be forever emblazoned on my memory.  Colic, gas, and it backed her up right proper.<br /><br />My wife and I started researching alternatives on the Internet.  We found a bunch of references to how Barley was easier on a tummy.  That Barley soup/broth is often what is given to people recovering in hospitals etc...  I went to every local store looking for some.  Family and friends that had used it used to buy it locally.  I couldn't find it anywhere.  I found it here on Amazon and bought this pack of 12 boxes.<br /><br />We found rather strongly that this was much easier on my daughters tummy.  She continued to eat without distress after we made the switch.  We started using it just as cereal and then as she got older we started using it as a thickening agent and filler when mixed with pureed vegetables etc...  She liked things better when they were less runny and we liked things better when she was happy.<br /><br />We will be ordering more here shortly for the twins that have now joined our family.  For us it worked great.  I really do recommend it as a far better option that rice cereal.

review/summary: Always have this on hand
review/text: I keep Gerber 'Mixed' and 'Barley' on hand all the time. The 'mixed' consists of rice, oat and wheat so I mix a box of that with a box of the 'barley' and have a completely balanced breakfast cereal. I don't use it for people: I keep it handy for when the dogs have upset tummies and their regular food is too harsh on their digestive systems and they need soft, easy to digest food that fills them up and is healthy for them.  As their tummies return to normal, I reduce the baby cereal a bit and add in some of their normal foods and as they continue to improve, the baby cereal gets reduced while their normal foods eventually return to full bore.<br /><br />This is good for them, too, after dental cleanings/extractions, surgeries, when they need a little help in the 'bowel' department (fiber), or just as an added treat to change it up a bit in their daily diet.<br /><br />I have used this in place of bread crumbs when making a meatloaf (ok, I was desperate), but didn't care for the texture of the meatloaf once cooked. It was too soft for our liking, but still quite tasty.

review/summary: Very satisfied with the quality of this tea
review/text: I was first introduced to Pu-Ehr tea by a Chinese friend, who told me that most westerners do not like it.  After one sip, I agreed with him, and after one cup, I was hooked.  That's the way it is with Pu-Ehr tea - initially an acquired taste, then an addiction.<br /><br />This tea is quite a good Pu-Ehr for the price.  Some low quality Pu-Ehr tastes very musty and earthy; this does not.  I brew one brick in a 22 fluid ounce (0.65 liter), and this yields the entire Pu-Ehr experience.  (A can contains 25 bricks.)  The first cups are mild, but the bottom couple of cups yield the heavy duty Pu-Ehr jolt.<br /><br />Never add sugar or milk or lemon to Pu-Ehr, just take it straight or with dried chrysanthemum blossoms.

review/summary: Delicious cooked pu-erh
review/text: I'm SO glad I gave these tuo chas a chance!!! I've recently become a huge pu-erh fan, so I've been on the lookout for great pu-erh that won't cost me a leg. I keep hearing that tuos don't usually have great quality, that often tea dust and poor quality leaves are compressed to make the "nests" (and yes, I've tasted those often enough to say it's true), but that's not the case here. In fact, this has become one of my favorite pu-erhs. (I've also tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021I8F60">Rishi Tea Pu-erh Classic, 3.2-Ounce Tins (Pack of 3)</a>, which I thought was bound to be better simply because it was loose leaf, but that is not the case. I was not impressed... this one is much tastier.)<br /><br />I can get 3 huge mugs (each with a strong brew) out of 1 little tuo. The 4th one is already too watery, but the 3rd is still as strong as I like. This tea made me understand those comments about good pu-erh being "a mouthful", thick (I used to wonder what on earth it meant); it is like gulping milk, very interesting experience. I can't really describe the flavor, except to say that it's mellow, sweet, and very yummy. As all pu-erhs, it never gets bitter. To make this taste like heaven, I sometimes add a little bit of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N749GY">Numi Organic Tea Chocolate Puerh, Loose Leaf Tea, 16 Ounce Bag</a> for some chocolate/vanilla/orange flavor - perfection in a cup!!!<br /><br />I was wondering how many tuos actually fit into one of these little tins... and the answer is, quite a lot of them! That was another good surprise.

review/summary: Pleasant Surprise
review/text: I like trying different teas (primarily non-herbals), and after hearing about Pu-erh I was intriqued.  From what I've read so far, I believe this particular version is not aged like the very high-end, expensive, caked versions are, but it seemed like a good way to get a taste of this tea variety.  I am not disappointed at all.  Though it's not a drastic departure from other teas, it's not quite like any I've had before.  It's very mild and earthy, with a subtle sweetness -- VERY pleasant!<br /><br />Something else that sets it apart from other (non-herbal) teas: It doesn't get bitter after extended steeping!  Furthermore, as I've read elsewhere, just one serving goes a long way.  In fact, I never stop steeping it.  When my cup is almost empty, I just top it off again.  I get at least four flavorful cups with just one of the prewrapped nuggets.<br /><br />This instantly became one of my favorite teas.  I'm delighted I finally discovered it, and just may have to spend the $ to try one of the more expensive/exotic versions.  If it's even better than this, I would understand why folks are willing to pay such a premium $.

review/summary: Next best thing to buying in China
review/text: By the way, this is not a loose tea but compressed cubes which is easier to take with you if you travel. I started drinking this tea when I visited China last year. I read about how it aids digestion after meals, so I drink it late at night. I noticed a great side effect of reducing my cravings for in-between meal eating and junk food. In that way, it can be used as a weight loss aid. It also helps get rid of excess water weight. I try to drink a cup at least every night and sometimes in the morning if I ate heavy meat the night before. This is not the same quality as the loose tea I buy in China but it will do until I get back to stock up. The true loose tea is much better because you can control how much you want to drink. For the reviewers who said their items smelled like fish, I have not smelled bad pu-er tea. The Chinese say it can keep for years if you refrigerate it or keep it in a cool dark place. I gave this only 4 stars because I have tasted better but I may order this again if I cannot get back to China.

It's pleasant enough and a nice change of pace from my normal Ceylon routine.  I don't know how well it rates within the black pu-erh family, but my uneducated opinion is that I'm not sure I could see myself drinking this every day.  The woody aspect is overwhelming at times.  Maybe a couple times a month when I'm in the mood for something a lil' "dirty."  If you are on the fence, I say give it a shot!

review/summary: Rishi Pu-erh Tuo Cha Is The Answer
review/text: I have been a connoisseur of quality green, oolong for many moons, and I also enjoy a good cup of morning Joe. I had tried loose Pu-erh previously and was bitten by the smooth coffee like mouth feel of the variety. This is not green tea taste be prepared, but is very earthy and rich especially during the first and second flushes. These nuggets of goodness have replaced my boring coffee routine. I prefer it strong and thick usually dropping two Tuo Cha nugs in my tea pot. I'm here to report the following; calm alertness, healthy as green and if you believe might help drop a few points on your disappointing cholesterol numbers  before your next visit.<br /><br />It's true......strong earthy aroma is apparent primarily during the first flush, but is very part of the brew process, brew is clear not cloudy and taste is never sharp or tannic. Be warned I've tried the flavored varieties, and filler is not my cup of tea. If you like it sweet add a little honey and say goodbye to the beans!

review/text: I have had the matcha variation and another loose leaf pu-erh.

No jitters here, just ultra rich smooth tea.  A Chinese friend gave me some of her Pu-Erh at work one day which was so-so.  I paid her back with of this Rishi Pu-Erh and she was raving on and on about it's amazing taste.  Getting 10 ounces for $13 something on the auto ship deal is a fantastic price for Pu-Erh of this quality.

It's one note when it's actually liquid--molasses; then, with an overpowering smell of dead fish before it gets to your nose, this is nothing short of gross.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch.<br /><br />For reference:  I'm a foodie by dint of food intolerances and, ironically, having to cook a lot in order to afford to eat out.

review/summary: perfect with pastas or as a snack!
review/text: These are the best sun dried tomatoes that I have found for several reasons.  These reasons include:<br /><br />1) Not packed in oil:  The first reason I love this product is that the tomatoes are not sun-dried and then packed in oil.  Many sun dried tomatoes come in large jars and have some type of liquid substance preserving them/adding flavor.  These do not.  They are dried and packed tightly into these little plastic containers.  The absence of oil makes these healthier and cleaner to work with.  Even though these lack a liquid component, there is still a softness to them.  They are not rock hard like some of the bags of sun-dried tomatoes out there.<br /><br />2) Little waste: The second reason I love this product is the size of the containers.  At 3.5 ounces, you have a manageable amount to use.  You don't need to worry about waste.  When you have a massive jar, once opened, the tomatoes are only going to stay usable for so long.  It is easy to use a 3.5 ounce container with one or two recipes.<br /><br />3) The taste:  I love the taste of these tomatoes.  A nice salty flavor accompanies them, but the salt doesn't overtake the phenomenal tomato taste.<br /><br />4) Perfect with pastas:  I love to make pastas, especially pierogies.  Perogies happen to taste wonderful with wilted spinach and sun-dried tomatoes that have been sauteed in brown butter with salt, pepper and some broth.  You don't need to stop with pastas though.  Try these tomatoes on salads and with sandwiches.  Each container has a recipe printed on the back of the lid.<br /><br />5) Perfect alone: The user doesn't have to feel a need to be creative with these tomatoes because they are perfect on their own.  Counting calories?  Mix up your daily eating routine and include a pack of these sun-dried tomatoes.  They have 225 calories per container, have a good deal of fiber (16.8 grams per container) and potassium and vitamin C.  Disclosure:  These have a good deal of sodium (300 mg per serving and there are 7 servings per container).<br /><br />6) Portable: Take these on a car trip.  Because the containers are made out of plastic, they won't break.  You don't have to worry about your children breaking a glass container and injuring themselves.  Again, because these are not packed with oil, you don't have to worry about liquid substances being splashed all over your car either.<br /><br />7) Packaging recyclable:  These tomatoes are packed in #1 PET plastic, which is readily recyclable in most areas.<br /><br />8) They last:  Because these have a lot of salt and are well-packed, they remain fresh for a very, very long time.  I've purchased large sums of these tomatoes and have had them sit for months unused.  When I experience a sun-dried tomato craving, I don't worry about the freshness because they have such a long shelf life.<br /><br />In sum, I love these tomatoes.  I use probably two packs a week for recipes and casual snacking.  I love that they are packed without any type of liquid and the containers are sized just right for recipes and/or casual snacking.<br /><br />I purchase these 3.5 ounce containers for about two dollars from my local grocery.<br /><br />These tomatoes are a product of Turkey and should be refrigerated after opening.

review/summary: A delicious mexican treat!
review/text: Huitlacoche, also known as Cuitlacoche, corn smut, and corn fungus, is considered a delicacy in latin american cuisine.  It is delicious and earthy, and the flavor is slightly stronger than but resembles a mushroom.<br /><br />Don't let the dark color scare you, it is delicious sauteed with onions and garlic and used as a topping on burritos, tacos, in guacamole, etc.<br /><br />I really like the Goya 7 oz can size and the spices they add.  Simple to use and delicious!  But do watch out 55/58 cal per serving is from fat!! So enjoy in moderation!

review/summary: Kidney Beans without Bisphenol A
review/text: This is a great product, healthy, low sodium, great taste... from the only manufacturer in the US which does not use cans lined with a Bisphenol A epoxy.<br />None of the other "Organic" suppliers bother to use packaging without BPA<br />Try their garbanzo beans and black beans as well!

review/summary: Perfect for chili
review/text: I am very pleased to get these beans that are organic and in BPA-free cans. These two things are top priority for me, after that it has to be taste and these are as tasty as canned kidney beans that are organic get. I use them in the crockpot to make chili and they come out just fine. It is a canned food so I think that expectations of having a firm texture and all that are a little too unrealisic, what canned food has that? These weren't mushy just soft as I would expect them to be. If you want the convenience of not having to cook beans for hours at a time and to be able to know that it is of great quality then this is worth buying.

review/summary: Big kidney beans, BPA free and no salt added!
review/text: I was excited to purchase BPA free canned beans from a reputable company, Eden Foods, who I must admit I think I have a brand preference towards, because I appreciate the effort they put into setting high standards for their products and finding growers who can provide them with that. While I do want to eventually switch to using dried beans because I think that its less packaging and better price versus the canned, I am busy sometimes and find that to have some canned beans in the pantry on stock has been very helpful. The kidney beans in the can are nice big beans, and taste delicious.<br /><br />Kidney beans are great cold out of the can in salads with kale, red onion, avocado, and sprouts and I love them in soups! (But shortly before the soup is ready as you dont want them to get too mushy) I was happy about my purchase and will continue to buy Eden Kidney Beans, whether it be canned or dried.

review/summary: Dents in Cans
review/text: I've enjoyed Eden products for a while.<br />I've noticed over the last few years that more and more of than cans have dents in them. The problem isn't shipping, because the boxes are never damaged, but the individual cans are. It's unfortunate because the product really is good.

review/text: Beans, the way they should be.  BPA free cans.  Sourced from small farms in the USA.  Eden is the oldest natural/organic food company in North America.<br /><br />These beans are great in any recipe that calls for beans.  Texture is great, as is taste.

review/summary: Organic, BPA-free and the price is right, but very very bland
review/text: These are not beans you want to eat right out of the can, but they are delicious in red beans and rice recipes or in pasta fagioli or in soups, where they have a chance to soak up a little flavor.  And they're just about the healthiest things in the world.  They are must-have staples around my house, where getting my ten year old to eat anything that isn't made out of meat or potatoes (or cake) is a challenge.  He likes these beans.

review/summary: Kidney Bean & Corn Salad
review/text: Several months ago, I switched to a plant-based diet. In an effort to eat enough foods that provide protein, I've been buying Eden organic no salt added kidney beans for a simple and delicious salad made of these beans (rinsed thoroughly and drained) combined with frozen Bird's Eye corn (I use the individual Steam Fresh packet), lots of diced organic celery for crunch, two tablespoons of Goya extra virgin olive oil and Alessi white balsamic vinegar. I have found that adding the vinegar to individual servings when ready to serve has a better taste than mixing it into the entire salad during preparation. I'd like to say that this is the first time in my life that I have eaten kidney beans and didn't know what I was missing (and I am 82 years old!)I keep this salad in the fridge, and have it as a side dish twice a day.<br /><br />Another food that I didn't know existed is Eden Red Inca Quinoa. Another absolutely amazing food that can be added as a nutritious protein boost to just about everything. I add it to pasta sauce for extra body; Amy's organic low in sodium soups that I dilute and add wild rice blend and the quinoa, as well as anything else that I can think of along the way. I'm learning a whole new way of enjoying mealtime. It's exciting and good-for-you eating!

review/summary: Excellent vegan preservative free product
review/text: The quality of all Eden organic beans is excellent.  Being preservative free with very little sodium (less than 100 mg per can), the flavor of the beans comes through and is excellent. This is particularly true of the kidney beans.<br /><br />The one small downside of the kidney beans is that they were a bit too soft; they tended to mash a bit more than I'd like, and they don't hold up well to boiling.<br /><br />Note that you'll find brown specks in some varieties of Eden beans.  Do not be alarmed: the specks are kombu (kelp), an organic sea plant that's used as a natural preservative.  The kombu can be consumed with the beans, or you can rinse it away.

review/summary: A disappointment
review/text: While finding a line of salt free beans at a reasonable price was great, I have had a hard time using up these kidney beans, they are mushy; unpleasantly so.  You'd think they would make a good bean in bean soup or refried beans, but I didn't think so.  A friend tried them as a shortening substitute in cookies with the best results; taste was fine once she ran the beans through the food processer and added them to cookie dough  - but what isn't.  Blending them and then using them as an addition to soup or 'secret vegies' in meatloaf and the like may have been the best use.<br />I did a little experimentation and evidently salt helps beans from turning unappealingly mushy.  I've learned to either cook my own and add just a touch of salt or use a 'low salt' product.  Color and size are good.
