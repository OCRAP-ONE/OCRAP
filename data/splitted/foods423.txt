review/summary: Much better than Emerald chocolate almonds
review/text: The Blue Diamond Dark Chocolate almonds are ridiculously good. The taste is heads above the emerald chocolate nuts. Although they are around the 7 dollar range I think they are worth it. They use stevia to sweeten the almonds which is a plant based sweetener. Not only are they  much better for you, they taste better than Emerald's splenda sweetened (eww). If they would lower the price a bit I would be ecstatic. Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent crunchy chocolate snack
review/text: This is an excellent snack for me.  It has the things I crave, all in a nice healthy package - chocolate, crunch, a touch of saltiness.  They have a wonderful chocolate taste without the bad calories.  Much healthier than the alternatives of chocolates and cookies and chips (or choc-chip cookies)!<br /><br />The packaging is particularly good - the small opening ensures that I take a small serving every time.  I don't have to eat very many before I am satisfied.  The side of the package has a vertical slit lets you see how full the container is, and has measured lines that you can use to limit your serving size.<br /><br />I really don't have anything bad to say about these.  Buy them if you crave chocolate and/or crunchiness!

review/summary: Incredibly satisfying
review/text: I am a serious chocolate aficionado. While these nuts are not coated in chocolate, they have a micro thin layer of dark chocolate that enhances their super crunchy goodness to the max. Interestingly, a small handful is very satisfying. I mention that because so many delicious foods have an addictive quality that makes you want to eat more of them. I would imagine it's the protein and fat content that allows them to be both a true food and a treat.<br /><br />Not only are they incredibly delicious, they come in a re-usable container that is great for dehydrated parsley, whole spices, or anything small.

review/summary: I HATE ALMONDS
review/text: But Blue Diamond nailed it with these. Everything about them is perfect. Just the right amount of chocolate flavor to mask the "nuttiness" of the almond, they have a great crunch to them, they aren't overly sweet. The nutrition profile is amazing, with only 4gms of sugar! These are my new favorite snack, I keep a bag at home, a bag in my office, and a bag in my car. Anytime I'm hungry and need something to get me to the next meal, these are on hand. They're delicious, no mess (no shelling or chocolate residue), fill you up quickly, and a very good addition to any healthy diet.

review/summary: My wife's favorite flavor, rich dark chocolate and delicious almonds!
review/text: We love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are our favorite snacks. This is my wife's favorite flavor.  She just loves dark chocolate and this snack is a combination of two delicious flavors, crispy roasted almonds and rich dark cocoa for that rich chocolate flavor. You get a little bit of the richness and sweetness you want in a snack that is still healthy and delicious.<br /><br />We eat these almonds for a snack because we view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with a little treat of chocolate for your sweet tooth.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 160 Calories and it contains 5 grams of protein, 9 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and 5 grams of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 24 of these almonds for 160 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 1% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.  They also give you calcium, iron, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, phosphorus, zinc, copper, and manganese.  It is like taking a small healthy vitamin pill when you eat a snack!<br /><br />This flavor is so exceptionally good that you can eat the whole container if you are not disciplined.  You have to be able to close the container and walk away.  This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />We like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as we feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  My wife would give it a 10 star rating if she could.

It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

review/summary: What a disappointment!
review/text: I discovered Emeril's Italian Essence a few years ago. I always thought I made great italian dishes but this made it so much easier and it really did add an extra "kick". It has been getting harder and harder to find it, so I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. I received it on time as promised. But it is not the same. It tastes like regular italian seasoning. Nothing special about it and definitely no "kick". What a disappointment! Don't know if they changed the recipe or this was just a bad batch, but I won't be buying it again.

review/summary: Little Money Makers
review/text: I assume that if you are looking at this product, you understand that reptiles need calcium supplements. I bought this supplement for my children's Russian Tortoises that live in a habitat in the back yard. In the past, I have used the calcium with D. But I read that if they have access to sunlight, which ours do, that they don't need anywhere near as much Vitamin D. And since Vitamin D is a fat soluble Vitamin, too much can become toxic. I mix one part with D to four parts without D, and the tortoises are doing great. They had another batch of healthy babies, which the kids easily sell to pet stores. Without the calcium, they get soft shells that become deformed. We have one male and six females, so I appreciate the savings on the larger size container. Great product! BTW, small ones that we keep inside get the full D. We take them outside once a week and let them run around for a few minutes, but it is not the same as sunning themselves.

review/summary: the un-wimpy chocolate
review/text: If you're not used to dark chocolate, Ghirardelli 72% takes a while to get used to because it's flavor is stronger than most others in the 70-72% range. I used to like Lindt 70% (before they changed the recipe), but Ghirardelli's flavor is more unadulterated and stronger, with a bitterness and 'bite' that I like. A lot of other chocs (especially the more common supermarket brands) strive for smoothness and creaminess...in other words yuck. This one doesn't. 72% is a very nice cocoa percentage. This is my staple chocolate in the 70-72% range. I have tasted even better chocs in this cocoa range, but they are organic ones from the health food store that cost at least 1/3rd more.

review/summary: Wow. It's like finding hidden treasure...
review/text: I am so glad my wife found this company a few years back. I never thought I would find my favorite tea from a company called Coffee Bean. lol. I have ordered a couple varieties of Wulong tea from this company and have been very satisfied with the quality and cost. I also left a review for one of the Wulongs if you are interested in looking that up. This is my first order of Peony White and it is now my favorite. It is quite a bit milder than other teas so if you want a strong flavor you may not like this tea. I was skeptical at first and from being used to Wulong, my first thought was that it was just a step above water! However; after giving it a few weeks I now prefer the milder taste. 'Ben B' did a great review of what you get with this tea. I completely agree with his review. You get a lot of tea at a great price. I posted this in my other review but it works so well for me I'm going to repeat how I use the tea. I don't know if it is good, bad, or indifferent but it works for me.<br /><br />I put about 1 cup of leaves in a coffee filter and brew it like coffee. I dump the first pot (I read this gets rid of any caffeine) and then brew another. I save the leaves in the fridge and can easily make 3-4 more pots of tea without losing flavor. It just seems to keep on giving! I pour it over a cup of ice and that's what I drink all day long at work.<br /><br />I also noticed that with this tea and the Wulongs (and probably all others) the longer the tea sits, the darker and more flavorful it gets. When I make a pot in the morning, it is almost clear when I first pour it. By lunchtime, the tea is much darker and has more flavor. I think this is just the nature of tea in general but just wanted to throw in that observation. Sometimes I'll brew a couple pots at home and pour it in a container and put it in the fridge. By the next day it is as dark as a traditional tea with a bit milder, less bitter taste.

review/text: I am NOT a tea expert or a tea connoiseur, but this product gave me what I was looking for: a huge quantity of nice-tasting white tea for a shockingly low price (at least compared with the prices of other white teas). That's why I gave it 5 stars. If you're looking for the highest-quality white tea, which sells for many times the cost per ounce of this particular tea, you're not going to find it here-- but how could you expect to?  To my relatively unrefined palate it tastes pretty good. It's milder and more pleasant than the various green teas that I've bought, as white tea is supposed to be. This bag contains a lot of long stems and longish leaves, which the best quality white tea almost certainly won't have, but it hasn't detracted from my enjoyment of product. I drink 5 cups a day, and this product lets me do that for a reasonable price.  So if you're considering a purchase, at least you'll be forewarned as to what's inside.  If you're simply looking for a large quantity of very inexpensive, pleasant, loose-leaf white tea that's supposedly quite rich in polyphenol antioxidants, this is a good choice.

review/text: This tea is excellent! It's not tannic at all when brewed properly! However, I can't get it to sink in the loose leaf state, but that's not a detriment. I'll just invest in an infuser.<br /><br />To brew this properly, you want to boil some water, then let the water sit on the stove for 10 minutes. Pour it into your teapot with about a tablespoon of tea for each cup you want to make. Let sit for 10 minutes (I hear you can also let sit for 30 seconds... but I like mine a bit stronger). The tea flavor itself is very light, and it's not tannic and non-caffeinated. Truly white tea is the way to go amongst all the teas, and I haven't even mentioned the health benefits of white over the other colors.<br /><br />Also, one pot can be brewed 2-3 more times.

Now, I've had plenty of white teas from the various folks who mass produce them (like Lipton), but this is the first time I've bought it loose, and brewed it up myself, rather than pre-brewed or in tea bag form.<br /><br />So, point is, I'm an amateur. I don't have experience with other loose leaf white teas to compare. But I find this stuff divine. It's mild, yet tasty, and I don't ever get any caffeine effects that I notice. Now, if you need something to wake up in the morning, I could see that being a problem. But as something I drink all day long, I definitely don't want to have to worry about getting jittery or cutting myself off at a particular point in the evening. I've never had a hard time going to sleep after drinking this tea, and that's great in my book. There is some debate as to whether white tea has lower caffeine content than other teas (like black teas), but I can only go by personal experience. And, personally, I find that black teas like English Breakfast, when I brew them up, give me a very noticeable caffeine kick. This does not in any way.<br /><br />This tea seems great. I wish I had the expertise to know whether I'm enjoying something that really *is* awesome, or some shoddy imposter that, y'know, simply makes me very happy to drink but has no real quality to it. I suspect this is pretty decent quality, and I hope once the two pounds run out, to try some other brand (at least in a limited quantity) to see how they stack up to one another.<br /><br />Oh, and a side note -- turns out throwing out your first, brief steep will not make the rest caffeine-free. Read more here, if you're interested: [...]<br /><br />Also, one of my favorite aspects of this white tea (and I assume it's true of most white teas) is that there is almost *no* bitterness. Black tea isn't exactly like tonic water, but it does have a bit of a bitter taste, and I found that I really enjoyed it once that bitterness was gone. Even though I didn't know or think that black tea was unpleasantly bitter, I now notice it quite a bit. A case of one of those "You don't know what you could've done without until it's gone" sorts of things, I guess.<br /><br />Happy brewing!

review/summary: Outstanding taste but lots of work!
review/text: These anchovies are packed whole in salt, meaning that in order to bring them to the looks of filleted anchovies you are used to, you will have to clean them yourself. Depending on skill, this process takes between 20 minutes to ... maybe 1.5 hours, so be prepared to work hard for your fish. The idea is to place them under running water (from your faucet). The skin will peel and when the water hits the fish around its fin area it will make the fillets part and you could easily extract the bones. This process requires a bit of skill which can be easily gained with repetition.<br /><br />On the other hand, the taste is definitely at par with that of Ortiz anchovies, making the Agostino Recca anchovies the best in the world as well. The fish is fleshy and not overly dry, and the flavor is interesting without being overpowering. The "fishy" taste also survives the salting in these anchovies.<br /><br />For those of you praising anchovies in salt, I would like to recall the fact that you have a choice of the olive oil to put them in - if you like extra virgin oil with the fishes you can have it!  (most anchovies sold in oil would use a lighter, less pungent oil)<br /><br />Given these considerations, I recommend these anchovies wholeheartedly, but you need to know that you have to work to get them!

review/summary: Great Breakfast Bar or Quick Snack Anytime
review/text: *****<br />I have tried several of the different Gnu Foods Flavor & Fiber Bars and like this one the best. I have it for breakfast with my coffee with some natural peanut butter on top and I don't get hungry and feel energized all morning. I can taste chocolate and coffee flavors and it is quite gritty (which I like) because of all of the fiber--it has all different kinds of fiber in it, so it is a very different coarse texture that I find appealing. It also is not too sweet, but I like that too. I don't put sweetener in my beverages and in general like things barely sweet, so this bar is absolutely perfect. If you're looking for a candy-bar-tasting food bar, this bar tastes nothing like that--more like a healthy, delicious, wonderfully flavored pick-me-up. It also has no coating, and I like that and don't think it needs it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I have this a few month along and its coming out as a pretty good table wine. Its a bit light on body so you might want to tweak it to taste a bit. I left 3 gallons as is, 1 gallon I added extra sugar to for something more port like, the other two gallons I added a can of frozen concentrate to each (pomegranate/blueberry and pomegranate/cranberry) those are both coming along quite nicely.<br /><br />Buying this brand again? I'd say for the price you can probably get at least a bit better locally. If you can't buy from anywhere local though the free shipping probably bumps it to a better deal for comparable results.

My family enjoys curry as often as they like now (usually more than once a week) and we don't have to go to a restaurant.  Actually, this tastes EXACTLY like what we've ordered in restaurants, but is much less expensive.  And, I've asked in restaurants to have the spice adjusted, to which I've been given the reply, "they can't, the paste they use only comes one way."  I suspect the cooks are using this very ingredient, which is how they are able to process orders so quickly.

I've purchased several of them now and have had no problems at all.  They come complete with real corks, labels, and foil caps packed into a plastic bucket. Note: The bucket is not a food grade container and can't be used as a fermenter so don't make that assumption.  I'm sure they only ship in a bucket because if they shipped in a box they would get destroyed due to the weight.  Great kits and a great deal.

review/summary: Love the Wisecrackers, but the pepper is a bit strong...
review/text: I have been buying these from my local grocery store for a while now and was VERY happy to see the Wisecrackers available on Amazon at about 40% below the grocery store prices (and with free delivery)! Cannot beat that! Aside from the price, why do I buy Wisecrackers:<br /><br />1) TEXTURE and CRUNCH: They are much tougher then regular crackers. They hold MUCH better when you need them for a dip, or a base for a topping. They allow you to "feel" the crunch and take a loooong time before getting soggy when covered with a topping.<br /><br />2) TASTE: They taste almost like bread crust, with ONLY 110 calories and 2g of fat for ten good sized crackers (each is about two inches by two inches).<br /><br />REGARDING THE FLAVOUR: I like the sesame variety the most, for their neutral aftertaste. The Pepper variety is not as versitile; in fact, it is quite spicy. You will have to choose the dips and the toppings carefully. However, they can be eaten alone as well, as a light in-between-meal snack.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: "Draught of the Living Death" would be a better name for this. It is freaking DELICIOUS, but seriously, don't drink it at work. I could barely keep my eyes open for the rest of the day, and only managed to wake myself up by shoving an ice cube up my nose. I fell asleep at 8:30pm, and woke up twelve hours later with no idea where I was.

review/summary: the best way to fight insomnia without a crash
review/text: i've had insomnia for 5+ years. I used to be on meds like Ambien, Zoloft, and Elavil for the longest time. I also do have anxiety (hence the zoloft and elavil). I kissed all those meds goodbye when this tea came out. I don't reccommend you drink it while driving, cuz it did impair me many a time when i would drink it while i was out having dinner.<br /><br />It def does what is says. I've only tried the Green Tea & Honey - non carbonated bottle of tea. It tastes great, and doesn't leave a bad aftertaste at all. In fact, i don't even notice an aftertaste when i drink it.<br /><br />Active ingredients: Chamomile (reduces anxiety), Valerian (promotes relaxation), Passionflower (reduces anxiety), Hops (promotes relaxation and inhibits adrenaline), Melatonin (relaxes your muscles), and lemon balm (enhances mood, alertness & calm).<br /><br />This tea is better then any pill i've ever taken for my insomnia and anxiety. It's healthy and all natural. There is no crash afterwards like most drinks and meds. You will wake up refreshed.<br /><br />Drinking it will make you relaxed and laid back (mellow). You will most likely fall asleep. (This is on 1 bottle). I have done 2 bottles - they reccomend not going over 2 bottles, and if you drink 2 bottles to separate it by 8 hours from the last one. I drank bottle 2 after 3 hours of drinking the last one. i only made it thru a 1/4 of bottle #2 before i passed out in my bed. Doing 1 bottle is like equivalent to 1 5mg pill of ambien, but doing 2 bottles is like equivalent to 20-25mgs of Ambien (and the legal highest dose for Ambien i am told is 20mg), so 2 bottles is pretty strong.<br /><br />I love it, and i definitely reccommend it to other ppl who have anxiety and insomnia. I love it so much i want a month supply of it.<br /><br />I have heard rumors that it may contain kava kava as well, even though none of the bottles have this listed on it.

review/summary: Insomniacs take note.....
review/text: In brief: I am a hard-core, life-long-suffering insomniac.  Sleep does not come easily to me; it never has; even as a child. I'm 54 now.  I've tried everything you can name.  So when I say this works, it works.<br /><br />Regarding price:  The price for this 12-pk is $2.59 can.  I bought a can yesterday from a 7-11 in West Virginia for $1.65.  I'm going back to that 7-11 and buy a case.<br /><br />Regarding flavor:  The can I bought was lightly carbonated, "Berry" flavor.  It's made with real cane sugar and real juice.<br /><br />The sugars are 29g and carbs are 29g, but I don't care.  I got a good nights sleep and woke up feeling fine.  I can negate the sugars and carbs in my diet and be fine with it.  My thinking is that without the sugars, it would taste awfully bitter because of the herbal content.<br /><br />For those who don't know, Valarian Root stinks!  I have to drink one Valarian Root tea bag with 2 peppermint tea bags to offset the horrible smell and flavor.  This Marley drink has no such bad smell or bad flavor.  The blend (the bitter and the sweet) is very smooth.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to my fellow hard-core insomniacs and to the occasionally-hard-to-sleep among us.

review/summary: It will not cripple my muscles
review/text: I have tried Splenda and Equal these sugars substitutes do something to my muscles like if they shrink and lose flexibility. My aging parents bought a box of Equal, and I warned them about this situation. They continue using Equal for a few days twice a day to drink coffee. My Dad likes three packets in his coffee. One morning they woke up with difficulty and felt no flexibility in their joints. They were using Splenda and my Dad did not show those symptoms but my Mom did show those symptoms. They stopped using Equal. I told them it will take weeks to show improvement, and that I have used Natrataste, and this muscle crippling symptoms never showed up. I can't find Natrataste at the local groceries chain in Puerto Rico.

The covered chocolates taste like m&m's, there are mini chocolate chips and mini peanut butter chips and peanuts in side. There are also these little chocolate chip cookie type things but they are rather crunchy. They could stand to be smaller since they are so crunchy. I will buy again.

review/text: We were in Hawaii and discovered iChill. We tried it there and liked the relaxing feeling we'd have before bedtime, though who really needs to relax MORE when you are in Hawaii? iChill is expensive...about $24/12 bottles which is $2/bottle. Red Rain Relaxation is half that price and seems to deliver better results, so stick with Red Rain IF Amazon ever gets it back in stock! I drink just a half and it works very nicely...body feels a bit heavy and sleep is definitely on the horizon.<br /><br />When I wake up in the morning I have absolutely no residual effects from drinking 1/2 or 1 bottle the night before. I'd definitely recommend for anyone who merely needs to relax or someone who has problems falling or staying asleep.

review/text: I was so excited to place this order.  We love Kraft Ranch at our house and I was thrilled to have an easy way to send it in lunches.  I would have guessed that there would be some sort of expiration date on the package or at least the box.  There is not.  The box arrived with many packages broken open.  And guessing from the saturation on the box, these didn't just happen en route.  Further more, there is no return available.  So I am stuck with a box of broken packages that I won't use because there is no way to check the expiration date.  I guess I should have known better than to purchase without seeing.  I shouldn't have assumed.  I guess loosing my money on this one is my lesson to learn.

review/summary: Closest thing to 70s Girl Scout Fudge Patties I've found yet--Keebler Fudge Filled Cookies
review/text: For anyone who remembers those fudgy little cookies and has been missing them, this is a good news/bad news story.  The bad news--the crisp cookie part of this treat is a chocolate one, unlike the plain vanilla of Fudge Patties past.  The good news--you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />For the uninitiated:  this is a lighter, more crisp version of a vanilla wafer (though chocolate), slightly hollowed out to accommodate a dollop of creamy fudge.  The whole thing is then covered in more chocolate.<br /><br />This is no gourmet cookie; but for chocolate lovers who've never forgotten the joy of biting into that thick, creamy fudge layer before  finding the crunchy cookie inside, it's not bad.<br /><br />Serving suggestion:  Best eaten at warm-ish room temp, when the outer blanket of chocolate is just soft enough to be a bit tacky but not messy, allowing your teeth to sink into the inner fudgy layer...with a glass of milk nearby.

Normally he would be stocking up on the girl scout thin mints this time of year, but he is delighted to find that keebler has a similar product for so much cheaper and available all year.

review/summary: My bassett hound LOVES his food now...
review/text: Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog.<br /><br />Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition.<br /><br />I volunteer at the local Human Society Shelter and a friend of mine there suggested that I try "Canidae". At first I was hesitant because of the cost - but when i read the nutrition facts and saw REAL, all natural ingredients, i felt confident enough that the price was worth it.<br /><br />Before i started feeding my bassett Canidae he would only eat once a day (placing a full bowl of food down for him in the early morning on my way to work...he would wait until late at night to eat AFTER I had my dinner and slowly munch on a couple bits here and there). The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.<br /><br />Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime. Occasionally I will cook up some frozen vegetables with an egg and mix it in his food for a little variety, but I havent had to do that in a while.<br /><br />If you love your dog and care about his/her nutrition, I suggest giving Canidae a try.

review/summary: Good price for a highly rated dog food
review/text: I feed three large dogs and one small dog with this dog food.  I've used it about three months.  Formerly I used a well-known brand that I assumed was good since it was well-known and readily available at stores everywhere.  I decided to change when I did some internet research showing my old brand was considered to have inferior ingredients.  I have to say that I have seen good reviews on the ingredients of this dog food, but I cannot say I notice anything in particular about my dogs since changing other than they seem to enjoy it more and seem to be satisfied with less of it.  Perhaps one dog who has skin problems is better, but I can't swear the dog food is the cause.  So, relying almost entirely on internet proclamation of quality, I give this a hearty recommendation.  And, the price is competitive to lesser rated dog foods.  And it comes directly to your door.

review/summary: great dog food at the lowest cost
review/text: I bought the chicken meal and rice formula because I suspected my 8 year old Lab mix might have a food allergy related to corn or soy. Well, she does not. However I did learn a lot about dog food in the process. According to [...]  Canidae rates four stars whereas as everything on the shelf at my local Wal-Mart rates only one star. I was considering Blue Buffalo and other brands but they were $15 or higher in cost.<br />  I saved money buying Canidae and received dog food with the highest quality ingredients! I highly recommend it.<br />  One thing I must note. Some dog owners have reported reactions to changing to this brand. Although Canidae gives detailed instructions on their website on how to transition your dog to new dog food, they do not give these instructions on the bag. I strongly advise you to visit their website.

review/summary: Great choice for the active young dog!
review/text: I'm the owner of a year and a half old beagle boy.  He's the love of my life and when I got him from our local rescue they emphasized how important a proper diet of a premium dog food is.  I'm not one to be sucked into the belief that if it costs more, it's better.  That said, in terms of dog food, it's important to find a food made of fresh ingredients with no corn byproducts.<br /><br />My little guy eats a bowl of this per day and he has cured the constipation problem he was having before we switched foods.  He seems to really like the taste and to make it a little easier on his teeth, I add water to it to soften it.  That seems to do the trick since the kibbles are decent sized and might be a bit much for a smaller dog to take on.<br /><br />What's also nice about this is ordering through Amazon Prime and getting the heavy bag shipped for free to my door with two-day shipping.  This is by far the most reasonable price I've come across for a top-brand dog food.  Try a smaller bag to see if your pup takes to it and go from there.

review/summary: Aboslutely wonderful for my pitbull
review/text: I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011).

review/summary: Great Food with Grrrrrrreat Taste
review/text: Canidae Grain Free ALS Salmon formula is one of the foods I rotate for my two keeshonden girls. They love the taste and they have no digestive problems with it at all. Canidae grain free food is rated very highly by all the dog food rating sources I have found. Do your dogs a favor and try some.

review/summary: Excellent Dog Food: Excellent Price (AVP)
review/text: I would have spent the big bucks to order top-rated Blue Buffalo, but was shocked to learn that there was a recent wholesale recall of Blue Buffalo products. Canadae is much more inexpensive and just as nutritious. My dogs love it! They seem much healthier since I've switched to this brand. The folks that sell this are wonderful. Canadae was shipped to me free of charge (Amazon Prime.) It was carefully packaged: no rips, tears, or leaks. I highly recommend.

review/summary: I am not a dog, but....
review/text: I am not a dog, but my pug seems to like the food. I decided to choose this food because of the quality of the manufacturer. So far the dog loves the food, and the transition from the old to the new has not caused any problems. I also like the price of the food, and will continue to use this product.

review/summary: Canidae Dog Food
review/text: We have two dogs a standard poodle and a miniature poodle mix; both dogs are doing great on the Canidae dog food.  Both dogs readily eat the dog food.  Our miniature poodle mix tends to be fussy about food, but we have not had this problem with him eating the Canidae. We haven't had any issues with shipping or packaging.  The orders are here within a week to 10 days of ordering.

review/summary: Great food for a great price
review/text: We could not be happier with this food, we have two labs who had problems with their old food Nutra. Male would have diarrhea at least once a month and the female would have to be watched to make sure she would eat her food. We switched to this after a vet recommended a grain free formula to one of our friends labs who was having problems with his coat. After researching different food brands we decided to not purchase the science diet brand the vet recommend and we went ahead and ordered canidae salmon and potatoes. All the problems stopped as soon as we switched. Our male has no more accidents in the house and the female runs to her food when it is time to eat. They both have more energy and their coats look amazing. Great food and we recommend it to all of our friends and family for their pets. Our dogs health is worth the extra 20 dollars over the pet store brands of dog food.

review/summary: best food out there
review/text: Hands down, this brand, or Blue Buffalo, are the best dog food out there, providing your pet doesn't need a special hypoallergenic brand of food because of illness or allergies.  Canidae use all natural, human grade ingredients in their foods.  My 3 pit bulls smash a bowl of this stuff and love it.  I recently switched my Blue pittie to the single grain formula however, because of persistent rashes she has been having lately (haven't been able to determine if it's all outdoor environmental and/or caused by a food allergy?)  She seems to do better on the single grain.  Nevertheless, I've been feeding my dogs this brand for over 4 years and am a very happy and loyal customer.  Even with the skyrocketing prices of grains and other foods, the price hasn't wavered in 4 years.  Not bad.  If you're feeding your dog trash like Science Diet or Eukanuba, switch over to this and you won't be disappointed.  Worth every penny.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: My dog has a very sensitive digestive tract.  She's been in the hospital for severe diarrhea and vomiting.  We switched her to this Canidae food (as well as putting her on some meds and making sure she doesn't get outside food/treats) and she's done great since.  And she loves it.  We haven't had any issues with it what so ever.

review/summary: Cost effective & so far a good alternative
review/text: We have a 52lb Basset/Beagle/who knows. For the past few years Boing has eaten a grain free + low gluten dehydrated food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QF363W">Honest Kitchen Force, Grain-Free Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Chicken, 10 Pound Box</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QW022C">Honest Kitchen Keen, Low-Gluten Dehydrated Raw Dog Food w/ Turkey, 10 Pound Box</a>  But with finances compromised had to find a cheaper option & having completed extensive research decided to give Canidae a try. So far it's 50% HK & 50% Canidae while transitioning to the new food  & in the next two weeks he will be entirely on Canidae. I will update this review after a month to see if his wonderfully shiny coat remains like that & if he remains "gas" free. If so it will be a great find & tremendous saving. Unlike other dogs Boing did not experience the change of formula & so has not had the unfortunate stomach upsets. Another real plus was getting free shipping which helped with the overall cost. Due to health issues I have to be extremely careful of what he eats & as yet I have not seen any ill effects. Have given him the chicken grain free, this flavor & have 2 more to try. He isn't a finicky eater which helps. More in a month or so - hope this helps anyone looking for a decent alternative to the usual big name dog foods.

review/text: My dog has had diarhea problems with all sorts of dog foods in the past.  We switched him to this a couple months ago and he is doing great.  This food was recommended by our pet store and I agree that it is not only healthy, but gentle on my dogs touchy stomach.
