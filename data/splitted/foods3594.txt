review/summary: Care bears Capsule
review/text: Size of the care bear is bigger than expected. Quality is ok for the price. It didnt come in a box as shown in picture, just packed in a plastic bag. In fact, there are many other exact same products on Amazon. I bought another set from another seller at a much lower price as I thought they are different as the dimensions given are different. But turned out to be the same size and same quality.

review/summary: Healthy and Great Tasting Product
review/text: I have been using nutritional yeast for years, almost every single day, and it not only tastes great but is incredibly nutritious. Our three year old son loves it, and especially likes sprinkling it on pasta--I think he feels empowered, and little does he know that he's literally sprinkling nutrition on his food.<br /><br />You can sprinkle this on popcorn or other snack foods to impart a cheesy taste, add a tablespoon to smoothies, pasta sauce, bread, or just about any other savory food. If you're looking for a cookbook with recipes that use this, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0913990604">The New Farm Vegetarian Cookbook</a>. It's a little hipped out, but there's a recipe for nutritional yeast cheese that's pretty amazing. There's also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570671516">The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook: Delicious Dairy-Free Cheeses and Classic "Uncheese" Dishes</a>, but I would try the Farm cookbook first.<br /><br />Lastly, these are large flakes, but Frontier Coop online offers 1 pound bags of Nutritional Yeast "mini flakes" which have a finer consistency and sprinkle well from a container with tiny holes (like the kind used to sprinkle powdered sugar). Frontier's prices are also very reasonable, and they offer organic nutritional yeast as well.

review/summary: Very tastey...and my cat agrees!
review/text: This is one of the best tasting nutritional yeasts products I've ever tasted and I've been using nutritional yeast for over 30 years.  I am vegan and use yeast for its cheesey, nutty flavor. Bob's is guaranteed gluten free as well!  One of my favorite meals is a gluten free pasta tossed with a little flax or extra virgin olive oil, Bragg's liquid aminos and Bob's yeast.<br /><br />I really love it so many ways but interestingly enough I use it more for my 10 year old cat than myself these days!  She has adored nutritional yeast since she was a kitten and I sprinkle a generous amount on her kibble every day.  It's  also very useful sprinkled atop any food I might have to coax her to eat when she is being finnicky.<br /><br />I've always been told that all cats and dogs should have nutritional yeast in their diet to help keep fleas away. Regardless, animals love it so why not give them the extra good nutrition?<br /><br />Amazon's is an excellent buy too, even less expensive than buying bulk at the health food store.  So treat yourself and your pets to delicious, high quality, good nutrition!

review/summary: Best flavor
review/text: I have been buying nutritional yeast in our local co-ops bulk bins for years. I wasn't happy that it didn't contain the vit B-12. I decided to give Bob's Mill a try and it is so delicious! The flavor is very cheesy plus has the B-12. We have already gone through 2 bags. Put it on baked potatoes, popcorn, steamed veggies..etc. Works great in dips, makes great cheese sauces. Best ever! I'll never buy any other brand again. This is the first time I have bought any type of food item from amazon and have been very happy,fast shipping. I am also happy I placed this item on auto shipping.

review/text: The amazon price and subscription service is a great deal most anytime. If you buy Bob's products, this is the way to go.<br />This particular nutritional yeast has a great taste. I've had several brands, and so far this is my favorite. I keep some on the table in a small jar next to the salt and pepper. My daughter and I routinely add it to foods---potatoes, beans, wraps, soups, etc., in order to make sure we are getting the B12 that is important in a vegetarian diet.

review/summary: yeast addiction
review/text: Actualy, it's my wife who has the addiction. We used to buy our yeast from the local health food stores. Sometimes they would have it, other times they were out. How can you run out of nutritive yeast? Tired of that situation we decided to see if Amazon carried yeast, since we order from them frequently. We ordered a case of the T6635 Large Flake. My wife likes it sprinkled on top of fresh popcorn. Now we no longer run out. Just re-order when we get low. The quality is very good. Large flake is good for popcorn.

review/summary: Great source of B12 for vegetarians
review/text: After years of not knowing the difference between baker's yeast, brewer's yeast and nutritional yeast, I got these nutritional yeast flakes which are a versatile addition to many recipes (another company, Red Star, has actually put out a nutritional yeast cookbook available on Amazon). Since vegetarian diets lack this essential vitamin, nutritional yeast flakes, with its cheesy/nutty taste, should be part of a daily diet for this group. You can pretty much sprinkle it on anything (salad, cereal, vegetables) and do your body good.

review/summary: This is so good!!!
review/text: The best nutritional yeast I've ever tasted.  It's fantastic on and in both sweet and savory food and is good eaten plain too.  I keep some in a medium sized Kraft Parmesan cheese shaker, the lid has a flip up top with both large holes and a half-circle opening, both work very well for distributing the flakes depending on how much you want.  I think it's safe to say that anything you get from Bob's Red Mill will not disappoint.  Can't wait to try the "yeast cheese" recipe printed on the bag, it sounds like it would be a wonderful spread/dip.  ***  May 2nd - made a batch of the "cheese" and I am hooked.  SO GOOD!!!

review/summary: Favorite Nutritional Yeast
review/text: Bob's Red Mill is my absolute favorite brand of nutritional yeast. I've even been to the factory outlet in Oregon! Some nutritional yeast is small flake and doesn't have the same texture as the large flake version. Some is light colored and appears like it's lost its nutrients and flavor.<br /><br />I use nutritional yeast on virtually everything, and we even have a little shaker of it on the dinner table. It's amazing on popcorn with a little salt and dill, I love it in pestos instead of cheese, it flavors up any vegan cheeses you are making (great for vegan macaroni-n-cheese), and works well in soups and stews.<br /><br />The best part is that it's actually nutritious. If you're a vegan, it gives you a boost of vitamin b12 so you don't have to take a vitamin supplement.<br /><br />I order from Amazon and use subscribe and save, which is the best deal available for it.

review/text: This nutritional yeast is my new addiction.  I tried a sample of Bragg's and it was pretty good, but I saw that this Bob's was cheaper through Amazon so I ordered the 4 bags of it. Definitely not a mistake! It tastes better than the Bragg's.  It is so healthy and has such a good "cheese-like" flavor that I find myself trying to think of things to make that I could put it on.  Haven't tried the yeast-cheese recipe yet or on pizza. It has been tasty in everything I have tried it in though. I usually make homemade pizza with a mix of reduced-fat cow's milk mozz, soy cheese and Daiya vegan cheese and I think this will combine with it well! Also good mixed with beef or soy meat for tacos. The possibilities are endless! It even tastes good straight from the bag. :)

review/text: I ran out of the nutritional yeast that I got at the store and decided to try Bob's Red Mill brand.  I was a little nervous to buy a pack of four, but since it could be frozen I decided to take the plunge.  I received my order in about 2 days (yeah Amazon!) and I already had a recipe that I was ready to try it with...Vegan Mac and Cheeze.  Nothing like jumping in with both feet to test out a new product!  I was very happy with the results.  The recipe turned out exactly as described and the Bob's Red Mill Nutritional yeast tasted fantastic.  My 3 year old son LOVED it and repeatedly said "Yum, I like the cheesy noodles!" For someone that is relatively new to being vegan, this is a great product for taste and also to get that illusive B12 into my diet.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  1. Great tasting (I add to salads, soups, noodles, etc.)<br />  2. Easy to use (The 8oz. packages allow you to use a little at a time and freeze the rest)<br />  3. Good source of vitamin B12 for vegans<br />  4. Good quality (I have always been happy with products from Bob's)<br /><br />Not-So-Pros:<br />  1. Flakes are a little larger than other brands (this isn't a huge deal and I knew this ahead of time since it is called "large flake yeast")<br /><br />I will definitely keep this on my "Subscribe and Save" list!

review/summary: Child does not like!
review/text: Even though I am a vegetarian, this was my first time buying nutritional yeast.  I recommend that anyone considering this for their child should get a sample or smaller package first.  I have been searching for milk alternatives for my son since discovering he has an allergy to milk.  He is fine with all types of soy cheeses so far and I thought this would be a good alternative to soy.<br />I have tried preparing him 'mac n' cheese' twice- once using the recipe on the bag and once trying my own recipe and both times my four year old said 'yuck, is this a special type of cheese?'. My 2 year old seems to be OK with it, but I think it upset her belly.<br />I am very satisfied with the quality and taste of this product and I am happy to have the extra B vitamins in my diet.  I think it does upset my stomach slightly, but I am not completely positive about that.<br />Unfortunately, I might find it difficult to work my way through 4 bags that I had bought to share with my son.  I found the taste to be pleasant, a little bit like cheese, but there is also a slight off-taste to it that children might not like. The best I can describe it is slightly bitter, or earthy. Which is fine, but just don't expect your child to love it like I did after reading all the positive reviews.

review/text: These are just OK. They are more bitter than other freeze dried mangoes. Some of the pieces are crunchy, while some are like styrofoam. I love the Trader Joe's brand the best.

review/summary: OUTRAGEOUSLY BAD DEAL!
review/text: I was VERY disappointed in both the quality and price of this product. The quality was poor, as the candy was stale, and the price was totally ridiculous...over $16.00 for a few pieces of toffee. I'll never buy this item from this seller again. Hopefully the Mackintosh's toffee bars will become available again sometime soon, because I've never had a bad one of those!

review/text: This is by far the best toffee on the market.  It doesn't stick to your teeth, nor is it brittle - it is just right.<br />If you love toffee, this will delight the senses (and it can be frozen!).<br /><br />Christmas just isn't Christmas for my husband without Mackintosh toffee.  He grew up in the Seattle area and his parents would buy it in Vancouver BC for his Christmas stocking.  It is still a part of our holiday tradition.

review/summary: Manna from Heaven (Canada)
review/text: My husband and I have fond memories of packing the old Mackintosh candy bars into the Quetico country of western Ontario 30 years ago when we were both in school and a canoe trip into the wilds of Canada was our vacation.  Eating a piece of this toffee was a special treat each dinner.  We periodically got some of the bars on our occasional trips to Canada for many years after, but it seemed to disappear from the stores for the past five or so years.  I was delighted to find that I could still buy this product in some form (I still prefer the old candy bar format to this new one), and that I could order it from the US and not pay an exorbitant price for shipping.  I don't know why all the fuss is made over chocolate - this is the best candy ever made in my opinion!

review/summary: MacIntoshes toffee ain't what it used to be
review/text: I recently purchased a package of MacIntoshes Toffee and expected it to be as I remembered it to be,wonderfuapl, chewy and a piece of heavenly candy from Canada.  What I received was a new csndy reinvented by Nestle that was nothing like what I remembered.  It was soft and gritty and just plain nasty. I contacted Nestle via email and was contacted promptly by their quality control department.  They assured me that they had not changed the recipe and that they had nothing but positive feedback from consumers.<br />They  apologized profusely and promptly refunded both the cost of the product and shipping.

review/summary: Not like it used to be
review/text: When growing up Mac was my favorite toffee, but it has changed a lot over the years. Now it is more like those very soft and dry-ish square caramels you can get at any grocery store. True, it doesn't stick to your teeth anymore, but it doesn't have that buttery melt anymore either.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good chewy and firm toffee like Mac used to be, try Walkers' Nonsuch Original Toffee. I tried that recently and was impressed. (As of this review, you can get it here on Amazon as well.)

review/summary: Canadian Candy You Remember As A Kid!
review/text: Many of "The Boomers" out there may tell you a story about Mack Toffee, but now-a-days they are still looking for a "slab" of Mackintosh Toffee.  Hey - Just let it go, the "slab" style of this product is long gone.  But, after years of growing older and getting a few dental crowns, bridges and numerous fillings...It may be a good thing that Mack Toffee is now sold as individually wrapped pieces in a poly style bag.  It certainly saved me time in December when I made my favorite toffee cookies over the Holidays.<br /><br />If you want, just let the Nestle Mackintosh Toffee pieces sit in the overnight in your fridge, then toss them directly in your food processor to make the toffee pieces even smaller - The cooled pieces of toffee break up nicely and Voila! You have just the right size to add to your cookie recipe, or you can sprinkle over ice cream, or just toss a few chips (or pieces...) directly into a hot cup of coffee or hot chocolate.  My GrandKids like the nifty package (it's somewhat small but fits nicely into their lunch box) - You might want to buy more than ONE bag to on shipping costs.  Follow the links to a few other listings for Mackintosh Toffee on Amazon.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SF9PNI">4-Bags of Nestle Mackintosh Mack Toffee Candy | 170gram Bags | Made in Canada</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057QLLYG">6- Bags of Mackintosh's Mack Toffee170g Each Bag, Made in Canada</a>

I would love to be able to put it on a hot pretzel at the mall or a sandwich at work. Like the other reviewer, I will also order more when getting low, but probably won't wait until I've already opened the last bottle. I consider it a crises when I run out of this mustard!<br /><br />If you like flavor, but don't want horseradish, give this a try...

I work for amazon and I do pack often, but from I was told, all boxes have to travel down the line with flaps inclosed into each other, so I don't see how grease and that much dirt could have made it onto and into the box (the packageing was supposed to be clear, but it was a tint of gray from the dirt left on it). The packages inside the outer clear package was alright, so thats not a big deal to me.

review/summary: Good but pricey.
review/text: I happily 'inherited' a little old man chihuahua from my sister a couple of years ago when raising 3 kids and a husband, two jobs, and many other things got to be a bit much for her to handle.  I couldn't have been happier!  I knew his history and that he's had skin problems since he was a baby.  Different vets have been unable to determine the cause of his itchy scratchy scaliness, and different medicines and types of food were tried.  This food hasn't been the cure, but he's doing much better since starting this last year.  His coat was always a bit thin and I never wanted to brush him for fear of irritating already irritated skin, but I actually had to buy him a brush this year.  His coat's filled out and he doesn't have as much skin problems as he used to have.  Thankfully he's just a little guy, otherwise this stuff would break the bank!  I've decided to stop buying from pet superstores because of some of their practices so I'm glad to have found this on Amazon!

review/summary: Quick, Convenient, Tasty
review/text: Kikkoman Instant Aka Miso Soup is fantastic. It's quick, convenient, and pretty good considering it comes out of a small pack. You add the powdered mix to a cup of hot water and voila... instant miso! What you see on the product bag is what you get... there's pieces of konbu (seaweed) and other goodies you'd expect in miso soup (but not tofu, that's not in this particular "flavor.") It's a great desk-drawer-at-work snack. Although it may not taste as "authentic" as the way a mama-san would make it in Japan, it definitely satiates the miso-soup-hungry palate in a pinch, you know, when taking a quick flight to Japan just won't fit into your schedule. It's comparable to the bowl of miso soup you'd get at a Japanese restaurant in the states. Not bad, if you ask me!<br /><br />The only thing you should know is that it contains a LOT of sodium. We're talking about a third of % daily value (RDA, based on the nutrition facts on the back of the package). If you have high blood pressure or are trying to maintain a low-sodium diet, this may not be the soup for you, or something you'd have often.<br /><br />Otherwise, get a few and take 'em to work or keep 'em in your pantry. It's too quick, easy and delicious not to!

Total milk content  73%<br /><br />(not watered down, it seems.)(less thickener necessary, that way)<br /><br />Suitable for vegetarians, says the label.<br /> If you divide the contents into three portions, the label says  in  each  140-gram serving,  there are:<br /> 143 calories,<br />4.1 grams of protein,<br />147 milligrams of calcium and<br />22.4 grams of carbohydrate.<br /><br />Not much sugar, to judge  by the low calorie count.  And better sugar than corn sweeteners, say I.<br /><br /> I plan to keep this label, to learn more.<br /><br /> The British have different regulations than the United States regarding artificial colors and flavors. What the United States allows, the British often do not.<br />  Annatto and Curcumin, which can be looked up on the Web, are considered not artificial.<br /> Enjoyed this product. Keep thinking about all those wonderful, custard-producing British cows hopefully grazing on nice British grass in a green  meadow.

review/summary: Not your best bet if you want smoky paprika - try another brand
review/text: Well, I ordered three tins of smoked paprika, one each of sweet, bittersweet and hot.<br />I love the smokiness and flavor it imparts to dishes, and wanted to try some other<br />strengths.<br /><br />We received the cans today. It was well-packaged and everything arrived in great shape.<br />The seller was also quick to ship the order out.  I have no problems at all with the seller.<br />One tin expires in 2012, and the other two are 2013, so guess I got an older tin of one strength.<br /><br />This review is for the MILD (or sweet) paprika from Chiquilin.<br />What a disappointment!<br />This has NO smoky aroma at all, despite it supposedly being a smoked product.<br />I have not cooked with it yet, but I surely hope that it adds more flavor than it does aroma.<br />Otherwise, I could have just bought plain paprika in the grocery store for a lot less.<br />(The actual smoky paprika (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NO943C">Smoked Paprika Tin</a>) DOES have a wonderful smoky aroma and was what I expected from all the versions.)<br /><br />I read a lot of different information about the brands, and while this was not my #1 choice on brands,<br />it was affordable and the seller did combined shipping, which was why I chose it. I guess you get what<br />you pay for? I was under the assumption that all of the Spanish paprikas were smoked paprikas, and you just got<br />different strengths of the roast. This does not seem to be the case with this brand.<br />We are going to keep the mild/sweet and the smoked, but returning the hot without opening it.<br /><br />I hope it tastes better than it smells. I am admittedly disappointed in the aromatic qualities<br />(or lack of them) of this particular mild paprika. You can probably do better with another brand.

review/text: This product does taste like sugar. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the price. It really is very expensive, so I keep trying other sugar substitutes to see if I could find a cheaper alternative. So far I haven't found anything that is close to this. There's no after taste, but start off using only a little because you might get stomach upset(diarrhea) then increase little by little so your system has time to get use to it.

review/summary: All Natural and Can Handle a Man's Stink!
review/text: This is the best all natural deoderant I've ever used.  I have only used the Herbal Scent which is pleasant, not overpowering, but strong enough to cover a man's natural all day musk.<br />The key is you have to shower daily.  Meaning, you can't get away with wearing this all day unless it goes on freshly cleaned armpits.  If you wear this all day, go to sleep and don't have time in the morning to shower, you will stink by that afternoon.  But if you do shower daily (no judgments if you don't), this deoderant is an all-natural wonder.  And I've worn this during hot, humid days in the sun.  And it works!  No rashes or the worries on putting aluminum on your skin.  I am no a lifelong customer!  You should be one too.

I am so relieved to have found a deodorant that is actually "ALL" natural! I had been trying other "all" natural deodorants...but none seemed to actually work. I had definite issues with sweating and smelling while using other "all" natural deodorants. Oh and come to find out that those other "all" natural deodorants are not really "all" natural! They have replaced the harmful chemical Aluminum and replaced it with another possible harmful ingredient...Triclosan. I have read that Triclosan is a chlorophenol, a class of chemicals which is suspected of causing cancer in humans. If you are looking to go all natural then use this deodorant! It seriously works!

review/summary: Eureka!
review/text: After hearing Howard Stern talk about his miracle new natural antiperspirant that actually works, I went to my local Whole Foods to grab a bottle.  While I have not seen any studies claiming a 100% correlation between using antiperspirants with aluminum and any maladies, I thought anything I am smearing under my armpits every day of my life might as well be natural.  I've tried various other natural brands over the years and none of them has worked very well.  Tom's of Maine was the worst, and the best was Trader Joe's cotton stick, but it still wasn't great.<br /><br />Anyway, my Whole Foods didn't have Howard's brand, but the guy in the pharmacy recommended this and I've been using it every day since for months, and it's very effective at odor elimination and perspiration reduction.  Good enough that I haven't touched my Mitchum gel since using it.  I will admit that the Mitchum gel would work for 2-3 days, and I wouldn't go that far with this stuff, but I haven't needed to yet.

Summers here are miserable,  but this deodorant keeps me smelling fresh until the end of the day.  It used to be available at a health food store here until they changed ownership.  Was very happy to find it on Amazon, and for a better price.  It also never irritates my sensitive skin like other deodorants I've had to use.  First heard about it from Oprah, and so glad that I decided to give it a try.  Need to stock up on them, since I always miss it when I run out.

review/text: ::sigh:: I had very high hopes for this product! This was going to be the one to conquer my stinky pits! Sadly, my search continues. Some background about myself- I've been off of traditional deodorant/antiperspirant since 2009. I actually began to smell worse with it and it has all those cancer causing chemicals in it. Since then, the only thing that gives me mild protection is the crystal rock. (Along with rose essential oil and talc powder.) However, by the afternoon I don't smell as fresh and I was hoping this miracle product would do the trick. Nope! In fact, I ordered the Jasmine scent and the second I put it on my skin (tested on the wrist) it smelt like gross scented cat litter. I've been bearing through the nasty litter scent for about a week, hoping to smell some results. (I figured that if the product worked, I would purchase the non-scented one.) However, like I said, my search continues on. :(

review/text: Everyone gave these treats rave reviews, so I thought I would give them a try. I have two cats, one who is very picky and one who will eat just about anything I give her, even other breath fresheners that the other cat doesn't care for. I assumed that at least one would take the bait. Both cats completely snubbed these things. Sniffed at and walked away cold. I broke one in half in case the inside might reveal more aroma. Nothing. I know all cats have different tastes, but it's a little weird that I got no reaction at all, not even a reconnaissance lick. Oh well.
