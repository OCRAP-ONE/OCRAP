review/summary: BEST dried cranberries I've ever had!
review/text: In comparison these are larger, softer, and even a bit juicy!!!<br />I usually buy the major or evern generic brand of dried cranberries carried at my local grocery. So, these are the ONLY organic dried cranberries I've ever had so I cannot say that these are the best in the organic category but these taste SO MUCH better than any non organic brand from my local grocer. I will buy again! :)

review/summary: Mocha-friendly
review/text: I hate artificial sweeteners, and I'm not absolutely crazy about Stevia, which has a very strong, sweet taste (different from sugar) but I really wanted to break my mocha habit and cut back on sweets. Two drops of this in skim milk and coffee makes an excellent substitute for my old heaping teaspoon of sweetened cocoa.<br /><br />I'd like to carry this in my purse to change those impulse Starbucks Mochas into Skinny Lattes, but the bottle says to refrigerate "for freshness" after opening, so I'm not sure how perishable it is.

review/summary: It's hard to strike a balance with this flavor
review/text: I've read a lot recently on how bad artificial sweeteners are for our health, so I decided to give this chocolate flavored liquid stevia a try.<br /><br />I simply cannot drink my coffee black, I was adding Hershey's sugar-free chocolate syrup and skim milk to my morning coffee. This stevia is a good substitute, but it's a flavor/sweetener I will have to learn to love. So far, not loving it, but it's better for me so I will buck up and maybe change my star rating later.<br /><br />I am experimenting at the moment, starting out with 5 drops per 8 ounces of coffee, it's sweet enough, but not enough chocolate flavor. Upping it to 8 drops per cup, it's starting to get there with the chocolate flavor, but it's too sweet.<br /><br />The Sweetleaf is all natural, has no calories, and is also rated 0 (zero) on the glycemic index.<br /><br />Also, you may think the price of this is expensive initially, but one 2 ounce bottle has around 300 servings, so it's cheaper for me considering the price of the Hershey's sugar-free syrup.

review/summary: Stevia - awesome sweetener!
review/text: My chiropractor recommended Stevia as an alternative to the artificial sweeteners I had been using.  I had been having chronic migraines, which he deduced were a result of my use of Aspartame.  Initially I was skeptical, but decided to give it a shot anyway.  I am happy to say that since I now use Stevia instead of any artificial sweeteners, I'm headache free!  Stevia comes in lots of flavors, even rootbeer, which I've used in sparkling water in place of diet soda - it's delicious and no headaches!  What could be better ...highly recommend! (PS this is the best price I've found anywhere ...)

Too much and it is bitter, but the right amount tastes great! I barely use half a drop on each strawberry and it is more than enough. Maybe you could dilute it in a little water or something to make it easier to use the right amount. I love stevia, no more white sugar for me!

review/summary: Makes great chocolate milk!
review/text: Dieting means I don't get to enjoy a lot of my favorite foods. Chocolate milk is one thing I hadn't tasted in months and was resigned to forgoing for years. (I have a lot to lose.) But this chocolate stevia adds zero calories to the milk, and I really enjoyed the chocolate milk I made with it. It still isn't something I'll be able to drink often, as 1 cup of 1% milk is 110 calories by itself, but I'll at least be able to enjoy it occasionally.<br /><br />When reading any stevia product review, remember that people "taste" sweetness differently. Some people don't really taste stevia as sweet, while others find it *too* sweet. In addition, I noticed that some stevia products, like this one, were both flavorful and sweet, while others tasted (to me) like there was no sweetener in it.

review/text: I bought this to use with the HCG diet - it makes you feel like you are actually getting chocolate.  You do get the "fake" sweet aftertaste - but I think you do with most fake sugars.  I added some to ice and ground up strawberries.  It seems expensive but it is cheaper on Amazon than in grocery stores - and not all stores carry this flavor and brand.  It also lasts a pretty long time.  Better deal to buy 2 pack.  Look at all the different choices to buy - some have free shipping some don't.

review/summary: Excellent item!
review/text: The chocolate flavor is the first SweetLeaf stevia that I purchased (after having tried Whole Foods' store brand) and I really like it! I was worried, since I ordered two bottles with the subscribe&safe! At first, I couldn't taste a noticeable chocolate flavor, but have discovered that it takes a bit of experimentation to find just the right number of drops depending on what you are sweetening. So far, I have tried it in unsweetened almond milk, which tastes like a milkshake, and added 11 drops to a bottle of water to make it taste like a chocolate-y treat instead of plain old water. Makes it a lot easier to drink enough water throughout the day! I also used this in spaghetti sauce! I used to put a pinch of sugar and/or a bit of chocolate in my from scratch spaghetti sauce, but can't do that anymore... I made the sauce, thought it was missing something so decided to try a few drops of this chocolate stevia -- it definitely elevated the sauce to a whole new level. I was pleasantly surprised! The stevia does have a bit of an aftertaste when I use it in coffee or tea, hot, but when I use cold drinks, I don't have that problem. I think my taste buds are getting used to the stevia, so I will try hot beverages again soon. If you are new to stevia, I recommend adding one drop, shaking, taste, then adding another, and so on, until you find your magic number.  If you can't have sugar and don't want to use artificial sweeteners (which all taste like poison to me!), it's definitely worth a try with the liquid stevias. I am happy I experimented and have since ordered more flavors... can't wait to try more!

review/text: I've been using this product for years and loved it. Okay, I loved the dark chocolate more, but that seems to have been discontinued. I opened a new bottle this morning, the first with the white label and yuck! I couldn't figure out quite what it tasted like, but another reviewer mentioned raspberry and that's pretty close. However, it's not a very tasty raspberry, and that is not the flavor of choice for coffee.<br /><br />I see that the picture is still showing the green label. So I may try again, but if a white label shows up, I'm sending it back.

review/text: My family uses stevia as their sweetner.  This chocolate stevia is pretty good.  The price is not bad although I wish it were a little cheaper.  My son uses it to sweeten plain yogurt and we use it in milk for chocolate milk.  It is a real help when I am trying to raise my kids having as little sugar as possible.  It is kind of hard to do when all their friends eat cookies, candies, juice, soda ect.  They feel like freaks because we don't have any of that in the house.  So stevia helps me out to be able to give them something sweet.

review/summary: Chocolate flavor, zero calories, healthy Stevia!
review/text: I only recently discovered Stevia, and I'm a big fan.  I've used saccharine in my coffee for years, although I know it's not good for me.  I eat a low carb diet so I didn't want to use honey, sugar, or agave nectar, and I've read too many bad things about Nutrasweet.<br /><br />I bought this 2-bottle pack of chocolate stevia liquid to try it, and I really like it.  It only takes a 2-3 drops to sweeten my morning coffee, and give it a faintly chocolate flavor and smell.  It's not as chocolately as I'd like, but adding more drops makes it too sweet.<br /><br />I don't notice any aftertaste or bitterness after using stevia, although I've read reviews that other people do. The bottle lists the ingredients as "Proprietary Blend, Purified Water, Stevia (Leaf) Extract, and Other Ingredients" which makes me wonder what they've put in there that they can't tell me about.  But for the couple of drops per day that I will ingest, I'm willing to let them keep their secrets.<br /><br />I got my two bottles with free shipping with Amazon SuperSaver shipping on orders over $25, and it's also available at a 15% discount if I sign up for Subscribe & Save.

review/summary: WARNING: You are paying 72 Cents per Ounce!
review/text: I haven't tried these yet; they have just arrived, but I wanted to warn fellow customers that you will be receiving 56 TOTAL ounces (four packages of 14 ounces each):  that adds up to 72 cents per ounce! Amazon has given me an appropriate refund, so props to them.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Flavor-wise I enjoyed these pumpkin raviolis:  Are they worth the specialty 40.00 dollar price?  -I would say not because the pumpkin flavor gets overwhelmed by the sauce and even by the ravioli pasta itself.  Another issue is that the raviolis are covered in powder and thus make a mess, especially when recycling.  I would pay 20-30 dollars for this product for a gift, but probably not 40.

review/text: This popcorn has a great flavor, and as suggested by others we sprayed a little olive oil on it and lightly salted it.  Very good corn from the hot air popper.<br /><br />Some folks have expressed concerns over how this popcorn does not turn out as "big and fluffy" as the store brands or other national brands.  This IS true.  Keep in mind that those other brands have been bred to be big and fluffy, but not necessarily tasty.  I prefer the good taste of this corn over the big and fluffy "cardboard corn" any day!

review/summary: Great popcorn
review/text: This corn pops beautifully in our air popper, and it has a wonderful taste.  There are very few unpopped kernels left when I turn off the popper.  Although the kernels are multi-colored, they're a creamy white after they pop.  The taste is faintly nutty and good enough that we don't have to add other flavorings or salt, just a little olive oil spray.  A 1/2 cup serving of kernels pops up into a large bowlful of corn, great for 2 people to snack on.

review/summary: Good But Not Great
review/text: The taste of this popcorn is superb; however, the dark kernels do not fully pop for us.  We are using a hot air popper and are still trying to figure out if we are doing something wrong.  We have separated the popcorn into two batches; one that has the dark kernels removed and one with the dark kernels remaining.  Of the two, the fist batch without the dark kernels is superior, but we are still experimenting with the dark kernels.  We have not tried another brand or type of popcorn yet, but will do so in the future.

review/summary: Popcorn Lover
review/text: OK, I do love popcorn, but I'm definitely not in the gourmet category.  I'd been using a store brand white popcorn, but decided to try the "gourmet" variety to see what I had been missing.  I still pop the old fashioned stove top way, so consider that when you read the rest of this review.  I like the look of the various colors, the popcorn tastes quite good, is it better than my store version, I don't really think so.  What surprised me was that when popped, it makes about 1/2 as much as the store bought, so I have to use at least twice as much to get the same amount of popped popcorn.  So, all in all, I'm going back to the store brand and I'll save some money

review/text: I used this in a fireplace/campfire popcorn popper with peanut oil. Every, single, kernel, popped. I'm not really a popcorn fan, but my wife and friends are. But this stuff was truly excellent. I served it with just a couple of pinches of pickling salt sprinkled on it. The entire batch was gone within minutes, without a trace.<br /><br />(Pickling salt is just regular salt ground very fine. On popcorn, this makes it stick better, so you can use less for the same effect.)

review/summary: Won't be ordering these again, pop too small
review/text: I ordered these hoping to have something more special than Orville, but these rarely come out of the pantry anymore. They pop much too small and once popped they are more hard then puffy and soft. The dark kernels are also quite unpleasing visually, looking like burnt popcorn. Finally, the ratio of fluffy popcorn to interior kernel is too low.<br /><br />If I ever want to have an authentic old-world treat of pre-hybridized and optimized popcorn, I'll pull these out. Until then, I'll stick with my Orville's that pop huge and fluffy and don't leave so many un-popped kernels behind.<br /><br />I notice a lot of the 5-star reviewers are either comparing this to microwave popcorn or are the type of people who think a misting of Olive Oil is a "delicious" topping? I can only laugh. So take those reviews with a grain of salt (haha). One even bemoaned that it isn't "organic."<br /><br />But if you like your popcorn with salt and butter and would judge this on its merits and not because it comes in a package and name meant to entice psuedo-foodies and vegans, I say pass it up and go with a name brand that let's you use half the kernels and get the same amount of popcorn. And if you've only ever eaten microwave popcorn, this isn't the popcorn to switch to.<br /><br />UPDATE: Ran out of Orville, so I dipped into my India Tree again. I'm throwing the rest away. If there is a special technique to get these things to taste good, pop evenly or simply be edible, I haven't figured it out.

It was like the monty python sketch, This parrot is dead, no it is only mourning for the Norwegian fjords. This Parrot was dead ass as a dodo and to declare otherwise is pure chicanery.<br />The tree was nothing like the picture, there was no indication as too how it should have looked, it was damaged during shipping. On top of this there was no effort to redo, what is in my mind, a major wrong.

Then I bought these tea bags on a whim and I haven't gone back. It's easier, there's less mess and it tastes just as great. I go through as many as six or seven cups a day.<br /><br />I buy mine at a local grocery store instead of online and as long as Bigelow makes them and my local grocery store sells them, I'll continue to buy them.

Chianti being on the dry side for our taste wasn't a problem as we just back sweetened a small bit to bring it up to our taste.<br /><br />We bottled before Christmas and shared with family and friends who kept asking for more. Noticed recently the Wildberry Chianti on the wine rack is in short supply already! Will have to order another kit soon.<br /><br />Shipping from Amazon on these kits was really quick. As soon as it arrived I started it and another Cornucopia kit and they were ready for bottling within the 4 weeks suggested.<br /><br />I would comment on if they get better with age but I can't seem to keep any of these Cornucopia brands on my wine rack long enough for them to gain any age.

review/text: I've just finished bottling 6 gallons of wine produced from this kit, and I followed all of the instructions to the letter. When I tasted the finished product I found it to have less alcohol content that a typical wine, and it was very sweet. I immediately called the customer service number on the box to report my results to see if I had done something wrong. The representative informed me that my results were expected. This is a very sweet wine with only 4-5% alcohol content. I did not expect a sweet dessert-style wine when I purchased this kit. I expected a typical Chianti. This kit does not product a typical Chianti, so if you prefer light/sweet wine you will like this kit. If, on the other hand, you prefer a full-bodied, drier wine, then I definitely do not recommend purchasing this kit.

review/summary: Trident White SUGARLESS Gum with Xylitol
review/text: This is a great product for people who want to improve their oral health.  The key feature in the gum is Xylitol, a sugar derived from the birch tree.  Xylitol is naturally sweet, so no added sugar is necessary, however, the added benefit of xylitol is that oral bacteria (the ones that cause tooth decay and gum disease) ingest xylitol, cannot digest it, and as a result - die!  This lowers bacterial counts in the mouth, which if done consistently, lowers the pathogenic bacteria, thus lowering the potential for cavities.  There are several gums that advertize the ingredient xylitol, but check the package carefully, some add additional sugars that bacteria love, thereby negating the positive effect of xylitol.  Most people who buy xylitol gum do so with the intent to lower cavity risk.  A usual daily dose of xylitol is chewing 5 sticks a day for 5 minutes a time.  Several toothpastes also have xylitol in them, such as Spry <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0560O">Spry Sugar Free Toothpaste with Fluoride, Spearmint 4 oz</a>.  (I always recommend a toothpaste with fluoride, so get the Spry with fluoride - it also comes in a non-fluoride formulation too).  The flavor of this gum tends to wear off rather quickly, but then the intent is to dose the mouth with xylitol, not necessarily to promote gum chewing or gum chewing pleasure.<br /><br />Bought in bulk, as in this package, the cost is reduced.<br /><br />kone

review/summary: A Cut Above
review/text: I first tried this tea in a search for a caffeinated black tea substitute. I had found that most green teas downright unpalatable. Finally...I discovered this Bentley's assortment. The quality and taste are refined and of a level far above anything I could find in the supermarket.<br />The value (price per teabag) is quite good. What a pleasure!

review/summary: good tea
review/text: I really love this tea;  am an avid Earl Grey tea drinker. First had this at a restaurant in Southern California and then a funky shop in D.C.  On either coast, it has a wonderful aroma and a good, balanced flavor.  And it's about half the price of other loose leave Earl Grey teas available at the tea chains (Teavana) or local tea shops in my neighborhood.  Overall, great value.

review/text: I love coffee but my stomach doesn't agree with me so I had been searching for the right type of coffee that won't cause discomfort (heartburn, acid reflux) and also taste good. I tried many that claim to be low-acid or for sensitive stomach but i still felt the discomfort after drinking them.  But not this one!  I'm so glad that i found this.  I actually bought this at a local Asian supermarket for under $6.  The taste is nice and smooth...although i can imagine it being not strong enough for people who like their coffee strong.

review/summary: Just as ridiculous as the other "designer" dog foods
review/text: I found this brand on Petsmart's website as an online only special. The price was excellent (~$1 per lb). The list of ingredients and quality seemed good and my dog liked it so I was happy. Then I went to order it again and have found that their prices have sky rocketed! Now they are in the same glut as all the other "designer" dog foods that have ridiculous price tags. Didn't you hear?...people are getting rid of their pets because they can't afford to feed them and this company is of no help. Unbelievable! Well, By Nature, you lost my business. If your dog food is the same high price and quality as 10 million others, there is absolutely no reason to buy it. Didn't your marketing people tell you that? or did they just take your money? Lucky for my dog, I found another well-known, high quality dog food that I will purchase instead.

It's not a substitute for a nice cold glass of ice water, but I purchased it for my mother-in-law who do to medical reasons was on a fluid restricted diet. What it does do is help eleviate the unpleasantness that serious thirst can cause. Works well, and doesn't taste bad at all.

review/summary: A Super Yummy Drink
review/text: My wife bought a box of this Honey Vanilla White Chai Tea, and I am hooked. She adds milk and sugar to the brew and produces a yummy caffeinated concoction. The ingredients include black and white tea, roasted chicory (a blue-flowered Mediterranean plant), cinnamon, natural honey, vanilla flavors with other natural flavors, ginger, cardamom (aromatic seeds of a plant of the ginger family), cloves, black pepper, and nutmeg. Failure to like this stuff could mean you have issues. If you are a fan of recycling, you will be happy to know that Celestial Seasonings print their boxes on 100% recycled paperboard with 35% post-consumer content.

review/summary: Perfect Cup of Tea
review/text: I drink one to two of these K-Cups a day (have been doing so for 6 mos now).  Love it - perfect tea - not bitter not weak.  I have come across the occasional K-Cup with a bad lid seal (and it will blow the grinds into the cup then) but I choose not to get worked up over the failure of a 40 cent item when the others in the pack are fine.  2008 EDIT: Ok, , I have to agree with the other reviewer a little more - the quality of these K-cups is inconsistent and they do blow grinds more often then they should.  I am still drinking this tea as much as ever as the flavor is not replicated in any other brand.  2009 EDIT: It's June 2009 now and this is still my main drink.  The K-Cup blowout issues seems to have been resolved in the last few boxes.  They must have fixed the problem.  A great tea.

review/text: Great find on Amazon! I had not found a decaf K-cup tea on any of the regular K-cup sties ... most decaf offerings were green tea or herbal. (Green tea is prohibited if you take the prescription drug Coumadin)<br /><br />Smooth and flavorful, does not brew as dark as using a tea bag, but just as rich.<br /><br />Priced below other teas on other sites and arrived nicely packaged, no extra packaging to dispose of!<br /><br />The best feature of this purchase was the use by date ... over 12 months away. Other sites have sent coffee and teas that had sell by dates within 3 months!<br /><br />I now use Amazon for all my K-cups because of price and service!

review/text: After reading pros and cons on the Twinings English Breakfast K-cups, I decided to take my chances (based on brand name and favorable reviews).  I was very pleasantly surprised that the taste and brew strength of the tea are of the best quality ... especially for a decaffeinated blend.  I've made numerous cups and never once had the problem of tea leaves seeping through the k-cup, as mentioned by some reviewers. It's a great way to make a quick cup of tea and I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Tea Time for a Pregnant Woman and Her Man
review/text: My wife and I are big fans of the Keurig K-cup system mostly for the fact that you can get a consistent tasting cup of tea or coffee in under a minute (Ours is always on, so no warm up time).  It saves us about 2.5 minutes per day of unnecessary steeping time.  That adds up to over 15 hours a year for each of us!  That's 15 hours for each of us to fall in love all over again with the rich bold flavor of this decaffeinated english breakfast brew which is a favorite of my wife during pregnancy.

I was so disappointed when they arrived because the tea leaves must be too tiny as they end up coming out of the k-cup during brewing and you end up with almost the entire k-cup of tea leaves floating in your tea cup.  YUK.  I am so disappointed.  I wish someone would come up with a good decaf k-cup of english breakfast tea... please!

review/text: We really enjoy the Twinings k-cups.  I'm a casual tea drinker and I think it's a really good cup of tea, and there's no wait for water to boil and for the tea to steep.  My wife is pretty particular about her tea and she quite likes it as well, but feels that there's no beating making tea the old fashion way.  So, not quite as good loose tea or bagged tea, but certainly a lot more convenient and a lot quicker.

review/summary: K-Cups are great for more than just coffee
review/text: I was a bit skeptical at first that my wonderful K-Cup machine could produce a great cup of tea.  I am a huge fan of the coffee I brew with it, but tea can be tricky to brew sometimes.<br /><br />I have to admit that after I tried two sips I was in heaven.  I wouldn't have been able to tell you that it wasn't brewed on the stove top.  The tea tastes just as good as the bagged version, and the fact that I can drink it in less than 2 minutes creates a total winning package for me.

review/summary: Very weak compared to the regular Twinings English Breakfast
review/text: My wife drinks the caffeinated Twinings English Breakfast Tea on the largest Keurig setting almost five times a day.  I accidentally ordered the decaf version and she has been trying to drink these at night instead of the regular.  Unfortunately, whatever the process that is used to remove the caffeine from the tea leaves this K-Cup extremely weak and watery.  To her, the lowest setting is comparable to the medium or high settings on the regular English Breakfast.  If you're a serious tea drinker like my wife and you need a decaf tea, you might want to try a smaller box or some other brands before buying 50 of these.
