review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: Putting aside all of the "Vigorate," "Rejuve" and "Awaken" marketing, Trident Vitality is a pretty solid chewing gum.<br /><br />The peppermint flavoring is not as intense as other gums (there's not a huge spike in flavor when you first bite in that quickly dissipates), but its flavor does last a while.<br /><br />The gum itself is fluffier than most other gums. That is, it's not as tough and dense as other brands like Orbit and Eclipse.<br /><br />I received the gum as a free sample, but I would definitely buy it.

review/summary: Great *Flavor* But It's Just Gum!
review/text: Although the TRIDENT VITALITY AWAKEN GUM does contain Ginseng extract, according to the label, it's still just gum. I didn't feel alert or awakened, but the flavor did last for awhile.<br /><br />TRIDENT VITALITY is peppermint flavored and tastes really good. There's no bitter or strange herbal taste and each piece of gum is sugar-free. They're also soft and easy to chew. They come 9-pieces to a pack, and each is in its own blister for freshness.<br /><br />While chewing, the gum didn't stick to my fillings, crown, or dental implant, so that's a plus.<br /><br />Again, if you're looking for something to wake-you-up you'll have to keep looking because TRIDENT VITALITY won't do it. But it's a great tasting gum, but a little on the pricey side. You can get more packs and pieces with the same taste and same effect (none) by buying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOUYGQ">Trident White Gum, Peppermint, 12-Piece Packages (Pack of 12)</a>; plus it's about two-dollars cheaper.<br /><br />I'm being generous by giving 4-stars and that's for taste. Remember, you're paying for the added Ginseng but it's in such small amounts that even if it did have an effect you'd have to chew two or three packs to actually feel anything. Stick with coffee or Red Bull for energy pick-ups.

review/summary: Steam is coming out my nose!
review/text: Lol!  That's what my 10-year-old daughter had to say about this gum when she tried it. :)<br /><br />Anyway, as for me, the flavor is great and lasts longer than I typicallly chew gum (it's a moderately strong peppermint).  I will admit that it's a little softer than I typically like, if that makes sense.<br /><br />The added gensing seems gimicky - but I've never gotten the advertised boost from any dosage of gensing.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend trying this gum if you like peppermint flavor.  It really is pretty good.

review/summary: A Great Place to Start
review/text: I very seldom prepare a soup from dry mix without additions, and this is no exception.  I diced a large onion, and about 6" length of cajun sausage,  and sauteed them lightly before adding the water. Once the water was boiling and the mix was stirred in and beginning to thicken I added 8 ounces of tomato sauce, about 1/3 pound raw shrimp without shells (from my freezer), and 1/2 cup extra raw rice.  Popped on the lid and let it simmer for the recommended time, and it was a very good result. Hubby, who is VERY sensitive to salt content, did not have any criticism of "too salty".  If you like a semi-instant soup I would give this a very good recommendation.

review/summary: AMAZING FLAVOR!!  Excellent Candy w/all natural ingredients!
review/text: Since our daughter was diagnosed with food allergies, our friends now think of us as the "all natural" family with some funky alternative things in their diet.  One day when we were at the zoo with about 10 friends, we gave our daughter one of these (her "safe" lollipops) and though the friends are always suspicious of our foods, their kids were all clamoring for lollipops, so they all tried some.  Every single adult and child said they were, HANDS DOWN, the BEST lollipops they have ever eaten!!  These things are delicious and you can feel good about giving them to your kids after you read the ingredients.  Our candy options are limited, but we are so grateful to Yummy Earth.  I only wish we could get on a commission program with their company because we give these out all the time and people all become ardent fans and purchasers!  LOL  We love all of the flavors they offer.  I had never tried their hard candies, but we did finally order some, so I will review those after we have a chance to taste them.

review/summary: Perfect Pops!
review/text: Wow! For some reason I feel like I'm really getting a special treat when I open one of these lollypops, which stand out from the mass-produced candy found at most grocery stores. The Pomegranate Pucker is my favorite out of all the different flavors YummyEarth makes, followed by the Grape and then Cherry, so I just buy the single-flavor bags now instead of slogging through the flavors I'm not as interested in. What I like best about the Pomegranate flavor is that it's sweet and tart, but it's not so acidic that you start to worry about burning a hole in your tongue. I also really like that when the pops wear down, they don't become super sharp and cut my tongue. If you're a fan of pomegranates and like candy like Jolly Ranchers, prepare to be amazed by this set!

Coming from someone who likes really hot food, I wouldn't classify this as `really hot'...  Probably not even `pretty hot'. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would maybe give it a 4. Don't get me wrong, this popcorn has decent flavor, and a slight bit of kick to it. If you are looking to try `really hot' popcorn, I would try Dave's Insanity Popcorn. But if you are looking to try something new, and aren't necessarily looking for something really hot, give it a try!

This is definitely easier and keeps things more consistent especially when you are asking a friend or family member to pop some for you.  The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because the price is a little high for popcorn, but for me its worth it.

review/text: I fear that I must report that my experiences with this product mirrored another reviewer's here.  I too ordered this stuff through a local store, for a party I was giving.  It arrived and it was a complete disaster.  My friend and I tried some (thank goodness) before the event and it was horrible.  I am not sure what they did to this poor fish, but what ever it was should be illegal.  There was a definite overwhelming after taste that took four brushings and a half a bottle of Listerine to somewhat erase.  It had sort of a chemical flavor to it.  The fish was very poorly prepared and had the consistency of mush smothering corn husks.  I fed a portion to the five feral cats that live on our street and they would have nothing to do with it either.  Now this is not a lot of money for this product, but you certainly would expect more.

review/text: I love salmon.  Fresh salmon, smoked salmon, any kind of salmon.  So I was pretty psyched when I ordered the Norwegian Hot Smoked Peppered Salmon from the Gourmet Food Store.  Unfortunately, this salmon should have stayed in Norway.  It was terrible. Dry in the middle, overly moist on the edges, it formed a gummy paste with every bite.  Add to the fact that while it had some kind of colored sprinkles on top it was, by no stretch of the imagination "hot" or peppered.  (Smoked yes.  I'm still tasting the overwhelming smoke flavor and I'm sure I will be tasting it for the next few days...)  Especially for the price, this salmon is a terrible disappointment.

review/summary: I really like Dalfour Fruit Spreads
review/text: We started buying the berry flavors of Dalfour about a year ago.  I find the flavor very good, although sometimes a little subdued (because it's not packed with sugar).  Just like the other reviewer, Jean, I also use these to satisfy my cravings for sweets, but they make good PBJ sandwiches too.<br /><br />Personally, I like the texture better than most jams.  Notice that whole fruit (raspberries) is listed as the first ingredient.  That means the product contains more fruit than any other ingredient.  Many other so-called 100% fruit spreads contain various fruit juice concentrates as the first one or two ingredients, meaning little real fruit is in the actual product.  As long as the ingredients are derived from fruit (eg, juice concentrate, pectin), they're still able to call it "100% fruit".<br /><br />So, with these Dalfour spreads I know I get something pretty good (but I do like my sugary jams like Bonne Maman maybe a little too much).

review/summary: Loaded with sugars and contains undeclared fats; not a health food
review/text: People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the "Fat Free" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type "snackwell devil food nutrition facts" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that "Fat Free" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other "health-conscience" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore "helpful review" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics.

review/text: I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.  I thought that was kinda "iffy", and the cookies were a bit worn (they had that patina of old chocolate), but they were edible, so, okay.  In April, the expiration date was sometime in the far future (September or October of 2011), so I figured the March shipment was a fluke.  In May, the expiration date was *again* 12 March 2011!!  They were PAST expiration.<br /><br />Of course, I'm a carb freak so that didn't stop me from eating them, but, C'MON!!  I'm almost scared to get my next shipment.

review/summary: Repeat Purchase - Great Deal!
review/text: I think that these cookies are a great deal through Amazon, because the packages are the exact same size and count as the ones sold at our hospital, where we spend far too much time. I'd suggest this bulk purchase to anybody who wants to break free of the $1.25 to $1.75 per pack that a vending machine or the cafeteria will wring out of you...even a convenience store gets right around that same amount, too, so again, just about the best price I can find!!!! =)

review/summary: Yummy cookies
review/text: I remember seeing these cookies and imagining how nasty they must taste. I tempted myself into trying some and was quite delighted. Granted, they are not the best cookies (that title belongs to Keebler's Soft Batch) but they are certainly an excellent substitute for those who like to eat cookies and not worry too much about weight. They're quite expensive at the stores (between $3.5-4.5 a box) so I ordered them in bulk from Amazon which bought per box cost down to $2.50.

review/summary: Not a ringer for Nabisco!
review/text: I can't speak for anyone else, but I am most definitely not a spokesperson for Nabisco!  I love these cookies.  They are super yummy,not too sweet, not too "blah."  They do not taste like a "diet" cookie.  I like these as well, probably better, than your normal, everyday "who cares about weight" cookie.<br /><br />I will say this.  I am not a fan of marshmallow.  I don't like marshmallow peeps, marshmallow in cookies, marshmallow "moon pies," any of that. I DO however, like the marshmallow in these cookies.  So that said, it means the marshmallow in the Snackwells is very different than what you find in the above-mentioned snack/sweets.  Therefore if you do like the peeps, moonpies, etc., you may or may not like the Snackwells.  However, the marshmallow is such a small part of this cookie, I don't think it will matter.  The star of this show is the fudgy chocolate.<br /><br />For the person who felt the cookies were bad, I wonder if there could have been a small hole in the packaging and they were, in fact, stale.  I don't typically have any sitting around long enough to go stale, but when I do, they do lose their positive attributes!<br /><br />I think my only "complaint" about this cookie is the fact they are so good, I end up eating too many, taking away any advantage of the fewer calories they contain.

review/text: American-styled beef jerky like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P38XPE">Pemmican</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026W9U2E">Oberto</a> are typically chewy, dry and salty, but Chinese-styled jerky is much softer and far less salty tasting. This particular brand is tenderized and flavored with fruit juices, and is moist inside the bag. The meat is very juicy and tender, with a nice, but not overpowering, note of sweetness to it. It's not sour, as the description erroneously says. Also please disregard the strange Genmaicha Green Tea inset in the photo. It's obviously a mistake. Reviewer Mary is right that it should be about $1 an ounce, or maybe just slightly more due to inflation.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this product if you've never tasted Chinese-styled beef jerky. It is an excellent and tasty treat. The spicy fruit flavored variety is also fantastic and even better than this one if you like a bit of kick. You might also like Chinese-styled pork jerky such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VH8278">Formosa Pork Jerky Original Flavor-16 Oz</a>, a popular brand in Chinese grocery stores and supermarkets.

I also like that purchasing the coffee helps to plant trees in Ecuador. And I like that the packaging is not too bulky, is simple and can be recycled. the only improvement for me would be if this company produced a coffee which had more floral notes. That's my personal favorite. But overall it's a win win!

review/summary: Great Cat Food For Those Kitties With A Sensitive Tummy
review/text: I used to feed both of my cats a different brand name cat food that was supposed to be for those kitties with sensitive tummies, and it was okay, but this Pinnacle cat food has the other brand beat hands down.<br /><br />We have been feeding our cats this food for about a year now and we have been having a lot fewer instances of upset tummies compared to the incidents we were having prior to switching over to this brand of cat food.<br /><br />Both of our cats love it even though only one of them has a sensitive tummy issue. Initially, it took a couple of weeks of mixing the old cat food with the new Pinnacle cat food and then slowly eliminated the old cat food until they were just eating the new Pinnacle cat food. Now my cat will stick his head in the bowl and eat a hole to the bottom before working his way around the edges of the bowl. Quite funny to watch actually! Ha Ha Ha<br /><br />My other cat is a strange one indeed, he will get a mouthful of food and then walk a couple of steps away from the bowl, drop the food onto the ground and the proceed to eat it from the ground. Not quite sure what is going on with that.<br /><br />Anyhow, I would highly recommend this brand of cat food for your kitty if he or she has a sensitive tummy. And don't worry about the price; it is an investment in the health of your furry four-legged children, as all of us good parents know. And if you haven't already purchased one of these for your kitty <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000L3XYZ4">Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain</a>, be sure and do so, it is the absolute best cat water fountain on the market at this time.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover

review/summary: Amazing food for cats with sensitive digestive system
review/text: My ten month old cat was switched from dry kitten food to dry adult food (Science Diet) He immediately developed bloody diahhrea. I took him to the vet. She gave him a clean bill of health and guessed it might be a dietary problem. I tried him on a few different brands of dry food,  most containing corn or brewer's rice and chicken. No Improvement in his condition. I then found Pinnacle dry cat food. I noticed no corn or rice in this food. I fed it to my cat and it was amazing. Within 12 hours his diahhrea was gone. If your cat has a sensitive system, I would strongly urge you to try the Pinnacle dry cat food. It is a bit expensive, but worth every penny for the health and well being of your cat.

review/summary: Expected better quality
review/text: We have two cats and we were feeding them with "Advanced Pet Diets Select Choice" food but unfortunately it was discontinued so we had to research for another great product. We were recommended this cat food by several people who know what the ingredients suppose to be in it and because this food is made by the same company so we expected same quality.When we got it and opened the bag we noticed different smell (not very pleasant ) and that this food is very dry( the old one was kinda oily ) and both cats didn't like it at all, sometime they don't even want to come and eat it even they are hungry. Now we will have to donate this food to the pet shelter but we learn the lesson, the only way to find the right food is not just by reading the ingredients but buying samples and give them to the pets.

It's tough to evaluate the health of the food when I'm not a vet, but it seems to have decent ingredients: the first two ingredients are Chicken Meal and Chicken, versus Friskies where you have to go three ingredients in to get to chicken by-product meal, and way down the list to even get to something with the word "meat" in it (meat and bone meal).<br /><br />At least as importantly, my cats eat it.  I won't say that they love it the same way they love the Friskies: I can harass Purina for their ingredients, but I don't think anything healthy will really ever match Friskies for taste!  I guess it's sort of like hot dogs versus a chicken breast on whole wheat bread with low-fat mayonaisse.  But I'd rather keep my little kitties around for as long as I can, even if the food doesn't taste all that great.

The noodles must be washed in a large screen or collandar with very hot water for several minutes to remove a somewhat fishy smell.  Drain the noddles well and then cut them several times in a bowl with a dinner knife and fork so they are not so long. Get "O" brand organic garlic marinara sauce at Vons and pour half the container (180 calories) over the contents of the entire bag...add a little Kraft parmesian/romano shaker cheese on top and you have a meal which is only about 220 calories...slightly rubbery but acceptable...enjoy!

review/text: My local BevMo used to carry this.  I loved it and would buy it regularly.  But, apparently not regularly enough as they stopped carrying it and there is nowhere else around here that carries it.  So, it has become the holy grail for me.  I have no interest in wimpy canada dry or schweppes ginger ales.  This is the kind of ginger brew you want them to use in a good "Dark and Stormy" and the little bit of "heat" really gives it that extra kick.<br /><br />If the idea of a hearty ginger brew appeals to you, you've got to try this. As some carbonated beverage company used to say, it's the real thing.

Although this tea would go down fine at any time of year, I love it best in winter when its fruity spiciness heats me from the inside so I can endure the bitter New England weather.<br /><br />Be aware that you can buy this tea for $2.99 (and sometimes, on sale, for $1.99) per box on the Twinings web site.

review/text: I found the curry powder to be very good. I wish there could be a bit less cinnamon. The price because of the large quantity, was much better than those little bottles at the grocery stores.

review/text: This flavor is delicious!  I used it in the crockpot with chicken breasts and it came out great.  It has a nice smoky flavor like a good BBQ sauce, and is a little spicy too which makes up for the lack of sodium in it.  Excellent product, it makes eating healthy very easy!

review/text: The water didn't seem crisp or refreshing. The bottles were pretty and very interesting though. I would rather have something that looks great and tastes great also. Still on the search for the perfect tasting water. I would recommend this for parties, but not for need. The amount is mighty small, and might leave you thirsty for more water.

review/summary: good
review/text: I work at CVS and whenever someone buys this water bottle, it's because of how appealing the bottle actually looks rather than the water. These come in two different types of bottle, one being glass and other being plastic. This one is a plastic bottle. Don't get me wrong, the plastic bottle still looks beautiful and is very sturdy, it's not your average poland spring bottle. Aside from the looks, the taste of the water is no different than Poland Spring or Nestle bottled water. These usually sell for $1.60 at CVS so, this price online is kind of high. If you really want to try this water, or just want the bottle for the look and future use, just go to a local drugstore or grocery and pick one up. It will be much cheaper and you will get to see and feel the bottle in person to see if it's for you. Overall, it's a good buy and offers a very appealing bottle but the taste is pretty much the same as any other bottled water. I personally bought a bottle because it is so sturdy and I can refill it for everyday use, plus the appealing presentation of the bottle doesn't hurt either.

review/summary: Labrada has great customer service
review/text: This product came to my door from Amazon and when tasted it had small clumps in it, definitely something was wrong.  The product was within date, so I called Labrada and talked to their costumer service.  They told me that it was nothing to be alarmed, that it was due to the protein coming into contact with cold temperature, and it was probably caused during shipping.<br /><br />Labrada immediately shipped me out a brand new box and the new box was perfect.<br /><br />It's really nice when a company provides great customer service.  I was worried because I bought it off Amazon instead of a retail store, but they said that was fine and they would still honor their product.

review/summary: Great nutrition, awful taste
review/text: Nutrition-wise, these were everything I was looking for in a meal replacement on the go. High protein, extremely low carb, with 1/5 of your daily nutrients, these are fantastic.<br /><br />But sadly, the taste was pretty bad.  I bought them because they came up as a crazy good deal - $16 shipped for 12 RTDs is really amazing.  However, the flavor is pretty bad.  The fake banana flavor isn't so bad, it's the terrible taste that the vitamin and mineral mix has.  Seems like it's something that some people taste more than others, but to me it tasted like I bit into a multivitamin.  It finishes with a really sickly fake sweetener taste that lingers along with the vitamin taste. I don't get that with most protein powders or RTDs, this one comes through far more than I've tasted before.<br /><br />It is definitely better cold than warm. I'll probably try them in coffee like the reviewer who loves them, to see if they are at all palatable to me that way.  I hate to waste, but as is, consuming these would be like taking medicine, rather that actually eating.

review/summary: Very strong chemical taste. Wont buy again...
review/text: I was very let down by these drinks. The Atkins and Slimfast low carb shakes taste fine. However, there was something very wrong with these. There is a very strong chemical taste to these shakes and it doesnt taste like banana at all... These shakes also dont mix well either. As much as I shake them, theres still small chunks of something as I get toward the bottom of the shake and its pretty unpleasant.<br /><br />Im giving them 2 stars since I will try to finish the case I bought, though Im going to have to use them in a blender with other ingredients to cover up the taste. Really defeats the purpose of "on the go" when you have to drink them at home only.

review/text: Lay's Natural chips are excellent. I love the way they taste, how crisp they are and that I don't get a bad aftertaste like I do other brands (with all the preservatives). That being said, Lay's Natural Ruffles are my fave and are actually stronger (do not break as easily) than the thick cut.<br /><br />FYI - these chips typically retail for around $3.50 an 8.5 oz bag. So keep that in mind when purchasing! :)

review/summary: I've Given My Heart To These Pepperidge Farm Cookies !!!
review/text: Pepperidge Farm has a long history of making premium quality cookies; and these "Chessmen" butter cookies are certainly no exception. They contain no artificial flavors, no preservatives and they are crunchy but oh, so wonderfully smooth as you roll them around in your mouth before you swallow them. Awesome!<br /><br />Another reviewer notes that they are aesthetically pleasing; and that reviewer is correct. The cookies have four chessmen on them--you get the rook, the bishop, the queen and the knight--this enhances the appeal of the product. Yes, chess players will love that; but just about anyone who enjoys a good cookie can appreciate these butter cookies. Even if butter cookies aren't your personal favorite, you will fall for these ones--they're THAT good!<br /><br />The cookies are kosher, if that matters to you; and they are certainly designed tastefully enough that you can serve them as snacks for any company you may have visiting you. One caveat, however--these cookies do contain sugar and some fat; and the sugar could convert to extra fat in your body if you are not too active. If sugar and/or fat content pose dietary concerns for you then I would ask a doctor before eating these cookies.<br /><br />Overall, obviously, these cookies are just about the best and they will remain some of the best because of the classic Pepperidge Farm high level of quality control. Buy a bag or two and enjoy some tonight!  SMILES

review/text: We were out grocery shopping the other day and, for some reason, the Chessmen cookies called out to me. Usually, I'm not a fan of crunchy cookies, even if they ARE from the delectable Pepperidge Farm bakery.<br /><br />But I decided to try these buttery treats and let me tell you...I am not disappointed! (In fact, I'm munching on them right now.) They are so buttery--so melt in your mouth--they'd be *perfect* with coffee, tea, or hot chocolate--but I tend to snatch them when I need a snack because I haven't eaten all day. (I know...bad habit!)<br /><br />And, this may sound corny, they are beautiful to look at! Not only do these cookies have a raised chess emblem on the front, but they are also washed with eggwhites. (I can tell because of the glistening, golden color!)<br /><br />Rook, Bishop, Queen and Knight--they're all here in buttery brilliance!<br /><br />So if you're in the mood for a fantastic butter cookie, you will LOVE Chessmen from Pepperidge Farm. (And if your favorite soldier or student loves chess--and cookies--this would make a great addition to any care package!)

I don't like him getting empty calories, and most juice is just that. This has some nutrients but isn't too large. He gets a little sweetness, but not too much.

review/summary: Maybe I am missing something here
review/text: I am a huge Keurig and k-cup fan, so I couldn't wait to try the new iced coffee line. Well, maybe it's me but I can't find any difference between this iced coffee and making it with a standard k-cup.  The instructions say to brew one of the smaller size cups of hot coffee into an ice filled cup.  Of course the ice melts and dilutes the coffee, just as it would if you used a standard k-cup.  I used to do that whenever I wanted iced coffee so I don't see any reason to use a special "iced coffee" k-cup.  I am going to give Green Mountain the benefit of the doubt here and assume I am missing something, because I wouldn't like to think this is a marketing scam from GM.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: This item is just OK.  It does make a 16 ounce glass of iced coffee, however it could be stronger both in the vanilla and the coffee.

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: When I bought these k-cups, I was expecting creamy vanilla l, STRONF iced coffee. The ice obviously melts in about twos minutes and becomes unbelievable diluted. I cannot taste any vanilla whatsoever. The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because if you add some flavored creamer, it tastes a LITTLE better. Definitely never buying this again and will never refer it as iced coffee to anyone. With that said, the regular green mountain k-cups are always very satisfying

review/summary: Watered Down, BUY DONUT SHOP ICED COFFEE
review/text: Bought a box of these and liked it. Then I tried the " Donut shop Sweet and Creamy Regular Iced Coffee" and that is 3x better than this one. The best way to get perfect iced coffee is:<br /><br />Brew over 6oz water setting. Fill the cup 1/2 with ice and add the dairy creamer. Brew it and then add the sugar and mix. Put in freezer for about 10 minutes and sti again and there you have a perfect Iced coffee!!

review/summary: Why Would You Buy This?
review/text: *SAMPLE PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURER*<br /><br />I have to agree with most all of the reviewers here.  There is no way that an unflavored non-iced coffee wouldn't work as well or even better than using this flavored product.  I used the 6 oz.cup size to prepare this, and I was amazed at how flavorless and watered down this product was even before  adding my cream and sugar.<br /><br />I can small the vanilla scent but I cannot taste it and there is no sweetness to this product.
