review/summary: Birthing Miracle Tea
review/text: I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

review/text: I usually dont like black herbal tea, but this one i was able to sip on the whole cup without making a face. It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past. The Rose flavour is the best. How much it really calms u, god only knows, but the pleasure is unbeatable.

review/text: This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.

review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

review/text: I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/summary: Fenugreek Seed Tea
review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

review/summary: Nasty tea debris everywhere!
review/text: When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/summary: Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes
review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms.  I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.  I have purchased other teas of this brand.  I would recommend their teas.  I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion.  It's a little bitter but bearable.  Add some sugar and you're good to go.

review/summary: Interesting taste
review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually.

review/text: I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/summary: ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE, VERY DISAPPOINTING :-(
review/text: I love this time of the year (Autumn/Fall) and love the immense variety of pumpkin food products that are available.  To name a few: Pumpkin Ice Cream, Pumpkin Bread and Muffins, Pumpkin Pie, Pumpkin Spice Latte (coffee), Pumpkin Cheesecake, etc. etc.  I recently started adding canned pumpkin to our Sunday morning pancakes, and was delighted with the results; however, I wanted a stronger pumpkin taste/flavor.  I found this product and excitedly ordered two bottles.  It arrived very quickly (within 3 days), and I just tried it this morning in our pancakes.  The flavor DOES NOT taste like pumpkin whatsoever.  It tastes like a chemical and leaves a bad taste in my mouth, literally.  I dumped both bottles down the sink and had to throw away the pancakes.  I was not able to eat them, they were terrible.  I was actually nauseated after trying to eat them.  I'm not a picky eater and have no allergies whatsoever.  I'm the type of person that will eat nearly everything, and cannot think of any food that I don't like.  I'm going to continue my search for a "NATURAL" TRUE pumpkin extract; however, this is definitely not it.  I hope this helps you, especially if you're as passionate about pumpkin flavor as I am. Happy Holidays to You and Yours.  Sincerely, Tim

Perfect when you're craving something sweet, great when you're feeling nauseous.  I don't have any kids, I bought these for myself and have given packs away to friends who were very happy to receive them.  A big plus for being organic and for not leaving a weird aftertaste in your mouth.  All the flavors included in these packs - Mango Tango, Pomegranate Pucker, Tooberry Blueberry and Wet-Face Watermelon, were equally tasty.  Some reviewers criticized the fact that these are made in Mexico - what's up with that?  Nothing.  These are simply the best lollipops out there!!!

review/text: I actually found this product at my local grocery store (Weis).  It was a bit more expensive than amazon at 4.29 a box but I figured what the heck, I MUST find out if this is a good mix or not.  I have a wheat allergy but not all gluten bothers me so I have more options than some people.  I have tried many mixes and recipes, just wheat free and totally gluten free.  I am VERY happy to say that these cookies taste just like a "regular" chocolate chip cookies.  They are the best I have come across from a mix or a recipe.  They are not gritty or funny tasting.  They are divine.  If you live wheat or gluten free I"m sure you have said at one time or another "that's not bad for being wheat/gluten free".  There is no need to say such a thing about these cookies.  I doubt most people would be able to tell you that it was not a regular old pilsbury or tollhouse cookie.  They are slightly more crumbly than a traditional cookie but it does not affect the quality or flavor of the cookies.  Try them! You will like them for sure!!!!

review/summary: Not my favorite, but the wheat lovers liked it
review/text: I have Celiac disease and cannot eat gluten at all or I get terribly ill. This cookie mix DID NOT make me sick at all.  It is 100% gluten free and safe for Celiacs! That is a great thing for all of us on gluten-free diets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, thought the cookies did not make me ill, I will not be buying them again. Frankly, I did not enjoy these cookies. What I like are fluffy soft, cookies, that have no greasy residue. Betty Crockers cookies come out chewy in the middle, crispy on the edges, and a little greasy.  Therefore, I prefer Cause You're So Special's chocolate chip cookies and will be buying those instead.<br /><br />On the positive side though, all the wheat lovers in the house ate the cookies up and loved them.  So, even though I do not like them, the cookies were close enough to the original that the wheat lovers were delighted.

review/summary: Best gluten free cookies I've had!
review/text: Like most of the reviewers already pointed out, these cookies rock!  All of my friends and family have tolerated my attempts at making gluten-free baked goods, and they were extremely pleasantly surprised by these cookies.  They said they couldn't even tell they were gluten-free (and they are brutally honest).<br /><br />The Betty Crocker website has a product locator, which I don't think is working for this product, since I did buy them at the store, and no stores actually appeared after I searched using my address.  If you don't want to use butter, there are alternative recipes on the website that use oil.

review/text: These cookies are buttery and delicious! Just like the old tollhouse ones...maybe a little more buttery tasting. I would definitely recommend buying this product. Its wonderful to have on hand to whip up a quick batch of GF cookies and the dough freezes well if you don't want all the cookies at once. Try mixing in a little shredded coconut for something different. Delicious!

review/summary: Awesome Cookies!
review/text: These are incredibly easy and oh so good!  Best of all, our 13 yr old daughter can bake them herself.  She uses a sheet of parchment paper on the bottom of the cookie pan and allows the pan to cool completely after baking.  The result is a perfectly shaped cookie that stores well without crumbling.  These are every bit as good as traditional choc chip cookies and worth buying again. Thank you Betty Crocker!

review/summary: Great cookies, thank you Betty Crocker
review/text: These cookies are good, chewy and have great flavor.  Next time I may try baking a slightly shorter time than recommended, as mine were a little too brown around the edges but otherwise, perfect.  My son (who does not have celiac) thought that they were fantastic and was disappointed the day after I made them when I had finished them off!  I just couldn't stop after missing good, fresh from the over cookies for years.<br /><br />I noticed a few negative reviews here from people who have not tried the products!  Shockingly, there is even one from someone plugging her own gluten free bakery and then hypocritically criticizing others for getting on the "gluten free bandwagon" since there are "bucks to be made"! Well, it turns out that perhaps the larger manufacturer has the research money and testing facilities to get the taste RIGHT.  This mix (along with the yellow cake mix) is better than nearly all of the specialty mixes I have tried.  It is sad how many pans of cakes, brownies, blondies and cookies I have tossed in the garbage because they were inedible.<br /><br />Thank you Betty Crocker (General Mills) for making a very high-quality gluten free mix available in my regular grocery store!

review/summary: easy and tasty
review/text: I give these cookies 5 stars because the recipe was so easy, compared to many other gluten free mixes that have lots of additions and many steps, this recipe basically has 2 steps, mix the wet ingredients then add the mix.<br /><br />The flavor was good, the rice flour does give it a bit of a gritty texture but it's not much. I think this mix would benefit from refrigerating the dough for an hour or so because the cookies were a bit flat, I have some in the fridge that I will try and see if the refrigeration makes a difference.

review/text: When making these cookies, I would change the directions given on the box by adding "Wait until cookies are cool to the touch before removing from the cookie sheet"  Two minutes was not long enough to wait, and the first batch of cookies that I made crumbled into a tasty pile of crumbs.  Cookies tasted great, and had only mild aftertaste (a bit powdery, but not unpleasant).  Might be better with a glass of milk to chase them down :)

review/text: As the husband of a Celiac, I've been subjected to a WIDE array of gluten-free products in the never-ending quest to find food that tastes like "normal" food. Let me tell you, these cookies are indistinguishable from cookies made with regular flour! Wow!<br /><br />They have all the great characteristics of a tried-and-true, classic chocolate chip cookie... chewy not brittle, moist not dry, smooth not gritty, flexible not crumbly, and plenty of chocolate chips!!<br /><br />If Betty Crocker can do the same magic with other products as they've done with these, they will REVOLUTIONIZE the gluten-free industry!!<br /><br />These should get 6 stars out of 5!!!

review/text: I just made and tried Betty Crocker's Gluten Free Chocolate Chip Cookie mix.  (I used butter as directed.) The cookies turned out chewy on the middle and crispy on the edges.  Perfect. The amount of chocolate chips in the mix seemed just right.  I often make Nestle Toll House cookies for my family.  These Betty Crocker cookies tasted and looked just like the Toll House ones which my family has always loved. The gluten free cookies were delicious-no  bad odor or after taste like many gluten-free mixes have.  I can't wait to try the other gluten free products by Betty Crocker.  If you love chocolate chip cookies, you won't be disappointed.  Very easy to make and great to eat!!

review/summary: crumbly with odd aftertaste
review/text: I love Betty Crocker GF mixes, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, I found it to have kind of an odd aftertaste, and the cookies just didn't hold together for me at all. I tried it using crisco grease, then again tried it using butter, then even tried it using cooking oil, but the cookies just spread out too thin no matter what I did. I tried removing them from the parchment paper warm and removing them completely cooled -- no difference. They just fall apart.  Makes a good ice cream topping, or great for using as a creative decoration on top of a birthday cake, though.

review/text: I totally agree with those expressing their requests for more ingredient information.  There are so many gluten-free products on the market now because it's "popular" to do so and bucks can be made.  I recently opened a wheat-free, gluten-free bakery because most commercial products take short-cuts and include ingredients which should not be combined, even if they are wheat-free & gluten-free.  Also, most commercial gluten-free products contain a ton of sugar.  Please be very selective and pay attention to how your body responds - you can learn to do that even before you eat something.

Received mine through Amazon yesterday and promptly made them up as directed.  Super easy to prepare, directions clear, but flavor was just average and texture grainy (the rice flour used in the mix is not a very fine grind).  Must say that my standard GF chocolate chip cookies using Karen Robertson's "Cooking Gluten Free" recipe, page 184, and "Wendy Wark's Gluten Free flour mix", is in my opinion far superior.  But, for friends who wish to mix up a batch of cookies for my child without a lot of fuss, this Betty Crocker Chip Cookie Mix would be just the right product.

review/summary: Yummy out of the oven, but crumble after cooling
review/text: I purchased Betty Crocker's Gluten Free Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix from my local Wal-Mart and was super excited to try them, as I just recently went gluten free and haven't found a good cookie yet.<br /><br />They were easy to make, just like "normal" cookies, and the house smelled wonderful while they were cooking. I almost cried when I took the first bite because they were SO GOOD!! They were perfect, warm, and soft in the middle with a little crispy around the edges. I couldn't have asked for a better cookie!<br /><br />However, when I pulled one out the next day to have another cookie, I was so sad to see it crumble in my hand. I had to pick up the crumbs and throw most of them away as they were so dry I couldn't eat them. They just kind of dissolved when I picked them up and didn't hold together.<br /><br />All in all, these cookies are WONDERFUL straight out of the oven, but they seem to really dry out when they cool and are pretty useless as decent cookies afterward. I may buy this mix again, only if I have enough people to eat all of them straight out of the oven. I won't make them for myself, though, as I'll end up throwing away 75% of the cookies after they cool.

review/summary: Delicious Near-Instant Chocolate Chip Cookies
review/text: The best thing about this mix is it's fast and easy. Everything you need to know is on the back of the box. You don't have to measure anything. All it takes is 1 stick of butter, 1 egg, and a splash of vanilla extract. And you can actually go without the vanilla if you don't have any handy. With a bit of quick kitchen maneuvering (preheat the oven and get cookie sheets ready before you mix the dough), you can have the first batch of gluten free cookies in 15 minutes. That's not bad considering it will take at least 15 minutes to go pick up a box at the local store (if you have one down the street) when a craving hits and there is absolutely nothing to snack on in the house.<br />The taste is not completely homemade. Maybe it's mental, but I think all boxed stuff has a "BOXED" taste. But it is warm and freshly baked and you get that nice sweet aroma in the house. I don't recommend eating the cookies directly out of the oven because the GF dough needs to cool and set a bit longer than regular wheat dough. Instructions on the box indicate that a 2 minute cooling period is required. I think it's wise to follow those orders. I let mine sit a little longer.<br />The raw dough doesn't taste as good as regular cookie dough. The rice/potato flour mix is quite grainy and the dough itself is crumbly. I would not attempt to add it to my ice cream.<br />The recipe calls for butter. You CAN substitute with margarine but butter tastes a lot better.<br />I just made a box this afternoon. I followed the directions. I made 24 (3-inch) cookies and baked them for 10 minutes because I like my cookies brown and toasty with crispy edges. You don't have to brown them as much. The recipe say 8-10 minutes. I let them cool for 5 minutes then ate 3 with milk. Yum!

review/summary: They will do in a pinch, but I really wanted to love them.
review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac less than two months ago, so I have been without chocoalte chip cookies for a little while.  I was craving them and these were on the grocery shelf (with 'mainstream' baking mixes...hurray for Betty Crocker putting itself out there with gluten-free products!)next to the brownies etc.,  I wish I had eaten more when they were warm.  They don't hold up for long after they have cooled down and you let them sit.  A good idea would be to use only enough dough for the cookies you can eat right away and freeze the rest; then use the rest as you would like to satisfy a craving of your own.  They should be eaten while still warm....when they are at their best.  After they cooled down; the slightly overly sweetness comes through.  Even later, the sweetness has a synthetic taste to it and a grainy texture to it.<br />All-in-all better than others out there, but room for improvement too.

review/text: I had tried the Betty Crocker GF Brownie mix and loved it, so I bought these without testing them first. Silly me... They must be eaten while still warm. If you wait too long, they develop a sandy texture and loose much of their flavor.<br /><br />Just the two of us, so I mix up a batch and roll them into balls. I refrigerate the balls until we feel like warm out of the oven cookies. Then I only bake as many as I know we will eat for that one treat time.

review/summary: Crumbly
review/text: You can produce a picture perfect cookie that will crumble on you with the slightest touch.  Eating the cookie is like eating gritty cookie crumbs with chocolate chips.  Adding milk to the mixture only helps a little.  I still have 4 boxes left to use and I'm experimenting to make a better cookie.

review/summary: Hard to believe these are gluten free!
review/text: These cookies are terrific!  When I first ordered the mixes, I made a batch to take on a trip so I would have a gluten free snack item.  The whole family loved them!  I had to keep hiding them so I would have some for myself.  We have a 'from scratch' gluten free chocolate chip recipe that we really like, but these are better and easier to make.<br /><br />I did have to make an adjustment on the baking time, as they took longer to bake than the instructions said they would, but that was not a problem at all.<br /><br />Our local stores are starting to carry some of the Betty Crocker gluten free mixes, but the prices are MUCH better at Amazon.

review/summary: great flavor, simple to make
review/text: I was very happy to find the Betty Crocker Gluten Free mixes at the local grocery store.  I've recently formed a gluten intolerance, but I do have a sweet tooth.  I have to be careful with soy protein, so many gluten free products are not usable for me as they use soy flour.  These however, do not.  The ingredients from the box are as follows:<br /><br />Rice Flour, Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin vanilla), Brown Sugar, Sugar, Potato Starch, Potato Flour, Leavening (baking soda, sodium acid pyrophosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Salt.<br /><br />I made the cookies per the directions on the box.  Due to the dryness of the mix once everything is together, I found it much easier to mix with my hands rather than with a whisk or a spoon.  Once that was done, I formed the dough in to 18 even sized portions, baked 6, and threw the rest in the freezer so I can pull out a cookie when I feel like having one.<br /><br />The flavor of these cookies is very good.  In fact, my two year old who does not like cookies gobbled these up.  I am giving it a 4 out of 5 though, because the texture is a bit grainy, which means the people in my house that have food texture issues thought they tasted nice, but had problems with the graininess.<br /><br />I think I will definitely buy again just so it is something to have on hand when in need of a sweet treat, especially if the frozen dough comes out nicely.

review/summary: Better with apple sauce
review/text: This was my first time making these cookies and the mix was really crumbly. I cooked one sheet of cookies and before I put rest of the cookie dough on the cookie sheet the 2nd time, I added some apple sauce (cinnamon flavored) until there were no more crumbs. The mix was a little sticky and I cooked them a little longer, but they turned out nice and moist. I will keep using the apple sauce in mine.
