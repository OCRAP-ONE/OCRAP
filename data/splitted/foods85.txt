review/summary: Great for Lemon Iced Tea
review/text: Initially I purchased this in good faith for brewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores. Here's my initial report and impressions:<br /><br />The tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible. The bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport. So a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good. I would hope that in the future Lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you don't have tea leaves all over the place.<br /><br />And as another reviewer mentioned, it is true that this particular brand has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other brands. And as always, you pay for what you get. I didn't expect this to be better than my Jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about $45 and taste fantastic. My goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which I was able to do well with that.<br /><br />Here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testing:<br /><br />-1 Gallon of Lemon Iced Tea-<br /><br />1. 1 Gallon of water<br />2. 5-9 Tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea<br />3. Empty teabags<br />4. 1 cup of sugar<br />5. 1/2 cup of lemon juice<br /><br />Lipton's direction call for 2 tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea to make 1 1/2 quarts of black tea to drink. We know that 4 quarts is equal to 1 gallon, if we used 4 tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with 3 quarts of tea which is short of one gallon. If 2 tablespoons makes 1 1/2 quarts then 1 tablespoon would make about .75 of a quart. So you would need at least a minimum of 5 tablespoons or even about 5 1/4 tablespoons of tea leaves to get your 4 gallons. I would not recommend using more than 9 tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong. Some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to brew your tea but I would have to disagree with that. I thought the tea wasn't strong enough.<br /><br />So go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point. Use between 5-9 tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags. The directions call for brewing your tea for about 3-5 minutes. Being a tea drinker I knew that if I brew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter (yes! tannins are what make your tea bitter). If your water is too hot or you brew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter. Initially I only brewed my tea for about 2 minutes because I was scared that the tea would be bitter if I brewed it too long. But I found that 2 minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. That is enough time to brew the tea without releasing the tannins so Lipton's brewing time was about spot on. After you finish brewing your tea add your 1 cup of sugar and then your lemon juice. I used cane sugar and Hy-Top reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever brand you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want. I did try Real Lemon Juice while at another supermarket but I didn't like it compared to my generic brand of lemon juice by Hy-Top.<br /><br />You probably wanted to know if I actually drank the tea without it being Lemon Iced Tea, and I did. I didn't like it nor would I recommend you drink this tea this way. I just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other brands. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other brands but I just feel that this tea wasn't up to par against other black teas nor do I recommend drinking it as just plain black tea. I particularly like the English Breakfast Black Tea by Stash better than this tea. I just felt that the quality difference was a lot but I didn't feel like buying every bag for $0.09 each every time I went to the supermarket just to brew Lemon Iced Tea. If you want to make lemon iced tea with the Stash brand you need 9 English Breakfast Black Tea bags and the same amount of sugar, lemon juice, and water. Economical wise I would get more tea buying Lipton but if taste matters I would choose another tea brand to make Lemon Iced Tea.<br /><br />I haven't tried making Raspberry Iced Tea with this yet but we'll save that for another adventure.

review/summary: Help, My stomach gets upset with this tea.
review/text: I have always loved Lipton teas. It is a daily habit.  I just bought a automatic tea brewer and loose tea for the first time.  Almost immediately I started getting an upset stomach.  It never occured to me that it could be the tea.  I have never had a problem like this.  After a week of stomach problems, and tring different solutions I finally stopped drinking the tea.  Immediately my stomach was better.  A few days later I started drinking the Lipton loose tea again and immediately my stomach was upset.  I looked on the internet and a few suggested I add a bit of honey and a bit of salt.  I tried that with no success.  Does anyone else have any ideas?  I hate to throw out six boxes of tea.

review/summary: Best iced tea around
review/text: If you want the best iced tea--and most economical tea around, make it from this fabulous Lipton tea.  Add 3 cups of boiling water to 3 tablespoons of tea; seep 3 minutes and pour into 3 cups very cold water. Serve over generous glass of ice cubes. Sugarless tea that needs nothing but maybe some lemon wedges. You can drink for a month on one box of tea! All bottled teas have too much sugar or substitute; this is healthy and I have been drinking it for 40 years!

review/summary: Morning Mainstay
review/text: Can't start the day without a pot of this tea! Loose tea brewed in a "coffeemaker" has been my morning mainstay for decades. Start with cold, filtered water and a scoop (rounded tablespoon) of loose tea per cup into the paper basket filter. Adjust per taste. If you use a machine where coffee had been brewed, it may affect the taste, so use any new machine and keep it just for tea. This makes wonderful iced tea!<br /><br />Loose tea is a broader cut leaf unlike teabags where the leaf is chopped fine. The flavor is much fuller and crisper, like the difference between fresh ground coffee and instant. No messy teabags to contend with. I like glass mugs, as they let the gorgeous color of the tea show through.<br /><br />Some areas may not stock Lipton loose tea in stores, but buying online turned out to be cheaper. Six half-pound boxes arrived in two days. A box will last me about two weeks, but I drink tea exclusively. There are many good "imported" teas that are much more expensive and a lovely addition, but for my daily enjoyment, Lipton's is a delicious necessity. This is the preferred tea when using French presses or a traditional teapot.

review/summary: Boxed Nostalgia
review/text: Lipton Loose Tea, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PC6">Lipton Loose Tea, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, is a reminder of the way things were when I was a little child.  My mother, all her sisters, my grandmother, and all our friends considered Lipton Loose Tea to be TEA. There was no other for them.  I grew up thinking anything else was an "off" brand.  (Lipton Tea is America's favorite tea.)<br /><br />In the South most people make it sweet.  They add the sugar while it is hot so less sugar is required.  Now I prefer to use Splenda (SPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Granular, 9.7-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 2)) and lemon juice. This tea has a strong black-tea taste.  It is robust and pure.<br /><br />When I moved across the Mississippi River, I was shocked to discover that people in Louisiana drink their tea three times as strong as they do in Mississippi. I think one reason my people liked Lipton Loose Tea so much was that we had very little money and we had to make things go as far as possible.  It was always a good bargain.  Almost any kind of tea is an excellent bargain.<br /><br />Nutritonally it is outstanding.  It is a means of hydrating, which is considered important.  (Always hydrate responsibly:  don't drink too much! You would not want to drown.) Also it is an excellent source of flavonoids, which provide antioxidants. A glass of tea has about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.  Since the ingredients vary with different practices, it is difficult to estimate the amount of caffeine.<br />Some caffeine can help many people.<br /><br />On my blog, which you can find at Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook, I talked about my mother's tea and all the spread she used to make when she took food to church for dinner on the grounds.  The name of the blog entry is "Myrtle's Stuffed Eggs."<br /><br />About stains -- it is helpful to brush and polish your teeth immediately after enjoying this wonderful tea.  Also, you can clean glasses, pitchers, etc., with baking soda. One more tip is to drink with a straw to try to avoid getting so much of the liquid on your front teeth. (I do this, but I don't think it helps much.)<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.

review/summary: foul tasting substance
review/text: There are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine, there's oolong, black green, but one thing binds all these teas together, they taste like tea.<br /><br />This substance has no flavor only an astringent quality.  It is not drinkable plain.  Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness.<br /><br />I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible.  In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.<br /><br />What should you drink?  Anything you like.  I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase.<br /><br />I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it "tea".  It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant.<br /><br />What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff.  By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.<br /><br />If you have to buy tea at a supermarket, try the twinings darjeeling that's a decent blend you can drink.

review/summary: Herbal Tea: 5 Fruit Flavors
review/text: Celestial Seasonings is one of my favorites, if not my favorite, brands of tea.  Fruit herbal teas are my favorite type.  I love this sampler box of herbal teas.  The five types of tea, in order of my favorite flavors, are: Country Peach Passion, Black Cherry Berry, True Blueberry, Raspberry Zinger, and Wild Berry Zinger.<br /><br />I love tea, especially when eating certain foods, but also I love it all by itself.  I love tea with most all kinds of foods, especially cornbread or country foods.  It also goes good with most all other ethnic foods.<br /><br />I usually drink my tea plain (no sugar).  Very, very seldom do I add sugar.  And when I do, it is a very small amount.  Where I grew up, sugar in tea is an option.  However, I was stationed in the Deep South, and they drink thick sugar water with a drop of tea in it.  When my daughter was in elementary school, her teacher had the audacity to bring me a glass of that thick sugar water; I gagged.  I couldn't get past the first sip.  She might have gotten her feelings hurt.  They think you are crazy if you prefer tea with no sugar.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like fruit herbal teas.

review/summary: Best Thai Tea so far
review/text: So far this is the closest thing to the Thai restaurant I've tried.  And though it's close, it's still not exactly the same.  It does have that one spice that other Thai teas are missing. It's really outstanding.

review/summary: Serious Stuff
review/text: If you are looking for a way to get someone that thinks they can eat anything hot this is it.  I purchased Kick Your Ass sauce which was rated 1,000,000 sc.  Put a bunch on a chip and eat it.  Nothing.  No reaction.  The next day Da'Bomb showed up at my door.  Thinking that it's not much worse than the other I put a bunch on a  chip.....Wow pain.  No Joke pain.  Instantly. The first thing in my mind was why did I do that $%^&*(.  This product is something that you can add to a soup or something but don't put anymore than a drop in your mouth at a time.  It is a neat experience to put a drop in your mouth, serious pain for about 30 minutes but any more rips your insides.  This even from a person that heats habaneros by themselves with his food.<br /><br />If you are going to play a joke on someone, just a drop is good.  The braveheart yesterday had to leave work and didn't return to normal for about 5 hours.  I told him only a drop. His quoto is below when I told him what some other people's reactions were when they took a drop.<br /><br />"Tell them my insides are STILL on fuego. I tried on 3 occasions to puke it all up and nothing. I was sitting on the can and decided I'd better pull up my pants in case I passed out on the bathroom floor-that way the person that found me wouldn't have to see me with my pants around my ankles. I took a piss and it felt like razor blades were coming out. I hope you're happy!!"<br /><br />Trust me some fun stuff and the price is much better than the other stuff that pushes the limit.

review/summary: Hotter than hot!
review/text: India is weaponizing the ghost pepper (true story) and in my opinion the idea probably stemmed from the pain and submission that this sauce inflicts upon people. Be VERY careful with this stuff. Just one drop causes myself and all the other insane hot sauce fanatics I know to beg for mercy.  It will cause avid tough guy hot sauce lovers to go into retirement.

review/summary: Hotter than Heidi Klum and more powerful than a Gorilla on Acid
review/text: I bought this hot sauce as my gift for a white elephant party. I had watched several videos of people tasting it and watched them all writhe in pain and many go to the ground. I knew that this stuff was potent and could potentially be used in nuclear weapons. Someone ended up picking it and brought it out to try. I wanted no part of this. While she was attempting to dole out her punishment some of it got on the kitchen table. I went to wipe it up with a rag and accidentally got a small drop on my finger. I instantly washed if off as I didn't want any of its pain to somehow seep into my skin. 30 minutes later I found out the power that this beast holds. I was talking to some people when all of a sudden it felt like someone had lit my junk on fire. This wasn't a "when you go raw dogg with some shady club chick" type of burning. This was more like pouring napal down my pants type of burning. Apparently water and soap are not enough to get a drop of this stuff off of your skin. I didn't know that I had to wear gloves to go take a leak after being in the presence of this hot suace. Safe to say for the next 20-30 minutes I was in more pain than having to watch the Notebook twice in a row.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: Title says it all. I took a dollop of this on a cracker. There is an odd mild and nondescript flavor that I doubt would taint anything. Then the burn begins to build. It just continues to build up until ridiculous levels. The mouth is the easy part, anyone can conquer that and sit mildly while waiting for the 30 minutes to go by. Its the other 3 hours of intense gut pain that makes a man out of you (you don't see that in the videos). Its worse if you eat it later after a previously eaten meal because it just sits in your stomach burning the hell out of you until all that food goes down the tubes. Sucked both times I did it. Used properly, it puts a mean heat in anything you eat.<br /><br />Don't bother trying to be an hero and eating a spoonful, you can't handle it.

review/summary: Hot yes, tasty no
review/text: Lets get this out of the way - I regularly pop whole habanero peppers in my mouth and douse my food with Dave's Ghost Pepper Insanity Sauce.  That being said, I was looking for the next taste bud hot challenge and figured I'd give this a shot.<br /><br />They don't lie when they say it's HOT.  I put a single drop on a tortilla chip and although I wasn't in pain, I was in moderate discomfort for about 10 minutes.  I think the thing that got to me the most was that the taste was just not very good.  I'm no culinary expert and I'm sure it's extremely difficult to make something that hot taste good but compared to Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce it was bottom shelf in that department.  That being said, I will be giving it another chance soon, trying to incorporate it into a hot chili experiment.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're after a sauce to spice up a dish and leave it (mostly) edible for everyone but the diehard hot lovers, I'd recommend sticking with that sauce.  If you're reading these reviews though it's clear that you want hot, and this sauce doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Heat: 5 stars<br />Overall product: 3 stars (for taste)<br /><br />Scoville Scale reference:<br />Habanero ~ 250k<br />Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce ~ 650k<br />Da' Bomb Hot Sauce ~ 1500k

review/text: One drop of this stuff will make almost anyone cry for mercy. It has 1.5 million scoville units which measure heat in food. FYI your average Jalape&ntilde;o Pepper has 2,500-8,000 s.u. A Habanero chili can have upwards of 350k s.u. A Bhut Jolokia (ghost chili) is the hottest known naturally occurring chili and that has around upwards of 1 million s.u. The Final Answer is 50% hotter than the hottest grown chili. If you want something to break out at parties this is it. I have yet to give it to someone who hasn't shown physical signs of pain. Even people who eat hot foods on a regular basis will still find this stuff extremely hot. I have had lots of fun with the stuff and would recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Hottest sauce I own!!!! Unbelievable
review/text: I have tried many sauces from Habanero, to 7 Pod and Trinidad Scorpion, to the Ghost Chilli, and to those not too tasty extracts. And this is the hottest one I have. Hard to believe the hottest pepper in this sauce is the habanero. How can this be hotter than the ghost chilli and others I have. Because of the killer pepper extracts in there. If you can't even handle Ground Zero then don't even look at the final answer. It's ground zero knocked up a million notches. Don't believe me? Try one drop. One drop will leave you drooling and in a lot of pain. It taste pretty bad. It's only meant to taste hot and hurt you. I don't suggest one drop straight on the tongue like I did, put it in chilli or on cheese. But If you gotten up the nerve to try it straight then props to you, enjoy the pain.<br /><br />Worth the money. This small bottle will last you years it's that hot. And cool for any hotsauce collection.

review/summary: Practical for hotheads
review/text: this review ended up a little long, for those who want something quick, if you have any taste buds remaining this will easily provide a satisfying burn. at least when directly applied to your own food. but also works very well when used as an additive.<br /><br />the flavor starts a little smoky sweet and after 5 seconds it begins to creep in with the heat.<br /><br />that covers my quick verdict, and how it satisfies the reasons I got it. now here is what was going to be my original review and some personal accounts.<br /><br />I had read about various hot sauces for several weeks to find something I could be sure would satisfy. while well beyond the realm of a sauce, with a rating of 1.5 million scovilles, about 6 times hotter than an habanero and nearly twice that of the bhut jolokia, is as others have said hot enough to give anything a satisfying burn with a few drops.<br /><br />my applications so far include on a ritz bits sandwich, on a brownie, tacos, hot chocolate and my sleeping brother.<br /><br />for those of you that have thoughts of pranking others with something like this, I would at least recommend great care in choosing victims. woke my brother within 5 seconds and had him chugging milk withing 10.<br /><br />my personal favorite application is one drop on the ritz bits. I nice strong burn for about half an hour and the small endorphin rush that follows is a good pickmeup, but, by no means recommended, I'm abit of an idiot at times and have been told in other scenarios that I have no taste buds.<br /><br />lastly, so far as I can figure one drop of this in 8 fluid ounces of liquid will raise it about 300 scovilles. so I assumed 4 drops in a cup of hot chocolate would give me about half a jalapeno. well, I could hardly taste the chocolate and my stomach threatened to chew it's way out alien style.<br /><br />and I just reminded myself that I got some sauce on my finger nearly 5 hours ago because after all that time and various hand washings my eye still burned after scratching it.<br /><br />sorry if that's a little long, but I wanted to add more input to this highly underrated product.<br /><br />and very lastly. if indeed the dropper releases 50 microliters at a time (the best description of the measurement of a drop I could find) then there are well over a thousand drops in this bottle. though I'm not that great at math, so you don't have to take my word for the numbers I give here.<br /><br />happy eating,<br />  Daniel

I would not recommend under any circumstances to try it straight out of the bottle, I dont think there is a human being alive that could handle it but if you have a friend who thinks they can handle anything, they will meet their match with this sauce I can guarantee that.

review/text: Let's be honest, most of us buy this for the heat itself - out of curiosity or stupidity.<br />After trying blair's ultra death (i think it was at 1 million scoville), i can tell you that this is much hotter as advertised.<br />1.5 million is not a joke so use one drop per serving.<br /><br />I would give it a 4/5 because of the lack of flavor and taste. There's barely anything to enjoy or to look forward to when you use this hot sauce, but that's expected. I simply use it to make things "hot", not to enhance taste or for flavor, and it never fails me.<br />Being that hot, it can last you a long time, worth the $23 dollars.

review/summary: Definitely the FINAL answer (for now)
review/text: I started with tabasco sauce at age 5, worked my way to jalapenos in my teens, then habaneros, and finally the ghost chili in my 20s. I am always on the hunt for the next HOTTEST sauce as i keep killing my taste buds on this stuff. The last sauce I rolled the dice on was the Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce and it was fantastic. I thought ghost peppers would be the hottest thing until I got my hands on this little tiny bottle called Da Bomb - The Final Answer. Hmmmm... made from Habaneros and pepper extract? It couldn't be too bad I thought. Like a champ I put a dime sized blob on a chip and tossed it in my mouth. After a few chews my parents asked me "Well how is it?" I tried to talk and realized once this bad boy goes aerosol or you breathe it you're done. "It's goo.... *cough* *cough*" My eyes began to water and the heat took over. This stuff is not a joke, not a game. Over the past year my mouth and tongue has become desensitized to it and I can eat it no problem but the intestines never lie. It feels like the devil himself is laughing while he crawls through your colon, clawing you from within. Do NOT attempt to eat this on an empty stomach. In a pathetic attempt to show off to co-workers I brought it to work and we all tried some before lunch. After a few minutes I felt as if a fiery ulcer had erupted and had to chug about 3 Sodas before it subsided. This is the hottest stuff i've found to date... yet i'm still on the hunt. Use at your own... misguided risk.

Be careful if you get any of the undiluted extract on your skin as it does not easily wash off.  The oils are persistent and if you rub your eyes, etc. you will likely feel the burn.  If you want a brutally hot sauce, this is the one to use.

review/summary: Da Bomb: The Final Answer?  Yes.
review/text: This sauce is most definitely hot.  Not intolerable, but definitely hot, the hottest I own and I have sauces made from the Ghost Pepper. I put a drop about the diameter of a pea on a tortilla chip.  Immediately you have the flavor, which isn't too bad to be honest.  Kind of a dark, smoky, pepper fruit flavor.  Then the heat shows up and keeps building from a tinge until your mouth feels like its glowing.  Maybe its because I wasn't an idiot who took a spoonful of the stuff, but there was no 30 minute burn.  The real burn lasted 5, *maybe* 10 minutes.  The gut bomb that everyone talks about?  Nonexistent.  And I am not one of these people who claim to eat habaneros plain on their own, because I don't.  Personally I have to call BS on the people that say that.  Its a bit expensive for a 2 oz bottle, but when all it takes to give something a pleasant heat is a drop or two without changing flavor, its worth the price.  This sauce will last you for a while.<br /><br />Final thought:  Dont be a hero and try to take a whole spoonful of this.  Not only is it too expensive to use it like that, but take that much and you will regret it.

review/text: Like most other 'sauces' in this heat range, this sauce adds heat to a dish without significantly affecting the flavor.  When you want to control the flavor of a dish with its other ingredients and just add pure heat, this is ideal.  The bottle has a dropper attached to the lid, so it is easy to meter out just the right amount.  Although the price seems a bit high for such a small bottle, it really is a good deal since it only takes a small amount to add a lot of heat.

review/summary: Very handy
review/text: Aside from the obvious benefits of using this product to spice up your food, it also works wonders with multiple other "regular" household problems.  Rusted bolts don't stand a chance against the metal disintegrating power of this product, it works better and faster then WD-40.  It also does wonders for pest control as I had a few ants constantly in my garage so I put this stuff in a dish with some syrup in the middle.  All the ants died crossing this sauce.  I also successfully removed a small grease stain from my garage floor, which isn't as practical as it is possible because you have to use a majority of the hot sauce.<br /><br />The sauce itself is unbelievably hot.  I'm talking pain inducing I'm too sick to move spicey.  I put a squirt on a chip and thought my nose started bleeding.  I'd recommend you only use this product in LARGE batches of food (large pot of chili).  If you want to experience about as much pain as possible without any long term effects (at least I hope not) take a swig of this stuff.  I'd also recommend a comfortable toilet seat and possibly a magazine subscription and some kleenex if you start crying.  Amazon really knows what to sell if they are trying to increase product sales in other departments.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: A friend introduced me to Lavazza a few years ago, and I have to say it's one of the nicest coffees I've had. I use it in my stove top espresso maker, and it brews a perfect cup every time. I also use the decaf version, which is also really good for decaf. My only gripe would be that it's neither fair trade or organic.

review/summary: Ambrosia.
review/text: My daughter, living and working in DC this summer, introduced me to this product while home for a visit.  She encouraged me to give the plain version (just pure coconut water) a chance first, and by the second container, I understood the amazing qualities of this drink.  I felt so refreshed, hydrated, and healthy!  I later tried the kind with pineapple, which is also delicious, but I think the plain is more effective and purely refreshing when really hot, tired and thirsty, while the sweeter fruit infused version will be amazing as part of a cocktail.  Can't wait for 5:00!

review/summary: Great coconut water in just the right size!
review/text: This has been my favorite brand of coconut water of the ones I've tried. They use real fruit juice for flavoring, as well as it tastes good.<br /><br />We tried the smaller size, and they just aren't large enough to get enough water at the gym, and are not resealable.<br /><br />Things I like about this:<br /><br />* Perfect size for an hour long gym routine<br />* Resealable cap(smaller one lacks this)<br />* Tasty (Like a pina colada)<br /><br />Negative<br /><br />* Box makes it hard to get the last drops- usually end up squishing it up to get the last bit<br /><br />So great coconut water, perfect size, and cheaper than buying locally at sprouts with the Amazon's 'subscribe and save'!

review/text: I have tried every brand of coconut water that health food stores carry, and this is, by far, my favorite.  The pineapple flavor does not overwhelm the coconut or vice versa. I also like the tetra pack with the screw on top- it is much more convenient than the smaller 11 oz size which you cannot reseal.  This has been a great Gatorade substitute for me, and helps a lot when I am sick or dehydrated or need to hydrate quickly. Great stuff!

review/summary: Hydrating, Refreshing, Great-Tasting Drink
review/text: I discovered Vita Coco a few months ago.  Of the flavors I have tried, I like the Pineapple best.  It tastes like a mild pina colada without the alcohol.  I love the idea of an all-natural hydrating drink that is low in sugar and high in potassium.  Whenever I am hot, thirsty or a little run-down, I find that Vita Coco Coconut Water with Pineapple really quenches my thirst, refreshes me, and gives me a little energy boost without added sugar or any artificial ingredients like the ones in Gatorade and other drinks aimed at balancing electrolytes.  An 8-1/2-ounce serving  has only 60 calories and 30 mg of Sodium (less than fat-free milk), with 515 mg of Potassium and 180% of the RDA of Vitamin C.  It's a little pricey, but if you can buy it on sale with free shipping, it's a great value.  Although I have previously purchased it on Amazon, I more recently bought it at GNC during Gold Card Week when there was a free shipping offer and a "buy 2, get 1 free" offer.  With a deal like that, it breaks down to less than 65 cents per 8-1/2-oz serving.

review/text: I love the Pineapple/Coconut water. It is high in potassium. I am a rural mail carrier and have to be out in the hot weather. In the afternoon I get hot, dry, and thirsty. I am trying to lose weight so I'm watching my calories. Water is wet and cold but doesn't quench my thirst. This stuff does the trick. It quenches my thirst and gives me a little pick-up for the afternoon and keeps me going. This only has 60 calories per serving, so that is much less than a 180 calorie Gatorade. I recommend this to those looking for a healthy alternative to the sugary sports drinks.

review/text: This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, don't think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity.

review/summary: yuck
review/text: I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesn't.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it,

review/summary: Hip & Joint w/ Glucosamine
review/text: I am leasing a 15 year old mare who is extremely stiff (and quite out of shape).  I started her on these 2 weeks ago and have noticed a big improvement with her movement.  I don't know if it is mainly because she is getting into shape or if the Glucosamine is helping.  She loves them so I plan on continuing to give these to her for the remainder of the lease and to my next horse if he/she is in the older category.  It can only be good for them.

review/summary: Great treat with benefits
review/text: I got this for my 23 year old gelding.  He loves it and it seems to be helping him.  His appetite and joints appear to be improving. I wish they sold this in 30lb or 50lb sizes.  Then all of our horses could have this everyday.

review/summary: Christmas treat
review/text: I purchased this for Christmas 2011.  I love peppermint bark and like to try a new kind every year.  Its a very special yearly treat for me, so I expect a lot from the product.<br /><br />Pros for Scott's Cakes version:  Good organization and logistics:  the package arrived quickly, the candy was well wrapped in the shipping box and shrink-wrapped in a box of its own.  Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.<br /><br />This seller's peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor.  White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality.  There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one's mouth.  This attracted me to Scott's Cakes.<br /><br />Cons:  The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing.  The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate.  The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark.  I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark.  However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite.  The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy.  Thus, there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark.

review/summary: Very interesting blend
review/text: I was first reading reviews @ the Starbucks website for this coffee, and it had great reviews, so I though I might give it a try. I went to downtown and bought a bag of whole bean Caffe Verona and boy I am glad I made that decision.<br /><br />Out of the bag, the rich dark brown colors and the aroma punished me of the years I lived without this. A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast - a blend of Latin American coffees.<br /><br />In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.<br /><br />Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha-Java. If you are looking for a Multiblend similar to this, Peet's fixes whatever lacked in Starbuck's Verona. This Mocha-Java is balanced, nutty and smooth. It has excellent acidity, with a slight bite.<br /><br />If you want a closer mix to this than I would mix the Arabian Mocha-Java with Sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance.<br /><br />There are many coffee drinkers who hate Starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity. I just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe Verona is one of the better speciality blends Starbucks has offered.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention, whole beans always rule . Even if you ground your beans at your nearest cafe or supermarket, the moment the ground coffee comes in contact with the air, the aroma starts to leak. Grind your beans moments before you put it to use, you will see notice the change in taste and aroma when you are drinking it.

review/summary: My favorite Starbucks variety
review/text: First of all, in response to the query of why you would order this online posed by the reviewer below...not everyone lives near a Starbucks. Hard to believe I know, considering they seem to be on every street corner, but believe it or not there are still large sections of the US w/out Starbucks. So for those of us who want good coffee, Thank God for the internet & amazon. Verona is my favorite SB blend. It doesn't taste burnt as some of their coffee does to me. It has a boldness without being too dark & overwhelming, and it has subtle notes of chocolate without the icky sweetness of a flavored coffee. It makes a delicious cup of coffee.

review/summary: Bring Back Verona
review/text: As a perusal of comment about Verona Dark will show, the fans of regular Verona are terribly disappointed that their favorite coffee is being discontinued. It's your company and you can run it any way you please. Conclusion: Unless there is a specific reason to discontinue regular Verona, the decision to do so is (for me terribly) ill-advised.<br /><br />There. How's that for potentially positive and useful feedback?<br /><br />PS: I cannot choose the product you want me to specify, because you mention only DARK Verona.
