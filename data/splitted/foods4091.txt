review/summary: Not what I ordered!
review/text: I ordered decaf hazelnut k-cups from Gloria Jean (that's what I clicked on) what came in the mail was non-decaf (regular) I cannot drink regular coffee. I was dismayed to see they were not returnable. If it were not for Amazon's wonderful policy (they refunded me anyway!) I would be stuck with coffee I could not use. This is why I order 90% of my online purchases from Amazon. I will go back to Paul Newman decaf k-cups. They arrive as ordered.

review/summary: Highly recommended!
review/text: Hazelnut is always a favorite standard flavor in my house.  As we go through a lot of coffee, we purchase our K-Cups in bulk so we're always looking for the best price per K-Cup.  We've tried other flavors from Gloria Jean's Coffees, and we have been satisfied with all of them so far.  We keep our K-Cups on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Keurig 5060 K-Cup Carousel, Chrome</a> so we're okay that the K-Cups ship in this box.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Absolutely dissapointed.
review/text: I received a 6 pack of these apples from amazon.com because I absolutely LOVE this brand because of the taste and lack of sulfuric additives.  However, the quality of apples I received is substandard compared to what I've experienced by buying them in the normal grocery store.<br /><br />These apples "look" as if they have a coating of dust/grey around them.  At first I thought they were coated in a light sugary substance.  I had to double check the front to make sure it said unsulfured.  Then there was the taste--they didn't even TASTE good!<br /><br />Don't waste your time buying these from AMZ.  It seems to me that they're selling the bad batches that go through Quality Control and are deemed insufficient for normal store shelves.  BLYEACHK!!!!<br /><br />I've opened three of the 6 packs and they're all the same.  I double checked the expiration date and they all show Oct. 23, 2009.  I also am wondering if they use different apples depending on the season because these taste NOTHING like the ones I bought back in early November (the reviewed ones I'm discussing were purchased in Jan. 2009).

review/summary: Meow Mix Shrimp & Tuna cat's favorite
review/text: My cat is a 19 lb. Maine Coon who will not eat any moist cat food other than Meow Mix Real Shrimp in Tuna.  He makes chomp chomp slurp slurp sounds when he is chewing and purrs when he sees it.  He paws the drawer it's in at dinner time to let me know exactly what he wants.  His dry food is Rocky Mountain Call of the Wild Salmon and Venison, a high protein food.  When he was a kitten he was eating a name brand cat food and smelled liked corn meal and was getting roly poly fat.  He wasn't playing and didn't "look" right.  I started researching and found his food had corn meal as the main ingredient!  Ever since then I've been a label reading pet parent.  He will not eat pate, cat treats or human food.  We've tried several other moist meals for him but this is his "one and only."  If he doesn't have a moist meal once a day his poo is hard little pellets.  Since he's such a picky eater and doesn't eat much at a time, the Meow Mix is just the right size.  He eats about 1/3 of it when it's opened and then finishes it during the night.  He's a hoot but we sure do love him.  He is such a good boy and deserves the best.  As far as we're concerned the Meow Mix Tuna and whole Shrimp is the best.

review/summary: Our Mini Pomeranians LOVED IT!
review/text: I have joined BarBox and i got the Fruity one. My dogs absolutely loved it. I went on amazon and they were much cheaper than the original website and i found these peanut butter ones. I bought them knowing that my two mini pomerainians love peanut butter, and they absolutely loved these too! I am very happy with these and very economical for a 3 pound (12 weeks old) and a 11 month old 11 pound pomeranian. I give them less than half in a day to share and then the next day they get a little more and then the nest. One tub last 3 days for them. I wrap it back up in aluminum foil and put it back in the freezer. I love them! Thank you!!!!!

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: In Texas recently I was given a taste-tour of a hot sauce shop by the owner. While most of the sauces were intent of being as hot as possible at the expense of any sort of taste, this was different. While heat is there (and lots of it) it was one of the few that combined it with flavour. The garlic and meat taste to it convinced me to buy a bottle. If you like hot and tasty - go for it!

Tons of flavor from the chipotles and garlic, and oodles of heat from the habaneros.  If you like hot sauce, this is your huckleberry.

review/summary: Spicy with lasting heat
review/text: The heat from this sauce is from habaneros, and it is a bit on the warm side compared to many habanero sauces with no pepper extracts.  The heat starts at about a medium level, then builds over the next few minutes to a fiery crescendo, and stays with you.  The product description is right on, this one will burn you more than once.<br /><br />The flavor is spicy, also having chipotles, garlic, onion, tomato, cumin and other spices.  The chipotle and cumin really add an earthiness to this sauce setting it apart from many others.<br /><br />It has a chunky texture with visible chunks of garlic, onion and spices.

review/text: From the picture, I thought a Zombie Bar might be a really big (monster size?) bar of chocolate, but they were about the same size as the iconic Hershey's milk chocolate bars that you'd see (NOT the king size version) sold at a candy counter at a convenience store.  The Zombie Bars also seemed to take a long time to arrive, but that could have been just an unfortunate comparison with the other items I ordered at the same time which all came really fast.  Due to the somewhat high price, I had ordered two bars as a gift, not for personal consumption so unfortunately I cannot comment on taste.

review/summary: My New Favorite Tea, Marvelous, Delightful
review/text: *****<br /><br />Ok, I love lavender, so I'm biased. Still, this Traditional Medicinals Organic Chamomile with Lavender Tea is just spectacular. I've never tasted an herbal tea so good. I'm not sure if I just love the tea or if it truly has "digestive and nervous system sedating properties" but I feel relaxed when I drink it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinals' Organic Chamomile with Lavender Tea are: organic chamomile flower 1,200 mg., proprietary blend: organic English lavender flower, organic lemon balm leaf . The tea tastes like chamomile with a strong, delicious lavender taste. It is a very fresh taste because there are no flavorings and everything is organic. The smell is yummy, too, even before brewing, as the lavender smell stands out; you could put the tea bags in your drawers to use as sachet fresheners!<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a very responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes on the box: "The combination of chamomile and lavender with lemon balm has digestive and nervous system sedating properties useful for nervous stomach and restlessness associated with upset stomach. The use of these herbs alone and in combinations for nervous stomach has been approved by European health authorities and is supported by clinical data. Organic Chamomile with Lavender has a pleasantly aromatic and balanced taste.".<br /><br />Also note the following caution from the box: "Contraindications: Do not use if your have known allergies to plants of the Asteraceae family (daisy) such as blessed thistle, calendula, chamomile, echinacea, safflower or yarrow."<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

I want to know, where has this tea been all my life?!<br /><br />Lavender is known to promote restfulness and is perfect paired with chamomile for a cup of caffeine-free tea at bedtime. Just brewing this tea will ease your stress as it's lavender scent will fill the room. This is aromatherapy in a beverage that tastes delicious.

review/summary: Cured my insomnia!!!! AMAZING
review/text: I have only been drinking this tea for the past week, but for seven nights in a row I have finally been able to fall asleep with ease!! In the past I have taken stuff like PM pain killers or NightQuil, sometimes they do the trick but I know they disrupt your sleep patterns and are VERY bad for you. It's a very short trial so far, but nothing else in my life changed this week EXCEPT drinking this tea, and now I am getting great sleep!

review/summary: 2nd best candy ever?
review/text: For years I've been searching for a candy to replace my twerpz cravings and I finally think I found a product that fills the void.  For those unfortunate souls that were never privileged to try twerpz they were a sweet sour and tangy produced by the Hershey company that was very addicting.  This is a similar product with a sugar coating to boot.  At first I was a little worried that the sugar coating would leave me with the post-sour patch kid mouth but pleasantly I haven't found that to be the case.  I highly recommend this delicious candy.

review/summary: Pflaumenmus!
review/text: I'm crazy about Pflaumenmus, plum jam, the way they make it in different parts of Germany with slightly differing flavors. My favorite is M&uuml;hlh&auml;user from Thuringia. The Schwartau was the only one available through amazon.com the time my supply from a store in Phoenix (Old Heidelberg Bakery on Indian School Road)ran out. This product comes from a town near L&uuml;beck in northern Germany. I use it as a bread spread.<br />I rate the product "excellent". Of all the plum jams I have tasted this one stands out with a very unique flavor; unfortunately I can't describe the spice(s) that gave it this flavor (I don't cook or bake). What comes to my mind is Christmas and a touch of campfire smoke. I'm glad I ordered it. It's heavy, and shipping for 4 jars was 35% of the total. But one expects to pay more for specialty items....

review/summary: Good, but expensive
review/text: First off, I admit that I didn't pay close enough attention to the size details, so I was a bit shocked when these 2 very tiny containers arrived! Most of the almond oils I had previously bought were in 16oz containers, or double the size.  That aside, the oil has a nice taste and texture to it. I use it in baking, particularly when making pancakes. It adds just a little bit of flavor instead of bland vegetable oil. However, when it comes time to re-stock, I will probably go back to my regular brand, Spectrum, which runs around $7-$8 for 16 oz (much more wallet-friendly.)

review/summary: The happy medium
review/text: Some nut butters are too oily, some too dry. Some are too grainy, some too pasty. Some--worst of all--have ingredients that shouldn't even be considered food. I purchased this almond butter from Amazon after a single jar of Maranatha rang up at $28 at my local grocery store. Having read reviews on all sorts of nut butters here, I worried that this would show up with something crazy like wheat germ or cane juice. Happily, it contains only almonds and palm fruit oil. The almonds are ground fine but with some texture remaining. The palm fruit oil seems to contribute to the consistency that's moist without being runny. The flavor is ideal as well--faintly sweet in the way that whole, fresh, raw almonds are. In short, I'm surprised and delighted with this product.

review/summary: Better than others I've tried
review/text: I've been using Maranantha almond butter in the past, which I'd buy in the store (and it was great), but it was sooo expensive!  I ended up buying it here in a more economical size, but it arrived leaking and I think rancid too.  In an effort to find another brand that would work, I gave Justin's a go.  Wow, it's great!  It has a great consistency which allows you to apply it to the bread without tearing the bread.  Part of what allows you to do that is that it doesn't require refrigeration.  Since I have limited space in my refrigerator, this is awesome.  There is also a quality control seal inside so it wont leak in shipping and it stays fresh.  This butter has the almond skins in it, which I actually prefer since there are nutrients in the skin.  Most almond butters have the skins, but a few here on Amazon don't so just be aware of that no matter which one you buy.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good sandwhich, try almond butter and raspberry!

review/summary: Tastes great, only 2 ingredients & the oil doesn't separate out
review/text: I keep this in my fridge.  When I first tried almond butter I purchased another brand and can't remember the name.  I put it in the refrigerator and every time I opened the container the oil had separated and risen to the top, and it was hard to mix the oil back into it.  I don't have carpal tunnel or arthritis and work out regularly, so the fact that it was very hard to mix the oil back in was aggravating and I threw that container away.<br /><br />I was at the grocery store and saw this brand and decided to give it a try.  I read ingredient labels as less ingredients typically mean less processing, and I try to eat more unprocessed and lightly processed foods than processed foods.  The label for Justin's states the ingredients are "Dry Roasted Almonds, Organic Palm Fruit Oil."<br /><br />I have been using the 16 oz container for over a month now and the oil hasn't separated ONCE.

I did keep for use at night I was told that if you have a spoonful at night it levels out something in your system & helps you sleep better. If you bought it give it a try, it can't hurt to try. It texture is not smooth like peanut butter, but more like fine chopped up nuts. Not my favorite texture, but not bad on a spoon either. I did give it a try & I did sleep better that night at least. I will continue to try at night to see what happens. I have chronic insomnia & have had it for years. I will be back in the future to leave you an update.

review/text: These Ghirardelli raspberry filled chocolates are the best of their kind! There are just so many disappointing raspberry filled chocolates on the market that it'll make you sick, but these on the other hand... what quality!<br /><br />The dark chocolate is smooth and with a hint of bitterness, but not too much (like 80% dark and up).<br /><br />And the raspberry filling is nothing short of addictive. The filling is very thick and not runny at all (unlike the mint filled version) which I really like (I have a beard... you do the math).<br /><br />Ghirardelli achieved the correct balance between a semi-sweet/almost bitter chocolate and the not too sweet/still kinda tangy raspberry filling to create one of my new favorite chocolates on the market.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The filling actually tastes like raspberries!<br />The filling isn't super sweet, yet isn't sour like raspberries can sometimes get.<br />Smooth velvety chocolate.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Kinda pricey, but that can be said about most any high quality chocolate on the market.<br />Filling does contain actual raspberry seeds... some people might dislike this.

review/summary: The best Raspberry Chocolate available in the US
review/text: I'm certainly not a confections expert, but I do love chocolate, and especially raspberry chocolates of all types and varieties. I can honestly say that these Ghirardelli raspberry filled chocolates are some of the best I've ever had, and are easily the best widely available in the US. I have had better (an Italian import that I cannot remember the name of), but they weren't that much better.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, the filling does contain actual raspberry seeds, and while some might not like that, I personally enjoy it. It lets me know that the filling I am consuming is made from real raspberries, not some boiled down concentrate with artificial flavors.<br /><br />These are slightly expensive, but their worth the price in my opinion. Not too sweet, not too gummy, perfect served alongside coffee or as a petite desert after a meal. They also go well with a dark chocolate cake or brownie and ice cream.

review/summary: Great price for a great little goody. The perfect gift. Super delicious chocolate with great raspberry filling!
review/text: These chocolates are real winners. Even people who do not care for dark chocolate love these.  This is a perfect present to get someone. You'd think 6 bags would be a lot-but they really go, for they are really well liked.<br /><br />With all these commercials, you'd think they'd be easy to find, but surprisingly, nice stores in NY did not carry them.<br /><br />The world famous Ghirardelli name of San Francisco's  Fisherman's Wharf fame has made a chocolate treat that is unsurpassed in flavor and quality.<br /><br />Super delicious chocolate with great raspberry filling and lovely package to boot.<br /><br /> Great price for a great little goody!

review/summary: Why the change?
review/text: Reading older reviews is a trip down memory lane. This decadent delight WAS a favorite. My wife and I would squirrel this away, hiding it from the amazing sniffer of our 12-year-old daughter, this was a treat we looked forward to with great anticipation. Then sometime several months ago the packaging changed. Well, at least we thought it was JUST the packaging, but to our horror, that was not the case. Ghirardelli tossed aside the recipe of our beloved chocolate and went with a new recipe that was dreadful. Gone was the aroma and texture we'd come to love. And the raspberry seeded filling that gave honor to the oft-disaffected raspberry was just some gooey-jell fake with no tribute to the old favorite as it became nothing more than a distant memory. Suffice it to say that after the weeping and rending of cloth, we won't get fooled again. Bring back the old stuff, Ghirardelli, else we shall turn our passions forever to the Lindt in our pockets!

review/summary: Excellent Tea
review/text: I'm picky when it comes to tea, in fact this is the only bagged tea I own - because I simply prefer loose leaf tea which I perceive to be healthier as well as tastier. However, I tried this tea because locally, we don't have a lot of loose leaf tea options. It initially put me off because I saw in the ingredient list that it contains basically stevia. As a rule of thumb, I avoid artificial sugars. I think they're gross and potentially harmful to boot. However, I researched this ingredient and no longer view it as a negative, and believe me I am a difficult convert (opinionated and surely always right). I think this tea is actually quite good, I drink it just as it is, sometimes iced, sometimes warm depending on the weather. It has more antioxidants than the other green teas I looked at, and that can only be beneficial. I'm a big fan. I don't think you'll regret this purchase, unless as a rule of thumb you dislike teas of this kind (like my husband). I did not buy this online, so I cannot attest to that. This is simply a review of this product because I really like it, which was a surprise.

review/summary: Got some mixed feelings...
review/text: I do love my tea based on taste, flavour and blend. Out of all three this one fulfilled only the flavour part and left out the taste & blend. Please take care, as its green tea, its really easy to over brew it and it gets real bitter with this.<br />It is predomindantely pomegranate,and lacks the depth and infucion of green tea (at least for me) when brewed exactly for 3.5 minutes at 94 celcius water.  Contain one of the most quantity of antioxidants, that is one of the biggest positive point in here. Another factor might be the inclusion of stevia in the ingrediants which most probably is masking the blend and helping pomegranate to overpower the infusion.

review/summary: Good chocolate, tacky packaging.
review/text: We ordered this chocolate to give out as a "door prize" of sorts.  Just a nice little thing to say "welcome, glad you are here".  The chocolate is good (as Ghirardelli usually is) although it isn't my favorite dark I have ever had, so I gave the chocolate itself 4 stars.<br /><br />The packaging on the individual wrappers is incredibly tacky though.  There are sayings like "A reward for beating my best friend in tennis...again" and "Gets me over the hump between breakfast and lunch" and the worst/least professional in my opinion: "A delicious start to Friday night happy hour."  Come on!  Are you kidding me?  This just seems like something I would expect to find on a Hershey's Kisses wrapper (if it could be done) but not what I expect from a quality company like Ghirardelli.  We gave these away last year and they didn't have any "clever messages" on them and the packaging was very tasteful and classy.  Unfortunately we can't return and reorder at this point, so we are stuck with these.  I will be a bit embarrased to pass these out this year.  0 stars for the packaging.

review/summary: Great chocolate (when it's not stale)
review/text: I'm not entirely sure the proper rating to give to this.  On the one hand, I buy a lot of 60% Ghiradelli (from another source) and I love it.  For those who want to transition to dark chocolate, this is a good place to start (vs. the more intimidating 85% or 95% cacao).  Tasty and good for you, too.  (Whoa!!)<br /><br />On the other hand, Amazon screwed this one up by sending stale chocolate.  I knew that something was wrong the moment I bit into the first piece and subsequently figured it out when I found coupons in the bags that had expired quite a few months prior.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for the chocolate and I guess I'll just leave it at that.  No reason to ding the good rating for good chocolate just because the merchant messed it up a bit.<br /><br />Pros: yummy and good for you<br />Cons: might turn you into a chocolate snob ;)

review/summary: I normally love these, but...
review/text: I have for the most part bought these locally (Walgreens), and have loved them. However, for some odd reason all of the bags in this particular lot, ordered here in March, 20212, were stale. The bags had an expiration date of 1/31/2013, and the individually-wrapped pieces were all intact, yet all the chocolate was definitely stale. I did call Ghirardelli and received a single $5 coupon for a new bag, but I will never be buying their chocolate online in the future.<br /><br />I also bought a similar lot of the dark chocolate mint squares, and all of these are fine, but still...<br /><br />Follow-up: I have contacted Ghirardelli, and I am going to receive vouchers to compensate me for the whole order. Very nice customer service.

review/summary: Weak, Tasteless
review/text: *SAMPLE PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURER*<br /><br />I made this according to the manufacturers directions and still came up with one of the weakest glasses of iced coffee I ever had. There was a scent of vanilla, but the taste was more chemical vanilla than anything else.<br /><br />There is no way that an unflavored non-iced coffee wouldn't work as well or even better than using this flavored product. I used the 6 oz.cup size to prepare this, and I was amazed at how flavorless and watered down this product was even before adding my cream and sugar.<br /><br />I can small the vanilla scent but I cannot taste it and there is no sweetness to this product.

review/summary: A Gentle, Tasty Tea to Calm the Stomach (and Nerves)
review/text: I got this tea because I wanted to get something to help my sister through chemo for her pancreatic cancer. I had read many good things about the effects of lemons on pancreatic patients, and the ginger and other herbs can be helpful to counteract the nausea from chemo.<br /><br />I began brewing up big pitchers of this tea using about 5 teabags per pitcher, and soon the whole family was a fan. We keep two different pitchers around -- one unsweetened, made just with this brewed tea, a dash of additional lemon juice, and sparkling water.  The other pitcher, we use this tea as a basis for some really tasty lemonade using brewed tea, lots of fresh lemon juice, lemon zest, water, and a little honey.<br /><br />If you're seeking a tasty, affordable ginger tea, this one is wonderful hot or cold, and it has really helped my sister with her chemo. She now swears by it and we always keep it in the house.

review/summary: Super Stinky But That Means Super Tasty!
review/text: Oh man! I recently adopted a 6 year old shelter cat and he is such a foodie! I've had him for a month now and did a sample run of some single cans of various brand food to see what he prefers. He ate them all, but he'd come and go, never finishing in one sitting. I looked online to see if I could find any of the kind I sampled and came across some grain free options on wag.com. I thought that sounded good and came here to comparison shop and voila! I found BFF here. I personally like the cute can design, but I wanted to supplement my cat's dry food with a seafood wet food. They have a few options that sound pretty good if it was people food, but I thought Tuna & Shrimp Sweethearts would be a good start. When it arrived a couple days ago as soon as I popped the can, he came scampering over! I can see baby shrimp pieces in it, which is a good sign. Smells horrendous going in, and coming out, but he really enjoys it! He likes this flavor so much he will eat almost all of his portion in one sitting. He'll go away for maybe 10-15 minutes and then come back to finish the rest. This is a big change from the other brands of wet food I'd been experimenting with. If the price stays under a dollar a can, I will continue to buy this flavor!

review/text: While these cookies tasted basically fine, they arrived completely melted and they were a gooey mess inside their bags. I bought them to serve at a tea party, but they're so unpresentable, there's no way that I would offer them to guests. Perhaps it was too warm during transport, which seems to have melted the powdered sugar coating. Very disappointing. Also, while this is a small thing, the resealable bag is a great idea, except they put the label with the nutrition information overlapping the top of the bag, so you have to rip it in order to open the bag where indicated. Poorly designed. Overall, not recommended.

review/summary: Granola without clusters
review/text: The Breadshop's 'Crunchy Oat Bran' granola tastes OK. I've had much better tasting granolas for less money. But my biggest disappointment is with the texture. I like granola with crunchy clusters and this cereal lacks that. The cereal consists of small bits that are relatively uniform in size and it impresses me as a 'whole' food that has been over-processed. I'd give it three stars for taste, two stars for value, and one star for texture, which averages two stars.
