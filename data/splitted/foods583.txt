review/summary: Tasty, smoky and versatile
review/text: I like chipotle sauce as well as cajun remoulade sauce. This seems to combine the essence of each, with a nice smokehouse touch.<br /><br />This tastes great on eggs, noodles, chicken, pretty much anything you like to sauce up.<br /><br />Taco Bell takes a ribbing on TV shows for its food, but this is a wonderful product. Maybe they should send some to the late night TV comedians!

review/summary: My favorite flavor
review/text: I've tried the Jalapeno and the Ranchero and this is my favorite out of the 3. It isn't very hot but you can taste the spices.<br />I prefer this sauce more than most of the dipping sauces you would get from the local fast food chains.<br />This is great on chicken nuggets and almost anything breaded. I also love it on homemade burgers.<br />It is a guilty pleasure I enjoy from time to time.

review/summary: If you like Taco Bell's mild or medium sauces, you'll probably like this too
review/text: Tasting like a mixture of tobasco and liquid smoke, you can use it for topping on tacos, or perhaps taco salad. I would use it somewhat sparingly as the flavor is a bit overwhelming, in my opinion.  While it is not terribly spicy. it does have a rather strong flavor.<br /><br />Those who like to use Taco Bell's medium or hot sauces on their food would probably like this as well.<br /><br />(Personally, I didn't care for it, as it sort of made me want to barf.) I'm more of a "pico de gallo, or chunky salsa" kind of person.

review/summary: If you are hungering for some Taco Bell - this is the sauce for you!
review/text: Interestingly, even when comparing with other sauces, this immediately brought to mind Taco Bell.  I never realized their sauces were so distinctive.<br /><br />With regard to the sauce itself, the consistency is thick, tasting like a mayonnaise base with some BBQ Sauce added and then mixed with some chipotle (minus the seeds). Mildly warm, extremely creamy... certainly not bad... more like comfort food - what you would grab in the middle of the night, not what you would feed to honored guests.<br /><br />So... it fills the bill for standard fare, but would be just as easy to make your own and cut down some of the fat and salt (of which this sauce has a ton of both!!!) and pick up some extra flavor and "freshness". Hope this review is helpful.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

review/summary: My New Favorite Sauce
review/text: I like using various types of sauce on such foods as tacos, taco salads, hamburgers, etc. This is the first time I've used a chipotle sauce and just loved it! The smoking flavor was just perfect for the tacos that I fixed. My daughter tried it and liked it as well.<br /><br />It was thick enough, but not too thick, for something that we ate with our hands (the tacos). The flavor was good, the sauce was not too hot for those who like a more temperate taste. Basically it was a good middle of the road sauce as far as the heat factor, while providing a great taste for anyone who wants something a little different.

review/summary: Kind of an interesting taste, but nothing I crave
review/text: I'm not a big fan of Taco Bell food, but I've tried a few of their sauces and they're really not that bad. This one is a little tangy, a little smokey, but personally I think it could use a bit more bite. That said, though, I'm really not sure where it work best. I've actually tried it as a salad dressing (not too bad) and on grilled chicken (a little watery for that) and I'm going to try it on grilled shrimp this weekend, I hope.<br /><br />I keep a lot of different sauces around the kitchen for those days when food starts to bore me and while this sauce won't necessarily save a meal, it's not a bad dipping sauce for chicken or even with scrambled eggs. No matter what sauces or dressings I use I seem to spice them up more anyway, so really this is just a base dressing and for that it's fine. I also use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK9CFE">Newman's Own Salad Dressing, Caesar, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> in the same way--even though it's probably just meant to be a salad dressing.<br /><br />If you're lactose intolerant, read the label: most of these Taco Bell sauces contain milk-based whey and you might want to avoid it or take Lactaid with it. So far it hasn't bothered me.

review/summary: Resturaunt Style Sauce for the Home
review/text: I've long been a fan of Taco Bell's sauces and have often taken a few dozen packets of their mild sauces home to use in my own creations.  Problem was that I couldn't take any of the larger sauces home like their chipotle sauce due to the fact that they don't keep any in the main lobby.  Fortunately, they decided to make a bottled version available for mass distribution so us amateur chefs could come up with our own mixtures.<br /><br />The sauce is good; I've been using it in my Mexican dishes such as quesadillas, tacos, and even some breakfast sandwishes.  It works well with just about anything I've put it on that requires a little more spice.  It certainly adds flavor.  I have yet to try and work it into anything fried or Italian (Taco Bell mild sauce works insanely well with sauted spaghetti meat), but I'm sure I'll figure it in somehow.<br /><br />All in all, a well worthy purchase.

review/summary: Tastes Good ... A Little Goes a Long Way
review/text: What's there to say about Taco Bell Chipotle sauce?<br /><br />It tastes good: it's not spicy, but has a zing to it. It's kind-of creamy, and is loaded with flavor. Anyone familiar with Taco Bell will already know this stuff; it winds up on about 2/3s of the food offerings there.<br /><br />It is very calorically dense, at 160 calories per serving, and should - ideally - be used sparingly. A little bit does go a long way towards adding flavor (and extra fat) to meats. I used mine to flavor ground-beef for stuffed peppers, on sandwiches as a condiment (in lieu of mayo), and as a 'dipping sauce' for grilled chicken. It has a great taste and is very palatable, but doesn't have any kind of nutritional value. It's best with a lean meat or dish, because the fat in the sauce adds depth to the taste of whatever you're eating.

review/text: I thought this was nice and creamy and tasty.  I used it as a dipping sauce for grilled chicken.  However, if you're looking for hot, this barely passes.  The chipotle flavor is there, but not enough for my tastes.<br /><br />Also, it's not the healthiest condiment.  Two tablespoons is 110 calories, 11g fat, and 300 sodium.  If you're looking for healthy, you should stick with salsa.<br /><br />If you're not worried about labels, and you like mildly spicy, this product is for you.

review/summary: Pretty good, but not sure what to do with it yet
review/text: This is a smoky, creamy, and just very mildly spicy sauce.  If that's what you're looking for you'd likely enjoy it a lot, but for me, it made figuring out just what to do with it a little difficult.  Typically when I make tacos, etc, I just use salsa, sour cream, and sometimes hot sauce, so I'm struggling a bit to figure out where this fits in exactly.  It tastes good, but seems almost unnecessary.<br /><br />One use that seems to work pretty well is adding it to a taco salad.  It's kind of a nice addition to keep the flavors a bit more interesting and I might keep some around for that.  It could also add a bit of variety to sandwiches if one is in the mood for something a little different than the norm; perhaps on a southwest style Panini or similar.  I might also try it for dipping chicken nuggets or wings, etc.<br /><br />Overall it seems like a pretty good product, but not something I'd be likely to use daily or even a couple times a week, so I may pick up a bottle every now and then but I probably won't buy a 6-pack of them.  I would rate it perhaps 4 stars on taste but it loses a few points for versatility since it's not really hot sauce, taco sauce, salsa, sandwich spread, or salad dressing, it's kind of something else that I have trouble classifying.

review/text: First the texture is like thin ranch dressing. It is not overly spicy. It is smooth, smoky, and has enough spice in it to be tasty but still not overpowering. The main ingredient is soybean oil if you ask. I tried it with burritos. It worked out great. I believe it works with burgers or tacos as well. I am even thinking using it as dipping sauce for chips if I cannot find the real one. It is is a good new sauce to try.

review/text: This tea is a true English luxury, but once you taste it, it is difficult to be satisfied with less than the finest tea this company makes. Yorkshire Gold tea has more flavor and character than most teas.<br /><br />The secret seems to be in the high quality of the teas selected for Yorkshire Gold and in the shape of the tea bag which allows for the tea leaves to spread out more and I think this enhances the ability for a full tea flavor to develop.<br /><br />This tea blend is perfect to steep along with a cinnamon stick. It is strong enough to serve with whipped cream and a dash of nutmeg.<br /><br />The art on the box was painted by Lizzie Sanders and it sets a nice English mood for your tea drinking experience.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: The taste... well it may take some creativity
review/text: As far as taste, what can we ask for? Plain with milk it's only passable. But heck, it's a hemp protein. Now there are ways of making it taste better and it's a nutritious product. Not too shabby is adding about a half of a decent sized frozen banana (a natural sweetener, thickener, and flavoring) to 8 oz of milk (I use organic fat free milk) to 3 tablespoons of the product. This tasted pretty good, and I would have no problem drinking it like this every day. So what I am saying is that for products like these that don't taste like a Steak and Shake milkshake or a Wendy's Frosty, one would need to experiment to find something that is suitable as far as taste to the consumer. I did think about giving four stars for taste, but it's not god awful and can be gotten around with a little creativity. Plus we are dealing with hemp here so I don't think it would be fair. This is the first hemp protein I have tried so maybe there are better tasting ones out there. However, since I like the way I made it above with the banana and may be able to find other good tasting concoctions, I may be just running risk and find something worse by seeking elsewhere. If I were to stick with this one, and I may, the bottom line then becomes final price. I am not a pure vegan although I do restrict meat intake and usually stick to salmon and chicken breasts when I do eat meat. So I use a supplement like this to fill in days when I don't get enough protein from animal products. I won't eat soy protein, trace amounts notwithstanding, and I would not put Splenda or sucralose (poison) in my system so I needed an alternative protein shake/smoothy. All the regular good tasting standard bodybuilding proteins use sucralose to sweeten them. Well, the ones I like and have used anyway. Even these latter mentioned ones that have the best relative taste, don't taste like an unhealthy milkshake anyway.<br /><br />Update 3/14/2012: Ok this is how I drink it now, and I love it. 8 oz of Pacific Brand organic oat non-dairy beverage (any kind of milk such as hemp, almond, or soy can be used), 1 medium banana, 1/2 cup of raw organic oatmeal (we buy this in the bulk section at Whole Foods), 4 tablespoons of this Hemp Protein, 1 packet of Sweet Leaf Stevia. This is my breakfast every other day. One can add a tablespoon of organic freshly ground (at the store which make it nothing but ground nuts) nut butter if you are not too worried about fat. To me the oatmeal really makes it great.

Just understand that the taste is at best tolerable, even with cocoa powder and sugar among the ingredients!  That's how awful hemp tastes....

review/summary: We like it...
review/text: After trying SOOOO many powders we did settle on this one as being pleasing to the whole family.<br />One of the problems we've had with a lot of the other protein powders is constipation (especially Garden of Life -- holy cow!)<br /><br />The taste of this product in middle-of-the-road; their not going to win any awards.  But if you add stuff (banana, nut butter etc.) I don't think the taste will be a deterrent.  As with all hemp powders it is a tad gritty.<br /><br />Nothing to write home about, but overall:<br /><br />1) My family prefers this one<br />2.) I am good with the product and ingredients<br />3.) It's affordable

review/summary: Manitoba Dark Chocolate Hemp Powder
review/text: This is very grainy and chalky like most other hemp powders I've tried. The taste is fine ( I like chocolate better than other flavors) but I also mix it with vanilla hemp milk, coconut milk, chocolate milk, or whatever else I feel like adding that morning. Tastes don't bother me as much as textures do so if you're like me then the grainy/chalky feel of this is going to be too much on it's own. I have to mix it up with the Nutiva brand hemp powder to smooth it out a little and make it stretch (because Nutiva is more expensive) but is the best that I've had so far.<br /><br />This is pretty much what I was expecting though and you have to remember it is a HEALTH shake and it isn't going to taste fantastic but you can do a lot to alter it more to your liking. If I actually used a real blender and added fruit and honey and some things like that to it the graininess could probably be cut down but I'm lazy and don't have time in the mornings to do that and I'm fine with what I do.

review/summary: Awful tasting protein partially masked by rich chocolate - 4x as expensive as rice protein alternatives
review/text: As an omnivore with a 100-200 gram daily protein intake, I am always looking to diversify my protein sources.  For protein supplements, I find the best value at Costco when purchasing Cytosport whey protein that costs approximately 2.2 cents per gram of protein.  Yet, it gets boring eating from the same six pound bag for months.  So, I recently evaluated two vegetable-based protein supplements: Nutribiotic Rice Protein and Manitoba Harvest Hemp Protein, both with chocolate flavoring.  While the Rice protein has great economics, tastes fantastic and contains few carbs, this hemp protein fails in all three categories.<br /><br />When I initially tasted Manitoba Harvest Hemp Protein, the first thought that came into my mind was "is this product really suitable for human consumption!?"  Olfactory memories from large-scale grass cutting arose.  Even with the rich dark chocolate, I can't consume this protein straight or even mixed with milk.  The pungent taste needs to be blunted with large amounts of cinnamon and Splenda and/or mixing with high protein cereals such as Kashi or Special K.<br /><br />Another undesirable aspect of this protein includes the large amount of carbohydrates:  2.1 grams for every gram of protein. The economics are underwhelming as well.  It costs about 10.8 cents per gram of protein versus 2.7 cents per gram for the Nutribiotic Rice protein or 2.2 cents per gram of protein for the Cytosport offering at Costco.<br /><br />Cons<br />Terrible taste<br />High carb content<br />Poor economics<br /><br /> Pros<br />Rich dark chocolate flavoring

review/text: These chow mein noodles are absolutely delicious!  They are so much better than typical ramen noodles.  The seasoning packet is a little bit sweeter, and these noodles aren't nearly as salty-tasting as the typical ramen noodles.  The seaweed also gives it an extra oomph.<br /><br />The price offered through Amazon is cheaper than anywhere else I've seen.  This is a good deal!<br /><br />One last thought:  I've noticed, and this goes for all the ramen noodles I've had, that adding a little bit of olive oil to the water as they cook brings out the flavor a little more.  Plus, the noodles won't glop together while trying to eat them.<br /><br />In any event, these are wonderful noodles - sometimes I get on a kick and eat these noodles every day for a week or so.  These are "gourmet" ramen noodles.  Ha!  Please do try them!

review/summary: The best instant Chow Mein noodles out there - BAR NONE
review/text: UPDATE: Amazon no longer carries these, so I went to VeryAsia dot com and you can get the 24-pack for about $20-21 shipped!<br /><br />I've been a huge fan of Sapporo Ichiban chow mein noodles for what must be close to 20 years now.  They were always so hard to find at local stores that I often went months or even years without them. I remember going to the store and if they had them I'd literally empty the shelf for fear I'd never see them again.  Now they are here on Amazon for an affordable, great price!  These are not your average mediocre 'instant' noodle. Their unique flavor has no equal on the shelf. You have to get THIS particular one though...the one with the white package with the red stripes on each side, red and orange Japanese lettering on a yellow background. Beware of competing brands for they taste nowhere near as good! This is the one!

If you get these, don't make the same mistake I did in preparing them like a traditional ramen noodle bowl.  Drain the noodles from the water, toss them dry with the flavoring packets and some vegetables thrown in, and you'll be set for a delicious meal.<br /><br />When made correctly, these noodles are awesome.

review/summary: A bit dissapointed
review/text: I've eaten so much ramen in the past year due to not having a car on campus. It's easier to just buy a bunch in case i ever out of food  and won't starve when it's snowing outside.<br />I decided to buy some online to find a better variety than just the chicken, beef or shrimp they offer at the store.<br />I thought it would be thinner noodles but its not. The sauce packet (powder) tastes like worcestershire sauce like the reviews say, but thats all i tasted. The seaweed flakes didn't go so well for me either. There is a slight spice which is usual with the worcestshire. Personally it was just lacking something and wasn't all that appetizing.<br />I will try adding ingredients and see how that goes. I think the preferred cooking method is stovetop for a reason.<br />I don't think it's any healthier than maruchan ramen noodles either.<br />It's made in the usa though, not that that says anything about it. Shipped super fast with chosen standard shipping.<br />Overall judgement: I wish i could say i like it, but i don't.

review/summary: Good delicious noodles
review/text: Hi,<br /><br />These noodles are hard to find in my local grocery store so instead,<br />I just ordered them from Amazon.com  When I drove out of town, I used<br />to buy them by the dozen and I always enjoyed them.  Each pack has a seaweed pack, and regular ramen noodle season pack, except it is somewhat sweet.  Sometimes your stomach doesn't want a bannana, a piece of cake or an apple for a snack, then you just eat one of these chow mein noodles and you are set.  You may also find it takes a while before your main meal is done, these don't take long before it is done.  You just add a little water, enough that it evaporates the noodles, and that the noodles have their soft & you could even overcook them about 2% so they have a little crisp and soft to them.  There's nothing more to it, they are either a snack or an appetizer dish.

review/text: These noodles take just a couple of minutes to make and there is only one flavoring pack.  IndoMie noodles are absolutely fantastic and cheaper, but take a little more effort to make - I buy both brands and use as the mood strikes me.  The reason I'm writing a review, however, is more about the price.  Every Asian store I've been to that sells this noodle pack charges around .68, so it's definitely worth buying these at an Asian store (though not all Asian stores sell Sapporo).  I'm hoping Amazon will start selling the boxes of these for less than the Asian stores sell single packets! (Hint . . . hint, Amazon.) Just a note,too - IndoMie noodles are about half the price of these, at least at the Asian markets.

review/summary: Best Noodle Mix Out There
review/text: I will start by being forthright about the negative aspects of this product. Mainly, that the noodles and sauce in Sapporo Ichiban's Yakisoba Chow Mein noodle pack are full of monosodium glutamate, a chemical "flavor enhancer" often found in Asian restaurants and store-bought Asian cuisine. The numerous studies done on the ingredient, however, have only yielded inconclusive results about the negative effects that MSG has on the body. The rule I follow is to try to consume all things in moderation. Although these are delicious, I prevent myself from overindulging for the sake of my own health.<br /><br />That said, these noodles are some of the best I have ever tasted and hardly have any majorly different ingredients from other mainstream noodle packs anyway. The seaweed packet goes great with everything else, and the predominant benefit for me is that THESE ARE VEGAN. For those of us who get depressed wandering through the ethnic food section of supermarkets searching through products with oyster and fish sauce and beef and chicken broth, this is the way to go. I like to fry some tofu and vegetables in a saut&eacute;e pan before adding the noodles and it is SO GOOD. These are certainly not the most authentic noodles that you will find out in the world, but they are quick and filling and VERY SATISFYING and also CHEAP. It's hard for me to imagine a better deal.

review/text: Now that I know I can get these from Amazon, I won't have to special order them through my grocer.  I used to live in Japan, and I really enjoyed yaki-soba (Japanese noodles) when I lived there.  BTW - these ARE NOT ramen.  These have Ramen-like noodles, but the powder is yaki-soba flavored, and when you cook them the right way you end up with a flavored noodle, not a soup.  I like to add peas and meat...ham is best.  You can add other things, as well, but this is my lunch of choice when I am home on weekends.<br /><br />Believe it or not, these noodles capture the lion's share of flavor of the yaki soba shops and street vendors I used to frequent when I lived in Japan.<br /><br />5 yummy stars!<br /><br />Just make sure that you follow the directions that come on the back for best results!

review/summary: Yummy, sweet, salty noodles!
review/text: I love these noodles.  They are my favorite "ramen" style packet food - but *NOT* ramen.  I've been calling them "chow mein" for some time, but other reviewers are right, they are Japanese Yakisoba style noodles.<br /><br />They are cheaper here on Amazon than I can find them in stores, but more importantly, consistently available.  Some local stores have them for $0.99-$1.25, but I have noticed they are incredibly difficult to find.  They seem to be carried randomly. I'll find a store that carries them, buy a dozen, and next time I go back they no longer carry them.<br /><br />The noodles are a wonderfully sweet, rich, salty, tangy-ish flavor.  Personally, I love them, but I know the flavor is NOT for everyone.  Every time I cook them, my husband always says, "ooh, that smells good, can I have a bite?" and immediately makes his "gross face" when he tastes it.  EVERY TIME.  So its a love-or-hate kind of food.  But me?  I LOVE them.  As a side note, they come with a small packet of green seaweed type stuff, but I hate the way it tastes (and even smells - ick!), so I always omit it.<br /><br />(And I'm a vegetarian, so these noodles are perfect for me.)<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Quick to prepare<br />- Flavorful<br />- Cheap<br />- Unique<br />- Vegetarian<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Sometimes inconsistent availability (outside Amazon)<br />- Packet of green "stuff" (personal preference)<br />- I wish they had a "1.5 packet" size. One packet is sometimes not enough, two is too much.

This company does make a 100% juice which is what I thought I was buying, as the labels are very similar.  Their 100% juice is great, but cost more.

Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

review/summary: AWESOME! BOLD! DELICIOUS!
review/text: These are SICK! I bought barbeque flavored almonds and chili/lime flavors just to distract others while I eat these amazing nuts. They are fairly salty, so I mix them with plain roasted almonds when indulging at home...but really, they are the most amazing party nuts you'll ever have. Trader Joes has a version that is a lot cheaper but not, to my mind, as good - not quite blow your face off tasty. Fortunately, some of my friends can only stomach mild flavors - otherwise I would be spending a fortune in nuts every time people come over.<br /><br />Well done, Blue Diamond!

review/text: I love sushi so I have always craved the combination of soy, wasabi and raw fish.  I never would have though that wasabi would go well with nuts.  But these almonds are spectacular!  I have to be careful not to eat too many at once.  I don't know how long these combos have been on the market, but I think they are brilliant.  I also like the Lime and Chili and the Habanero BBQ.  But the Wasabi and Soy is my # 1 favorite!  Thank goodness that almonds are good for you.  And even though they have a lot of kick, all three flavors are low in sodium.

I've tried other organic mac and cheese products and I would have to recommend that you buy one box at the store before spending on 12.  I wish I did because it has been a year now and I'm struggling to finish the pack ( I hate to waste food).  My kids don't even want it so I will not buy again.  I gave it  3 stars because it IS organic and it is edible but not "great".

review/text: A neighbor recently bought my dog an antler from a speciality pet store and my dog absolutely loved it!  However, I couldn't justify the $24 price tag that came with it.  This anter, although slightly smaller, was such a great value that I had to try it.  The 4-5" description is accurate although misleading if you read it along with the word "giant."  My dog is a bloodhound mix weighing almost 100 pounds and can almost fit the whole anter in his mouth.  However, he does love it so I let him chew on it with proper supervision.  I definitely recommend this product if your dog is an intense chewer and you're sick of gross slobbery rawhide (the antler is a much cleaner and natural alternative)!

review/summary: A Tasty hot sauce with a very fresh taste. Quite mild yet very tasty. Highly recommended!.
review/text: I really like this hot sauce. It offers some gentle heat along with the wonderful taste of the Jalape&ntilde;o chile. This is a very rare hot sauce, one of only a very few, where the actual chile is the major ingredient. More often it is water.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): Jalape&ntilde;o peppers, then water and salt - in that order. After those ingredients comes an acid (which is a chemically refined version of vinegar) and a few preservatives<br /><br />A Jalape&ntilde;o chile is not very hot ---- so this sauce is quite mild. If you like this as much as I do -- you'll go through a number of bottles every year. I wish it was sold in a larger size!<br /><br />There is a freshness and purity to this sauce which I really enjoy and it is quite rare. That sense of "freshness" is very unusual.<br /><br />I have about 30 hot sauces in my home right now. I enjoy taste testing them and writing up my results. I'd easily place this sauce in my top 5.<br /><br />*Note: this sauce can be very expensive to purchase on-line given the very high per unit shipping charges. That price could easily change if a new seller decides to offer it.  You may want to purchase this one locally or wait until a better seller appears on Amazon. Some sellers really profit from their high shipping charges!<br /><br />So purchase a sample on-line but if you like it you are far better off purchasing it locally until Amazon sells it directly or another company comes on-line offering better discounts on shipping multiple bottles at once

They get the food to you quickly and pack it great, so the jelly rings are in tack when they arrive. If you love jelly rings, get them from this seller. Thanks.

review/summary: Brand of choice in my home
review/text: We get this kind of salt for most baking and basic table use. It doesn't have a noticeable iodine flavor like some iodized salts have and it's fine and pours well. Kept in a dry cupboard it stays clump free very nicely.<br />Since we don't use much salt at all, this size canister will last us at least a year. I like the flavor of this salt in my soups very well. The fine grains mix well into my baking.

review/summary: Fancy Feast, why are you using so many fillers?!?!
review/text: Okay, I admit it.<br />I was sucked in my the most adorable, romantic commercials for a cat food product that I have<br />ever seen. I vowed to buy at least some Fancy Feast each week just to show my support for that commercial!  LOL<br /><br />The cats love the wet food. It is very expensive, and from what I have read on the labels, you are<br />definitely paying for the IMAGE, not the quality or quantity of the food. (The cans are only 3 ounces<br />compared with 5.5 ounces in the other can styles.) I still get it, and they love the ones with cheese the most.<br /><br />So, I thought we'd give the dry food a try. I had my husband grab a bag when he was at the grocery store.<br />How bad could it be, right?  Same company, same "gourmet" promotion on the foods, so surely it has great stuff<br />in it, right?  Well, shocker - NOPE.<br /><br />Fancy Feast is made by the Purina company in St Louis, MO. They are the same ones who make the generic dog chow,<br />cat chow, rabbit chow, ________ (fill in the blank) critter chow.  They are all full of fillers that animals don't need,<br />because it is cheap to manufacture. Why I thought this might be different, I do not know.<br /><br />First off, food mfgs have found the kitty equivalent of addictive MSG, and load their foods with it.<br />This one is no different. Note that BOTH our cats went crazy over this food, inhaling it out of my hand<br />before I could even get more out of the package. Fancy Feast knows how to make things that smell/taste good to cats.<br />However, most food mfgs know how to make things that TASTE good - how they got there, well, you might not really want to know.<br /><br />Here's the ingredients list (which is in the order of the QUANTITY of the item) for this "gourmet" cat chow - bear with me, this is<br />a really long list of iffy ingredients, artificial junk and food coloring):<br /><br />Brewers Rice<br />Poultry By Product Meal<br />CORN GLUTEN meal<br />Animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols<br />Ground Yellow Corn<br />Soybean Meal<br />Animal Liver Flavor<br />Chicken<br />Turkey<br />Phosphoric Acid<br />Calcium Carbonate (in case they get indigestion?! This is what's in Tums!)<br />Salt<br />Natural & Artificial Flavors (more unspecified stuff?)<br />Potassium Chloride<br />Dried Yeast<br />Choline Chloride<br />Added Color, Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2 and "other colors" (Why?!?)<br />Taurine<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Ferrous Sulfate<br />Vitamin E Supplement<br />Niacin<br />Manganese Sulfate<br />Vitamin A Supplement<br />Calcium Pantothenate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Copper Sulfate<br />Riboflavin Supplement<br />Vitamin B12 Supplement<br />Pyridoxine<br />Hydrochloride<br />Folic Acid<br />Vitamin D3 Supplement<br />Calcium Iodate<br />Biotin<br />Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (a form of Vit K)<br />Sodium Selenite.<br /><br />Sounds yummy, huh?<br />The meat is way down the list, after all the corn, soybean and rice fillers and glutens.<br /><br />How on earth does cat food need artificial food dyes?  The cats won't care.<br />There are many known reactions to food dyes in people - I am sure our pets don't need it either.<br />Was the food too yellow with all the grain meal and gluten, or too white from all the fats?<br /><br />So, the cats love it. I will now consider this the equivalent of a bag of potato chips for humans -<br />okay some times, but NOT all the time. I'll have to watch our oldest cat. He gets super itchy with wheat<br />grain or gluten in foods, so I'll watch for reactions to the corn.<br /><br />Cats are carnivorous, and do not eat grains in the wild. However, especially with the manufacturing plant<br />smack dab in farming country, they can apparently get all kinds of leftover grains cheap?<br /><br />If you buy this for your kitties, just know that you are buying the IMAGE more than a quality food.<br />This is not really different than the super cheap pet foods that cost half as much or less.<br />But the bag is nice and shiny and the photo of the kitty is cute.<br /><br />Overall, I was really disappointed to read that ingredients list, when they could do SO much better for our pets.<br />We'll use this as their treats, rather than their main dry food. We'll stick with our Blue Buffalo for that, which is<br />grain free and actually has meat for the first ingredient!<br /><br />Fancy Feast - marketing genius, but sloppy on the nutrition.

review/summary: Ruby likes it.
review/text: I feed it to my cat Ruby.  She likes it.  I give it to her as a supplement to her fancy feasts cans which she devours.  She gets 2 of those a day.  Saves the hassle of buying it at Walmart.  Almost the same price, but hey,  no tax and it's delivered to my front door! Can't beat that these days.

review/summary: I thought this was going to be a good deal/And it is
review/text: I thought this was going to be a good deal, but it is not so hot. I have a hard time carrying heavy items into the house and buy many heavy items through Amazon Prime (Also note that shipping is automatically free when you use Subscribe and Save). I am referring to heavy items that I use repeatedly like cat food, soup, and laundry detergent. Anyway, cat food like dry Fancy Feast can cost quite a bit at the store. Then it has to be taken off the grocery shelf, loaded into the cart, taken out of the cart and paid for and then lugged home etc. It requires a lot of manipulating to get to the kitty feeding station. So, when able, I get it delivered on Arizona Prime. The price for the bags was Fantastic: two 3 lb. bags for $7.19...much less that the grocery store or PetsMart. But, THEN, the dreaded shipping cost was added. That boosted the price to $13.18. THEN the deal does not look so hot. You are back at grocery stores prices then and all that is saved is the lugging about.<br />My Kitties prefer Fancy Feast in the dry food and like all the varieties. I mix them up by adding a scoop of chicken, a scoop of filet mignon, and a scoop of fish to the mix and the kitties eat contentedly off and on all day. They are active litle critters with whom I play and they have no weight problems so free feeding works for us.<br />I like the little kibble bites that Fancy Feast makes. It seems to be just the right size for the cats to eat since it is not so thick as other kibble bites. Makes it easy to pick up and toss back into the bowl when they spill. With 2 flavors per bite, it looks appealing and the cats doing the eating seem to agree. I may do the major part of my buying from Amazon but if PetCo or PetsMart is having a sale on dry Fancy Feast, I stock up. It easily keeps for 6-8 months in my garage or closet and the kitties eat it just as if it were purchased yesterday. That is a Big benefit for me since I buy in bulk if I feel up to loading and carrying heavy items about.<br />The other creatures who prefer Fancy Feast dry are my neighborhood Feral Kitty Buddies and the birds. If I have dry food out for the ferals and they do not finish it (perhaps they caught a mouse today) then the birdies swoop in and finish it off.<br />So, in the end, I am a great fan of Fancy Feast dry, as are my critters, but I do not care for the shipping. Next time I will wait until a Prime deal comes available.<br />After I wrote this item up I went back to look at it to see why I had ordered something with shipping attached. Turns out, I did not. It is available on "Subscribe and Save" which is how I had set it up. So you can get this deal without shipping. Just sign up for Subscribe and Save. Then it is, once again, an extremely reasonable price, and arrives on your doorstep at needed intervals. Could life get better?!<br /><br />LIFE JUST GOT BETTER: January 2012. These are pricier, BUT, they have the advantage of coming in very small bags, so that I am able to handle them easily. The larger the bag, the less the cost, but for convenience, nothing can beat this. And again, it comes right to your door!<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00437H0OA">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042DEDJA">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042DHP04">Purina Pet Care Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold, 16-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a>Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold Cat Food Ocean Fish, 16 oz - 12 Pack

review/summary: Where is FANCY FEAST MADE?
review/text: I looked on the label and it only says the bag is printed in the USA. It gives no reference to where this food is made and although she gets this as a treat, I still want nothing that came from CHINA!!!<br />Hard these days I know. But for my kitty, only the best! So where in the heck is this food made?<br />Anyone know?

review/summary: Randi Inhales This Stuff...
review/text: My cat would leap a 10 foot canyon to get a bowl of this stuff.<br /><br />I used to feed her the wet canned food, but it made her kitty box smell twice as bad.<br /><br />I also don't particularly enjoy the sound of a siren coming from my pets mouth, which is what she'd do each morning and night for a half-can of the goods.<br /><br />Now she free eats this and loves it almost as much as her old wet food rituals. Occasionally I'll give her wet food, which she still literally inhales, but this is my definite choice second to that.<br /><br />I question the quality of the food, Fancy Feast is an image, and you pay for that. I've read similar things online, but if your cat is a picky eater and turns away other brands, i'd suggest giving this one a shot.

review/summary: Outstanding Tea in Proprietary Pouch
review/text: *****<br />This tea is a lovely premium black (caffeinated) tea made with high quality whole tea leaves and Madagascar vanilla bean bits stored in a special proprietary pouch instead of a conventional tea bag. The Mighty Leaf pouch has won awards; it is made of a biodegradable and compostable corn-based material, and it's beautiful as well. The pouch has lots of room in it for the tea to unfurl for richer flavor. No glue, no staples. And it's stitched with unbleached cotton thread; the company is careful with details to maximize your tea drinking experience and to keep it healthy for you and good for the environment.<br /><br />The tea is full-bodied, rich, and smooth. You can taste the vanilla in it, but it's a clean and subtle taste, not artificial tasting like some vanilla teas. It is my favorite vanilla black tea, and one of my favorite all-time teas. It was the first Mighty Leaf Tea I've ever tried, but it won't be my last.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: My favorite hotsauce for flavour over 100's of others.
review/text: I've been collecting hotsauces from all over the world for the last 5 years.  I own hundreds of different types. This is not even close to being the hottest.  But it has the best combination of heat and flavour I have tasted.<br />It is my first choice for putting on chicken wings or peameal on a bun (it's a Canadian thing) or if I just want to<br />spice up some meat or scrambled eggs. This is of course a subjective thing but I have tasted no better hot sauce from anywhere.<br /><br />And now if you'll excuse me I have to go find a deal on a couple more cases.  They discontinued this for a couple of years and now brought it back.  But I'm down to my last case.
