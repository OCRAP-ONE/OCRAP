review/text: Great coffee. I received this as a Christmas gift, and decided to treat myself. I especially like the fact that this benefits U.S. farmers. Most coffee is imported, so it's nice to know it's grown in the U.S. Like most things produced in the U.S., it costs a little more than imports, but it's worth it.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I took a chance on this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews that I read.  The package arrived within three days of ordering, and the coffee was sealed in a standard vacuum-sealed bag.  I opened the bag and noticed that the coffee smelled stale.  Normally fresh-roasted coffee has a certain "life" to the scent, but these beans smelled as if they had been on a shelf for a while.  I brewed the coffee and the flavor was similarly uninspiring.  The coffee was mellow, as expected, but the flavor was flat.  I have had high quality Kona in the past, and this sample is clearly inferior to my previous experience.<br /><br />This is the first time I have troubled to review a product sold by Amazon.  I have no previous experience with this coffee roaster, and since others found their coffee to be to their liking, it is possible that something went wrong with this particular batch.  I am pleased to report that Amazon has refunded me for this purchase.

review/summary: Poor Taste
review/text: After reading the reviews I decided to order a bag and try it. I had had numerous styles of Kona coffee over the years and love the smell and flavor. When it arrived I ground some up and brewed up a pot. The smell was there but the flavor was lacking. It was missing that Kona pop that I have experienced in the past with other coffee's. Over the next few weeks I tried different brewing combinations. No matter what I tried, it was quite bland and just did not have any flavor. I was quite disappointed by the coffee.

review/summary: no quality consistency
review/text: The first time I ordered this it was heavenly.  The beans were dark brown and oily, smell divine, and the brew was caramely, smooth and perfect!<br />So, I splurged and ordered another bag and claimed that it would be my weekend coffee.<br />I was greatly disappointed with my Saturday morning brew.  The second bag, the beans were light tan, and lacked that oily sheen, and smelled slightly bitter.  The brew was lacking depth, and slightly bitter, not much better than a grocery store medium colombian roast.  Now, I don't even want to brew it.<br />The product is too pricey to risk product consistency and I will not purchase it again.

review/summary: Wrong Roast!
review/text: Ordered Kona Bean DARK ROAST and received MEDIUM ROAST.  This was the same reason I switched to Amazon for ordering as no one at the Kona Coffee plantations seems to know the difference between MEDIUM and DARK roasts!!  VERY ANNOYING!!!!!  I would try and return this, however, I didn't realize the issue until I opened the bag and noticed the tan beans instead of the expected dark brown/black beans.<br /><br />Fortunately Amazon shipped a new bag of dark roast at no extra cost!  Thank You Amazon!<br /><br />The Dark Roast is great and has a rich flavor (now that I have it).  I've always loved Dark Roast and Kona Dark Roast is my absolute favorite.  Thanks Amazon for keeping me a happy customer.

review/summary: stale coffee beans
review/text: The coffee beans are large and have even size. The package stated the expiration date is in June. However, upon opening the package, beans looks too oily. Not a good sign!<br />I uses AeroPress for my coffee and inverted method most of the time. I had been making coffee from mostly home roasted beans. This cup of coffee is the worst. It's not bitter or sour but just banal and smell/taste awful.<br />If you are interested in Kona, you might want to look somewhere else.<br /><br />Update:<br />To be fair, one star might be too low. I update it to two stars for the visual appeal of the bean.

Last time it was air-tight tins of LaVazza ground, so it is not so bad at least I can drink though not enjoy. But this time the staled beans with pathetic taste really disappointed me a lot!!! I can't even bear the espresso made with this beans. Next time think twice if you will order coffee online, especially those beans bags. Since I lived in New York City, I should have listened to my friend and buy those freshly roasted beans from less than a week ago at local espresso shops.

Initially, 2 or 3 drops was all we could handle in a dish, but now it's really not that hot (I'm not bragging here). Now, a teaspoon seems to be just the right amount. The flavor is what really stands out. Much more so than most other sauces, this stuff really adds flavor. The peppers are sweet and tasty and when used in cooking really become an important ingredient adding more flavor than heat. Don't get me wrong, the stuff is hot no doubt - it's just yummy hot. Enjoy.

I am one of those people who thinks that what restaurants label spicy is what I would call mild.<br /><br />However, this hot sauce kicked my ass.

If you are 100% insane then you should definitely buy this hot sauce and eat it with everything, especially chicken tostadas.

review/summary: Great if you're one of those people who need the burn
review/text: I'm a spice addict, I admit it.  I keep 3 types of hot spices at work and poor hot sauce or hot pepper powder in my coffee, on my fruit, in everything I eat (except ice cream.... so far).<br /><br />This stuff knocked me out with just very small amounts the first time I tried it.  Now I'm slowly working my way through the bottle and loving it.<br /><br />I mostly came to look at these reviews because I was curious where this stuff rates on the scoville scale -<br /><br />One website lists it at 40,000 Scoville (seems way too low to me, though that's compared to Tobasco sauce listed at 2,500 scoville by the same site).  That puts it below all the "Dave's... " and "357..." lines of hot sauces.<br /><br />Just for comparison, most websites list cayenne pepper as 30,000-50,000 scoville, but I can pour large quantities of cayenne pepper powder (trader joe's brand) into my food or eat it raw with no trouble, just a mild burn.  And this 100% Pain is WAY BEYOND that.  A very small amount of it will make a large bowl of soup almost too hot for me.<br /><br />Also, Original Juan's website lists this stuff in the same category with their "Da Bomb" line of salsas, which all have listed measurements of 119,000 scoville upward.  That seems far more realistic to me than 40,000 scoville -<br /><br />If you're not sure you can handle this level, try the Pain 85% for a lil more flavor and a lil less heat.  I haven't tried that one yet myself but I hear it's a pretty significant heat difference.

review/text: This is an outstanding sauce.  The heat's there, yes, believe me!  But so is the taste.  I'm on my second bottle.  I use it when I want to raise the heat without adding the usual vinegar-y taste that so many hot sauces add to flavors.  Under the heat, though, is a well-blended sauce.  Start by using a few drops, then ramp up to a level of heat you enjoy.  Remember, heat is not taste.  This has both.

Every package now must be examined to ensure the products don't have nuts and aren't processed on equipment that also processes nuts.<br /><br />Well, after checking package after package at grocery stores, super stores, and the like, this is the only nut-free product I've been able to find.

Bottom line though, my toddler LOVES them. Highly recommended!

My 3 month old has a gluten (wheat) allergy and these are completely safe for her to eat.  My 9 month old has a few teeth and, since these fall apart fairly easily in his mouth, he has no trouble eating them at all.  We have tried a few of the other fruits but they have been tougher for him to chew (especially the bananas!).<br /><br />If you buy them in a large package and don't find yourself eating them as quickly as we do, you may want to separate them into a few batches as they do get just a little soft after being open for a while (this doesn't affect the taste).<br /><br />A note--be sure to save the powder at the bottom of the container!  It is a delicious thing to sprinkle over cereal or yogurt!

The strawberries came in a two pack, so I immediately opened the other pack thinking the first one was just a bad batch...no, those too were very soft and chewy.  I purchase these (expensive) items because I expected them to be crunchy like the small one serving packs I purchase at Walmart.  Not even close.  Kicker of this all...you cannot return food items for a refund (this was our first time purchasing food through Amazon so I did not realized this until I went to send them back).  Not a good buy...

review/summary: NOT PRODUCED IN THE U.S.A.
review/text: My wife and I ordered these for our 1 year old to snack on. We are not "it has to be organic people" but we do like items grown in the U.S. so we can be somewhat assured that there are some controls on the food. We purchased these because the product description clear states PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES. Well, that is not the case. On the packaging it states (Product of the USA, Chile, South America and Mexico). Apparently Chile isn't part or South America and South America is its own country...<br />I will not be buying from this producer any more......

review/summary: So tasty
review/text: I love freeze dried fruit. It is my favorite go to snack all day. If you are new to this product there are a few things that are good to know. First, in order to protect the texture of the product, they need to be kept in an air tight container. I like to use them in my trail mixes, but they will only last a day before getting soft. Second, if you get a fruit with color, like a blueberry, it is going to turn your mouth blue and dirty looking. I love them, but only eat those products in the privacy of my home with my toothbrush near by. All in all an excellent product. I love that nothing is added to them and Just Tomatoes is priced very well for the amount you get. I like to buy the big containers to avoid unnecessary packaging. The sour cherries and the strawberries are my favorite and complement one another very well!

review/text: We actually try to get the organic ones when available, but both are equal in flavor. My 21 month old grandchild loves them almost as much as fresh berries. They are a good travel snack and fit into her snack cup easily, plus they are much neater than fresh berries. I save the powder and small pieces to add to applesauce for another treat. The blueberries are another favorite.

review/summary: Love them on cereal!
review/text: I love Just Strawberries on my cereal each morning when fresh ones are not in season. I actually get a little panicky when I'm running low on them and dread having to eat "naked cereal." :P  Love to snack on them on their own, too. They're basically freeze-dried, so when you eat them, the moisture in your mouth makes them so they're almost like fresh strawberries (emphasis on the 'almost,' since there's really no substitute for fresh berries, of course).<br />Definitely agree with others that they can get a bit less crunchy if either left open for a while or not eaten relatively soon after opening, but I don't usually have that issue with this size container. When I get the larger size container, I empty the whole thing into a sealed Mason jar, and that works great to keep them perfectly crunchy.  Either way, flavor is not affected, and when I'm going to put them in cereal with milk anyway, then it really doesn't matter at all.<br />Can't recommend highly enough.  Just wish they weren't quite so expensive.

review/text: My 2-year old granddaughter is absolutely addicted to these freeze-dried strawberries!  They are a very healthy, low calorie, delicious snack which she prefers over just about anything.  At $5+ for each 1.5 ounce pouch at the grocery store, it was getting to be pretty pricey to keep her happy.  I was delighted to find these at Amazon at a substantial savings over what I was paying at the grocery store.  The tubs they come in are much nicer for storage than the store pouches.  We will be purchasing more of these in the future.

These have lots of Vit C, unlike raisins and dried cranberries, which have virtually none.  The tubs hold about 2 1/2 or 3 cups since freeze dried fruit is super light weight.  I put the tub inside a large zip lock bag to keep them crisp after the seal is broken.  I also have to hide them as the grownups in the house love them as well.

But it's clear they would be terrific on cereal, probably sprinkled over other items like waffles/pancakes/puddings/sorbet/ice cream/yogurt.<br /><br />I really love this product. Even my "not all that friendly with fruits/veggies" hubby likes these. Note also that a four ounce tub is a really big size! Yay.

Just Tomatoes offers some of their products organic, but not strawberries.<br /><br />And they do go soggy (or at least lose the crunchiness) pretty quickly if you leave the container open, so don't just graze. Shovel some into a bowl and seal the tub up again, that keeps everything crispy.

review/text: I collected up a handful of gourmet hot chocolates for my husband for Valentine's Day this year. This was the only one that included the sorts of ingredients I associate more with cheap hot chocolates like Swiss Miss---partially hydrogenated oils, corn syrup solids, and artificial flavors. Similarly, it has the kind of raw, slightly harsh taste that matches Swiss Miss-type instant cocoas rather than the smoother, more subtle brands such as Moonstruck. It's still very good as long as that's the kind of chocolate you're in the mood for; I recommend it more as an accompaniment to other flavorful foods rather than as a treat on its own. (Subtler hot chocolates can get overwhelmed when served with strongly flavored foods.)

review/summary: Pretty Tasty and not Too Sweet
review/text: These cherry vines have a nice mild cherry flavor. The "no added sugar" label is misleading. These contain "organic corn syrup" rather than "sugar." However, I didn't find these to be overly sweet. Actually, I found these to be less sweet than a lot of dried fruit. And unlike Twizzlers, these left no artificial aftertaste--even after eating a pack in a sitting (I'm a recovering Twizzlers addict, so I used to finish a large pack in a sitting all the time.). They're chewier (and harder) than Twizzlers and have a texture similar to those off-brand red licorice vines that you might find at a gas station or convenience store. The chewier texture did not deter me, however, from eating one vine after another while watching watching TV. The packs are small, so these will go fast: each vine is about 5 inches long and there are about 15 vines in a pack. That said, I wish that they were a little bit cheaper, but considering the great taste and the fact that they're the only brand of gluten-free licorice on the market it's worth the price.

review/text: This is not your typical licorice by a long stretch of the imagination. It's made from corn syrup so you'd think it would be sweet but it's not sweet because there's basically NO flavor at all. The only thing that you can taste is the gritty rice flour. To say the "flavor is mild" is misleading...more like "non-existent" would be closer to the truth. You have to order a whole case of 12 so now I'm stuck with 11 bags of this crud. If you want the taste of cherry - eat dried cherries and pretend they are licorice - at least you'd get some flavor.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I was diagnoised gluten sensitive 2 years ago and their went licorice.  I loved licorice and so did my son who also has the curse of gluten issues. We just finally decided to order some.  Granted I was a bit unsure spending $30 on a box of licorice I had never tried.  My son was so excited when the box arrived.  We torn the first package open to a fruity aroma.  We each took a cherry twist and we both were overjoyed how good it was.  I like the chewy texture I was a fan of Redvines (hated Twizzlers tasted so chemical)  This has a nice flavor and the bonus of being able to savor the twist because of the chewy texture.  Now when we go to the movies my son can feel like a regular kid again-<br /><br />Loryn- Loves Park Illinois

review/text: These taste horrible and are extremely hard. My kids have been gluten free for over 4 years now, so they are not used to the 'typical' gluten containing foods at all, yet they still hated these.<br /><br />They are not sugar free either, they contain corn syrup. I think saying they are sugarfree is very deceiving.

review/summary: came open second time - stale - will not buy again
review/text: first time: I ordered this on a whim and so far it has worked out.  I have made it in both the air popper and the presto microwave popper and both come out fine.  I won't say it is the BEST I have even had but I bought some GV at WM that was pretty bad and had to use it up.  Other GV I had bought before wasn't as bad as this last batch.  This is SO much better than that or at least the first bag was.<br /><br />I keep my popcorn in the freezer in a sealed container.  It lasts longer that way - we did it as kids growing up and I have continued to do it.  So when I got the big bag, I put some in a couple of ziploc bags and put the rest in the Rubbermaid container I keep in the freezer door.  I keep a 3 T measuring cup by it and that amount works well fin the microwave popper.<br /><br />Getting 50 lbs at once would be too much for my limited freezer space.  I will stick to this size bag or smaller.<br /><br />I ordered this a second time - it came open - slit on the seal of the bag.  The second bag was STALE so who knows how long it had been open.  Amazon did refund my money for the slit open bag.  The popcorn was BAD and ended up being tossed.<br /><br />I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Just like the movies
review/text: This popcorn is awesome.  It pops perfectly with very few kernels left unpoped.  Add butter flavored salt, and it taste just like movie theater popcorn and is so addicting that I eat it almost every night.  There is so much in the bag that it will take me a while to get through it, but that means I wont have to worry about running out anytime soon.<br /><br />When doing this on the stove in a covered pot (cover slightly tilted to let steam out), the secret is to heat the oil (3 Tbls) with just a few kernels, and I also sprinkle the butter flavored salt on the oil (about a cap full) before the oil gets hot.  When those kernels start to pop telling you the oil is hot enough, turn off the heat and add the rest of the kernels (1/4 cup), cover and count to 30.  Letting them sit for 30 seconds in the hot oil with the heat off will pre-heat them to pop more consistently.  After the 30, turn the heat back on and once they start to pop, shake the pop occationally to keep the unpoped kernels on the bottom until you hear very few pops, and its done.  You'll love it.  Only add salt to the hot oil and not other flavored seasoning.  Most will burn in the oil so it best to add those to the popcorn after.

Olive oil and sea salt completes the taste I like. Two thumbs & two big toes up on the Great Northern 12.5 pounder!

review/summary: Best Popcorn to-date!
review/text: I too experienced a little hiccup with my first batch of Great Northern Premium popped corn, however, it turned out to be me "undercooking" it that made it taste chewy an unappetizing.  I started my first 1/3 cup batch at 2.30 minutes, trying not to burn it, however, with my second and all subsequent batches, I am using a Nordic Ware popping bowl (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W4UP">Nordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 Cup</a> also bought here on Amazon.com) in our 1000W microwave at 3.05 minutes and it has come out consistently crisp, light and full of flavor each and every time with no burning.  Furthermore, I have almost NO kernels left in the bottom of the bowl.  The Nordic Ware bowl allows you to cook without the need for oils of any kind, a plus for the health-conscience.  To top it off, a little I Can't Believe it's Not Butter 0 calorie spray a few times on top with a light sprinkle of sea salt, a brisk shake to stir it in and you will have the most flavorful, guilt-free movie-time treat, period!  I love this stuff - we are eating two bowls a night, so the size of the bag does not scare us.  I would recommend moving the kernels to an airtight container however, to keep them fresh.  Great Northern, if you are reading this, a resealable bag would be a nice touch to keep the large bag sealed...  Other than that, keep making flawless popcorn kernels, thanks!

review/summary: make great popcorn - just seal it to keep fresh
review/text: My wife and I always loved popcorn, but we are officially popcorn junkies now, thanks to the Whirley-Pop and good, cheap kernels bought in bulk (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052XN0EI">Great Northern Premium Yellow Gourmet Popcorn 12.5 Pounds</a>).  We make popcorn about 2-3 times per week (when watching <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XRLWPQ">Castle: The Complete First Season</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0I4P8">Psych: The Complete First Season</a>), and we've found the best way to make it like movie theater popcorn without spending a fortune on coconut oil (like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YLI9E2">Paragon Coconut Popcorn Popping Oil (Gallon)</a>).<br /><br />For 1/2 cup of unpopped kernels, use 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 Tblsp of corn oil and 2 or 3 Tblsp of margarine, cut into ~1/2 Tblsp chunks for quicker melting (we prefer Imperial margarine - to us, it tastes the most like real butter).  Put the oil and margarine in at the same time, but leave the top open while you crank the handle (this is to let most of the water from the margarine evaporate and escape, and avoids condensation dripping back down and cooling off the oil/margarine mix once the popcorn is added).  Once the margarine is melted and a fair amount of water vapor has escaped (about 30 seconds after the margarine has completely melted), dump the popcorn and salt into the Whirley-Pop and close the top.  Pop as usual.  (Note: 1 whole tsp of salt may seem excessive, but about half will remain on the bottom and sides of the popper when finished.)<br /><br />Just make sure you keep these kernals sealed up tight (with maybe a drop of water, to keep it from drying out) to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I hope you find this method helpful.

review/text: I bought a Great Northern kettle popcorn machine and have been trying different brands/types of popcorn in it: standard store popcorn, Orville R., Fireworks, Trader Joe's Organic, white, yellow, etc.  Decided to try the Great Northern 12.5 lb. bag of yellow corn.  It arrived quickly from Wayfair with no issues other than a small tear in the bag that dropped a handful of kernels into the shipping box.  Dumped the bag into three large freezer bags (which I had planned to do anyway) and  put a cup of corn into the kettle.  Popped quickly, with very large kernels, very few old maids, quite tasty.  So far, I think this is the best I've tried.  And the price is very reasonable.

review/text: There was a tiny tear in the bag upon arrival, but I sealed it with some tape. No big deal. The bag is just as good as any other bag you might find at the grocery store. These kernels do seem a little bit better than Jiffy Lube or Jolly Time or whatever popcorn sold in the grocery store. The kernels pop big and the popcorn tastes fresh. No complaints. I'm not really worried about it drying out. I kept Jiffy Lube popcorn over two years sitting on the shelf, and the kernels did not dry out. I am not sure what desert people are living in that they have popcorn kernels drying out. Just keep it in the bag or a sealed container and it should be fine. I did the math and this bag is cheaper than anything sold in the grocery store. Of course, Rumpenbacker popcorn is ten times as expensive. I never buy Rumpenbacker.

review/summary: It's gourmet popcorn
review/text: I enjoy watching movies at home and to complete the theater experience, I purchased this bag of gourmet popping corn.  I make my popcorn in the microwave in brown paper bags to cut down on using too much butter.  I then use other toppings to add flavor.  The kernels seem decent and I get a decently large bag of popping corn to last me a while.  No complaints yet.

review/summary: Tasted like it was very old ... nothing special
review/text: Tasted like it was very old.<br />When I get home I will check to see if there was a "use by date".<br /><br />I will return since it was a 12.5 pound bag ... or I may use as bird seed etc.<br /><br />When I came back online to write this review, I see the message to signup when this product becomes available again.<br /><br />This suggest that yes I got the last bag and it was very old.<br /><br />UPDATE the next day ...<br />The popcorn bag had an "use by date" MAY 2012<br />That is four months from now.<br />I'm not sure, but I read somewhere (could be wrong here) that the window on popcorn kernels is 3 years from date of packaged. Feel free to correct this if you know this is incorrect.<br /><br />Amazon will refund and emailed shipping label for return. (Thanks Amazon)
