review/summary: Tastes very different from the small cans
review/text: This soup is OK, but a little unsettling since the flavor is so different from that of the delicious Heinz Cream of Mushroom Soup in the smaller cans. I love the soup in the smaller cans, but that was no longer available so I tried this. The flavor just seems strange to me. However, my mother likes it. She guessed Heinz used a different type of mushroom for this large can recipe but we can't be sure. The appearance and consistency of this soup is the same as in the smaller cans.

review/summary: Crunch, tasty, organic and a decent amount of fiber. The catch is the sugar content
review/text: I'm pretty pleased with this cereal. Unlike other high fiber cereals, this tastes pretty good. The flakes are large (about the same size as Frosted Flakes) and very crunchy. Most important, you don't get that "sawdusty" or "cardboardy" taste that fiber cereals often have.<br /><br />The reason for that is two-fold. First, while it is a decent source of fiber it's not nearly as much as cereals such as All-Bran.  This has 7 g of fiber per serving (1 cup), which is 28% of the recommended daily amount. Decent, but not fantastic.<br /><br />It also has quite a bit of sugar - 10g per serving. That's nearly as much as Frosted Flakes - it has 11g of sugar, and is commonly considered to be the archetypical "sugary kids cereal." So if you're looking to keep your sugar intake low, this probably is not a good choice.<br /><br />Calories are also a bit high at 160 per serving (dry cereal).<br /><br />Despite these issues I'm still pretty pleased with this, mainly because I don't have to mix it with another cereal to make it taste good, as I often have to do with other high bran cereals. This is fine on its own. It also packs 100% of the recommended daily amount for Vitamin C, and 25% to 30% for iron, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, B6, folate and B12. Toss in 6g of protein and only 1g of fat, and it's a decent way to start the day.

review/summary: Basic reliable vanilla extract
review/text: McCormick spices aren't exactly world-renowned for bringing bold new taste sensations to the world.  But Vanilla isn't a bold new taste sensation; it's a, well, plain-vanilla product that most bakers will use in quantity.  A baker needs their extract to be consistent, flavorful, and (unless you are made of money) inexpensive.  This is all three.<br /><br />This is not artisinal product that will vary with every batch; this is the exact same vanilla extract bottle after bottle. You can rely on it to always taste the same and since it's the "default" brand of vanilla extract in the US, the person that wrote your recipe probably expected you to use it, or something like it.

review/summary: 16 oz is a huge amount, the picture is decieving, bigger than a soda can
review/text: I got sick of buying Mexican vanilla that wasn't real vanilla, and the blue cattle co. vanilla that just tasted watered down, so you had to use double or triple quantities in everything to get the right taste. If you didn't know, Mexico does not have label standards, or an FDA, and people can sell that non-conforming vanilla online because online purchases are not regulated since they can be cross boarder. It is a classic case of federal government not being able to respond fast enough in a globalizing food market and technology. Coumarin is a toxic substance found in Mexican vanilla (even if it is labeled "organic") that can cause irreversible liver damage from studies I read.<br /><br />I have decided that true madagascar burbon vanilla is the only way to go, and this McCormicks is the best price I've found on that variety of vanilla bean extract. I cannot tell the difference between other more expensive madagascar burbon brands such as spice islands, and safeways O-organics label. McCormicks has a reputation to maintain, they can't afford expensive lawsuits, and it is of course passed through standard American FDA standards, which basically protects the consumer from some of the stuff Mexico makes.<br /><br />The following is an excerpt you can find by googling "Mexican vanilla danger"<br /><br />2008 FRIDAY, Oct. 31 (HealthDay News) -- So-called Mexican "vanilla" is often made with a toxic substance called coumarin and shouldn't be bought by consumers, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned this week.<br /><br />Coumarin is related to warfarin, which is found in some blood thinners. Eating foods with coumarin may be dangerous for people taking blood thinners, because the combination could increase their risk of bleeding.<br /><br />Mexican vanilla -- which may smell and taste like real vanilla and is cheaper than the real thing -- is sold in Mexico and other Latin American countries and has started appearing in some U.S. stores and restaurants, the FDA said.<br /><br />Pure vanilla is made with the extract of beans from the vanilla plant. Mexican vanilla is frequently made with the extract of beans from the tonka tree, an entirely different plant that belongs to the pea family. Tonka bean extract contains coumarin. Since 1954, coumarin has been banned from all food products sold in the United States.<br /><br />Consumers should be cautious when buying vanilla in Mexico and other Latin American countries, the FDA advised. Look for "vanilla bean" on the label's ingredient list. Don't buy the product if it says "tonka bean" or has a vague ingredient list or no list.

review/summary: Extract is good, but bottle cap leaks.
review/text: This extract is very good quality and I was happy to receive it at such a good price.<br /><br />However, I see the reason they are selling them so cheaply:  The cap leaks.  The bottle cap doesn't fit the bottle properly and it leaks (at the screw-on part) every single time it is used.  I have tried tightening it, didn't help.  I have used DUCT TAPE around the cap, hoping it would stop the leaking, didn't help.  This bottle is just determined to leak.<br /><br />I supposed I could funnel it into a smaller vanilla extract bottle that doesn't leak, if I hadn't thrown away my smaller bottle already.  Sigh.<br /><br />So, I've resigned myself to keeping the bottle sitting on a towel because of all the drips coming down the sides.  It leaks BADLY.<br /><br />If it weren't for the leaky top, I'd give it 5 stars for the extract quality and the great price.

review/summary: A good quality Vanilla extract at a very good price
review/text: A a professional Chef I always want the best ingredients for the food I prepare. I used to use Nielsen Massey vanilla which is pricey for all of my dishes that call for vanilla extract, but after testing my baked goods with both brands I found no difference in the taste. I attribute this to the temperature that cookies, cakes, puddings and pies  bake or cook at cause most of the flavors in pure vanilla extract to burn away. Even in custard based ice creams this happens. There are only a few dishes I use the Nielsen Massey now (I do use their vanilla bean paste frequently or a vanilla bean) but now for almost all of the dishes I bake or that are cooked I use McCormik's vanilla extract. The exception are butter cream frosting's, no cook ice creams, milk shakes, or any other thing that is not cooked and calls for a premium quality vanilla extract.

review/summary: disgusting
review/text: In the past I've used pure vanilla extract and vanilla beans which are expensive. However good vanilla tastes great and that's why I ordered this. It read McCormick PURE vanilla. To me that should mean only vanilla extracted from the full grown unripe fruit of the vanilla plant.<br /><br />I thought I was getting a bargain at $12 for 16 ounces of vanilla. When it arrived and I used it to make a protein shake I was shocked. One sip and I knew I had to throw away the shake. It tasted disgusting just as if it was spoiled. The first thing I noticed after using a teaspoon of this so called vanilla is that my shake smelled funny. At first I thought it was the milk or yogurt. When I smelled the vanilla from the bottle it was disgusting. I read the ingredients and noticed that there was 41% alcohol. Are they kidding? The alcohol drowns out the vanilla taste (if they really use vanilla). This might only be good for cooking because alcohol evaporates with heat. I'm completely baffled by the positive reviews here. Don't people know by the taste and terrible flavor that they are using alcohol? I definitely do not recommend this unless you're a desperate alcoholic. Most good vanilla extract I've used in the past only has about 2% alcohol. This horrible product, with 41% alcohol, might as well have been labeled "alcohol with drops of vanilla flavor" or "I dare you to taste the vanilla"! I've bought numerous items from Amazon over the last few years and 90% of the time I'm satisfied with the purchase. However, McCormick (Pure???) Vanilla has to be the worst purchase I ever made. Fortunately this is not the norm when buying here. I just wish this was a returnable item.

The main point for us purchasing jarred foods is for variety. Yet, 9 out of the 12 jars in the pack has banana. I'm not sure how that can be considered a variety.  I would not buy this again. Mainly because bananas are cheap and easy to feed your toddler. Why would you want to be gouged for the mark up?<br /><br />Also, I don't see how they can label them stage 2 when they have the consistency of stage 1 food.

review/text: My baby loved this variety pack of Earth's Best baby food. I was afraid she might not like the prune flavor, but when I gave it to her, she ate it without a fuss. I love it because it's organic and healthy-also, all that whole grain helps relieve her constipation, lol. So whenever she's constipated because we tried giving her a new food--and also when we switched from formula to regular milk--I give her about half a jar of one of these with plenty of water and, well, it comes out. :)

review/text: My 11 month old daughter has eaten this variety for the past several months and just loves them. These come in great flavor varieties and she loves them all. The consistency is fine for beginning eaters, just starting stage 2 foods. This is a great way to incorporate cereal together with fruit on the go, without having to mess with mixing formula and dry cereal.

review/summary: Best Baby Food out there if you're not making your own!
review/text: I am loving Earth's Best brand overall.  I set out with the goal of making all of our son's food.  However, when I returned to work full time the puree time was less.  So my go-to backup is Earth's Best Baby Food.  We're on stage two now, almost stage 3, and he loves them.  I appreciate the no added sugars / preservatives and that it's mostly organic.  He loves the taste and combos.  Good stuff, great product, LOVE IT!

review/summary: Great Combination - Our Favorite so Far
review/text: Our 7 month old loves all of the flavors in this combo pack. The fruit and grain mix is great and saves me the extra steep of mixing runny purees with cereal. Earth's Best makes a great product but sometimes there's a particular item in the variety packs that our son doesn't like as much but I can honestly say he gobbles up every one of the Fruit and Grain flavors.

review/summary: Baby Says Yum!
review/text: My daughter pretty much exclusively eats Earth's Best baby food. The stage two fruit and whole grain combo is well-liked by her. It is also one of my favorite varieties because it is thicker than the ones that just contain fruit or vegetables without the grains already added in. Buying them on Amazon has been the most cost effective option for me by far. When I use the subscribe and save option it is significantly less expensive than buying it at a brick and mortar store. All in all I am very happy with this product! I wish there were a few more varieties available, but the product itself is wonderful.

review/summary: Not a hit
review/text: Our 7 month old really did not like any of combinations included in this variety pack. This may be specific to our baby, but it seemed to be a texture issue. Even if he seemed to like the taste-- he made himself gag trying to get it out of his mouth and didn't want to swallow it. He seems to be sensitive to texture anyway, so maybe this just wasn't a good choice for him. He does like the Earth's Best fruit variety pack, but any of the fruits mixed with grains were a definite no go. The nanny and I both even tried thinning down the mixture with breast milk or formula, and he still did not like it and spit it out. I would recommend trying one jar before you buy the variety pack because I had to give these away.

review/summary: Not a great product to get through the mail
review/text: My 2nd child was raised on EB baby foods. They were easy to come by in VA.  I clipped coupons and "afforded" them. Now that I'm living in rural Alabama, I turned to Amazon to get the product that I loved.  I ordered 3 different cases.  It was a mess when it arrived.  At least two of the jars were broken when it arrived at my house.  This sends the price per unit price up.  Two years ago, I got a sliver of glass stuck in my finger. As my body worked to push it out, I developed a tumor that needed to be surgically removed.  To say I have a broken glass phobia is an understatement.  I also through the entire shipment away instead of digging through the glop to find my unbroken jars, but these are tough economic times, and a baby's got to eat.  After sitting back down to the computer I decided that the 16 packs you get with Happy Baby pouches were more cost effective, and they don't run the risk of breaking.

review/text: I actually don't even own a peppergrinder because I found that my marble mortar and pestle worked better. When I want pepper, I pour a few of the corns into the mortar. A careful push of the pestle gives me coarse pepper. Mulling the pestle around gives me finely ground, and the aroma is amazing. I use it for all kinds of herbs. I like a second mortar set because if you make pounded garlic or herb butter, it flavors the somewhat porous stone.<br /><br />If you like cloves, allspice, or any whole spices that are so much more flavorful, this is a fantastic tool and it makes your kitchen counter look like something from the old country.

review/text: If you're as dimension challenged as I am, I want you to know this is small. It's great for a few peppercorns or a handful of herbs, but if you want to do any quantities of nuts or a salsa preparation, you should look for a larger one. It's pretty on the counter, doesn't take up much room, and it's of good quality, so I'll keep it.

review/summary: In Love with this!!
review/text: I had a recipe I was making the other day that called for corriandar, all I had were corriandar seeds. I tried EVERYTHING to grind these things up!! My food prossecors were BOTH too big (even my one cup processor)! I even pulled out the hammer to try and pulverize them! All I ended up doing was mangling a plastic bag and making a mess!<br /><br />I hopped on amazon, VERY upset and determined to not have that problem again! So scrolling I went and so the cute mortar and thought 'aww...it's cute an all, but do I REALLY feel like hand grinding??" I recalled watching a cooking show and the chef swore by GRINDING herbs because it releases so much better. The mortar wasn't much so I ordered and got it today!<br /><br />I dumped a few corriandar seeds into the mortal and ground with the pestle and this LOVELY fragrance hit me! It was absolute HEAVEN!! I'm thrilled with it!! So handy too! I don't have to haul out huge electric applances. Just get my mortar and pestle and away I grind for fresh spices! A wonderful purchase!

review/summary: Red Marble Kitchen Mortar and Pestle
review/text: Red Marble Kitchen Mortar and Pestle<br /><br />What a little kitchen gem.  If you like freshly ground spices this is the way to go.  Allspice, Pepper, Cloves, Cinnamon are just a few of the spices that I use with this mortar and pestle.  When it comes to garlic and onion I use a pharmacist's glass mortar and pestle.  The reason is that marble is a porous substance and there can be a flavor carry over from one use to the next. I also use a porcelain mortar and pestle, but they are more fragile.<br /><br />To clean, wipe with a damp cloth, that works to a certain extent, but I found that using glycerin U.S.P. (anhydrous) to clean the marble works better and it helps seal the marble and clean away the residue (essential oils) of the spices better.  Now, you used to be able to buy this at the pharmacy, but since all of this terrorism scare you can't find it over-the-counter and have to ask for it or you can order it from Amazon.  It only takes about 2 ml (one-half teaspoonful) to clean the mortar and pestle. After the cleaning with glycerin, I use a damp cloth to clean further. Among other uses glycerin is used for chafed, chapped, and cracked lips and windburned skin. So, it is safe to use, it is used as a sweetening agent, and makes the marble less porous and look better. Dimensions: 3-1/4" diameter x 3" tall bowl, 4" pestle.<br /><br />I am pleased with this little kitchen aid and the aroma from the freshly ground spices it absolutely amazing and you can grind to the consistency that you need and you aren't beholden to what the manufacturers of spices believe to be the correct consistency.  Besides, who knows how long those ground spices have been around.<br /><br />An epicurean Bon Appetite

They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.

Imagine chowing down dried up pellets yourself, or moist pellets in flavorful gravy?<br /><br />Also, our Shih Tzi's skin lesions seem to be benefited from this as well although that's a lil' inconclusive as we're engaging other remedies to target that.

It has the rich sweet taste you expect in a BBQ sauce (thanks to Splenda) and packs quite a punch. The thick and Spicy is definetly for people who are a fan of spicey hot BBQ sauces.<br /><br />I would definetly recommend this product to anyone who is following the low carb diet or is just watching your calories.<br /><br />I don't often rate things 5 stars, but for zero calories and high on flavor and kick this deserves it.

review/summary: Yum!...
review/text: Yeah, yum.. If you like candied liquid smoke. I've never tried Walden Farm's before but the idea of 0 calorie, scratch that, *TRACE* calories and zero carbs. Wait, there's Splenda and it has half a carb per serving, plus tomato paste which also has carbs and other things on the ingredients that you can't de-carb.<br />Anyways, I digress, the idea of very little calories and very little carbs sounded too good to be true and yep. I drizzled it onto a grilled chicken wrap and bit in. Oh my god. The first thing to hit was a overly sweetness and not a real one, the chemical kind, bletch. The next thing to hit was a smokey taste, and again, not a very good one. It was way too strong and chemical tasting.<br />It ruined my wrap. I should have tasted it separately, but I thought for sure it couldn't be that bad, plus the taste of the Cajun seasonings on the chicken would help hide the taste. I was wrong. By the time I got to the end of the wrap where the liquid fool's gold had collected and bit through, it was way too much. I spit it out and threw the rest away. And all this from a small drizzle down the middle, after all, I was trying it.<br />I couldn't imagine pouring this on something and grilling that nastiness into it.<br />The other reviewers who gave it 5 stars. I don't know what they were thinking. Or maybe Walden Farm's changed the recipe but I didn't get spicy at all in this. It was a bottle of chemically candied chemical smoke flavor.<br />Absolutely horrid. I'd advise staying away unless you like wasting money, not just on this bottle of septic tank juices, but anything it touches. I must now to gargle Listerine and brush.

review/summary: Terrible...And Not Cheap
review/text: I took one sampling of this barbecue sauce after opening the bottle and immediately threw it away.  The taste is really disgusting, nor is the consistency anywhere close to "thick."  Using this product with any type of meat (pork, chicken, beef, etc.) will absolutely ruin what you're eating.  I should have done a better job of reading the other reviews, since they are dead-on.  You can find a number of low-carb barbecue sauce recipes on the web - I'd try that instead of this product.

review/summary: HcG Diet Phase 2 MUST!!!
review/text: I am currently doing the HcG Diet and cannot have anything extra with calories, fat, or sugar.  This barbeque sauce is perfect!!!  I used it last night and WOW! It tastes so good!  It's not thick like traditional bbq sauce, but it is for dieters.  It's sweetened with Sucralose which is an HCG diet no-no, however I didn't stall.  It is tangy, sweet, and barbequey.  I couldn't ask for more.  I have tried Walden Farms Balsamic Vinagrette (which is good), the Honey Dijon (yuck), the Sesame Ginger (so-so), the Ranch (yuck), Peanut Spread (sweet, but not peanut butter tasting), and the Blueberry Jam (good) and I have to say that so far this is the best that they have to offer for dieters.  I don't understand the 1 stars people are leaving (they probably aren't really dieting!).  My coworkers who are also doing the HCG Diet along with me LOVE this bbq sauce, they almost stole my bottle.  I am ordering more now so I don't run out!!!

review/summary: Chemical aftertaste
review/text: Give Walden Farms credit for making a no-carb sauce. It's just a shame it doesn't taste better. Still, I do buy it on occasion and mix it with other tastier sauces to lower the over all carb content. However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft's low-carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined. However, if you are on an extreme low-carb diet (such as Dr. Bernstein's) this may be the only product that fits.

review/summary: poor service from this company
review/text: When I purchased this sauce to aid in my Atkins diet, it was shown CLEARLY to be a 6 pack.  The title said it, the photo had one of those little text bubbles on it that said "6 pack" and the shipping weight was listed at like 5 pounds or something.  TITLE AS LISTED: "Walden Farms Sauce Barbecue Thick Calorie Free, 12-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)"<br /><br />One (1) bottle arrived, so I called the shipper who said the listing was wrong, and not their fault.  They said Amazon writes the listing (Lies) and to contact them.<br />I called Amazon, they said no, they couldn't possibly be responsible for the misprint on the ad, as they sell millions oof products for tens of thousands of companies, and each company writes their own ads for their own products. (Truth) and that I should make every attempt to resolve the conflict with the seller.<br />After several more "going nowhere" calls with the supplier, they said the only way they would do anything is to submit it for resolution with Amazon, and I'd probably get my money partially refunded.<br /><br />Amazon ended refunding all of my purchase price and shipping.<br /><br />I can't wait to never buy from All Star Health , ever, ever again.  I hope my review inspires you to look elsewhere as well. Bad, poor, lousy, unpleasant, untruthful customer service.<br /><br />By the way, the sauce is good, and I have since found it available in my local CUB Foods grocery store in their diabetic section.

review/summary: An Unexpected Delight!
review/text: The other reviews of the Walden Farms BBQ Sauce made it sound like something you would scrape off the bottom of your shoe, wipe on your meat and promptly barf.  I, however was pleasantly surprised to find the Original Sauce to be very tasty.  The spice level was well balanced with the acidity and sweetness.  No chemical aftertaste of Splenda.  I am a foodie, but my doctor has me on a ridiculously low calorie diet for the next few months.  After the past three weeks, I was desperate for variety and this fit the bill perfectly!  Bare in mind, this is NOT regular barbeque sauce though.  It is thinner, but what would you expect from a no calorie, no carb sauce?  If you are needing variety in your menu, give this a try.  You might just find an unexpected delight!

However, I do use this more as a condiment, instead of catchup or 57 sauce - for THAT purpose, with zero cal,carbs, etc...it is an awesome product! :D I also really enjoy the flavor.  But taste is completely individual.  It is def. worth a try if you are watching carbs or looking for easy places to cut a few calories from your diet. :)

My expectations were medium to low, but I am very surprised by this stuff, it helps me so much. Its a bit runny which sort of stinks, but the flavors are pretty good considering it has no calories and is made out of some suspect stuff. I season my protein more to kick up the flavor a bit more, but I enjoy it. Its not the best BBQ sauce ever but for not having calories it rocks. I like this the most of all the walden farms stuff I have tried. Look at a grocery store for a price cut; I got mine at Albersons.

review/text: I buy sugar free products a lot, and it is hard to find sugar free barbecue sauce.  I held out hope for this, and indeed did use the whole bottle.  I hate to waste things, and I am generally very easy to please.  I won't buy another though because the stuff just doesn't taste like barbecue sauce.  In my opinion, it has nothing to do with the artificial sweeteners either.  Whatever they are doing with the rest of the recipe just isn't getting the job done.<br /><br />If you have NO other choices, maybe you could give it a try yourself.  I do see some others love it, so maybe you would, too.  However, if you have a choice, choose the other brand(s) first before bothering with this.

I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic "coffee". The "crema" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino.

review/text: I've had these at a gas station before. I would go 20 miles out of my way just to buy these. Then the gas station stopped selling them. :( I finally found them on here after a year I was so excited but when they got here they were very very hard every package I got. I believe I bought 6. It was just very disappointing.

review/summary: Pig ear review
review/text: I used to buy pig ears packaged by Hartz from Sams Club. They have not been available recently, hence this purchase The pig ears through Amazon are smaller, fewer to the package and far more expensive than the Sams product. Even though my dogs like them, I will no longer buy them.

review/summary: Great doggie treats!
review/text: My dog was crazy about these treats!  She hounded me every day until I gave one to her...but only one.  They're quite large and seem to be of good quality.

review/summary: much too greasy
review/text: That pretty much says it all.  I couldn't even stand touching them.  I've bought pigs ears for decades and these are the most greasy I've ever tried.
