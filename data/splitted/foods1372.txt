review/summary: Crunchy and Delicious
review/text: From the first milisecond of the hairs on my teeth hitting the golden brown surface of the geniously pretzelly, and perfectly salted crust I knew that I was in for a treat among snacks.  now i'm a salt man, not really a pretzel fan, a chex-mix man, cheeze-its are the food of the gods, and i love salsa and chips and jalapeno flavor is my own personal objeto favorito, so as you can tell a lot was riding on what would happen next. i sunk straight throught the golden crust in the next chamber on this complicated food labyrinth, a cavern filled with the creamiest, perfectly spiciest, taste bud satisfying, bodacious jalapeno filling a man of my age and religion could ask for.  i instantly fell in love and like smegal became golem, I became obsessed.  so the first thing i thought was i must have more, more.  than i though i lost my ebay account i wonder if amazon sells food online.  i looked it up, and they do! so i came here and saw this great bargain? i will buy the cheaper first and see if i don't get sick of them eventually, if not it's gonna be the big bags next. peace.

review/summary: Edible, but just kinda "meh"
review/text: The corny outer shell is nice, and there is a tiny kick of jalapeno in the cheese.  It's not an instant heat burst, though, more like creeper heat.  Typical Combos cheese-food stuffed in the middle.  It's a decent snack, but I'd take a Big Grab of Doritos over these any day.  Thanks to my boss for giving me a 3/4 full partial bag of these.  He was not impressed.

review/summary: Great, if you like addictive, bite-sized salty snacks
review/text: These are good, albeit a bit salty.  They do taste like a corn tortilla with Jalapeno and cheese.  Well at least as close as scientists can come up with for something with a long non-refrigerated shelf life. The bags are smaller than the ones you can get at a convenience store.  So I just ate two of them.

review/summary: Best mustard ever
review/text: If you grew up on the East Coast, you already know Gulden's is a mainstay condiment there. My grandmother used this in recipes and for sandwiches, hot dogs, etc. and owned her own restaurant for many years. It definitely has a distinctive taste; it says "SPICY" for a reason, so a little goes a long way. Gulden's continues to win awards and has not changed the recipe (that I know of) for more than 140 years. I missed it when I moved west and couldn't find it for the longest time. I'm happy to have it once again; it takes me back to my grandmother's cooking!

review/summary: Rehydrates well, tasty, inexpensive, eco-friendly.  This is a winner!
review/text: Another excellent flavrz product. Rehydrates well - will have to wait for summer to put it through more intense rehydration testing but so far so good. Taste is excellent. Low sugar, low calorie. No artificial colors, flavors or sweeteners. Its organic so no pesticide residue and no genetically modified ingredients. The small foil packet is easy to transport and can be mixed to your taste preference: 8-12oz water for a sweet drink, 16oz water for medium sweetness, 20oz water for a flavored water drink. Cheaper than buying a bottled drink of this sort - especially with the subscribe and save option from Amazon. Eco friendly - love that this takes a disposable plastic drink bottle out of the equation! Excellent for distance activities where the weight you are carrying matters (hiking, distance running or cycling) - pack several pouches and mix with water as electrolyte replacement is needed. Would also be great for a hot day at the beach. The packet is easy to open and easy to mix - just pull the perforated tab at the top off and pour into a glass of water or your own water bottle. Can't think of any cons.

Like a Heath bar meets a Reese's Peanut Butter cup...YUM!!<br />The chocolate was rich, creamy, and it was loaded with toffee chunks (they did NOT skimp on the toffee).  I cannot wait for next month's delivery... :)

On the other hand, everyone loved receiving them, so they were good for some laughs and disgusted faces.

review/summary: Delicious, but strange
review/text: These are quite different from the C Howard's violet mints I've eaten before, in many ways.  The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl-like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.  Also, shipping was excellent, they came 2 days before the stated arrival time and were packaged well.  The tin they come in is also quite nice.

review/text: When we moved to New Jersey I could not find many southern type products.<br />My mother used this to sweeten tea when I grew up in Georgia. She tried to avoid too much sugar.<br />Left the south for a while in new Jersey for work and could not find it anywhere!

review/text: Nectar sweet is the only sugar substitute that I've found that doesn't effect the overall flavor of hot drinks. I've tried using it in cold drinks and it takes a long time dissolve and it alters the taste. Crushing it prior to using it in cold drinks helps it dissolve quicker but it still alters the taste. The price was a gteat value and I've purchased it through Amazon several times.

review/text: This flour is a very light cream color and smells like toasted coconut, it's a wonderful coconutty smell. I've had great results using this in recipes as part of my gluten free flour mixtures and I've even added it to meatloaf for added fiber! When I make a mixed grain loaf using it plus adding some coconut oil, the loaf comes out of the oven smelling of fragrant coconut... yum! I like the smell and taste of this flour so much that I haven't bothered to try any others!!  I did smell my daughter in law's Bob's Red Mill coconut flour and Swanson's coconut flour smells much more coconutty, so I'm sticking with it over any other brand. The texture of it is really nice too.

review/summary: Great Coffee at a Great Price
review/text: After drinking Costa Rican Peaberry coffee that was given to us as a gift and drinking Community Coffee Cafe Special for years and watching the price rise and rise, I decided to search for Costa Rican Peaberry coffee here on Amazon.  I didn't find any Costa Rican Peaberry, but came across this Tanzanian Peaberry.  I read the reviews and decided that for the price, it was worth giving it a chance.  It isn't as strong as the Costa Rican Peaberry, but with the addition of a bit more (probably as much as I usually put with my Community Coffee) it should be to the strength that I like it.  Other than that one little issue, it has a yummy flavor!!  I will definitely purchase this coffee again and again!!

It's the coffee itself. I love good quality Columbian, Kenyan, Guatamalan, Sumatra, Costa Rican, Zimbabwe, Papau New Guinea, Ethiopian and others...this is the first time I tried Tanzanian and I hate it. If you like any of the coffees I mentioned you are not likely to enjoy or even be able to tolerate this. It tastes like what you might get if you poured hot water through a bag of dirty, old pennies. It makes me sick just thinking about it. Trust me and do not believe the positive reveiews like I did...for $45. I bought five pounds of regret.

Pretty pricey, and while the nutrition is great I just don't have that kind of money.THis is a 8.4 oz can, so it's smaller than a soda can, and I would have liked it to be a bit bigger. The taste is great, I really don't think it is too sweet, and the ginger pear is a great combo. I drink this once a day, so when I'm all out I am def. getting another package.

review/text: Kombucha is one of my favorite drinks, but most bottled versions are too strong (acidic) for me to enjoy drinking straight. So when my girlfriend introduced me to this beverage, I was thrilled to discover how delicious it tastes!!<br /><br />The acid level is just right, and the ginger gives it a great bite (but it's not too powerful). The only possible issue is that it's still a bit sweet for my taste -- it could use less sugar.<br /><br />But in the end, it's half the calories of a can of soda, is made primarily of kombucha and tea, and I get antsy if there isn't at least one in my fridge. Try it!!!

review/text: This was more of an impulse buy for me as I'm not a regular kombucha drinker and just wanted to try something new. I think the taste is fairly unique, as it's tough for me to describe it. I want to say sweet yet sharp...probably due to the Asian pear and ginger, respectively. To me, it was like drinking a soda with a more complex taste profile. I don't think I felt any healthier, more energetic or had more "incisive mental clarity" from drinking this, but overall it's still a pretty good drink.

review/summary: Great nutrition for even finicky stomachs
review/text: I tried a number of foods for my Boxer puppy, and this one stuck. He doesn't eat as much of this as some other foods that have more fillers. And the nutrition seems to be balanced so that the food doesn't artificially accelerate the puppy's growth.

review/summary: Look around more
review/text: I guess I should have looked around more, I was expecting them in a tub. Instead they were in 3 baggies with sticky ties and it made me feel a bit uneasy.... I was thinking:  who packaged these, where were these packaged and why don't I have any product information included?<br />I don't believe the price was any better than what I could of found in a local candy store or drugstore.  I've purchased more product for less money before.  The Christmas tree shop in Wiliston, VT sells a 4 lb. tub for $5.99  but since I just moved to FL... my local knowledge of stores is limited.<br /><br />I bought these for a specific reason, I am attending a memorial service for a dear relative (who loved these) and I was planning on bringing them and putting them in dishes for those attending the service, instead because of the small size of them (I've seen larger ones) and because they have too much sugar on them, I will be keeping them at home and buying others somewhere else.

review/summary: So great to find a bully stick for sensitive/allergic dogs!
review/text: I was hesitant to order the Canine Caviar Buffalo Stix based on other Amazon reviewers comments about some of their other "stix" products being flimsy or quickly eaten, but I researched this specific item on the Canine Caviar website and these are actually Bison pizzle, unlike other products which may be made from gullet or intestine and are less sturdy. Therefore, these are directly comparable to beef "bully sticks."<br /><br />I was pleased with the case of individually wrapped Buffalo Stix that I received. While the thickness varies, many are quite thick and are obviously of good quality. They do have a distinct odor, as all pizzle does, but it is not terribly overwhelming and seems to drive all my dogs into a frenzy. The price works out to be $1.50 per buffalo stick, which is more than the beef bully sticks, but that seems to be the case with any bison product.<br /><br />Most importantly, my allergy-prone dog absolutely loves them and they last longer than any other chew I have purchased for her (including trachea, scapula cartilage, jerky, etc.) She is a 50-lb medium-intensity chewer, so one stick will keep her completely and totally occupied for over an hour.  She was so engrossed with the last stick I gave her, I was able to take my other dog for a walk and come back to find her still chewing away blithely. (Don't worry, she wasn't unattended with a chew.)<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this product to other people with allergy-prone or picky dogs. I will definitely purchase this product again, especially if there are any special sales or discounts forthcoming. =)

review/summary: Fabulous tea!
review/text: Every year we visit local Starbucks stores in search of this tea (the only reason we go there). We buy several for Christmas gifts, and also stock up for ourselves since it's only available for a limited time. It's inexpensive as far as specialty tea goes ($6.95 a box), and it is exceptional.<br /><br />I'm a rabid coffee drinker (granted it is 1/2 caffe), but at this time of year when Joy arrives, my attention turns back to tea.<br /><br />I know it's all about marketing, and tin recycles, but I was perfectly happy when Tazo came in boxes (and I believe there were more than 15 bags per box?).<br /><br />That aside, we love this tea, and look forward to enjoying it every year. I'd highly recommend it.

review/summary: Yummy! A perfect snack
review/text: These Cranberry Almond Thins were offered as samples at Costco today, and I was instantly addicted! I immediately bought a package and it will not be my last. They are delicious! Not too sweet, crunchy, with cranberries adding tartness, and a almond slices adding almond flavor to the cookie.  They come in nice individual packages, each package has three thins.  A perfect amount for a snack and kind of stops you from eating more. Maybe not totally stop, but at least make you think about opening the next one!<br /><br />Each package of 3 thins is 100 calories, 8 grams of sugar, and 3 grams of fat. I am attaching a photo of panel with nutrion information, as well as two photos that shows an individual package.<br /><br />The best price on them is at Costco at $6.99.  I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool to be very helpful. I set up an alert on Amazon if the price approaches this amount.<br /><br />I really like the taste of these thins and recommend them!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Wow!
review/text: This is without a doubt the smoothest coffee I have ever tasted. I couldn't detect even one hint of bitterness. It is, however, by its nature a very light coffee, so if you are looking for a dark and bold roast for say, espresso, you should look elsewhere, for an Ethiopian or something like it.<br /><br />I ordered it from the marketplace seller Aberdeen, with fulfillment by Amazon. It arrived freshly roasted and vacuum sealed. This is definitely the real deal! Beware of the imitation blends, that while are fine coffees, cannot even approach this level. Costing almost as much, they are quite a rip off! If it's from one of the Jamaica based Estates (i.e. Wallenford, Mavis Bank, etc.) then it's real.

review/summary: Gag Me
review/text: I'll say for starters that I am a caffeine junkie.  I have been a coffee drinker since I was a very, very young lad.  For the past fifteen years I have only purchased whole beans and for the past five years I have used a French press.  I've varied my purchases so that I can enjoy different blends and coffees from different continents, coffees that fulfill my morning quest for the perfect cup.  I had never tried Jamaica Blue Mountain (having read lots of tales of its great taste and quality production) I wanted to try a small amount before I would shell out close to $40 for a pound of this sought-after bean.  I am sure glad I just got a 4oz portion.  This is the worst - absolutely bar none (and that includes chow-hall coffee from my military service years)  The taste is flatter than flat, the aroma is non-existent - in short it is awful.  Thinking I might have somehow done something wrong I brewed another batch in the drip-coffee machine rather than the French press.  It was just as blah.  Maybe I got a bad batch but for sure I will quickly return to my old faithful Yirgercheffe.  As The Who sang "We won't get fooled again!"

review/text: while i prefer pepper jerky to regular smoke jerky, when i do find these 2x8oz bags at costco on sale for $11-12 i always stock up since this is far better than the fatty over salted worlds kitchen jerky often found cheap here on amazon.  pacific gold is an even balance of beef salt oil smoke, with uniform texture beef:fat ratio palm size chewy pieces with rarely any gristle.  golden valley jerky on amazon and on their own web sight is noticeably leaner in fat than pacific gold, but it's rare to find that brand under $1/oz as it's also organic USA domestic meat.

review/summary: Good quality, good taste, price could be better
review/text: The Pacific Gold jerky is much better in terms of taste and quality than the cheaper bulk packages available on Amazon and elsewhere. The cheaper brands make heavy use of MSG, preservatives, and spices. The result is like having a chewy, spicy, chemistry lab in your mouth. Pacific Gold tries to balance cost and quality and does a pretty good job of it. The packages I bought state that the jerky is made of beef that comes from one or more of five countries: U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Uruguay. The Pacific Gold label says there is no "added" MSG, but it does not say there is no MSG. The Pacific Gold flavor is credible -- you can taste beef (and like it) as well as brown sugar and hickory flavoring and there is no distracting chemical taste. The only product I have found so far on Amazon that is in a similar quality/price bracket is Golden Valley's non-organic line. Golden Valley is a little less expensive than Pacific Gold, especially if you subscribe. The last time I read Golden Valley's package it stated that the jerky was made of U.S. beef raised without hormones. Golden Valley recently raised the price of the product I like substantially, but even after the price increase it is competive in its quality bracket.

review/summary: WOOHOO! THIS GUM IS SUPERB!
review/text: To be honest, I've never felt the need to review chewing gum before, but this gum compels it. It's just that good! It's so full of juicy spearmint flavor you would think you are chewing gum with sugar as opposed to sugarless gum. If I pop two cubes of this gum in my mouth I actually feel like I'm chewing Spearmint Bubble Yum from back in the day. Woohoo! The flavor crystals actually make you feel like your biting into sugar crystals, but the gum is, indeed, sugarless. A dental hygienist friend of mine recommend this gum to me because it contains the highest concentration of xylitol in it you can find in a gum, which actually helps to clean your teeth between brushings and helps them to appear brighter. I have a serious sweet tooth, but I try to do right by taking care of my teeth, so this gum helps me strike a nice balance. The only drawback I note is that the Spearmint variety of this gum seems to be harder to find in stores and also appears to be a bit more pricey here on Amazon than the other flavors. If you like spearmint, buy this gum. You won't be disappointed.

review/text: Ice Cubes Spearmint gum is great. I purchased a 4 pack previously and it went fast. The 8 pack ought to last me longer and since it comes from Amazon will arrive sooner than before (especially since I'm an Amazon Prime Member: It seems like a lot to pay for annually, but given all of the small to mid price range items I order from Amazon, I get my money's worth and then some!).<br /><br />Flavor lasts a reasonably fair amount of time. I tend to chew two cubes at a time instead of just one as I like the gum to last a while. Good solid flavor and it really does freshen the  mouth up quite nicely and quickly.<br /><br />If you're a frequent gum chewer, whether at home, work or in the car, this gum is for you (assuming you like Spearmint flavor).
