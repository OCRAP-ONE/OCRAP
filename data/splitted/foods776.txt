review/summary: DELICIOUS!
review/text: I can't believe I am the first to rate these bars!  Larabars are awesome...very tasty and healthy.  The apple pie bars are one of my favorites.  As far as nutrition bars, these are just about the only ones I'll eat because they are raw with whole, unprocessed ingredients.  I generally just have a great feeling after eating them.  Not like the other "rock-in-my-stomach" bars that taste artificial.  I highly recommend ANY Larabar!!!

review/summary: Tasty, but why aren't these organic?
review/text: If you squish together dates & bananas, mix in finely chopped almonds, form into bars, and dry the bars a bit so they're not too sticky, you basically have a Banana Cookie LaraBar.  I think they taste quite good for packaged bars and are healthier than most of the available food bars.  They taste like, well, bananas, dates, and almonds, with the almonds providing a bit of crunch.<br /><br />Although the ingredient list is only three words long, the wrapper text extolling the healthfulness and near-magical virtues of the bar is seven lines long.  To partially quote, "Real food, raw food... No chemicals, no fillers, no medicinal tasting supplements.  LaraBar is never cooked.  Never Processed...[will] leave you with a pleasing sense of vitality and well being for hours to come."  And there's more information on the wrapper, "uncooked * unprocessed * no added sugar * non-GMO * gluten free * dairy free * soy free * vegan * kosher."  The LaraBar website also tells you (in case you haven't figured this out) non-irradiated, no sulfites, and no colorings.<br /><br />All this is well and good, but if they're going to the trouble of making a bar that's so fabulously healthy for you, then it would be nice if they used organic ingredients.  Eating a bar made with conventionally grown (pesticided) fruit invalidates some of the healthfulness of the bar.  The bar tastes good, but in terms of healthfulness, I think LaraBar can do better.<br /><br />P.S. And what's with the two dots above the first letter A in Lara?  Do they want us to think it's an exotically Scandinavian product?  Like Haagen Daz, Lara bars are made in the U.S.A.

review/summary: Amazon larabars taste stale and dry!
review/text: I've gotten this flavor larabar from the grocery store and loved it. In fact, that was the reason why I purchased it from Amazon - because the cost per unit is so much lower. The peanut butter cookie bar from the grocery store was moist and delicious. The bars I received from Amazon taste stale. They're dry and crumbly. The expiration date is not until 2013 so I don't understand why they would be this way but they are. I won't be reordering any more Larabars from Amazon!

review/summary: OK taste but surprise on last pack of white fuzzy
review/text: I figured I would give Larabar a try since I want to cut down my chips/cookie snacking on those late afternoon. I also shared them with my family and friends which got me varying opinions.  There was only one person that complained it was too sweet. Other health conscious, ingredient readers were impressed with the make and taste.  For myself, I thought they were OK. I don't normally snack on fruit bars like this so it took a bit to get accustomed to the sticky and "oily" fruit bar.<br /><br />As I was coming to the last couple bars in my Key Lime Pie, I ventured to get the Coconut Pie. Oddly, they almost tasted the same except for a slightly stronger coconut taste. It still had the "core" of dates and nuts,etc.  What really jumped at me is on my 2nd to last Key Lime Pie ... I noticed fuzzy edge on the bar.  The box stated it hasn't expired either so I am hoping this is a single bad bar in the box.  However it doesn't help that to search the term on the comments here that someone had a whole box of *bad*.  I'll see how the coconut pie fares but the mental image is now stuck on me. It is an OK alternative but I may seek another late afternoon snack.

I was pleased to find them at Amazon for about $1 each with no shipping charges! I was EXCITED to find out there was special offer at the time I placed my order: when I spent $25, I could get $25 of product for free! So I got 2 cases for one price, and still free shipping! The boxes came very quickly - perhaps 2 days? The expiration was for Feb 2008, which was great! The boxes arrived in excellent condition. I was so excited with this deal I placed another oerder for my mother to make some to sell at her craft fairs this fall!

review/summary: Better than Microwave and as much fun to make as it is to eat
review/text: may not be as easy to make as a microwave popcorn and not as good as making it in pot with fresh kernels and the correct mix of oil and Salt.  But "Jiffy pop is the magic treat that is as much fun to make as it is to eat".  I have been making Jiffy pop for decades now and it is always great and consistent.  Nothing to clean up when you're done and better than Microwave.  Start with a low flame move the pan to break up the oil and keep moving the pan until the popping has stopped, start with too high of a flame or temperature and don't move it around you will burn it.

review/text: Jiffy Pop seems like a fun product and is easy to use but I would NOT recommend it due to the fact that partially hydrogenated oils are used in it. That's very unhealthy and not something you want to be feeding your children. You're better off popping your own popcorn and adding your own non-hydrogenated butter.

review/summary: Makes delicious pastries and cakes!
review/text: I have used Solo Almond Paste many times in the past.  We move frequently, sometimes living in large cities, sometimes small towns.  I can usually find it on the shelf in large cities.  However, this Christmastime, we find ourselves in a small town and I could not find the almond paste anywhere.  I was grateful to find it on Amazon...and at a very good price.  I have paid nearly twice the price from some specialty stores in the past.  My one complaint about the cans of paste I ordered:  the contents were a little dry.  There are no dates on the cans, so the product may not have been as fresh as others I've purchased in the past. However, my cakes still came out perfectly, so the dryness did not affect the final product.  I will definitely look to Amazon again for the almond paste. Great value!

I also own a keurig and am not buying too many kcups now because of the outrageous prices, although I do use a solofill with the keurig so I alternate between pod coffee, some kcups and bag coffee I use in the solofill adapter. Can't understand how people don't realize that pods and k cups are two different things. These pods do not fit in a kcup device unless you have the pod holster, which I have but don't use. I do like the Bunn My Cafe. This coffee is worth a try if you want decent decaf.

review/text: This product comes up in a search for Keurig K-Cups by calling itself a "Pod". It is not a pod, not a K-cup, and there is nothing in the product description that clearly states what the product really is--a single serve coffee filter bag. I sincerely doubt that the deception is accidental. Bad form, Puck.

I wish they had a slightly richer flavor, but that's a problem with all water process decaf, so I can't blame them... it has plenty of flavor, just not that sweet depth that I love, which the Senseo dark roast caffeinated pods do have, but they make me jittery.

review/text: I have used this product for 25 years now, since a former flame introduced me to it as a more flavorful alternative to Mrs. Dash.  I use it on green salads and on popcorn, primarily.  It's just amazing.<br /><br />I think the best part is the fact that it has a salty flavor from the seaweed...but is very low sodium.<br /><br />The only problem I have with it is that if left unused for a period of time, it will cake.  That is annoying, but easily fixed by inserting a fork or butterknife and making it a powder again.<br /><br />I buy it here and in large quantities because I can't get it at my local stores any more.

It is perfect on a breakfast burrito and has a really good flavor to accompany the heat. A real staple that goes with almost everything.

review/summary: Good snack that's better for you than Cheetos
review/text: These are identical to Cheetos but without the cheesy coating. Instead, Robert's American Gourmet uses nutritional yeast, which allegedly adds nutritional value. Each 6 oz. bag has 900 calories, 108 g of carbs, 12 g of protein, and no vitamins or minerals. I'm not sure what the "nutritional yeast" add, but it's not clear that they add anything actually nutritional (at least according to the Nutritional Facts). However, these are a tasty and interesting alternative to Cheetos. I would recommend trying a bag before purchasing a box.

I love Old Dutch Popcorn Twists and these Tings are just like it -- only healthier, I guess.<br /><br />I'm not familiar to the cheesy-poof references in the other reviews because there is no cheese associated with Tings, but maybe there just isn't a similar product to compare it to.<br /><br />While proper for my personal tastes, I can forsee this being a little on the salty side for others.  For those familiar with the other products from American Gourmet, I had some Chaos chips/pretzel mix and found those to be rather bland.

review/text: These taste like vegan cheetos to me. Granted, I haven't actually had cheetos in well over 2 years but Tings are definitely similar. Don't expect an obviously cheesy taste, it's really more of a salty flavor. If you come across these at your local supermarket they're definitely worth a try and make a great snack. Purchasing 12 packs of something you haven't tried before seems a bit crazy to me, but if you REALLY want to try them and can't find them locally the price is definitely comparable.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the Chocolate Pirate's Booty, it is also vegan and is ridiculously good!

However, I still get cravings for a few things, usually cheesy things. The first time I tried Tings a few weeks back, I was in love! The nutritional yeast makes them taste so cheesy and good, and as a salt-lover I appreciate their salty goodness. Now when I am feeling the need for something crunchy, cheesy and junky, I am very satisfied with these snacks. Plus, everyone I know loves them, vegan or not... they are a great party snack!

I don't understand the bad reviews hammering it for not being more flavorful like cheese curls... what were people expecting from baked corn meal flavored with salt and yeast? Good snack anyway with reasonably good texture that is great for those intolerant of cheese, spice, or stronger flavors. To me these would be much improved with better flavors... perhaps add a few varieties that taste better and call this one "Corn Tings - Unflavored" or "Corn Tings - Original"? I'd buy other flavors with this texture and quality, but this one is just a bit too bland for me.Overall, does the job it was designed to do: healthy, light, and easy on the body.

review/text: I was disappointed with the flavor of these. I really love the taste of nutritional yeast (I'm a vegan) but the only discernable flavor of these doodles was salt. I don't know why nutritional yeast is listed as one of the ingredients and the flavor non-existent. I think it may have been a marketing ploy to entice "health nuts" and vegans to buy them. It's too bad since nutritional yeast is so full of nutrients and flavor. If you are a vegan, don't waste your money!! Go makes some popcorn and sprinkle some nutrional yeast over it.... it's much less expensive and healthier than these lousy things, I mean "Tings".

I love the taste and the fact they're much lower in fat than "regular" chips. I eat the 3 ounce potato Popchips bags and now the 3.5 ounce Tortilla bags. These 3.5 oz bags seem to be just slightly less volume than the 3 oz potato bags but both are a satisfying amount. The nutritional values for the Tortilla bags are pretty much the same as the potato (not exact but close). So that said when I saw these brand new tortilla Popchips on Amazon I got excited! Excited over chips? Yes. I immediately ordered a box of the Nacho Cheese with subscription. Today they finally arrived and just in time for lunch. They nailed it! They look like any tortilla chip but a bit more puffy. They are crunchy but slightly more "fluffy" I guess you could say than a regular tortilla chip. The corn tortilla flavor is strong (tastes good) and the nacho cheese flavor tastes pretty much like you'd expect, very similar to nacho cheese Doritos (good!). Basically these taste like a very good tortilla chip or nacho cheese Dorito but without any greasy feeling or taste. I LOVE these, now I just need to try the other flavors!<br /><br />Side note... Boo Amazon dropping subscribe and save discount on Popchips to 5%...

review/summary: Convenient, tasty, crunchy
review/text: These tortilla chips are conveniently in single-serving bags with each bag containing only 4 grams of fat and 120 calories for those watching their weight.  They are nicely crunchy with a very nacho-cheesy flavor.  The flavor might be a little strong depending on your preferences.  If you like to know you have really had a taste of Tex Mex, this is the chip for you.  I first got onto Popchips in the nutrition center of our local food market.  Now I have seen them also in the larger chain grocery stores.  The price is definitely a savings over buying a package at a time. It gets my recommendation.

review/summary: Not Your Regular Pop Chip!
review/text: I love the regular style Pop Chips so when these were a Deal of the Day I grabbed a case of them. That was a mistake because these are gross. We had a party that weekend and put several flavors of this style of Pop Chip out and no one liked them. I have no idea what I'm going to do with all of them. I guess I'll take them to work because those people will snack on anything when it's free!

review/summary: Toffee + Chocolate = Heaven
review/text: This matcha is phenomenal! You taste the sweet, buttery toffee and the rich chocolate, even a hint of nutty goodness. And it really is good with the green base! These flavors are like magic, how did they stuff so many aspects of a tasty treat into matcha? I mean, this isn't simply caramel + nuts + chocolate. It really does have that buttery smoothness and a toastiness that I associate with toffee. It's amazing that this has all the full, delicious aspects of a good piece of toffee. It really brings to mind Heath/Skor bars in a mug!<br /><br />Of course, the grassy sweet gentle matcha base blends perfectly with this and keeps you from feeling too full/heavy after an indulgent latte of this. But... it's not really indulgent at all! The perfect way to curb a sweet tooth without ruining your diet is with a nice dessert matcha, and this is one of my absolute favorites.

review/summary: Toffee & Chocolate & Matcha, oh my!
review/text: I tried it as a latte - and it was still delicious, but I was still searching for the English Toffee. I'm happy to say that I discovered the flavour the best in an iced tea with no milk OR sugar! That was super surprising to me! I usually add sugar to make the matcha sweet like the flavours usually are in their original forms, but this one came out the BEST unsweetened. Who would have thunk?<br /><br />I keep seeing online a "recipe" for iced matcha, or rather, instructions where all you have to do is add the powder to a bottle of water and shake like crazy! Well, I have tried that multiple times and it's gross every time haha. I uncap a bottle, sip a bit, shake some matcha in and shake away (for a loooong time) - but all I end up with is murky green water with clumps. Clumps that hit your teeth and dissolve into a bitter mess in your mouth.<br />THEN I read on a website (of course I can't remember which one) where they added just a half a teaspoon of matcha, and a tiny bit of cold water - the same way you would make hot matcha - to make a matcha paste first and then add more water! So I added my half tablespoon of English Toffee Matcha, about a teaspoon of water - and my shaking was vigorous! It created a smooth paste almost instantly with no lumps (I didn't even need to sift), I filled up my water bottle with the rest of the cold, filtered water. The liquid was emerald green, not lumpy or murky, and tasty! I didn't add sugar or anything else, just sipped away and lo and behold - English toffee flavour and natural sweetness from the matcha, with a bit of vegetal tones and no astringency.<br /><br />I'm pretty happy that I figured out the right way to make iced matcha in a bottle - I'm also happy with my English Toffee matcha. We're on good terms now ;)

review/summary: Just like Toffee!
review/text: When I opened the pouch I was excited because the smell was so amazingly good. I was preparing myself to be let down just in case because I figured this would be a difficult one to get right. I mean I really don't know when I can stop doubting Red Leaf Tea lol they have never let me down to date, so why would they now right? But still, I had to be cautious as I prepared my bowl of yumminess not to get my heart broken for the first time.<br /><br />As I am typing this I look sadly at my glass, as it is not half full or even half empty but it is totally empty and I am beginning to eat the remaining ice because there is still a little remnants of matcha hanging onto the cubes. If I could get my tongue down into the tall glass I would lick the inside of it!<br /><br />Having made my typical matcha latte, cold, with ice, creamer, milk, and the matcha mix I  think I gulped it down in a matter of minutes, and I am being generous, it was probably more like a manner of seconds! Its a wonder I even can recall what it tasted like as it blasted past my taste buds so quickly!<br /><br />It was in fact nutty, buttery, caramlish but with the toffee flavor of correctly burnt sugar flavor, and of course just the right amount of chocolate but not so much to mask the other wonderful flavors! And as always the amazing matcha powder base shines through taking away the guilt of the sweetly sinful, ummm sweetness!<br /><br />So again Red Leaf you delight me! Thank you for all your amazing matcha offerings and keep them coming!

review/summary: My first Matcha!
review/text: This is a good entry level Matcha. It is not bitter or grassy. This blend is perfectly balanced. I wanted to try a Matcha because I wanted the health benefits. It tastes so good, it is hard to not just gulp it down! I added milk after I whisked the powder with hot water because I wanted something cool and creamy. This is a great product and the customer service from Red Leaf Teas is outstanding. If you are on the fence about Matcha teas, go ahead and order your body will be glad you did!

review/summary: Great value and flavor!
review/text: I love toffee so I was super excited to give this matcha a try. I have to say this was a great choice for my first matcha from Red Leaf Tea. You can find more information about this beauty and order some for yourself here: [...]<br /><br />First off, the scent when you open the pouch is of creamy, rich caramel toffee. I was concerned that the color of the matcha would have been muddied a bit with the addition of flavoring, but luckily the matcha is a beautiful, deep green. I love that there are no artificial flavorings added to this tea because the color of matcha is definitely part of my overall experience. I don't have a sifter so I was worried that the matcha might be a bit clumpy, but it was perfectly smooth! After brewing this up without additions, it gives a pretty good froth. The flavor is primarily of lightly sweet toffee, but the matcha is not lost against the flavoring. However, there isn't any edge of bitterness like you usually get with unflavored matcha. If you are new to matcha or don't really enjoy the bitterness it can have, I highly suggest this company and flavor.<br /><br />Although the matcha was good without additions, I wanted this flavor as a dessert replacement. Next up, slightly sweetened matcha latte! I added just a teensy bit of sugar and a splash of milk into my chawan of matcha. Yum! This is pretty amazing! It is just like drinking matcha while eating a big hunk of toffee. This is definitely a great dessert replacement! "Wow!" is the only word that truly describes this flavor accurately. This is my first flavored matcha and it definitely will not be my last.<br /><br />I also want to add that my order was sent out quickly and I received both an email after submitting my order and after it shipped with tracking information. I'm very happy with the service I've received from Red Leaf Tea. I will certainly be ordering from this company again.<br /><br />While this is delicious to drink, I'm already planning how I can use this English Toffee Matcha to bake with. I think that this would be amazing in a buttercream icing and equally good in cupcakes or really any type of baked good. This would also be great incorporated into some whipped cream and used to top fresh fruit or angel food cake.

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: I've always been a huge fan of English toffee and English toffee-flavoured drinks. I loved English toffee cappuccinos in my coffee-drinking days and now I'm hooked on Red Leaf's English Toffee Matcha!<br /><br />I opened the bag with great expectations. The actual tea blew those out of the water! The scent was enough to send me running to the kitchen to make myself a cup. It smells like caramel and chocolate. A decadent dessert. I made a cold almond breeze matcha latte and slowly savored every sip. It truly tastes like what it purports to be. English toffee! I was skeptical about the English toffee-match combination, mostly because I couldn't conceive how the bitter, grassy matcha would pair with chocolate and caramel. But I was more than impressed. It tastes like English toffee, with no bitterness or grassiness of matcha. A hit!

review/summary: Toffee!
review/text: Now, I have to say, I am wildly impressed with Red Leaf Tea. With the sheer amount of matcha I've been getting through this promotion, I was starting to feel like I was taking advantage of their goodwill and resolved to hang up my reviewing hat, saying that I had tried all the flavors I wanted to try. Imagine my pleased surprise when I mentioned this in a review and they responded to let me know they were releasing new flavors soon and encouraging me to keep trying new ones and keep reviewing! I know they read all reviews posted and I've received wonderfully kind responses to my reviews and emails to them. Their customer service is stellar and it makes it so that I want to recommend their teas to everyone I meet (and I do!). And while yes, I have gotten a ton of matcha through this promotion, I've also gained an adoration of matcha that will keep me coming to them long after I really do stop reviewing their product. But by now they know me, and they know my reviews and they're just wonderfully kind to me. When I received my package yesterday, I found a little matcha spoon included with my order! I don't know if it's a promotion I just didn't see, or if it was for me specially, but it certainly made my day!<br /><br />I don't know an awful lot about English toffee, but what I do know, I like. I got this one to try with my wife, in an effort to get her to like matcha. We'll see how it goes!<br /><br />When I opened the package, it smelled a lot like the Caramel Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, which is very promising. I love their Caramel matcha. Brewed up, it still smelled like caramel, but with a hint of chocolate. And that's exactly what it tastes like, caramel mixed together with tasty, tasty chocolate. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this is very, very good. Very sweet too, but not overwhelmingly so. But then again, I like my teas sweet. But when I see pictures of English Toffee, this is what I think it would taste like, so yay! I love that it even tastes like that crunchy caramel....mmm. This would be a very good starter matcha for those who like sweet things, English Toffee especially. I might even win my wife over with this one!

McCormick's spices have always been a part of my kitchen and I was delighted to find this product sold in two 1-pound containers with free Super Saver shipping.<br /><br />The pepper itself is coarsely ground, which gives a nice peppery bite to foods.  We prefer it to finely ground pepper.  There are no additives or preservatives added, which is something I look for in all foods.<br /><br />I fill my smaller pepper containers (at the table at at the stove) from these larger ones.  I keep the second container in a zip lock bag in my freezer, to maintain freshness until I'm ready to use it.

review/summary: I love cheese grits
review/text: Good solid product. Granted, those who take their grits seriously would never be caught dead making instant grits, but for those of us who aren't so serious this is a quick easy solution. I do find that the quality is better if you let the product sit for about 5 minutes after you pour in the water. Grits take longer to soak in the water than instant oatmeal.<br /><br />I use this as a base for my breakfast, I make the grits in a microwave bowl, let it sit for a bit, then mix in some egg product (no cholesteral), nuke it for 2 minutes covered, and then throw in some tinned crab or lox or whatever and I've got a really tasty filling low cal hot breakfast.<br /><br />I also eat this stuff straight as snack in the evenings.<br /><br />I live in the midwest, and while Quaker headquarters is here, its almost impossible to find any of the instant grits other than the plain flavor in stores here, since grits is really a southern food. I was thrilled when I found I could buy it from Amazon.

review/text: My product was shipped very quickly, I'm grateful for that.  So far, I've found two packages with broken seals and stale product.  I've opened one intact package and find the flavour slightly bitter and the texture a bit over-hard.  I, personally, would skip this brand on my next attempt and this wouldn't be a halva I would recommend to anyone for the first time.  I can do better locally when it comes to quality, and at very competative prices on single 16 ounce units. Overall, a bit of a dissapointment I'm quite sorry to say - I ususally find Israeli products to be very high in quality.  Maybe Halva's not this company's niche.

review/text: Excellent product; lousy shipping.  I have purchased three times and each time at least three of the individual packages have been broken resulting in the need to be discarded.  The problem is on Israel's end, not Amazon's, since the damage is concealed within the heaving taping of the original box.  Some of the damage has been so extensive that the product has leaked into the original shipping container.  I want to purchase the excellent halva, but I do not want to spend money for twelve packages when nine or fewer are edible.
