review/summary: Best Peanut Butter I've ever tasted
review/text: I purposely purchase unsalted so I can add Redmond Real salt (very high quality sea salt with naturally occurring trace minerals and no flowing agents).<br /><br />I've tried all different kinds (natural, organic, conventional, etc.) and brands (Skippy, Jif, Adams, Maranatha, Laura Scudders, etc.) of peanut butter over the years. This peanut butter is a cut above them all. It is creamy (and not too thick to stir) and the flavor is amazing. I've never tasted its equal!

review/summary: Wouldn't use to kill a rat
review/text: I gave 1 star because I can't go lower!!!<br /><br />I've gone through many different brands of peanut butter over the years, and this one is by far the worst I've ever encountered.  The entire jar was a liquid mess that only by its color did it resemble peanut butter.<br />It wasn't a situation of separation but the entire jar was the consistency of a pudding.<br /><br />I, unfortunately, bought 4 jars of this repellent product and now don't know what to do with it.<br /><br />Avoid them if you can.

review/summary: Not quite smooth and not as tasty as the crunchy version
review/text: Not sure how this is listed as smooth peanut butter. It is smoother than their crunchy but there is still small chunks throughout. So far the best tasting "healthy" smooth peanut butter but for some reason every company I have tried cannot get smooth peanut butter down. Now if you try this same brand in crunchy I think it is fantastic and with only Peanuts and salt as the ingredients you arent consuming such unnecessary preservatives.

That's great but the store was about 20 miles from home so I decided to try this product.  It tastes fresh without the slight bitterness I sometimes detect in the grind-your-own variety.  If they were to make this in "crunchy", I would be over the moon!

review/summary: Bear Creek Hot and Sour Soup Mix
review/text: The absolute BEST one pot meal ever.<br />Economical, easy and quick, just add water...cooks in 8 minutes.  As is, it is far better, and less expensive, than any hot and sour soup I have had in a restaurant or a packaged mix purchased at a supermarket, including stores which specialize in Asian products.<br /><br />I have added chopped fresh garlic, cilantro, brocolli.  For extra protein, have added cooked chicken OR turkey, tofu, or may drizzle in raw scrambled egg just before it is finished cooking.<br /><br />Made according to package directions, it yields a gallon of soup, far more with the add ins.<br /><br />Please do note that this product is high in salt, which for me is no problem, as  MD advised to add more water and salt to my diet.<br /><br />PLEASE Country Kitchens and Amazon, do not discontinue this product!

review/summary: Hydrogenated oil...why??!
review/text: I love Bear Creek products, but why on earth are they still using hydrogenated oils?! (Note, you can't see it in the abbreviated ingredient list but on the package all the oil is specified as "partially hydrogenated". For no apparent reason they're taking a wonderful, low-calorie and otherwise reasonably healthful product and turning it into an artery-clogger. Please, Bear Creek, update your recipe and use un-hydrogenated oils!<br /><br />This soup mix, with some added hot sauce (I like a little Szechuan stir-fry sauce and some sichimi/nanami togarachi Japanese chili pepper mix), corn and mushrooms (wood ears, straw mushrooms and /or shiitake, maybe some oyster mushrooms too), with some potstickers cooked in the soup to absorb the flavor, makes a wonderful one-pot meal.<br /><br />All in all it's an otherwise terrific product, with totally unnecessary hydrogenated oil.

review/summary: Flavorful and good ... but not actually "hot & sour".
review/text: This was my first experience with a Bear Creek soup product. Their hot & sour soup mix couldn't be easier to use (boil water, open package) or faster (ready in 10 minutes) but it doesn't actually taste like real hot & sour soup, and I've enjoyed Chinese cuisine all over the United States. But that's not to say I don't like Bear Creek's effort! It still tastes distinctly Asian, has a nice kick to it, and if you reduce the water from 8 cups to 7 it's a little more robust. I also add cubed tofu, a package of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRSAJS">Miracle Noodle Shirataki Rice, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> and a couple of beaten eggs, all of which turn this soup into a very flavorful complete meal.

If you want the best hot and sour though, buy the Asian Home Gourmet paste packs.

review/text: The one good thing that I can say about this mix is that it does produce a very large amount of soup. That's the only good thing that I can say. I have had this soup many times while living on Long Island. Been to Chinatown in NYC many times and<br />I can tell you this mix absolutely does not taste anything like Hot & Sour soup. I currently live in Orlando and have been here for about 10 years. I find this soup is inconsistent among the various Chinese restaurants here, so that is why I tried this product. After making one package worth of soup(?) and trying it, I threw out the remaining 5 packages of mix. Talk about false advertising. I need to find a book that will provide a correct recipe for this delicious soup so that I can make the soup from scratch.

review/text: I bought this soup based on the glorious reviews. With the Armageddon news scared and how we should stocked up on food I went ahead and picked this up. I am very sorry I bought it now. Boy, am I ever sorry.<br />Follow instruction to the T. I also add some tofu and bamboo shoots. The soup turned out to be very runny and not as thick as it should. I have to whipped in a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up. Sour enough but hardly spicy hot. In addition, I never have noodle in my hot and sour soup before(homemade or restaurant), but hey, anything go, as long as it taste OK. But the noodle taste like overcooked spaghetti. Thank god there is not very much of them, and I can easily spooned them out. Also, there are specks of what I believe to be mushrooms, they so tiny, can't tell for sure.<br />Unless you add stuff to it, this soup by itself is wimpy and will leave a sour taste in your mouth!<br /><br />Five more packages to go.... Next time I will use less water, and see how it go.

review/text: Since my trip to Germany 4 years ago I have loved strong German coffee.  I brought back whole bean coffee from there and when it ran out I search for more German Coffee. I have been ordering the coffee in whole beans for about 2 years now.  My family loves this coffee and I had to order some for my cousin.  The instant is an easy alternative to one cup coffee.  I do not have to make a whole pot for just one cup.  Taste is delicious.

The first order I made for the same quantity but a few dollars less was back-ordered however no notification was given for it, I called Amazon about the delay and the rep was very kind, she stopped the first order and then ordered this shipment for me and did not charge the shipping, Amazon is the best.

review/text: I've ordered this product from Amazon several times over the past year or so and never had a problem.  That changed.<br /><br />When I unwrapped and tasted one of the Biscotti from a recent shipment I got a rather unpleasant taste of what I can only describe as the spice Cumin.<br /><br />I emailed Nonni's customer service to report the problem and got a response along the lines of "yeah, if the ingredients aren't mixed well you can get a clump of spice which results in an off taste."<br /><br />Huh?  That's it?  Suck it up, dude?  Who didn't manufacture a quality product...me?<br /><br />I was surprised and disappointed at the apparent lack of concern.<br /><br />So far about 1/2 of the 25-count tub have been consumed and I've found one other that tastes bad.  I won't bother reporting it again because clearly Nonni's manufacturer doesn't care.<br /><br />No more Nonni's product for me.

review/text: I ordered this item a couple months ago and love the flavor.  I use it just about everyday on so many foods(even popcorn). Since the grinder bottle is refillable I just ordered a large jar of it. I didnt give it 5 stars because I found one thing quite annoying.  The label information, except the Faerie's Finest logo, disappears as you twist it to grind the salt. I have never had any problems like that with other grinders.  So I hope the company reads  comments and come up with a label that will withhold the use.  As of now, when I refill the jar I need to somehow mark it with what type of salt it is.  (NOTE: all other information regarding what the contents are etc. are gone.)

review/summary: When people say, "Peet's flavor is too strong..."
review/text: ...THIS is what they're whining about!<br /><br />I like a deep, dark roast, and French is right up my alley. My preferred preparation is about 8g of coffee per "cup"  of water (generally accepted as 4 ounces -- don't get me started on that oddball convention!). So that's roughly 40g in my 20 oz. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064GSR4">Planetary Design French Press Mug</a>, my choice of brewing apparatus at work.<br /><br />Sure, I get kidded for being a coffee snob, slurping my expensive Peet's while the other guys are pouring insane amounts of artificially flavored CoffeeMate creamer into their bland, employer-provided "Columbian" or "Morning Roast." But when I'm generous and share a little of my stash with them, most jump at it. It's like that scene in Pulp Fiction: "Mmmmm, that's good coffee!"<br /><br />If you like something just a little stronger than Peet's French, try their Italian. Don't go overboard on your measure or it'll get bitter. A gram scale is a calibrated measure is in order. (In my case, we have an ice cream scoop at work that works out to be 1� scoops to get my desired 40g.)<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you want something a little milder that might be more "crowd acceptable" for mixed company, you can't go wrong with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024KGQJI">Peet's Major Dickason's Blend</a>.

review/text: I LOVE my Baby Brezza, but I wouldn't recommend the cutting board.  The white surface absorbs colors and has cut marks all over it after only a few uses.  If I had to do it all over again, I would simply continue to use my regular wood board instead of spending money on this one.  The fit over the machine is handy, but not a necessity.  Generally, I would need to put the cut up items in a separate bowl while waiting for a previous batch to finish in the Brezza anyway, so the handy "fit" doesn't really do me much good.  A good idea, but would be better if made from a more durable, non-staining material.

review/summary: WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!
review/text: I am a fan of cookbook author and blogger Gwen Ashley Walters, and have all three of her cookbooks, featuring recipes from chefs at guest ranches, ski retreats, and golf resorts. In her "Great Ranch Cookbook," published in 1998, she has two recipes calling for demi-glace, and references a brand of demi-glace concentrate available to consumers. The brand is still found today in many high-end grocery stores and specialty food stores across the country. Somewhere between 1998 and 2001, when she published "The Cool Mountain Cookbook," she discovered Master's Touch demi-glace concentrate, and she talked about it on her website, ([...]) under "cooking tips". She said it was the best she'd ever tasted, even better than many restaurant-made versions, but it was incredibly hard to find. Apparently it was on the store's shelf by mistake, when the deli ordered it to make a sauce and put the excess jars on the shelf for the public to buy. She suggested everyone call or write the company, demanding that it be made available to the general public. I called the company several years ago, and they referred me to a distributor who would sell it to me for a very hefty price plus shipping. I filed the information away, but didn't order.<br /><br />Fast forward to several weeks ago when I found it on the Amazon website. I immediately ordered some, and last night I made some red wine and shallot sauce for steaks we were serving. To make it interesting I also bought one (very small) package of the commercially available sauce to compare. The other sauce was $5 for enough demi-glace concentrate to make 1 cup. I used the entire $5 demi (3 tablespoons of concentrate) and 3 tablespoons of the Master's Touch and made two separate sauces. Upon opening each of them, I would have bet I'd have preferred the expensive alternative. It looked appetizing and the way I would have expected it to look. The Master's Touch did not look as appetizing, and I am still not sure how to describe it - like a brown whipped topping? Upon adding boiling water to it, however, it turned into a wonderful, sumptuous, rich, delicious beef gravy. I added it to my red wine and shallot mixture, which I had reduced down to a thick syrup, and reduced the whole mixture again for a fabulous sauce. To be fair, the other, more expensive demi also made a very good sauce, but it didn't go together quite as easily, and the price differential was staggering. For $28.34 I got enough to make 54 cups of sauce. To make the same amount of sauce, the commercially available demi-glace would have cost $270.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found the Master's Touch demi-glace on Amazon. If you enjoy cooking and are interested in restaurant-quality results, I think you will love it. I heartily recommend this product.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a hot sauce fanatic (there are at least 6 different types of hot sauce in his cabinet), and a Jim Beam/anything whiskey or Bourbon lover. He heard about the sauce but neither of us could find it in any stores, so I decided to buy it from Amazon (because of course they had it!). He absolutely loves it and puts it on everything, so needless to say, he will be keeping this in his stock of hot sauces.<br /><br />Seller was great too. They sent out the package ASAP and I received it a couple days before the earliest estimated delivery date.

review/text: These little fruit cups of peaches are quite scrumptious.  Being packed in apple juice is so much better than syrup and does not destroy the delicate peach flavor.  The fruit tastes freshly ripened but not mushy.  Each serving is perfect for one person and can be taken to work or where ever without a problem.  The price for each pack of 36 is good too (for now anyway).  I highly recommend these little (just 4 ounces) fruit cups.

review/summary: Dilute!
review/text: I've sought out Mitoku products over the years more for their superb quality than any alleged health benefits--I like good food. And there are times when a cup of miso soup really hits the spot, especially when you're not seriously hungry but need to ingest something tasty and satisfying yet light. I like miso soup a lot but have to be careful when ordering it at restaurants because it usually contains bonito (I'm vegetarian). I happened upon this at a local health food store and even though it was rather pricey for instant miso soup, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I chose this over Mitoku's white miso instant soup offering because even though I like white miso soup, I was looking to try something a bit heartier. And this, not unsurprisingly, turned out to be a good choice. However, the instructions are to add "a cup" of hot water and I took them at their word--I started with 8 oz. I found, however, that this resulted in a much too salty and intense serving; another ounce of water did the trick and produced a most palatable cup of soup.<br /><br />This variety contains dehydrated scallions and wakame which complement the broth nicely (I seem to recall that these are pretty traditional add-ins for red miso soup). Not unsurprisingly, this isn't in the same league as what you'd be served in a restaurant but it's very good nonetheless. Worth trying if you like miso soup and definitely one of the better such products I've sampled over the years.

review/text: Nothing will satiate your appetite like sardines.  My favorite is Season's Sardines, Skinless & Boneless<br />in Water with No Salt Added. They are hard to come by at the market so I am very pleased  that Amazon<br />offers the pack of twelve.  I like to add them to a salad of mixed greens with a little olive oil & balsamic<br />vinegar for a quick & nutritious meal.

review/summary: Healthy course in a compact can
review/text: If you are looking for a great healthy course that you can take with you anywhere, then this is it.  Sardines contain healthy nutritious food necessary for a good diet.  No sodium and they are great tasting, too.  Be sure to include a spoon to eat with.  It comes in a can that can be stored just about anywhere.  I have an emergency can in my work desk when I don't have time for lunch.  I have sardines with brown rice mixed together for an easy fast dinner option.  When I go hiking, I can put it in with my gear for a source of food on the trail.  It has a long shelf life and a great price.  This is a great product.

review/summary: such a special gem, this one!
review/text: after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be "ginseng for women" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to "draw one's energy" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's "good for you" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?

review/summary: After at least a year drinking this tea, some thoughts.
review/text: My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from "crisp and delicious" to "overpowering and slightly off-putting". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Good tea, very gingery
review/text: This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.

review/summary: Good tea wish it came in loose tea too.
review/text: I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.

Also, the grind is almost too fine and tends to 'clog' the filter when I brew more than half a pot.

Until this product I just gave up on cereal because I just didn't like the taste of other cereal. Either they were just so hard or too fake in taste and chocolate cereals got old very quick.  But this honey nut sans gluten changed all that.  Absolutely the best cereal I have come across and still haven't found any other cereal to meet it's caliber.  My toddler who isn't gluten free loves it.<br /><br />I also found that when crushed you can use this as a noncooking pie crust. or any recipe that requires bulk. (bread, or graham crumbs)
