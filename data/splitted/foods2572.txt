review/summary: One of the Best Tasting Jolly Ranchers
review/text: We remember eating Jolly Ranchers Cinnamon Fire as children, and didn't think they existed anymore.  Then on a hunch, we searched Amazon and found the Cinnamon Fire hard candy.  So we ordered a bag (160 pieces) through Candy Mafia.  This is such a great tasting candy.  We plan to order more.  We have had family and friends ask us where did we get them because you cannot find them in the stores.  Now if they will only bring back the LEMON and PEACH Jolly Ranchers!

Why ask if I wanted a gift message if it would come on a wrinkled 8 1/2 X 11  piece of paper typed in bold black letters (font size about 100).  Just think if I would have had the gift sent directly to it's recipient...?  "POOR, POOR, POOR"!

review/text: This is a versatile combination of herbs. It's got a lot of different flavors, and they work together nicely.  The components of this seasoning? Marjoram, thyme, rosemary, savory, sage, oregano, and basil.<br /><br />One specific dish I use this for is when I make our weekly "gravy" (spaghetti sauce). Tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, a little wine, a little garlic, and some of this Italian seasoning product. Let the sauce simmer slowly for an hour or two and the ingredients come together nicely.<br /><br />Sometimes I use the seasoning when I'm grilling vegetables, too.<br /><br />All in all, quite satisfactory.

review/summary: I love this tea!!
review/text: I bought this tea for my sister because she wanted a decaf hot beverage to enjoy while in the hospital.  I bought one for myself as well since it looked different from other chai teas I've tried.  It tastes amazing!  The best chai tea I have ever tried.  I bought an extra box for my mom.  Everyone seems to really enjoy the flavor.  It has a great aftertaste, you can taste a hint of coconut and ginger and other spices.  The aroma really reminds me of fall as well.  I enjoy a cup in the morning and a cup in the afternoon at work.  I think it might even be nice to try iced.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!

review/text: I'm really fond of this chai. I like a lot of chais, but this one is unique with the blend of red and decaf black tea, sweetened with coconut. It forgives a long steep or a wide range of temperatures (though hotter temps bring out better flavor), and I find the blend of flavors quite nice, particularly for such an inexpensive brand of tea.<br /><br />As with most chais, this tea is not at all bitter.

review/summary: Don't like taste, but do like medicinal qualities
review/text: Out of curiosity, I chose to purchase this particular flavor of Two Leaves and a Bud at my local grocer.  I do not like the taste of the tea without sweetner -- it is very bitter even when using a lower temp for the water (because its green tea) and this is the first time I've ever tasted a green tea that I didn't care for -- The Two Leaves and a Bud Jasmine Green is divine!  With sweetener, the Orange Sencha Green is tolerable (for me).  What I like about this green tea is its medicinal effects.  On the back of all Two Leaves & A Bud packages are brief statements listing what types of foods the teas pair with and/or what the tea is "best for."  The Orange Sencha Green Tea states that it is best for concentration ... and it is.  If I'm feeling particulary foggy headed or out of sorts (lol), I drink a mug of Orange Sencha Green and it clears my head right up!  I appreciate teas that have effective medicinal qualities that are evident within a few sips and this makes up for the unpleasant (my opinion) taste.  I will continue to purchase it and would recommend it as a good reading or studying tea.

review/summary: Do yourself a favor and order this exquisite Green Tea
review/text: I only thought I knew what Green Tea was supposed to taste like before trying this awesome product. My local grocery store was clearing it out (much to my benefit). Once I experienced it, I drove back the very next morning and bought the remaining inventory they had to enjoy and share with friends. Several months later after running out, I went to the company's website in Aspen Colorado and ordered some more.<br /><br />When I ran out again, they were kind enough to inform me that I could order it from Amazon and that it would qualify for Amazon's awesome free shipping. What an amazing deal. Thanks to everyone at Two Leaves and a Bud and Amazon for their insight to carry such a great product.<br /><br />Bt the way... This is "Whole Leaf Green Tea" and the tea bags are adorable sachets versus the paper type you get with everyone else. Top drawer stuff. You actually savor every last drop.

review/text: I debated a little about whether or not to order just because the reviews are so split down the middle. But I'm a big fan of other Two Leaves and a Bud varieties so I decided I had to give it a fair try. I'm glad I did! I prepared it with warm water, just the same as I do with all green tea, and it turned out really nicely. It's got a light smooth flavor & just a hint of orange. With just a little bit of stevia, it was perfect. I am not a sencha aficionado, so I cannot make a thorough comparison to other sencha teas. But I have been drinking a variety of green teas for a long time and can definitely say it stacks up to the other nice greens that I've had. It's also really refreshing iced so I recommend giving it a try that way this summer as well!

review/text: I really like this tea. My doc told me to up Green Tea consumption for the theanine benefits, but honestly, most green teas taste nasty to me. So far this one, and Celestial Seasonings Raspberry are the only two I can stand. I have tried Zhena's green teas, and other brands, but I like this one best. I add a teensy bit (1/4 teaspoon) of Organic Agave for sweetening, and I'm good to go. The bags are elegant, and I love the orange aroma of this tea. I also enjoy Two Buds Earl Grey and their Assam (with almond milk, yum). I wish that other reviewer who disliked this flavor would send me his/her box of 100! I'll drink it. Maybe if you're a purist Green Tea person, this one is too flavored; but like I said, my uneducated palate loves it.

Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference - almost as good as brewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient.  It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however.  They do not seem to be readily decomposable - not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can.

review/summary: Hideous over-powering orange flavor
review/text: Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and "deep"). I have also tried many of the products offered by "Two Leaves and a Bud" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & "bitty" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee.

review/text: I'm sorry to say I was not exactly thrilled when I tasted this brand of "Branston" or ploughman's pickle.  There is a high proportion of "sauce" to veggies, and the flavor is blander than I like.  I also reviewed the Crosse and Blackwell Branston Original (much better, IMO) and would recommend it over the Heinz.<br /><br />I noticed that this is packed in Holland.  Don't know if that has anything to do with anything but seems odd.  The crunchy bits are not quite as crunchy as I like, and it's soupy, rather than being thick.  It's not a terrible product, but I believe the Heinz is higher priced than the C&B, so I'd recommend that for more flavor and crunch and less drips.

For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds. Mother picks out her own groceries, and was in the habit of buying these about every other week. She bought two other Murray's packages this week, but really wanted the peanut butter. That's why I went searching the internet for them. After I receive them, (12 boxes!) I probably will keep at least one box to try for myself. (It would be nice to be able to buy an assortment from Amazon rather than so many of one variety--that would be a lot for a 94-year-old woman to eat, even if they are that good!)

review/summary: No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts
review/text: My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be "sugar free", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need "special" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for "special" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit.

review/text: Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a "sweet" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies. I like oatmeal cookies anyway so gravitated toward their cookie. I promise I couldn't tell they didn't have sugar in them. I'm so addicted to them that I even carry them when I travel (wonder what the suitcase inspectors think?!) My grandkids even recognize MY cookies and now ask for them over the sugar-loaded kind. Trouble is, I can never find them. I don't know if they're just very popular or the wholesaler doesn't bring enough. It could be that I buyt 4 to 6 packages every time I DO find them. Murray says I can find them at Wal-Mart but never have although they do have the other flavors. Now I look to Amazon and they don't have them either! I have a hint of how drunks feel when they can't get their liquor! Please, Amazon, hurry and get a supply before I run out!

review/summary: Diabetics With A Sweet-Tooth --- REJOICE!
review/text: When I was diagnosed with type-II diabetes about two years ago, it felt like a death blow. I mean, I love sweets. And my favorite were peanut butter cookies (my wife also made a mean peanut butter cheesecake that I still crave to this day but am able to hold off thanks to these Murray Sugar Free Cookies). I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame). There's no horrible after-taste and the peanut butter flavor is just enough to satisfy my slavering pallete.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quality cookie that won't shoot your blood sugar up into the statosphere, these are a great option.

review/text: My fiance & I are following a reduced carbohydrate eating plan.  Given that these are sugar free, they are great for when you need something sweet, but with a slighter glycemic impact than regular cookies.<br />They taste almost like Girl Scout Thin Mint patty cookies!  They are NOT, however, low in calories, or free from ingredients that some may feel are "unhealthy".<br />Since people's ideas vary greatly as to what is bad for them & what is okay, there is some understandable controversy.  In my opinion, most of America is over weight because they don't know HOW to eat, but that's just my take on things.  Everything is conflicting.  Low carbohydrate foods are higher in calories & vice verse.  I have an extreme digestive sensitivity to Malitol (Maltitol), which is a sweetener used in most sugar free chocolate items.  While these cookies don't contain Malitol (Maltitol),there are very few items available that are without it.<br />Bottom Line: They taste great!  My suggestion would be to check the ingredient list & nutritional information each & every time you purchase, I recommend purchasing in a grocery store, rather than online.

review/summary: Good enough!
review/text: For people avoiding sugar, Murray Sugar Free Cookies Oatmeal, are good enough! This whole thing about sugar free products got me intrigued and confused at the same time. Some products that advertised as being sugar free have a lot of other sources of sugar, like alcohol, that are high. The feeling I get with Murray's is that they are reliable in their claims. I see them in all sorts of reputable publications and that gives me encouragement regarding their advertisement. As to the taste I can say they are pretty good tasting. Have tried their other ones and this one and the chocolate are the ones I favor. Who am I? Hungry hungry all the time for sweets but I realize not all sugar free items are created equal. For now a decent 4 stars rating!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.  But these cookies aren't your typical peanut butter cookie.  They are pleasantly fragrant, delicately buttery and crisp (no mealiness like most others), with good-sized pieces of peanuts mixed in. Just delicious!

review/text: Good cookies. They're made with Splenda. I guess that makes them sugarfree. They certainly don't taste like they are. I despise the taste of fake sweetners, but the folks at this company did a great job. The cookies are very yummy! I only gave it four stars, because I prefer soft  and chewy oatmeal cookies.

review/summary: wonderful alternative
review/text: My favorite uncle is diabetic, and I always feel awful when I invite him for my birthday and he can't join in on eating cake with the rest of us. I picked up a package of these and used them for a cookie crust on a cream pie with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVD4">Jell-O Sugar-Free Instant Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate, 1.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a> and whipped cream lightly sweetened with non-sugar sweetener. The result was gorgeous and tasted pretty good even to those of us who can have sugar. For him? He told me "You know I can't have sugar." and when I told him it was sugar free he dug in with gusto. He said "It's not even my birthday and I feel like I got the best present."<br />It was so easy to make, and the crust was his favorite part. I gave him an extra package of cookies I bought and he enjoyed those a lot too.<br />Love these for making it so much easier to make special treats for my uncle.

review/summary: Big Chocolate Taste
review/text: I could EASILY gain 15-20lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookies/candy that is so available.<br /><br />I bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE, they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they won't take the place of home-made fudge or gourmet chocolates, they are still satisfying.<br /><br />They are tiny, not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I don't have to worry about portion control. Also, it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package. My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber, they don't spike his blood sugar.<br /><br />The only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upset.<br /><br />I'm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry, I know I won't indulge as often.

review/summary: High antioxidants compromise the taste
review/text: As far as antioxidants go, this is the best tea you can get for the highest concentration.  One great thing is that after I drink it, I feel focused and calm.  When it comes to taste, on the other hand, this is an extremely bitter tea.  Doesn't really taste like green tea at all.  The first time I tried it, I felt nauseous.  But, I drink it with breakfast everyday (contains Caffeine) and now I don't really mind the taste as much.  So it's probably just an acquired taste.<br /><br />That said, if your a beginner to tea choose something else because you'll probably spit this out.  Otherwise give it a try, it's really healthy.

review/summary: Low Fat Is the Bonus
review/text: Agreeing with other reviewers, this is the best BBQ flavored chip of any kind I've ever had.  The fact that it's low-fat (and all natural with few ingredients) is almost incidental, but so great. These bags are bigger in size and less expensive than my supermarket.  Fantastic value. This size wasn't available for a little while on Amazon so I'm thrilled it's back! (The only problem with the big bags instead of individual sizes is it's VERY hard to stop eating them. But hey, even a whole bag won't set you back as much as a single portion of deep fried chips!)

review/text: I'm addicted to these things!  They have the best BBQ flavor of any chip I've ever tried!  And SO low in fat and calories.  A single  serving is almost a full cereal bowl.

review/text: I first tasted this sauce while backpacking through Sumatra in the 80s.  The taste of hot potato chips (fries) with this sauce never left me and I've had a bottle in stock ever since.  Splash it on your chow-mein or spring rolls, take a dash in a good chutney sandwich or smear it into a good burrito - the sweet, hot, garlicky taste is the best of all the sauces I've tasted in this genre.

review/summary: Love ALL Natural Balance flavors
review/text: My cats have been on Natural Balance dry and canned food for more than 6 months, and I am not going back to any other brand.<br />First of all, the can is 6 oz. so it's more food for a reasonable price.<br />Most importantly, the dry and canned foods are nutritious, all-round, and healthy. Consumer reports (online)researched them and found them to be the best cat food out there. And now, my cats can prove it. They don't eat so much, have maintained their weight, and their coats are so soft and glossy that I can't stop petting them.<br />Indoor formula and Ultra is their favorite, along with Salmon.

review/summary: Great Wet Food for Indoor Cats - Worth the Money
review/text: When you buy Natural Balance (Dick Van Patten's Brand from "Eight is Enough" -- who knew) you will discover that you are paying more than your regular Friskies, 9-Lives or regular store available brands.  In fact, sometimes this brand is hard to find ... but it's worth every penny.<br /><br />Our cats enjoy a mixture of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008VKBEQ">Wellness Healthy Weight Formula Dry Cat Food</a> and Natural Balance wet food.  I use the Indoor formula because they are indoor cats.  Our cats love this formula and chow it down like happy campers.  Their fur is soft as can be, their eyes are bright and they are in great health.<br /><br />You need to understand that in the world of cat food like so many other things, you really get what you pay for.  You will either spend more money on food, or eventually more money on litter materials because feeding a cat regular store bought food with a lot of "corn meal" filler creates the smelliest, and fullest litter box around.  Time has taught me this.<br /><br />Once you begin to understand that all cat foods are not created equal and where there is "corn meal" filler in the ingredient list (cheap for manufacturers and smelly for the household), you will have more cat waste and more litter to have to scoop and buy.<br /><br />With good foods like Natural Balance (if your cat tolerates it well), you will discover less cat "poop" in the litter box and a LOT less smell around the house.  Put good stuff in your cat, get more pleasant outcomes :)<br /><br />I've lived it and learned it.  We are a 5 cat household with ONE litterbox and do amazingly fine.  I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUIP9Y">Nature's Logic Ponderosa Pine Cat Litter</a> and this keeps odors to an absolute minumum.  Some people wonder if we have cats!  I change our box twice a week.<br /><br />Good stuff in, good stuff out = happy cats and happy owners.

review/summary: good cat food...
review/text: My cats like this food but not anymore that what I was feeding them before.  I was feeding them Nutro Natural Choice Indoor formula prior to trying out Natural Balance.  Nutro Natural Choice brand is signigicantly cheaper and still has a good ingredient list (no by-products/meal or high grains content).  I also didn't notice any difference in terms of my cats litter behavior or coats in switching the foods.  Another thing that is minor but that I didn't like is that the cans came all dented.  For a balance of cost and ingredients I think I'll be going back to Nutro after this order has been finished...

review/summary: Quality inconsistent
review/text: My last purchase of 4 cases of this food had a sour off- smell. Called natural balance customer service, they said they hadn't received complaints about that batch, they'd pass info along to tech dept, they'd send me a coupon for 1 case.... But, it's a natural product, and variation "was to be expected".  They suggested I return it to the retailer. Paying for shipping 3 times (receiving, sending back, receiving again) for a heavy product like this makes it very expensive.<br />I've fed this variety to my 3 cats for a year (alternate with Natural Balance Ultra), and they have always loved it.  They will only eat this batch if they are very very hungry.  I can barely stand to open the cans. All other batches had a clean fresh smell.<br />I'm disapointed with the customer service response to a quality issue from a heavy user of their premium priced product. (I have 3 cats). I won't buy from Natural Balance again. I'll use the coupon locally, and make sure I'm mixing production runs.

review/summary: Wonderful, cats love it, healthy, great price!
review/text: This is an excellent high quality cat food at a reasonable price. While it is pricier than your average store cat food, it truly saves you money in the end. I have noticed over 3 months of use that my cats are eating less as they are more satisfied now and getting the nutrients they need. I purchase cat food literally half as often so in the end am spending less than if I was buying a poorer quality food. Also believe it or not, there is far less in the litter boxes now (no doubt due to less processed junk to eliminate and eating less quantity)so in the end I'm saving on litter as well. The best part is there is a notable difference in my cats health. All have shinier, softer coats and my 5 year old boy jack seems to be suffering less with allergies and his sensitive stomach. Definitly a wonderful buy and a great product!!! Shipped fast.

We have tried him on many foods - from prescription diet to vet recommended foods, and until this food, he turned his nose up at pretty much all of them, so much to the point that he lost over 10 lbs in a very short amount of time.  I was literally at my wit's end over it.  Then I saw this food at a local pet store and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!

review/summary: Don't love the taste, but it works!!
review/text: Until I started drinking this tea, I had not had a "normal, natural" period in years.  I had to induce my period with Rx drugs about every three months or so.  Since I started the tea in October 2010 (5-6 months now), I have had THREE natural periods, and have not had to induce even once.  That is amazing!  I also have a general increase in energy since I started drinking it, and have reduced my coffee intake to just one cup daily because of it.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I don't love the taste... it tastes a bit like a celery tonic to me... however, I am slowly acquiring the taste and even if I wasn't I would still drink it for the health benefits, which are truly amazing.

review/text: I'm 23 and had a hormonal imbalance where i would  not get my period. My doctor immediately said, well here is some birth control for you. I tried the pills and got sick (nausea/migranes/stomach aches). I wanted something natural, so i decided to do some research online and bumped into this tea. I read some good reviews so i decided to give it a try. I have never really been a tea drinker so the initial taste was horrid but since i was hoping to get better i decided to drink it anyways. I started getting my period naturally after 3 months of drinking this cup of tea with two tea bags everyday. I guess it depends on the severity of your imbalance, some people say they see a difference within days or weeks. Bottom line is it has worked for me, i am still using it and will continue using it. Yes i recommend it! :)

review/summary: Impressive Cup of Tea, Could Be Helpful with Women's Health Issues
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Woman's Dong Quai Tonic from Yogi Tea is for hormone balance. I'm pretty finicky with my tea tastes and I like it. It has an herby and slightly spicy, slightly sweet taste to it that makes it a pleasure to drink. I usually brew two bags in one cup, which is recommended on the package for overall health and fatigue relief. It is stronger that way, and more intense of an experience, although it still tastes great with just one bag. I'd been having lots of hot flashes and wanted to get down to business with this tea.<br /><br />Woman's Dong Quai Tonic comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh) and is organic.<br /><br />The ingredients in Woman's Dong Quai Tonic are: dong quai root extract, juniper berry extract, and a proprietary blend of herbs, including all organic: cinnamon bark, orange peel, ginger root, fennel seed, chamomile flower, dandelion root, anise seed, stinging nettle leaf, dong quai root (I guess as opposed to the extract), black pepper, and orange oil. Amazingly, I can taste some of these, like the chamomile, and the anise seed and the ginger, making for a lovely and complex cup of tea. I'm impressed!<br /><br />Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Organic Woman's Dong Quai Tonic is an effective and organic way to lessen fatigue, restore your energy and balance a woman's hormones. This healing tonic is formulated to ease what traditional Chinese medicine practitioners refer to as "blood deficiency," resulting from stress, poor digestion, or improper eating and health habits. We've included in our tonic the potent "Queen of Herbs" Dong Quai (Angelica sinensis), shown to be effective in supporting the reproductive organs, addressing common female hormone imbalances, helping to regulate the menstrual cycle and building all-around health. Bartram's Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine (1995) indicates Dong Quai is useful for a wide range of female conditions, including minor symptoms of PMS (such as mild mood changes) and menopause (such as hot flashes). This powerful herb is complemented by Organic Nettle to help detox your body, as well as Organic Dandelion Root and Juniper Berry to help maintain proper water balance. According to yogic wisdom, women have greater emotional awareness and intuitive powers. A woman can choose to be balanced, happy and healthy. Choose to drink a daily cup of Woman's Dong Quai Tonic and feel like your healthy, beautiful, graceful self." I don't know about that, but I do like the tea, and it seems like it might be helping with my hot flashes (I've been having fewer...whether or not it's due to the tea, I don't know!), which is why I bought it---for menopausal support.<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Good for bringing on a period
review/text: I have PCOS so I don't always get a period. I try to make my body have periods because if I skip, I get moody and my face breaks out. Sometimes, that still happens even when I get a period. This is good for bringing on a absent period - as in one that has already skipped. I won't drink it other than that because the taste is TERRIBLE. I can't believe anyone would say this tastes good. It's like a combo of licorice, celery and pepper. It actually contains pepper, if you can believe that! It's pretty much disgusting. It also gives me strange cramps all over. Not sure what that' about, and it seems to trigger irregular heartbeat in me. I'm prone to that, but certain things bring it out. One night, I also noticed a sped up heart rate. Metformin, maca, and other drugs that promote ovulation seem to have this affect on me. They do work, but you have to keep an eye out for side effects.<br /><br />So, I reserve this tea for the end of my cycle, if I feel like I'm going to skip. I'll take it towards the end of my cycle or else wait until it's skipped, then try it. I'm trying raspberry leaf tea as it tastes much, much better, and is calmer on my system. You drink it every day and for some PCOS'ers, it brings on periods. I hope to be one of those. I'm unfortunately out right now, which is why I'm drinking dong quai. I order raspberry leaf tea from here as it's hard to find in stores, but it's taking its time getting here (with holidays). That's why I'm glad I have dong quai in reserve. I think it does help me feel calmer toward the end of my cycle. I've been drinking it the past 2 days and I don't have that irritable feeling I get around this time.

review/summary: Cures my adult hormonal acne
review/text: At the age of 30 I developed severe hormonal acne mainly on my cheeks, chin, and upper lip area. I went to a dermatologist who said this is "normal" for women my age with a hormonal imbalance... acne tends to develop around the areas that men get facial hair. She wanted me to take birth control, some other hormonal pill, and use 2 facial creams.<br /><br />INSTEAD I found this tea. Now keep in mind I'd been dealing with this acne for 2 years and it continued to get progressively worse. I was up to 2 or 3 new zits a day. I started to drink only one cup of this a day and within a month I noticed a significant difference. After 2 months the breakouts stopped altogether. If I stop drinking the tea the breakouts return within a week or so and I have to start the process all over (learned that the hard way... TWICE).<br /><br />So I'll just continue to drink the tea... I never had any cycle imbalance problems and I still don't. I chose to write this review because the acne had been taking a toll on my overall self esteem and I was getting to the point that I hated going to work... or leaving the house for that matter. I'd never had acne before IN MY LIFE. This tea has been a blessing and is just part of my daily routine now. The scars have healed and I DO NOT get breakouts anymore.<br /><br />I never took what the doctor prescribed for me. So YES I'm sure the tea is what's doing the trick. And like I said... when I stop drinking it the breakouts start back up. If I skip a day or two it doesn't seem to have an affect. I drink the Red Raspberry Leaf tea with it.<br /><br />I really hope this review helps someone else. If it does... please comment to let me know. Thanks!

review/text: This tea is good. I am addicted. Dong Quai is known to work well for those who are trying to fix/adjust their hormones and better their reproductive organs. Also I recommend the tea for the time of the month as well. OMG is does miracles. I never have cramps with is if I have a cup or two a day or two before I am expecting my first day. :)

review/text: Oh wow!  Am I loving this tea!  Not only is it aromatic and has a nice, spicy note at the end, it is helping me health-wise so much!<br /><br />I've been drinking this tea for almost a week now and it seems to be balancing my body out tremendously.  Gone are my intense craving for sweets, gone is my water weight and I feel more relaxed, at ease, blood pressure is coming down and did I mention I lost 2 pounds in a week?<br /><br />I'm 47 and have been plagued with the most horrid cramps ever and menstrual flow so heavy, I've had to resort to wearing Depends PLUS feminine protection each month  I can't WAIT to see what effect it will have on my period, but something tells me it will be the first normal one I've had in years....<br /><br />And it's delicious to boot!<br /><br />I am loving Yogi teas!

review/text: Now, usually I am not a fan of warm tea.  Actually I hate warm tea, I have to gulp it down so I can't taste it, but this stuff is so good.  I love it. I keep a tea kettle on the stove on my warming unit so I can make tea all day.  I add 1 - 2 small teaspoons of honey per cup, but it is suprisingly good without honey also.  It is great anytime of day, morning or night because it contains no caffine.  I haven't seen any changes in my energy or anything because I have only been drinking the tea for a few days but I will update my review later.  This is a great tea and I will definitly keep drinking it.  I look forward to trying the rest of their teas.

review/text: I have the worst cramps every month. By this I mean the kind of cramps that make you want to stay in bed with a heating pad for the rest of the day. But this tea really helps to make them more bearable. I've found that it helps to start drinking the tea a couple of days ahead of time and for extra bad cramps I use two tea bags instead of one. As for the taste I actually like the spicy orange flavor, you can add a dash of cream to help tone down the spicy flavor if needed.

review/text: I'm not sure why this is called Woman's Energy. Maybe it revs up some women, but for me, it's the exact opposite, and I get drowsy and sleepy, but it's a "peaceful, easy feeling". It does contain chamomile. The taste, well, it's an herbal tea, and most of them taste like grass to me, but with a dollop of almond milk and a little agave nectar, it's quite drinkable. I'm post menopausal, and I'm trying to get my HRT on a moon phase schedule, so I plan to begin drinking this only on the 4th week of my cycle to see if it will help balance my hormones, which have been a mess since my surgery nearly 20 years ago, even with compounded bio-identical hormone cream. I would recommend this tea but not for an energy boost.

review/text: I USE TO BE ABLE TO SET MY WATCH TO AF After IUD (copper) I became irregular, would skip atleast 2 mos,no longer have IUD still irregular, went to the DR. the prescriptions came out, I don't take hormones or B-control because it does not work well w/ my system at all!!!!!!! so that was out! You would think that the DR. would try alternatives knowing that Depo almost killed me (ONE SHOT) only but not quite! OF COURSE NOT, RIGHT? Story short after labs I needed to balance my hormones naturally, I had all kinds of symptoms from the imbalance  E.G.- sore Nips, tired, not sleeping well, irritated,and retaining unwanted weight to say the least even working out not loosing as fast as I know I should. I thought I would try this tea. Now i have a really sensitive system, I don't drink I don't smoke and if there is a side effect usually I would get it, I drank this tea (one bag) Wednesday afternoon and immediately started feeling weird and felt cramps, I got tired hence (suppose to give you energy) and went to sleep when I woke up I felt rejuvenated had the best sleep I had since JUNE it is now September, the next day i felt soreness in my nips subside a great deal, but I was sore in my neck and my butt as if i had worked out HADN'T this might be a side effect.! so I decided to lay off the tea for a few days until the soreness left, Thursday was feeling a bit lighter so I got on the scale lost 2 lbs I weighed in at the Dr. wednesday at 157+tax and was 155.00 no change, by Friday once I got home from work AF, very light but "it was there" one cup of tea for me  last cycle MAY, wipe SPOTTING oN AUGUST 28-SEPTEMBER 3 IT IS SEPTEMBER 22ND WE we will see what else happens I just finished my 2nd cup. I usually don't write reviews, but with the hope this product gave me I thought I would share. P.S. I dont mind the taste is it AMAAAZZZIIINGGG!? ABSOLUTELY NOT but it is ok.

review/summary: This product combined with Progesterone cream helped me get my cycle back!
review/text: I read the reviews of this product about everyday for a week because some reviews seemed so convincing, but when I saw that some of the reviewers didn't review much it made it hard to believe. And I haven't reviewed anything much on Amazon here, mainly for privacy reasons. But for the fact it's been a month since I ordered this and tried it, and got a natural spotting. (after 9 months or longer) I felt I had to write a review! I also ordered Fertilica Natural Progesterone 3oz. at the same time and started it at the same time with this tea and I believe they both helped jump start one day of my cycle. With the Progesterone cream, if you don't have cycles you need to just pick a day to start it and call that day 7, then use it twice a day till day 26th and stop. I went over a day by accident, but that was probably ok. Anyway about this tea, I liked the ingredients in it, most of the ingredients I see in it are used in other medications you can buy online to help get your cycles or help get pregnant so that was impressive. And yes the tea is not the best tasting, I tried adding sweetener to it and that ruined it, so I drink it alone, I wait till it gets warm and gulp it down, once in the morning and once at night. There were a few days I forgot to drink it but overall I think it did what it says and I have a lot left over in case I need to jump start my cycle again.
