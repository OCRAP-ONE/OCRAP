review/summary: bad diarrhea
review/text: My 7 year old beagle loves this food. When we first got it i mixed with her old food for 2 weeks, she would eat all of Orijen before her old food. Her stool was fine during that 2 weeks, but once we were out of her old food her stool became liquidy that it was impossible to pick up. Now it has been 7 weeks and we see no sign improvement... still bad diarrhea.

review/summary: Best Doggie Food in my book!
review/text: My mommy got me this new food and I just LOVE it! She used to make my food special, cooking me turkey, beef and veggies. I have allergies and my skin gets very itchy and mommy worries about me. So, she took me to the vet and that's where we heard about Orijen. It's super tasty! I can't wait for mealtime! My skin feels better and I have more pep in my step! Plus, mommy says that it's cheaper and easier on her than making me special food, and by feeding me Orijen, she knows I'm getting all the vitamins I need to grow up a strong happy doggie! I give Orijen four paws up- I'd give it five but I only have four (LOL)!

review/summary: Orijen - Champion Dog Food Award 2011-2012 , Washington, DC
review/text: First of all, to those afraid their dog will get to much protein from the best quality dog foods ..feed your dog according to his weight and instructions on the bag! Use caution and research for his daily needs according to his weight if feeding high protein wet & dry food at the same time in seperate bowls. If you dont, don't blame Orijen if he gets elevated liver enzymes. Blame yourself for not doing your homework!<br />Glycemic Research Institute, Washington, D.C has awarded Orijen another Pet Food of the Year award. For those not familiar w/ this institite, they also do clinical investigations for our gov. Anyway I was doing a research on weight-loss products and stumbled upon the dog food and dog treat awards lol. Below are links, the latter are awards for past certified doggie products [...] (lab info)<br />[...]  (look to left column for best cat & dog stuff)<br />[...]

review/summary: loose stools
review/text: Actually caused my dog to have bad diarrhea.  We have a border collie who has been on a raw diet due to allergies and we wanted to try a grain free kibble to see if it would be easier to travel with.  She liked it first time and then not so much for the next two times and then the loose stools began. I think the quality of the food is good - but not sure what is causing this side effect. Had to stop and go back to raw food supplemented with Sojo's grain free.

review/summary: Quality, not Quantity...
review/text: ...because it is FAR too expensive in quantity! :)<br /><br />Orijen dry dog food is rich in proteins as it is nearly 100% meat from a variety of pure sources: chicken, fish, etc.<br />We mix this dog food during the dinner feed 50/50 with lesser grade Iams Healthy Choices as I'm not so sure a pure Orijen diet is a good idea for our aging Rottweiler. The food smells very strong and it is a very dark color - very different than lower-grade commercial dry dog food.<br /><br />The bag is sealed when it arrives, and has a very good shelf life while sealed (air-tight) in the bag. When opened, poor the bag into a sealable (air-tight) container for storage and keep in a cool, dry place.<br /><br />The dog food is so expensive, one could actually cook fresh food for the dog at lesser cost. But there is an advantage in dry dog food in that it is more convenient, and the kiblets help to keep the dogs teeth clean.

review/summary: Balance is everything
review/text: My Beagle was a troublesome eater. I did research and found Orijen but feared what a high Protein diet might do to my little Diva. So, I used innovation. I mix frozen green beans, chopped up apple, broccoli, and Kir yogurt or a small can of Chef Michael and mix it with her food. The cost of Orijen is irrelevant because as many of you have said I use a small amount of it. By adding different vegetables and fruit, everyday she has a unique meal. Polo is a beautiful animal and is exceedingly happy with no health problems, and my mind is at peace.  One size does not fit all but with a little creativity you can have your own win-win.

review/summary: good quality per my research but price... jeez
review/text: I'm giving 4 stars to this product because the price is sooo high.<br />But I would say this food is good quality per my research.<br />I used to feed my dogs with "puppy chow" and later when they got older "dog chow"<br />I have parrots and I always researched for the best food for them because I was a first time parrot owner. While I was researching for my parrots food I started to think about my dogs... so I realized I may have dogs for years but I never took the time to check their food.<br />Dog Chow is a very popular brand and I always though it was at least an average quality for my dogs that also eat fresh home made food.<br />I researched and find out that good part of the food is made by corn!!!! I felt so guilty for my babies and I started to look which dog food would be more recommended.<br />I ended up finding this web site: [...]<br />Based on the reviews and information found on the website above I decided to buy orijen and also Instinct.<br />Problem is that my babies tummy is used with "dog chow" and I know they can get sick with this new food even it's the best quality you can get. So I'll just start to mix a little bit with the "dog chow" until they get used with orijen and instinct.<br />If you are one person that knows how to prepare balanced and nutritious fresh home made food for dog I would say to stick on that. There is no processed food that is better than a fresh food. The trick about home made food is that you need to know how to prepare to cover all your dogs needs, if you don't know to do that you may ended up giving less nutritional food than a processed food can give to your dog.<br />Again, something I told before in a review. Please be responsible on caring and loving your animal. Remember you have friends and family, your pet has only you. You may live beyond 70 years old, you dog will have only 10 years to enjoy his life and will totally depend of you to be happy and healthy.

review/summary: I won't feed them anything else!
review/text: I have been feeding my dogs Orijen pet foods since they were puppies and I couldn't be happier.  I have tried other dog foods only to be disappointed.  I have a blue pitbull that has sensitive skin and some of the other dog foods have caused her to break out in hives.  I also have a Shepadoodle(1/4German Shepard, 3/4Standard Poodle) who has a sensitive stomach and he tends to throw up pretty frequently on other dog foods.  Orijen is as good as it gets for dry dog food.  I also like to supplement it with "Cabot Plain full fat greek yogurt," and raw meat.

review/text: I mix this food 1/2 and 1/2 with Life's Abundance dry food.  This is the only concoction my dog gets.  She is now two years old and extremely healthy.  My previous pet, because of my ignorance, was fed regular store food plus table scraps.  Of course she loved those table scraps but paid a terrible price later in life with gastric distress.  I feel like I was a bad owner and let her down.  No people food for my current pet.  Her weight is perfect and a nice bonus is no begging while I'm eating.  I love her and don't want to bring her any problems we humans have with our stomachs.  This dry dog food is excellent.

review/summary: If I were a dog, this is what I would feed myself
review/text: You know how you are supposed to transition gradually to a new food? When I first started to switch my dog to this, she picked out all the new pieces and left the old stuff behind. (old stuff=Blue Buffalo). Now I usually prefer raw but will feed kibble because of convenience, but only Orijen or Acana (both made by Champion Pet Foods in Alberta). Orijen uses all fresh, human grade ingredients, with no grains, animal by-products, unnamed meat sources, or anything else I don't want in my food.<br /><br />Champion Pet Foods is an award-winning boutique manufacturer who does not outsource any stage of production or buy any supples from Chia. They are passionate about pet nutrition and the proof is on the kibble. It is highly palatable, nutritious, and safe.<br /><br />It is pricy and distribution is not as good as some, but well worth the extra effort and expense.

review/summary: ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!
review/text: I have two picky Golden Retrievers.  One girl is 8 years old and the other just turned 2 years.  It has taken me forever to find a good kibble they both like and I finally did!!!  I researched for the best dry dog kibble and came up with study after study.  Origen was either #1 or at least top 5.  I decided to try it and they love it.  You can even tell by the smell when you open the bag that this is a kibble made of quality products.  It will take time to see how their coats react to the new food, but so far the fact that they are both eating it with gusto is proof enough for me!!!

review/text: I have been feeding my German Shepherd Orijen since he was a pup (started on the LBP forumla). I love this food. He doesn't have to eat as much to maintain his weight...meaning less poop! His poop doesn't smell that bad and it is firm and good color. He LOVES this food too. Has a healthy coat and plenty of energy. No sign of anything lacking in his diet and no worries from me that it isn't safe to feed him. If you can't feed raw this is the next best thing.

review/summary: Incredible ingredients but pricey.
review/text: The first time I read the ingredient list for this food I said: "Son of a... I WOULD EAT THIS!" No joke, there isn't a single ingredient name you won't recognize and there are no artificial preservatives. I have yet to meet a dog owner (in person!) who hasn't told me their dog eats this stuff like it's crack-cocaine!<br /><br />As it is a little pricey (despite the fact that you actually have to feed your dog LESS food than any other brand with a high grain content (which is used as a filler)) I do a half-and-half mix of Orijen with another incredible dry dog food called "Taste of the Wild".<br /><br />All I can say is that my Siberian Husky LOVES this food so much that when she's done she just sits there looking at me for a minute before letting out a very satisfying belch. Finally, I can also say, and this is only anecdotal, but after I switched to this food (I was formerly feeding her Eukanuba) my dog's shedding decreased significantly.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand to anyone with a medium to large breed dog that has a high-energy level.

review/text: I found Orijen by reading online veterinary recommendations for the best dog foods -- dry and canned. Several reviewers put Orijen at the top of their lists, and it was almost always included in the top five. My dogs have been very healthy on this food -- and they like it. On the rare occasion when I had to switch to another dry food (another highly rated brand) because Orijen had not arrived in the mail, I noticed stomach upset and less enthusiasm about the food. In this household, at least, Orijen is the only dry food in the dog bowl.

review/text: This is the second bag of Orijen grain-free adult dry dog food I have purchased. The first was gobbled up by my little Papillon.The second bag has caused her to have diarrhea,and throw up. I have smelled the food and it does have a sour odor. My daughter who lives in Austin,Texas buys this food for her dog and has had no problem. She buys locally. There is not a store in Amarillo,Texas which carries this brand. Could something have happened in the shipping of this food to me? The vet put her on Carafate and Amoxi which seem to cure the diarrhea. However, she will not touch the dog food now and I have been giving her Prescription Diet i/d (gastrointestinal health). I am puzzled. The date code is good, and the first bag was fine. I would appreciate any feedback you have on this product.

Upon giving more food to gain weight the dog's got even looser stools.  I e-mailed the company about it and never got a reply. Coats were shiny but not good enough for show competition.  Since taking my dogs off this food they have gained weight and coats are coming in to the point I can show them again soon.  I do like the philosphies of this company with regards to ingredients but makes me wonder if no grain at all is such a great thing.

review/text: I am a K9 police officer for a fairly large police department.  One of our local pet stores recently started selling Orijens dog food and told us of its high quality.  It was supposed to be ideal for large active dogs.  Six officers transitioned their K9s to this food.  Five of those six officers have had to take their dogs off of it.  Two dogs nearly died from gastric and liver problems.  These two had to spend days overnight at the vet, one required extensive surgery to save him.  The other three also had gastric problems, but did not require medical attention before they were taken off the food.  All of the dogs experienced problems within a month, or even just a few days after transition to Orijens food.  Only one of the six dogs not experience a problem.  Use caution with this food and monitor your dogs for signs of bloat.  We will never recommend this product.

review/summary: I take it for health reasons but it is quite tasty as well
review/text: I had problems with my gums and had a high C-Reactive Protein reading (10+), a sign of inflamation in the body and not good if you have high cholestorol. I saw a news clip on 5 superfoods and how they could beneift your body. Acai was attributed with lowering body inflamation. I saw a Zola Daily Wellness Shot at a smoothie store and bought it. After two months of a daily shot my CRP fell to 1.5, a low normal reading. My dentist could not believe the change in my gums. Unfotunately, Zola stopped making the shot and I tried other brands of acai berry juice. Horrid taste, akin to fermented prune juice. I found out, however, that Jamba teamed up with Zola and created Jamba-labled shots using Zola Juice. I talked with Zola and the company said it had the same ORAC (3,000) of the Zola Shot and the same 26,000mg of antioxidents. It is not quite as tasty as the Zola shot but it is pretty tasty itself. With the health benefits I get from it, the juice taste is darn good enough. My family has started taking it and I am hearing they are having the same results.

review/text: I'm really happy to see this from Zola.  I've been looking for a concentrated form of their super fruit extracts without the sugar from the juice and this is IT.  However, I've also combined this with other juice to get an extra jolt of nutrients, especially with green drinks.  I don't think the shot cap is necessary but it's nice to have.  Thanks Zola and Jamba.

review/summary: Helps my joints - great convenience with Subscribe and Save
review/text: Jamba Juice's Acai superfruit shots are cheaper than the competitors per ounce.  I also like that they come in 16oz bottles instead of 25 or more oz bottles.  It seems that it's fresher at the bottom of the bottle that way.  I drink 1oz per day. I was initially referred to a competing product with the claim that it helps joint pain. My experience is that it does. This is equivalent replacement for the 2 other concentrated Acai products I've tried, but it's cheaper and possibly tastes a little better. (Full disclosure: I also take glucosamine)<br /><br />Also check your local Jamba Juice for the same product to see if the price here is better. I love the subscribe and save convenience - the price varies a bit, but so far, it comes out a bit cheaper to significantly cheaper here.

review/summary: A dose of health...
review/text: I take a shot of this everyday and have been for 4 months. I can't say medically or scientifically how much it helps w/ anything but I like to make sure I'm receiving enough antioxidants. I'm an active mom of two, who tries to take care of herself and exercises regularly. I feel like this gives me a boost... a little more energy and a little stronger immune system. I can't say for sure but I do seem to feel a little better when I take it regularly. Less fatigue... It tastes like strong blueberry juice.. not bad. So I plan to use it threw the winter and hope that I get sick less often. We shall see...

review/text: Decent price for a booster shot.  I can see it being bitter for some, but I enjoy the taste of things that are healthy.  Tip:  pour the shot into a cup of mineral water and you have a seltzer type drink that is absolutely refreshing.  Can't say that I feel different physically due to this, but I'm a believer in antioxidants and have been drinking green tea since I was a teenager.  Would like to see the price come down.

review/summary: Made in Michigan since 1866
review/text: I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernor's has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernor's has 39 grams sugar in the full size can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernor's has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.

Lo and behold, when I saw the coffee offered with "free" shipping(the coffee price was the same as CBD), an order was made.  My coffee was AWFUL!!!!!!!!  It was old, stale and had no aroma.  When it was ground, there was NO cleanup for my grinder: no coffee oils were present. I threw a $30+,5# bag of Organic/FairTrade in my compost and ordered from NJ.

review/text: Another Coffee Bean Direct product. As I said in other reviews the company itself is awesome. Great customer service and great products. This coffee is no exception, but it (if you'll pardon the pun) isn't my cup of tea. It has chocolate and caramel notes, a smooth finish and no unpleasant after taste. The issue is, it has no body either. I find myself using more than the normal amount just to try and get an extra 'kick' out of it. If you're a person who likes a lighter tasting cup of coffee then this is definitely your coffee. But if you like a more robust brew then give this one a pass (on the 5 pounds worth anyway!)

review/summary: A mild coffee, not for you dark roast lovers.
review/text: I bought this coffee with the basic requisites that it must be Fair Trade, and not too strong, as I prefer a breakfast or house blend for my morning coffee routine.<br /><br />I am basically pleased with this blend, I am enjoying my first cup as I write this review. Although I prefer a light/medium roast, this might be a little too light and mild, even for my tastes.  If you prefer a very light roast, then this would be perfect for you.  It is otherwise smooth and seems like low acidity (my stomach isn't upset by it or anything) which are both great pluses.  Since I prefer my coffee a little darker than this, I will probably just add an extra scoop of coffee to the pot to get it up to my taste preference.<br /><br />I wish Coffee Bean Direct made a darker roasted fair trade coffee, b/c the price sure is right!  Just as an FYI - BJ's Sumatran Fair Trade is very tasty medium/dark roast, and it's actually a little cheaper than Coffee Bean Direct's fair trade.<br /><br />enjoy!

review/summary: Was hoping for more but still satisfied
review/text: First off, I have to say the cost for this amount of fair trade coffee is amazing.  I was buying three pounds previously from a different company for the same price as this 5 pound bag.  I was very excited to get this very large bag of coffee in the mail.  I would not consider my self a full time coffee snob but I am getting close.  The beans that I recieved did not have a strong aroma.  When I ground them, they left no residue and cleaned my grinder of it's past residue.  I had been told that some coffee residue was good in that it meant the beans were fresh.  Even without this education, it appeared these beans were dry.  When I made my first pot of coffee, it was weak despite following the ground recommendations on my grinder, which typically makes it strong.  My next pot I added some more beans and it was better.  The coffee itself has a dull flavor.  There is nothing that stands out about it.  Unfortunately, it takes like a cup of coffee you would get at a decent restaraunt.  I think I will just attempt to get another type of bean from this company and see if it is any better but I still will not discredit this product considering I still got a decent cup of coffee for a very good price.

review/summary: Fruity flavor medium roast
review/text: UPDATE:<br />The reason these beans are dryer and less oily is because these are light to medium roasted beans! Darker roasts are oilier and wetter looking, the darker the roast the oilier (and more burnt tasting) the coffee will be...<br /><br />I like this coffee and have ordered 3 lots already. Anybody who does not like dark roasts should like this coffee.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />----------------<br />The bag I received was a medium roast, though it doesn't specify any particular roast on the package.<br /><br />This coffee (Guatemalan) has a fruity flavor.<br /><br />It's organic as well as fair trade.<br /><br />This brand is a good price for organic coffee.

review/summary: BUY IT :)
review/text: I am so glad I ignored the couple bad reviews and ordered this coffee.  Maybe someone got an old bag or one that got too hot during shipping? (Only explanation I can think of why someone would say there is no flavor)  When it was delivered to my house, the aroma from the beans was so strong that I could smell it through the cardboard box, which is a good sign! I store my beans in the freezer and only take out one serving at a time to grind up to make a pot of coffee in my Bunn, which preserves the oils in the beans and keeps the beans fresh longer.  I am a "coffee shop coffee" lover and am always trying to get that same bold flavor at home, and these beans did the trick! The flavor is amazing, better than anything i've tried in a loooong time, and the price is awesome.  I had been paying 9.99/pound for organic beans before I found this coffee, so this is nearly 3 dollars/pound savings if you subscribe and save. Awesome cup of coffee! :)

review/summary: Great for the price!
review/text: Ok for the price that this is selling at you just cant beat it. I mean one of these bags will easily last you a month and thats if you make it like me and add about a 2 inch layer at the bottom of an 8-cup french press! So i was torn between giving this product a 3 and 4 and here is why. First off the tea is pretty much stem free like it says at least enough to satisfy me, second it has a great flavor even after i have been storing the bags in the freezer for the past 3 months. Anyways some of the cons are: after you open one bag you really need something to store it in until you finish it up because its pretty hard sealing them up after you open it, they have a lot of powder!! almost too much for my taste, but they never said powder free, and i dont mind too much i think it may even contribute to the stronger flavor of this tea. Next if you ever brew in a tea ball, you will have some pieces left in your tea, as there are a lot of fine pieces in this tea and tea balls seem to have a hard time of holding everything in. All in all its a great product! for the health benefits of Yerba Mate you need to drink a lot of tea so this is definitely a good product for that, and it taste pretty good not as high end as some but i would definitely rank it among my top favorite tea brands. That being said, a tip on how to make a mean cup of Yerba, get a french press put about an inch or two layer on the bottom, add in your nearly boiling water, mix, and let set for about 4 minutes then pour in a mug with a spoonful of Honey..its great! and an excellent alternative to coffee. Oh and if you dont have a french press and are thinking about getting one go for the 8-cup thats just enough for about 2 full mugs of whatever your drinking, and they make awesome cups of java too!!

review/summary: Contaminated with aniseed oil.
review/text: If you like soft licorice that contains aniseed oil as a flavouring, you'll love these. The texture is perfect. However, the weird taste that lingers on your palate after you've eaten "black licorice"? Yes, that's not licorice; that's anise.<br /><br />These Pontefract Cakes are advertised elsewhere as being "much stronger in flavor from the previous Pontefract Cakes, which were manufactured by the Haribo company", as though "stronger flavour" is necessarily a good thing. Ha ha. You got it. Anise is the MSG of the licorice world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this was the only brand in stock and available for me to purchase, here in the USA. They are labeled "Gustaf's Licorice. Made in the UK for Gerritt [sic] J. Verburg, Michigan", and I'm pretty sure the same product appears under both brand names (Gerrit Verburg and Gustaf's) as different items on Amazon.<br /><br />They are not so bad that I won't eat them whenever I have a lust for Pontefract Cakes, but the anise flavour is disturbing enough that eating them dampens my ardour for more. In other words, this 2kg bag should easily see me through until the day I can replace it with the real thing, possibly the boring old unenhanced licorice flavoured Pontefract Cakes from Haribo. Assuming they still do make theirs the traditional way, without aniseed.<br /><br />Still, these Pontefract Cakes do get a 3-star rating simply for being better than almost any other form of licorice candy available in the States. As I say, if you are used to anise flavoured "licorice", just ignore my licorice snobbery and give them a try.<br /><br />--<br />Ingredients as listed on the bag I got: Sugar Cane Syrup, Glucose Syrup, Modified Corn Starch, Invert Sugar Syrup, Wheatflour, Liquorice Extract, Potato Starch, Glazing Agent (vegetable Oil, Carnauba Wax), Aniseed Oil. Allergen Information: Contains Wheat and Gluten. May Contain Taces of Sulphites.

review/text: Great little licorice morsels.  I've been on a licorice crave for several years and these cakes are the best i've had. not too sweet, with a fantastic licoice flavor.  I've tried all different kinds and origins of licorice candy and nothing can match Pcakes.  My family and friends agree! They keep very well in the fridge.

review/summary: Soooooo Yummy!!
review/text: I first tried the Fruity Pasta at the Germany Pavillion at Epcot at Disney World.  I was hooked. I walked around all day and ended up eating a whole bag and went back before leaving for another bag. I got home and searched to see if I could get this tasty treat here in the real world.  I was very pleased to see them at Amazon and for a great price for 12 bags.  I think they were about $3.50 a bag at Disney.  Thanks Amazon for offering such a wonderful and yummy product.

review/text: I normally purchase this candy locally and was happy to be able to purchase from Amazon at a discount. Unfortunately, it appears I had a 'funny' batch. The first bag I had was perfect, but the second bag seemed to have been rancid or something. Some pieces from the bag had a very strong chemical taste.

review/summary: BEST. SOUR. CANDIES. EVER.
review/text: I first tasted these in Europe 14 years ago, and I'm still hooked. They're the perfect texture. I don't like gummy candies that are too soft or gelatin-like. In fact, I prefer to buy sour candies that are less "fresh" so they're harder and chewier. These are great fresh out of the bag.<br /><br />The flavours are strawberry, apple and pear. Usually when I eat a bag of mixed candies there's always one that isn't my favourite but I eat it anyway because it's included in the bag. All of these flavours are yummy, and I still (after 12 bags!) can't decide which I like best.<br /><br />Trust me, if you like sour gummy candies PLEASE try these. You won't be disappointed!!!

review/text: These things are amazing. I studied abroad in Spain 3 years ago and I used to buy packs of this candy all the time. Just the other day I randomly remembered this candy and thought to look them up online to see if I could buy them. I ordered this 12-pack from Amazon and I ate all the packs way too quickly. These are really delicious and addiciting! They are marketed as being sour, but I do not find them to be unbearably sour where they start to hurt your teeth and gums. This is a really delicious candy and I would most certainly recommend that others try it! Also, this is a great price for a 12-pack.

review/summary: Low Fat and Few Calories (HEALTHY SNACK); Great Taste
review/text: Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps are a healthy snack and I absolutely love them.  Trying to be health conscious and trying to avoid fats, I was looking for snacks that would satisfy both requirements.  I stumbled on these snacks at two (2) places: Dean's Natural Foods stores and Whole Foods.<br /><br />Be careful that you only select the Glenny's that say Low Fat on the label. Why? This is important if you are trying to cut fat out of your diet as well as calories.  There are no saturated fats nor any trans fats nor any cholesterol in the low fat Glennys.  There is only one gram of fat per serving.  And the calorie count is extremely low (only 70 calories per serving) versus for the regular Glennys over 110 to 120 calories per serving.<br /><br />The taste is great and for those who need a crunchy snack sometime during the day; this is a healthy alternative to potato chips or pop corn.  Two small servings which would only be 140 calories and 0 saturated fat would provide you with 10 grams of soy protein, 25 mg of soy isoflavones, 3 grams of dietary fiber and more soy protein than tofu or soy milk.<br /><br />Cosmopolitan Magazine quotes: "Even better than potato chips. Delicious."<br /><br />Additionally, each serving gives you 4% of your daily calcium requirement and 8% of your iron percent daily value. Each serving would be about 10 chips approximately.  I open the 3 ounce bag and separate the contents into ziplock bags (10 chips apiece) so that I can regulate the calories and the amount of fat in my snacks.<br /><br />What is nice for those who are afraid to buy a 3 ounce bag of anything.  Even if you succumbed to eating the entire 3 ounce bag: all would not be lost.  You would be getting 20 grams of protein, 50 mg or soy isoflavones, 6 grams of dietary fiber and 300 calories total in the whole bag.  The taste is great whether you purchase the low fat apple cinnamon, the white cheddar or the lightly salted, the low fat barbeque...all have a great taste.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this snack..great taste.<br /><br />Sample a bag.  I think you will be a fan after that.<br /><br />There are 1.3 ounce bags (which are being offered on Amazon) which are even better than the 3 ounce (85 gram) bags (for those who are concerned about their will power) that I have been purchasing.  You have the bags already divided into individual snack portions with 24 bags in the pack.  Terrific alternative.  This particular selection is for a six pack of the 3.5 ounce bags which I have been purchasing at my local natural food stores.<br /><br />Note: The White Cheddar is my personal favorite of the lightly salted, barbeque and white cheddar LOW FAT selections.  Although all are crunchy and good tasting.  MAKE SURE TO SELECT THE WHITE CHEDDAR VARIETY THAT STATES LOW FAT ON THE BAG COVER (THIS SELECTION IS 70 CALORIES PER SERVING VERSUS 110!)..GLENNY'S HAS TWO DIFFERENT WHITE CHEDDAR PRODUCT OFFERINGS..ALWAYS CHECK THE CALORIES AND THE PER SERVING NUTRITIONAL VALUES.<br /><br />Bentley/October 2007

review/text: I've been enjoying the Glenny's Lightly Salted chips for several years.  They're great.  They're hard to get in the supermarket, so I buy them by the case from Amazon .  (Sometimes they're hard to get from Amazon, too.)<br /><br />I thought I'd give the Glenny's Sea Salt chips a taste.  Blech.  It has a funky taste.  "Salt is salt," I thought.  I don't know if it's only the taste of the different salt that makes the chip taste funky, or if they make that variety of the chip differently in other ways.<br /><br />I trashed the entire case of the Sea Salt chip, and went back to the Lightly Salted variety.<br /><br />"To each, his own taste."

review/summary: High in protein and tastes great!
review/text: I was so shocked to see that there were 7 grams of protein in serving of these chips that were only 80 calories.  This is really impressive, since most protein bars that pack similar amounts of protein are way more calorie rich and packed with a lot more sugar and fat.  I compared these soy chips with the PowerBar ProteinPlus High Protein Bars and here are the stats if you were to eat 3 servings of these chips (to get comparable protein amounts):<br /><br />Glenny's vs Powerbar:<br />21 g protein vs 23 g protein<br />240 cals vs 290 cals<br />0 g sat fat vs 3.5 g sat fat<br />3 g fiber vs 2 g fiber<br />27 g carbs vs 37 g carbs<br /><br />So the powerbar has 2 more grams of protein, but is 50 more calories and tons more carbs.<br />On top of that the chips taste great and are perfect if you love crunchy, savory, carby stuff but still want to get that protein.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />--Don't worry, I don't work for them, I just did all these calculations because I literally could not believe the protein content in these considering they are also low fat, low carb and low cal as well.  Why doesn't this get any more cred?

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: I have long been an avid fan of Glenny's products.  Unfortunately, the two stores in my hometown that carried Clenny's Soy Crisps stopped carrying them.  That's when I turned to Amazon.com, from whom I ended up ordering from six to twelve bags of nearly each flavor.  They arrived at my door so quickly (in only two or three days, despite the prediction of more than a week) that I was completely astonished.  For people who are on Weight Watchers, they can eat twice as many of these crisps than they can other similar products for the same number of points.  The crisps are a delectable alternative to crackers and chips, and in lieu of croutons, I have crumbled them into salads as well.  I have even melted fat free cheese on them.  They are worth the money and the few days' wait.

review/summary: tasty!
review/text: I looooove these chips. Super tasty. Just got to watch out for how much salt it has, and sometime not every bag gets the same amount of flavor dusting. Seriously though, even with a dud bag or two I like the taste and the protein that I can get from munching!

review/summary: Love em!
review/text: I have tried many brands of soy chips and these are the best I have found. And they are one of the few brands that come in plain ol salted. I don't do the flavored chips. Their customer service on the home site needs major improvement, but Glenny's still makes the best chips.

review/summary: YUMMY!!
review/text: Looking for an easy way to incorporate some soy protein in your (and your kids) diet?  Soy Crisps are a fun and easy way, and delicious.  Don't worry, they don't taste weird.  Even my son (who hates everything) likes these.

review/summary: Not terrible
review/text: I try to be healthier with my snack choices, and this isn't horrible. Could be worse, could be better. If you're a "healthy snack food" person, definitely check this out. If you're like me ... skip a soda and grab those Cheetos. :)

review/summary: THE BEST CRACKERS
review/text: CRUNCHMASTER 4 CHEESE CRACKERS ARE THE BEST!!  I LOVE THE CHEESE FLAVOR, THE LIGHTNESS OF THE CRACKER & THE CRUNCHYNESS.  IT'S BY FAR THE BEST CHEESY CRACKER. NOT TOO SALTY AND THE FLAVOR ADDS TO ANYTHING YOU PUT WITH IT OR JUST EATEN BY ITSELF IT'S GREAT!!
