review/summary: One of the Best Kenya coffees
review/text: I really love Kenya coffee and it's not easy to get at a reasonable price.  I ran across this and decided to risk the price and the quantity.  Now I have it on subscription.  It's excellent coffee.  The flavor is robust and smooth.  I make a pot every morning and enjoy until I run out.  I don't think you can get better Kenya coffee, and the price is phenomenal.  This has turned out to be my favorite coffee.

There are many variations to this product including a string bean with red/green peppers with garlic that is my favorite. An excellent choice anytime and a great value too.

review/summary: A favorite of mine since childhood
review/text: I have always enjoyed chocolate covered cherries, from the cheapo milk chocolate ones up to the high-end gourmet dark chocolate ones. Put a cherry in the middle of some chocolate and some liquidy or gooey stuff and I'm there.<br /><br />These are a classic. I'd put them in the middling range in terms of taste appeal--the chocolate is a bit too sweet and not as chocolatey as perfection would demand. The liquid is a bit too sharp and can make you have a back-of-the-throat reaction.<br /><br />BUT...they are a mouth happy-making candy experience all the same. I'd say a 3.5, but add in the nostalgia factor and they're a 4.5.<br /><br />I remember open air candy displays at newsstands in NYC where you could get three for a quarter. oh, the joy of it. Eating the very top part first, the way your snap the top of a soft boiled egg, and then sucking out the liquid or letting is drip onto your tongue. Then carefully--or messily--getting to the cherry and the rest of the shell.<br /><br />There's a lot to be said for a candy that can combine fruit and chocolate and a fun liquidy experience that makes you feel 10 again.<br /><br />Cellas still make me smile.

They certainly bring back memories as I enjoy them once again.  Love the liquid centers - they're much better than the cream.  Thank you Cellas!

review/text: I bought a pack of 12 each of the Sprout Roasted Turkey meal, the Sprout Creamy Chicken meal, and the Sprout Minestrone.  He likes the minestrone but the other two are a completely different story.  First, they smell absolutely disgusting.  It's like herbaceous cat food.  Worse than cat food... I feed my cats canned food every day and it does not make me want to vomit like this stuff does.  But I thought I'd let my son give it a try... He hates it.  He spits it out and then he tries to scrape off all the ground meat that sticks to his tongue, poor thing.  In contrast, he has loved all of the Happy Baby meals I've given him, as well as my homemade meals.  He is by no means a picky eater.

Even for an adult it would be too much, let alone for a baby's delicate palate. I expected more balanced flavored from Tyler Florence. My baby didn't even want to touch it. It's too bad, because if the seasoning were more subtle, this would have been very tasty--the turkey and mashed vegetables were nice enough.

review/text: Like the other 2 reviewers, my son (13 months) is not picky! I actually call him my "champion", cause he has never refused any food...except this! The smell of garlic was the first thing I noticed when I opened the pouch, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. Yeah, nope! I did get him to eat it, cause like I said, he's a champ...but it took FOREVER!! Then I put him down for a nap, and when I went in to get him, his whole room REEKED of garlic! The garlic was so strong, even his poop smelled like garlic! Thats when I knew we wouldnt be trying that one again!<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because he did eventually eat the entire pouch, and we love all the other recipes...but this one needs some adjustments!

As soon as I open the pouch, I smell this strong garlic smell and it is so strong that I don't even want to smell it again. My daughter is not a picky eater at all and she like all kind of food. But this one she would spit out and refuse to swallow any. I threw away the whole pouch. It is a failing recipe.

They are also much sweeter which means you have to use less syrup to sweeten your snow cone (or whatever it is you are flavoring).

I think the jugs really help keep them fresh. I only opened one pack so far, but they were by far the crunchiest, most crisp nori pieces I'd ever had! You can fold a piece between your hands and it will almost shatter! That's how crisp they are! I hope the rest are just as good. If I get through all 6 and they're still good I will try and update this post. I will be SURE to update this post if they go stale too quickly. Hope this helps.

review/text: I'm somewhat obsessed with coconuts, considering I was born in a tropical island  :-). I discovered this juice while shopping at my local organic supermarket and immediately felt in love wit the texture and taste, which has the consistency of coconut milk. My favorite coconut drinks are Taste Nirvana Coco Aloe and the Lakewood Organic Coconut juice (which is organic and fleshed pressed). I bought a pack of 6 and literally finished it within a week lol.<br /><br />My only complaint is I wish they made them ONLY out of fresh pressed coconuts instead of adding other juices like Pear and Apple. Other than that it doesn't take away the rich coconut flavor. Will buy tons of these if there weren't so expensive too.

However, I was shocked that the unit cost online works out to be more than $7 per bottle.  I'm not sure why the price is so high, but you just lost a customer for this product.

review/summary: Great product, poor packing.
review/text: I've tried this product before and like it very much. It's one of the only stocks/broths without tomatoes/tomato paste, which I find makes the broth richer tasting. In the past, I've ordered this product and received it well packed with groups of three boxes wrapped in bubble wrap. On my most recent order, I purchased two cases, 12 boxes.  The 12 boxes were wrapped in one plastic bag and put into an oversize box - no bubble wrap. Two of the boxes ruptured, soaking the plastic bag and ruining the integrity of two other cartons. I ended up with 8, a little over half the order, and a big mess. It's not possible to file a damage report online because this is a non-returnable item.<br /><br />Not sure if I would order this product again, just because of the packing and the damage policy.

review/summary: Tea almost as it tastes in Japan
review/text: I really love this tea. It is my every morning tea. It has the very green (fresh)taste of the tea served in Japan that is distinctive of Japanese tea alone. For this reason it is not necessarily for those who prefer the taste of Chinese green tea, and there is a big difference between the two, because its flavor is definitely characteristic of Japanese green tea. The color is beautiful - almost as green as the twice as expensive Gyokuro variety. I have reordered this tea many times and expect to keep ordering it as long as the price remains close to its present price.

review/summary: Fresh, distinctive flavorful taste.
review/text: This Japanese Sencha Green Tea seems to be of good quality, with a very fresh look, texture, color and smell. The flavor is very different than what consumers of even high quality bagged Sencha teas may be use to. It has a somewhat "grassy" taste and almost seaweed like aroma once  brewed. I enjoy it a lot, as do other members of the family who are normally less adventurous in their tea drinking choices. However, I can definitely see how some people who enjoy other green teas may not like this distinctive flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint, which will have me sampling other loose leaf Japanese Sencha Teas to draw a comparison, is that the leaves are much more finely chopped than I am used to in a loose leaf tea with a fair amount of "tea dust". If you brew with a stainless steel strainer, you may find more tea particulate passing through the strainer and a slightly more difficult clean up of the strainer afterwards than with other loose leaf teas.

review/summary: Great food for a picky eater or those with digestive issues!
review/text: Our Himalayan cat is an extremely picky eater.  To add to this she has intestinal trouble with many foods (diarrhea, vomiting).  We only feed her quality foods with no grains or fillers, and this narrows our selection down quite a bit, knocking out most grocery store brands.<br /><br />We initially tried Wellness and apparently it was too rich for her with all the additional unnecessary ingredients (squash, zucchini etc?)  Then we tried the Natural Balance DUCK and pea, and she hated the taste and texture, which was extremely mushy.  We then put her on this Venison flavor, and she absolutely loves it and the more meaty texture.  She is enthusiastic every time she eats.  She loves the dry as well.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this food to anyone, especially those who have a cat with a sensitive digestive system.  Not only is it a healthy grain free, artificial/dye free food, but it is also a limited ingredient food, meaning pets with food allergies or bowel problems are more likely to tolerate it.  And it's very reasonably priced!

review/text: I have fed my 4 cats Natural Balance Venison & Green Peas 6 oz. wet food for abt. 2 years or so.  They are all abt. 9 years old. I split one can 4 ways in am and pm.  I started because one cat seemed to be allergic to chicken by-products.  She licked her stomach raw.  The vet recommended food like duck or venison. When I started feeding them the Venison she stopped licking as much.  Her stomach hair grew back.  They all seem to like it.  I give them a duck dry food to supplement.  They have no health problems.  I think higher quality food helps prevent illness and they have glossy coats.  I would recommend it.

review/summary: Bad smell / good taste!
review/text: I got this food for my cat because he was throwing up, and at the time we thought it was the food he was eating. He stopped doing that for quite a while before this arrived, so apparently it wasn't the food. We decided to see how he felt about this food, as we had already bought it and sure didn't want to waste the money on it.<br />A lot of people here say their cat loves this food (this flavor at least, I can't speak for others. I really wish they had a variety pack..). At first my cat seemed to hate it. He wouldn't go near it, and after giving him no alternative, he would begin to paw at it. I was dismayed, because as I said, we paid for this already (and it's not expensive, but it's certainly not the cheapest..) and didn't want it to go to waste. So, we started experimenting. When some was put on his nose, he licked it, and seemed to like it, but when going for more, he was again repulsed. He seemed very confused by this. It turns out he can't stand the smell of the stuff, but likes the flavor. We started mixing it with one of his old foods, and he was quite happy with this. Eventually after a week or so, I decided to give it to him without the mix, and he ate it with no complaints. I guess he just got used to it! So, I mainly wrote this review because I saw (in some other reviews for this brand of food) that people say their cats hate it. Don't throw it out yet, it could just be the smell!<br />I don't like giving this amount of stars, because it really seems like a quality product. But I can't very well give it a glowing review if it didn't meet the needs for which it was purchased!

review/summary: Great for cat with allergies
review/text: My cat suffered from such severe food allergies that the process of finding a food that he could safely eat nearly killed him. Natural Balance Venison Green Pea formula is the only food he can safely eat. Within two weeks of switching to Natural Balance my cat regained 2 of the pounds he'd lost while he was sick and his facial sores started to clear up. The best part is that he loves the taste. He'd probably eat six cans a day if we let him. I just wish Natural Balance would offer a dry version of the Green Pea and Venison formula.

I went through the cans and found that ALL the Venison & Green Pea Formula flavor cans were not properly sealed. I returned them to the store, whereby I discovered more Venison & Green Pea cans bulging on the store shelf. I made the clerk aware of the cans so they could be removed.<br /><br />Note: When our cat first got sick, I checked the Natural Balance "Buy with Confidence" Database, but it showed no toxins or contaminates tested positive. I have notified the Natural Balance directly and their in-store representative, however, as of time of this review, they have only posted a voluntary recall for their Dog Food Products, NOT Cat Food.

review/text: I've ordered this food off of Amazon a few times as it's considerably cheaper here than in my local pet supply store and it's one of the few things that my poor little rescue guy can eat. If you've got a cat w/special dietary needs I cannot recommend this food enough.<br /><br />I will say however that I've been very unimpressed with the shipping. On my first order the box arrived pretty beat up but the food was in tact. This last go round I've had to throw away more than half the cans b/c they were burst, open, or leaking. The shipper should take much more care with how food like this is shipped. From now on I'll be spending the extra money to buy this at the pet shop - it may be cheaper online but having to throw away that much food is a tremendous waste.

review/summary: limited ingredient canned cat food
review/text: Upon the recommendation of my vet that I use limited ingredient food for my cats, I started out by using dry duck and green pea cat food. Then I decided to feed one can a day of vension and green pea canned cat food (for 4 cats). They love it. They wait for it at 10am every morning.<br />However I could not use it as their only food source due to cost. The can recommended one 6oz can per day per every 8 pounds of cat. Holy Cat Food! That would cost outrageously. They are lucky to get what they get.

review/summary: skin allergy relief
review/text: Our little guy had a terrible problem with skin allergies.  The first visit to the vet ended in a diagnosis of a possible flea allergy and a steroid shot.  The shot cleared him up, but it returned about a month later.  I didn't think it was a flea allergy because he didn't have any fleas, but the vet said all it takes is one flea bite, and so we started there.<br /><br />When it came back I decided not to pay the vet for a process of elimination that we could do on our own.  So I did some reading and found out that another common cause of skin allergies, other than fleas, is grain.  So I ordered a case of the canned venison and green pea and a bag of the dry duck and green pea, both by Natural Balance.<br /><br />The skin condition cleared up beautifully.  That was about a year ago, and our little Tommy has, hopefully, gotten over his allergy because he has had some food containing grain lately with no ill effects.<br /><br />This saved us a lot of money in vet bills.  The cats love the flavor too.

review/summary: Grain-free, reasonably priced and cats love it
review/text: I was initially put off by the texture of this food since it is a lot more "meaty" than the cat food pates I'd bought before, but I now think it's actually easier and more natural for cats to eat their food as chunks rather than mush. In any case, all 3 of my cats really seem to like this food and even the picky one will usually clean her bowl, which she rarely ever did with her old food.  All in all this is the best deal for premium grain-free that I've found.

review/summary: Great food, my cat loves it!
review/text: As a preface, my cat is almost 12 years old. He was diagnosed with diabetes 2 years ago but after one year I changed his diet from both wet and hard food to just wet food, he lost a couple lbs(from 17 to 15) and subsequently went into remission. At the time I had put him on Wellness cat food. He had no problems giving up the dry food and was never really picky about the wet food I gave him.<br /><br />Starting several months ago my cat started throwing up a lot more often, sometimes twice a day. I thought it was new plants that I had gotten in the house as he loved chewing on them. I home glucose test him and his numbers were just a bit higher at the time so I brought him in to the vet to check on him. They did a blood sample and checked his organs. The vet said his organs were fine and his stomach wasn't blocked and that his numbers weren't significantly high enough to put him back on insulin. They did suggest I change the food of his diet though as he might have become allergic or "sensitive" to the wet food I was giving him. They suggested a higher protein diet of venison or rabbit. Of course, they offered their "Vet Only" brands for an absurd amount of money. Then I went on Amazon and did a search for these type of foods and came across this brand.<br /><br />I ordered up a case to try seeing as this cost pretty much exactly the same as I have been paying for the Wellness brand at the local store. Upon opening the first can I inspected the consistency and smell of this new food. First thing I liked was how loose the food was. I normally have to chop up my cats food because he is more of a licker than a biter when eating. This seemed like it would be easier for him to get down. When it came to the smell, I thought it actually smelled good. I read a lot of reviews where people said it smelled terrible or offensive. I have a very sensitive nose and can get turned off by smelly things very quickly. This wasnt bad at all and if anything, smelled better than the Wellness formula I had been feeding him.<br /><br />My cat inspected the first plate of food but then dove right in. My cat is a grazer so I normally leave a can out for him and he would finish it over the course of about 24 hours. The first can was gone in 6 hours. I put out another can and that can was gone in 10 hours. I now have him(or he has me) on a schedule of a fresh can every 12 hours. So yes, he goes through the food a lot faster than his old food and this is costing me now twice of what it was before but Im glad he is eating as much as he is. The unfortunately part now is that he will wake me up at any point during the night to tell me he is out of food. Since starting him on this new diet I have not had one full nights sleep. I suppose thats a different dilemma however.<br /><br />My cat is now throwing up a lot less but does still throw up. I am seeing more hairballs though as the reason for throwing up. I do brush him down as much as I can but he seems to throw up soon after the brushing as he tends to groom himself a lot more now as well. He seems a lot happier with this food and processes it a lot quicker too. In the morning when I clean out the litter box every day it seems like I have two cats in the house, there is that much more pee and poo.<br /><br />Either way, I definitely recommend this food to anyone with a cat who has been throwing up or is sensitive to other foods.

review/summary: Great for IBD cats
review/text: My cat has allergies to chicken and pork, which are in most mainstream cat foods but this limited ingredient formula is working well for her so far. She used to get a steroid every day to help her tolerate her old food--with this stuff we've got the dose pushed out to once every three days and I'm hoping we'll be able to discontinue the meds altogether (per advice of my vet, of course). We were on rabbit-based food for a while but switched to canned for urinary health and this venison variety is pretty easy to find.<br /><br />You do need to adjust the feeding guidelines to match your cat/your vet's recommendations though. My 12 lb kitty seems content with half a can twice a day, which is the recommended amount for 8 lb cats--in fact, I may need to cut her back a little. I'm sure it makes a difference as to whether they're inside or out. My guys are in and just don't seem to need as much food to maintain weight.

Natural Balance canned food has improved her weight,her coat is smooth and shiny, and her overall health is much better. If your cat needs a limited ingredient diet I would highly recommend trying Natural Balance. Prescription food is always an option, but Natural Balance is readily available and comparably priced.

review/summary: Great for cats with recurring UTI issues
review/text: I've been buying this cat food for my cat for over a year, due to his UTI issues. He generally would get a UTI once a year, costing us hundreds of dollars in vet bills. We tried a lot of stuff, but the only things that seemed to help were the expensive "prescription only" scam foods. After a lot of research, I decided to try the Natural Balance L.I.D. foods.<br /><br />The cat has not had a recurrence of UTI over the past year. I am sure this makes him more happy than I.<br /><br />I can't say much about the flavor or texture, but I didn't try it and the cat is a garbage disposal. He will eat anything (seriously. he steals loaves of bread off the counter. he eats vegetables...)<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with the quality of the product and the results. I just wish they made a flavor my picky cat liked.

review/text: Typically, when I think of drinks that give you energy, I think of a bitter taste and a little energy. Energy isn't all you need to keep up with studying. This drink, I've found, has actually helped me focus in class. I've tried red bull, monster, and Amp to pay attention in class. They don't work. They keep me awake, but the focus is completely gone.<br /><br />With NERD, I've had just enough energy to keep me awake and find myself more able to focus in my law school courses, also allowing me to retain more information. This is extremely important in my situation where I am in law school - one final exam is our entire grade...<br /><br />Anyways, I've been drinking NERD since 2007 or 2008 when I was at UTSA, where the creator of NERD created NERD. I continue to order online while I go to school in Boston at one of the top schools in the country.<br /><br />Disclosure: I do not work for NERD, nor do I know the creator or any of the employees of NERD.

But NERD on the other hand is an energy drink with a purpose... and it works! the supplements in this drink are proven nootropics that really can give you an edge whether it be at work school or play. not only that but it tastes fantastic!<br /><br />It is no wonder that the popularity of NERD has spread to college campuses around the nation,<br />unfortunately NERD is not widely available, especially off campus. even still this is a great price for a great product on amazon and definitely worth a try.

review/summary: A fine, but expensive, alternative sweetener without any bitter aftertaste
review/text: PROS:<br />One of the best and most pleasant tasting sugar substitutes<br />No bitter aftertaste<br />Similar consistency to sugar<br /><br />CONS:<br />Expensive compared to sugar and other sugar substitutes<br />Ounce for ounce, not as sweet as sugar<br />Might not be a perfect substitute for sugar in all baking applications<br />Cools down your hot beverages when it goes into solution/Cool aftertaste<br /><br />Swerve sweetener is a good, zero calorie substitute for sugar.  It is a reasonable alternative to sugar for use in coffee, tea, and even for some baking purposes.<br /><br />Swerve's main ingredient is erythritol but also has a proprietary blend of 'oligosaccharides and natural flavors.'  Erythritol is a sugar alcohol (or polyol) very similar to xylitol, another polyol that is often used to sweeten sugarless gum and other candies.  The company makes a big deal out of the fact that erythritol can occur naturally in some fruits and fermented foods, mass production of erythritol apparently involves the fermentation of natural sugars found in corn.<br /><br />Interestingly, I found that although erythritol is touted as a 'zero calorie' sweetener, it actually has 0.2 calories per gram.  This isn't quite zero, but is far less than the 3.8 calories per gram found in regular table sugar.<br /><br />Like the sugar alcohols xylitol and inulin, erythritol has a sweet flavor that closely resembles table sugar (sucrose), without the bitter aftertaste found in other sugar substitutes such as saccharin, sucralose (Splenda), and aspartame (NutraSweet). Unlike xylitol and inulin, however, erythritol is more digestible/absorbable, and hence does not cause as much GI upset/bloating.  Sadly, erythritol is only 70% as sweet as table sugar, so you need about twice as much product to get the same level of sweetness.  This is why erythritol is often used as a vehicle to bulk up other sweeteners, such as Stevia.<br /><br />As to baking, erythritol is not a perfect substitute for sucrose.  It has different hygroscopic (moisture absorbing) properties than sugar and apparently tends to crystallize more than regular sugar, depending on the application.<br /><br />True to its roots, Swerve has a pleasant, sweet flavor that is very reminiscent of sugar.  In spite of the hype on their website that Swerve--unlike other erythritol formulations from other companies--can replace sugar on a 1:1 basis, I found that Swerve was generally less sweet than sugar.  This did, however, depend on the application.<br /><br />In a side-by-side test, at room temperature, Swerve compared fairly to table sugar.  It was a little less sweet, but not by much.  Oddly, it seemed to initially tickle the sweet receptors on my tongue on first taste, but the sweetness quickly died down. Sugar's sweet taste seemed to linger longer.  Still, Swerve was devoid of any bitter aftertaste found in common artificial sweeteners and in Stevia.  However, I found that when I put Swerve in hot coffee, it took almost two teaspoons of the stuff to equal the sweetness of one teaspoon sugar.  Interestingly, when used to make brownies, I used 30% more Swerve than I would use sugar for the recipe and when they were done the brownies were sweeter than usual.  I wonder if temperature affects the sweet taste of the erythritol.  I can't seem to find any evidence for this, but it seems true for my taste buds.<br /><br />Some people have commented on experiencing a 'cool' after sensation on the mouth and tongue after tasting erythritol.  This is best described as the kind of cool sensation you get after tasting mint, but without the minty taste.  I did experience this a little with Swerve, but it wasn't bothersome or overwhelming. Interestingly, erythritol does absorb heat when it goes into solution, so it will make your coffee a tiny bit cooler after mixing it in.<br /><br />NOTE 1/31/2012:  I used powdered erythritol to make a butter cream frosting.  The consistency wasn't as thick and robust as it is with sugar, but it was fine.  However, the cooling effect was wild here.  Not necessarily unpleasant, but a little strange. Interestingly, by adding cocoa powder to the mix, the cooling effect was blunted a bit.  I will have to experiment with combinations of this sweetener with other ingredients to see if the cooling effect can be tamed or blunted.<br /><br />Another downside of erythritol is its price.  At current market rates 16 ounces (2 cups) costs twice as much as 16 ounces of boxed Domino sugar on Amazon.  In reality, if you buy a 5 pound bag of sugar at your local supermarket you can probably cut that down to about a dollar a pound, which makes Swerve about 14 times the price of table sugar at current rates.  Pretty expensive.<br /><br />On the whole this is one of the better sugar substitutes out there.  It is a nice compromise between the strange aftertastes of artificial sweeteners and the GI side effects of other sugar alcohols.  Although not quite as sweet as sucrose, it is a fine alternative.
