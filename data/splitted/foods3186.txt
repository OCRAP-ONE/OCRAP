review/summary: Better than the Original?
review/text: Truthfully, who can remember what the original M&M/Mars Marathon Bars tasted like--other than the universally accepted, "They were just amazing!"  They were.  Here in my native Southern California, they were also 15 inches long, not merely 8 inches as was sold throughout the rest of the United States.<br /><br />Today, while M&M/Mars continues to ignore requests from their customers to bring the Marathon bar back to market--it's probably just as well, as they would undoubtedly replace sugar with revolting and dangerous high fructose corn syrup--Cadbury in the UK continues to manufacture the original Curly Wurly bars, which are at least as good as the original American candy. Deliciously, the Curly Wurly doesn't taste like so much of the rest of Cadbury's chocolate.<br /><br />Additionally, considering that American candy bars are close to $1.00/ea in local stores now, this is one of the best bargains in candy today.<br /><br />So yummy!

review/text: My Lab  has been eating this food for over 8 years.  Before finding this product, her skin allergies caused lifeless fur and hot spots that turned into mange.  Her coat is shiny and soft and she hasn't had a hot spot since I changed to Royal Canin.  Roxy, now 10, is not overweight, has no arthritis symptoms or any other health issues.  I attribute her good health to her diet.  Knowing  this food is specially formulated for Labs and any health issues they have is PRICELESS.

review/summary: If you have a LAB - Get it NOW !
review/text: I adopted a 3yr old choclate lab 4 months back. She has been a sweetheart but has had her share of problems with food. The first 2 weeks of getting her, she hardly ate & I wasnt too worried considering it was a new enviornment & all. The 2 weeks became 6 & now I was going crazy. I knew her previous owners fed her BENEFUL & my vet along with the entire dog loving world absolutely frown upon that food brand. After trying CANIDAE, INNOVA & BLUE, she ate a little bit of BLUE but I had to hand feed her that if not stuff it in her mouth. After speaking to my vet again & asking for her recommendation, she suggested Royal Canin & off I was doing the research. From AMAZON's site to PETCO's site - there have been nothing but great reviews. I purchased a bag, put it in her bowl & just like that - she eats it within a few minutes of putting it in her bowl, she has learnt to chew & not swallow due to the kibbel size, this works well as a training tool as well with her. Instantly my food worries were gone. Almost 1 bag later & about to order my 2nd bag now, I have seen a lot of good changes in her. Most importantly her energy level has gone up. Initially when we played fetch, she would run a couple of time & then stop & call it a day. Now she will run up & down a parking lot 10 odd time before she is completely tired & give up. She is shedding a lot less. Dont know where to attribute this little miracle but its true. I am extremely pleased. All I know is I have a normal & healthy dog due to this food. If you have a LAB, get this NOW.

review/summary: Chocolate lab loves this food!
review/text: Our 75 pound chocolate lab eats a lot of food - and this food is her favorite!  We started ordering on Amazon because none of our local stores carry this and it wasn't worth the gas to drive a couple hours to pick it up.  The dog gets excited when the box is delivered because she knows this food is in it!  She loves this food!  The size and the hole in the middle of the food make it so that the dog has to slow down a bit to chew it.  Our dog was never one to just inhale her food, but it does seem to make her eat slower.

review/summary: He finally stopped scratching...
review/text: I have a 5 year old lab mix who has always had trouble with excessive scratching, self-chewing, and shedding during the wintertime.  We tried all the special oils in his foods, had multiple vets check him out, and no one had the answer.  Finally, about a year ago, it started happening in the summer too, so we decided to do an elimination diet to see if he was allergic to anything.  We would give him 2-3 weeks on a limited ingredient food and watch for improvement, and if there wasn't improvement, we moved on to the next one. Royal Canin was the last one we tried because well, it was the one that finally worked! He still scratches and sheds some, but no more than an ordinary dog.  The obsessive chewing has stopped.  He has been on Royal Canin for 7 or 8 months now and we've been very pleased.<br /><br />I also love that the kibbles are large and hollow, forcing him to bite into it and chew rather than just guzzling down food- I am sure this helps his teeth and digestive system, now that he is forced to actually chew his food! It is on the high end price wise, but compared to the money I spend on food for my 2-legged children, it is nothing. One bag lasts him just under a month (he is about 80lbs), and with free shipping through prime, it is cheaper than driving to a pet store to buy it there.  Will be re-ordering every month!

review/summary: It is worth every Penny (but please don't raise the price)
review/text: I have two labradors, a black labrador female approximately 10 years old and one of her pups, a male yellow lab age 6.  I switced to Royal Canin when Shack the yellow pup and his litter mates were old enough to eat Royal Canin lab puppy food.  The coats of these puppies were softer than normal and I equate it to the puppy chow.  I fed Shack RC puppy chow until he was 15 months old.  Up to that point I fed Caddy (his mom) beneful which was the only dog food she would eat.  If I tried other brands she just wouldn't eat it and she would simply take off on her own and go hunting for something in nature.  I got tired of chasing her down, paying my neighbor for chickens she ate and throwing away dog food so, I stayed with Beneful even though she was gaining weight. She liked Beneful well enough, but she was never satisfied after eating it. When I converted Shack from RC puppy to adult Royal Canin I didn't want to be buying two brands of dog food so we switched Caddy over to Royal Canin. She loved it right away.  I noticed she was satisfied and full after eating it. I also weaned her back from 4 cups to 2 cups per day and she even remained satisfied at the lesser amounts.  Six plus years later she has trimmed down nicely and naturally and is very fit  at 9/10 years of age. She is very active and plays regularly with Shack.  She has slowed a bit, but what she lacks for in speed she makes up for in smarts.  Shack at age six is like a young pup and is a total hard body in very excellent shape.  I am still feeding him 4 cups per day but as he ages I will begin to consider weaning him back a bit to control his weight but I don't think that will be for awhile yet.  Every person who runs their hands through Caddy's coat are just totally amazed at the thickness and the softness and the shine of her coat.  Shack's coat is just as it was when he was a puppy, shiney and soft.  If you have a labrador and you can afford this food, your dog will love you even more for making the switch !!!  Caddy & Shack love Royal Canin for Labs!  My sister has been feeding her cocker spanial the breed specific royal canin and she has lost weight and her skin alergies have started to go away after just a couple of months.

TWO DAY SHIPPING HAS BEEN DROPPED AND FREE STANDARD (SUPER SAVER) SHIPPING WHICH TAKES ABOUT A WEEK IS HOW IT IS BEING SHIPPED DUE TO ITS WEIGHT.  IT STILL HAS A PRIME LOGO ON IT SO BE CAREFUL AND PLAN YOUR ORDERS AHEAD OF TIME.  I LEARNED OF THIS THE HARD WAY AND HAD TO PICK UP AN EXTRA BAG AT ALMOST $10 MORE WHILE WAITING FOR MY SHIPMENT.  NOT THE END OF THE WORLD, JUST AN FYI :)<br /><br />I've been feeding this to my oldest lab for 6 years and the youngest for almost 2 (puppy formula 1st year for both).  They are both so healthy, perfect weight, shiny coats, clear eyes and good joints.  My vet had recommended it so we did the research and found that because pet food is not regulated like our food (no pet FDA) a lot of companies can word things to sound like their food is good for your pet, not full of fillers and is nutritional. But listen carefully to those ads and how and what they tell you.  Read the labels and research, even if you don't go with this brand.  I have found this product to be great for my dogs and I am happy with what it is.  They both get a scoop in the morning and night.  They both weigh about 70 pounds.<br />It's also cheaper for me to buy it here than the store and I do not mind having it delivered to my door at all :)

review/summary: My Dogs' Only Brand
review/text: I have 2 very picky female lab/pit mixed breed dogs that only get the best.  This diet has been, by FAR, the most advantageous for them out of the many I've tried.  One of my girls has a highly sensitive stomach.  Where dog food comes in, that is a huge thing to consider.  The mixture that Royal Canin uses for this variety is perfectly tailored to their needs.  My "sensitive" girl had problems with her stool being extremely loose constantly, not to mention her having to go quite a bit more often than is normal.  This was the case with countless brands - some of the more notable being Science Diet, Blue Buffalo, and Nutro.  After switching my girls to this and allowing time for the adjustment, she no-longer has any problems at all.  She has been on this product now for 3 months - her stool is small and compact, much less frequent (because the food is a more desirable blend of ingredients that her system can digest), and her coat is now shiny and soft.  I can't say enough how worthwhile it is spending the money for this brand of food.  I will never go back.

What I love about this from Amazon is that it is cheaper than Petsmart and Petco by about $10.00, plus I get free shipping.  This has got to be the single best "bang for you buck" item on Amazon and I hope they never discontiue this product with Prime (free standard shipping).  The only thing that would make this better would be to have on the Subsribe and Save program.  I know with freight cost these days Amazom probably wouldn't reduce the cost while on the subscribe and save but who cares, at least I won't ever have to make that "Oh no, we're almost out of food and I forgot to reorder from Amazon" trip to the store to get food.<br />So Amazon....if you're reading this, please keep this item around forever, keep the cost as is......and contiue the free standard Prime Shipping!

review/text: This is some of the tastiest stuff you will ever eat, and it can be used so many different ways. It works great in standard mustard applications such as hot dogs and hamburgers, is awesome as a dip with Doritos and other types of chips, pretzels, bread...you name it. Also, and I am no good at cooking, but I have tasted food in which this is used as an ingredient and it creates a taste like no other. Try it... you will become addicted!!

review/summary: Excellent- No Odor!!
review/text: Coconut oil has wonderful moisturizing properties.  This particular brand is my favourite because it has no odor; I can't stand stinky lotions and oils.  I use it only for topical application but it is edible too (saturated fat alert!).  It is great as a pre-wash hair conditioner, and just add some turbinado sugar to make a sugar scrub/moisturizer in the shower- winter dryness will be gone! It's a little pricey though- Still love it

review/summary: Adulterated, not 100% pure as they claim
review/text: This KTC company is a fraud. I bought this same product in Canada in a local indian store. the first time it was okay and so bought it another time and was so disappointed because it's not coconut oil. I have used other brands in the past and this one has absolutely no smell of coconut oil. Another thing is even in slightly low temperatures, it stayed liquid whereas coconut oil would actually be solid at that temperature. I did notice a deposit on the bottom that was white so just a little bit of coconut oil and the rest is some other oil. I could get the smell of vegetable oil. Coconut oil has a beautiful aroma, but this one none.<br /><br />That said I have used parachute since childhood and never been disappointed but since this was cheaper I decided to give it a try and hugely disappointed.

review/summary: COCONUT OIL
review/text: I bought this product after reading all the great health benefits coconut oil offered. I am glad i read it because it provided me with some help with advice on things I can use this oil for. When I got the oil I noticed that it did not smell like coconut, and everything I read stated that the oil should smell like coconut. Now the oil did help to soften my skin and moisturize the places that were really dry, but I just wondered about it since it had absolutely no scent what-so-ever. Also I found that Walmart sales coconut oil that smells like coconut oil and works just as well. So from here on out especially since it is cheaper - it is walmart for me.

review/text: The Grainless Baker has some amazing products and their Cheddar Snackers are another successful product in my opinion. The crackers are buttery, flaky and crunch and remind me of non- gluten free crackers. The only downside to these crackers are the price (I paid around $8 for a box) and they are very high in calories (17 crackers for 150 calories, yikes). If you are looking for a savory gluten free snack, Cheddar Snackers are a great option.

review/summary: BPA Free Cans
review/text: BPA free can a BIG plus if you eat/store canned foods. Rice has good texture, beans firm. Overall this version of Eden Organic Rice and Beans is VERY bland. Some doctoring with preferred herbs/spices is needed. I much prefer the Mexican version for "out of the can" good taste. Free shipping brings the price about in line with what I would pay locally. Good product.

review/text: I bought this through Amazon, and am tasting it for the first time.  Service through Amazon was fabulous.  But the taste of this canned food leaves much to be desired -- it is very bland and mushy.  I had to add lots of my own spices just to make it taste alright.  It's relatively healthy though, and the can doesn't have BPA which gets it the additional star.  I'll try some of the other Eden brands, hoping they are better tasting. But if you are looking for a quick relatively healthy meal, and have your own spices to add, then this can be a good pick.

review/text: It is kind of spicy, which is nice, because otherwise it would be very bland.  I got the Eden black beans as well, and they are a lot worse without the Caribbean Rice.  Of course, the best feature of these products is the bean cans do not have BPA toxicity, as well as no toxic ingredients or sweeteners.  No salt even!  If you want the rawest, natural, bare beans and rice.  Here it is.  Hopefully you can season and flavor foods if there's not enough oomph in them, or you know someone that can.

review/summary: Wholesome product, taste not too great.
review/text: I bought these Eden Organic Carribean Rice and Beans, because they come in BPA free cans. First of all, I would like to thank the company for producing a quality product in a safe container. It is honestly hard to find BPA free cans, even in these "organic focused" days. Now for the taste, I am not picky about food, but ... these were just O.K. The flavoring was not up my alley. I was expecting something a little more spicy. This rice and beans had a very mild seasoning. Once I added spices to these the taste improved greatly. However, if you like the more mild seasonings this might be perfect for you. I know you can't expect too much from canned food. I give this three stars for safe packaging, and decent texture/taste.

review/text: I bought this for quick organic rice & bean dishes or things like burritos. There is a strong cumin taste and it is spicy right out of the can, so you should taste it before adding anymore spices. I found I liked it better toned down by adding more cooked rice or a lot of cheese or sour cream on burritos. We have all had beans from a can, but I wondered what canned rice would be like and it's pretty good, but not five star good.

review/text: When I first got this I was disapointed that it it had so much rice.  I know it says Rice and Beans but I was hoping for more beans.  But it has really grown on me and I'm about to order another case.  I love it as a base for tostadas, better than beans alone and the slighly spicy flavor adds alot (I put cheese, salsa, fresh tomato and lettuce and sometime meat on my tostadas).  I use about a can week and it is a nice product to have for emergencies, you could, if you have to, eat it straight from the can and it would taste better and be more filling than a lot of emergency foods.  Beans and rice form a complete protien which makes for a hunger statisfing meal.

review/summary: Good Edibles!
review/text: First time ever that I buy beans and rice, fully prepared, in a can. After reading the glowing reviews for Eden Foods we purchased Eden Organic Rice & Beans, Caribbean Black Bean, Lundberg Brown Rice, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12), among two other Eden Organic choices for a total of 36. The first time we tasted this one product I added a little virgin olive oil to a pan and used two cans. They were not kidding when they said low salt. I will admit that on my portion I did play a little with herbs and even salt and pepper. Just a little. But in the end it went to the plate accompanied with a tasty broiled garlic chicken and the results are in: A Winner, Good Edibles. Brown rice, which is basically the only kind of rice I can attempt to eat these days and the black beans. Uh Wee Loui!, I could have eaten an extra can but since I am attempting to set a good example on moderation at the dinner table and have also eyes on me checking for any sign of faltering or deceive (harsh critics all around me!) I realized I was and everyone around me too, content with dinner. Can't wait to dive in the garbanzos and green lentil, probably tonight, but one can tell the reviewers were on the money. Why not 5 Stars? I guess I do not want to honk the horn too loud until I try them for all they are worth! For now 4 Stars but very promising stars!<br />PS Now is 11-4-09 and I feel I must update this review. Healthy but not tasty! Certainly not a 4 Star (believe it or not I do care for my fellow Amazonian consumers and reviewers) so here is my latest take on the same product after having had to eat it (will not throw food away) for quite some time. Here it goes:<br />From what I gathered from the nutrition label this is a healthy form of food. From what I gather every time I eat one of the 12 cans of Rice & Caribbean Black Beans, Organic 15 oz Can I regret every byte of it. Some type of condiments, perhaps attributed to the Caribbean way of eating but I doubt it, makes this selection below par. I have tried to fix it with herbs, spices, dry it in the oven, make soup but it still barely acceptable to my highly developed culinary instinctual taste.<br />First I must say that this is the first time ever I have purchased a can that included both items, in this case beans and rice. The overall taste of this particular product leaves much to be desired. I still have about 7 more cans to consume but not very happy at all with the taste. Thought I bring it up, Healthy but Not Tasty! What a distinctive, off the wall flavor, Caribbean or not it's getting increasingly harder to finish! No disrespect intended to Eden Organic for they do deserve their accolades but not with this little bundle of joy!

My only issue was that I was working in a shared kitchen where I think someone must have put something hot into the walk-in cooler.  The fondant ended up sweating really bad and looked almost like ganache.  It dripped all over the white table cloth as I was setting up the tiered cake and made for a sticky mess to cut.  I'm not sure if it was someone who put something hot in the cooler or if the fondant just doesn't sit well in a fridge overnight...  Either way, I don't think I'll use this again, just in case.

review/text: Our greyhound absolutely loves these bones! Even though it's designed to clean her teeth, I think she plans her day around the opportunity to chew on this luscious bone. She knows she gets the bone after she finishes her dinner. I think she would eat sawdust to get to this bone! Like the original Coke recipe, does it have Cocaine in it? Our dog is a loving, docile pet, but regularly growls if we try to take it away from her...we give her 1/3 of a bone after each dinner meal. Too much of this product seems to effect the stool negatively. If you want  your dog to place you on a pedestal, buy this product!

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS BONE, IT WILL MAKE YOUR DOG SICK.
review/text: I bought this bone for our 8 month old schnoodle. He loved it, and ate all of the inside 'meat' within two days. True, he shouldn't have been left to eat it so quickly but he also shouldn't have gotten sick. The day after he started eating this bone, he developed diarrhea with some blood for a couple of days. After a week, he is still having loose stool and yesterday he vomited twice. Otherwise, he has been eating his food and drinking water as usual and is playing like he always does so we have been trying to wait for his system to clear up on its own. Another couple of days of these symptoms and we'll be taking him to the vet. Btw, I did a google search on the Dingo brand for any cases of puppies/dogs getting sick and I found multiple hits where people were talking about their dog having the same reaction as ours did. I also found out that there was a recall on another type of Dingo treat 1 year ago. Please look for another brand of bones for your pet, better to be safe then sorry.

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: I would call this "fudge" rather than brownies. My husband didn't like it, my son ate a small piece but wasn't too impressed, I thought they tasted OK but whatever ingredient is in it, it gave me awful cramps and bathroom issues, the same problem I get with sugar free candy so I guess I should have known. Sugar free "fudge" is a great concept but I guess there's no real way to be slim and still eat brownies because this is not the answer, atleast not for our family, unfortunately.

review/text: Something like popcorn seasoning is sure to be subjective, which is why we see the "love it or leave it" 1 or 5 star rating from previous reviers.<br /><br />Personally...I like it. It enhances the popcorn flavor. Just don't use too much. But again, how much is too much? That is beyond the scope of this review. Do you trust my taste in popcorn seasoning? If so, buy this now. If not, just buy it anyway. You need seasoning. You know this or you wouldn't be reading this review. Your life is empty without popcorn seasoning. Spice up your life!

review/summary: makes your popcorn taste amazing
review/text: Wabash Valley Farms Popcorn salt is wonderful. It is very fine grained<br />and won't just glide across your popcorn and fall to the<br />bottom of the bowl. This season sticks to popcorn and<br />makes is taste amazing. I ordered Wabash Valley Farm popcorn seasons to go along with Paragon's Coconut oil bars. Unfortunatley Amazon did not send me the Paragon Coconut oil bars I ordered but substituted with Lou Ann coconut oil bars. Which taste pretty good, just not what I ordered.<br /><br />The combination of cooking popcorn in the coconut oil and then topping it<br />off with this Wabash popcorn salt is a grand finish. You will get popcorn<br />that tastes like theater popcorn.  I ordered this combo after reading reviews<br />here at Amazon. Glad I read the reviews. Because we are popcorn lovers and this<br />combination of Wabash popcorn salt and the coconut oil bars gave us popcorn<br />perfection. You don't need much of this salt , a little goes a long way.<br />It has a slight buttery flavor to it.<br /><br />I recommend Wabash Valley Farms Popcorn salt .<br />Plus get some coconut popcorn oil to cook your popcorn in.<br />We use the Whirly pop popcorn maker to cook popcorn in. It makes the fluffiest<br />lightest popcorn of any popcorn maker I have ever used.

review/summary: Too Salty
review/text: I purchased this at a local Home Outfitters and was really excited to try it out. Unfortunately, it was extremely salty, and did not really impart any butter flavor. I tried to just use it sparingly as other users have suggested on Amazon, but it didn't seem to help -- it was just... mildly salted popcorn now, rather than that buttery/salty flavor that you're hoping for in 'movie style' popcorn.<br /><br />I didn't mind the yellow color of the product but couldn't get over the fact that it really just tasted like regular salt. I really like Wabash's Zesty Cheddar Cheese seasoning, which is quite salty as well, but has a great cheesy taste - try that one out!

review/text: I thought this was the salt that Wabash puts in their popcorn packs that you can use in the Whirley-Pop. This salt you are advised to use only as a topping and it doesn't taste as good as the salt flavoring in the popcorn/oil/salt packs. So I used it as directed. I didn't really go crazy for the flavor. I have another salt I like better and it's the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014A1BWQ">ACT II-Buttery Popcorn Salt, 3 lb. 4 oz. jug</a> which when added to butter really tastes like the movies. Won't be buying this again.

I tried some thing I bought at the local grocery and it is not good at all so I examined the container of the "old" stuff and found an web place and placed an order.  Seems like this new batch is not quite the same.  We will still use it and is far better than the POOR product I bought locally.  I'll try it out on company and see if anyone gets excited.<br />In a few words . . .what were my expectations?  More butter flavor.  Lots of product to use here, and not super cheep so not sure I want to experiment.

review/summary: Salty beyond reason
review/text: The butter flavor of this topping is decent. But the salt is beyond reason. I shook a minimal amount on our first batch of popcorn and none of us could continue to eating past the first few bites. Now, I sprinkle maybe 3 shakes over an entire large bowl and then I end up with several really salty bites and a bunch of popcorn with no topping flavor at all on it. I might consider a low-salt version of this, but with the amount I have left of these bottles, it will probably take me 3 years to get through it. I'll probably end up throwing them away.

review/summary: Theater Style Popcorn Seasoning "Great Stuff"
review/text: We were gifted a jar of Whirly-Pop Theater Popcorn Spice in 2004 and became fans immediately. When we tried to replace it we were unable to find it anywhere in Washington State and proceeded to search the net for our favorite spice. We visited a store in Everett, Washington that carried the Wabash Valley Farms seasoning but they did not have Theater Spice. We finally found it at Amazon.com in a three-pack and have shared it with family and friends who are now converts. This is a great product, it reminds me of my weekend trips to the movie theater back in the 50's and 60's because it tastes the same. Word of Caution: DO NOT USE TO MUCH a little goes a long way. Hey... Its popcorn night tonight!

This product adds that taste to my home made popcorn.  I just sprinkle it on when I am finished popping.  I also use their butter flavored oil.  Together my popcorn tastes fabulous.  When I get low, I simply order more. I have used Wasbash Valley Farms products for some time, and they have all been good, high quality popcorn products.

review/text: APPEARANCE...WEIRD.  Honestly, it kinda puts you in the mind of 'regurgitated' food from an EXTREMELY large PELICAN!  I alllllmost didn't use it cause I thought it went bad or somethin'.<br /><br />SALTY AS HECK. GEESH. YOU COULD CURE A CORPSE IN THIS STUFF.  (SORRY but seriously)--However, I advise you to just take my word at this and JUST USE IT. DON'T taste it--- because you might change your mind and decide to throw it out because it taste like "salty regurgitated food from...yep you got it".<br /><br />If you're a 'sodium warden'...Immo be honest...just pass it by.<br /><br />And yes...like everyone probably knows on here....a little--goes a lonnnnnnng way.  If you use too much, well...don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />TASTE!!!  Delicious. Crackin' delicious.  There was no salty taste in the end product.  I marinated chicken for 2 days.  I got worried because I actually forgot about the chicken and we alllll know the last thing you wanna smell is "bad chicken".  Now that I think about it, the excess salt probably prevented that.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I burnt some of the chicken while grilling. Definitely grill--it gets the BEST taste, smoke + jerk..well it just belongs together.  The parts I could eat though---"FAN-BLESSING-TASTIC". Seriously. No salty taste what-so-ever.  And if you don't really like chicken thighs (I don't either)---jerking is what a chicken has thighs for.<br /><br />It's takes that funny, 'chicken thigh-ee', dark meat---errrr...taste out of it.<br /><br />I don't know how to explain it but chicken thigh meat taste...well...funny to me.  But hey--jerked thighs = jerked juicy tastiness.  NOW, that's C.H.I.C.K.E.N thighs...not REAL PEOPLE THIGHS people!  Yeeees, it may yield more meat but ughh...yeah...that's demented and you can go to jail for that.<br /><br />I will DEFINITELY THOUGH...get me some more and not burn it this time.  Tha' bomb!

review/text: This is as good canned kale as I have had.  Just the right touch of seasoning.  Sprinkled with a bit of parmesan and it is a perfect no meat lunch.

review/summary: what a great flavor
review/text: I made 3 lbs of this so far. I made both jerky strips and jerky sticks using my Nesco jerky gun kit. I have been making all different kinds of jerky so far and this is an instant favorite! I couldn't really tell the sweet part of it, but it does have a nice spicy hint to it. This is a very tasty jerky, very hard to stop eating too.

review/summary: Not enough flavor
review/text: I have tried a few of the High Mountain jerky seasonings and this was one of my least favorites.  It didn't taste sweet and spicy.  For some reason it just didn't have enough taste.  I followed the instructions on the amount of seasoning and cure to add for lbs of ground beef.  I may have to add more of the seasonings than what the instructions stated, but I'll just stick with High Mountain's original as that is the best.

review/summary: To Dill or not to Dill?
review/text: I recommend you Dill. This product is strong and has good favor. I highly recommend on fish, when making tartar sauce or when making a Dill dip for vegetables.<br /><br />Very good product.
