review/summary: Not so Tender...and Very Dry
review/text: I purchased this as an option for my cat since he only eats chicken. This is a much drier and diced product (no juice) as compared to the other Whiskas products in a pouch. However, the pouch is quite stuff, so if you cat likes it, he will surely get enough to eat from this pouch. Also, the picture does not look like the product I was shipped.

review/summary: Cats are carnivores
review/text: Our older cat (14 years old) would only lick the juice from the bowl and let the chunks alone.  I've read since then that cats are carnivores and therefore should not be fed a grain-based diet.  So many cat foods on the market have grains as the main components, and so you have to look for products labeled "grain free".  We found some at our local feed store.  Maybe our first cat would have lived longer if we'd fed him better.

review/text: Even my most finicky cat LOVED this flavor.  The bowls are spotless after their meal!  I haven't been able to find this flavor by itself in the store, only in variety packs, and my cats don't like all the other flavors in the variety packs.  I'm willing to pay a little more to get a box of food I know they love!

review/summary: New formula - NO JUICES ???
review/text: This used to be my cat's favorite food.  But a couple of months ago, they changed the formula and now my cat won't touch it, and I know why.  Each of the four flavors says "in juices" after it.  But since the formula changed, there is absolutely no juice in this food.  The food comes out in one big dry clump.  The juice was my cat's favorite part.  I'll still by the other Whiska's flavors, but not this one.

review/text: I love the tender bites as do my senior cats (17 & 18 yrs old). But I do question the price, which is a unusual.  I get the 24 count variety pack for $9.49 at my local Food Lion grocery store.  I would expect a 48 count pack to be no more than double that price (18.98) so $28.11 would seem a bit high.  Unless of course  48 means 48 - 12 pack boxes.  Then the description needs  a little work.

review/text: I have never seen this flavor in the stores.  I do enjoy Sour Cream potato chips, so I thought I would give this a try even though I'm not a big fan of cream sauces.  You should definitely give this flavor a shot.  It has a light sour cream flavor (not sharp) the sauce is not too thick, and it makes for a great side dish, or a meal on it's own.

review/text: I love this candy! and my younger brothers love it too.<br /><br />The candy itself is a smooth, delicious milk chocolate (100 times better than your regular hersheys) and inside is a soft creamy white chocolatey kind of mixture, it almost tastes like malted milk balls, but only slightly.<br /><br />I ordered this a few days ago, and it completely slipped my mind that it was upwards of 80 degrees here, so i was afraid it would melt into goo when it got here, but luckily it arrived on a moderately cool day, and the chocolate itself was beautifully packaged and not in the slightest bit melted (a bit soft, but not melted)<br /><br />The box is about the size of a big candy bar, and there are 8 smaller bars in it, about finger length and width (but i have small hands, so that wont tell you much) but it was amazing and i will definitely order more chocolate soon!

review/summary: I'll have a SCONE with my coffee, please!
review/text: This morning I felt decadent, luxurious, replete, and utterly, completely satisfied.  This morning with my cup of hot coffee I ate a piping hot sweet cherry scone.  Now, this might sound frivolous to those who purchase scones at Starbucks, or take them for granted as a part of special tea-times with friends.  But for me, who has a penchant for scones in all their incarnations, and who has felt relegated to the world of gluten free "living," enjoying an edible scone was, I thought, a thing of the past. Well, not any more!  Because this morning I mixed up a batch of Mama's Scone mix, popped it into the oven, and just finished two of the best scones I've ever eaten.  Truly *the best* - including the fancy scones I used to purchase from Concord Tea Cakes in Massachusetts, including the scones I ate at that fancy hotel in New York at their famous tea service, including the sweet biscuits my mother used to smother with butter and homemade strawberry jam. These moist-yet-crumbly scones baked up to perfection, with a lovely brown crust both top and bottom, a not-too-sweet flavor that had none of the typical gf aftertaste or texture, and my addition of sweet dried cherries made for a tasty breakfast.  I baked these on parchment paper, which I've found enormously helpful for gf baked goods, and also added a smidgen more cream than the recipe called for.  Be sure, when you make these, to follow the direction of brushing with cream and sprinkling with granulated sugar, because it's an added touch that turns these into real confections.  I used heavy cream, which worked very well for density purposes, but whole milk would work just fine in my estimation.  Each package of mix contains a generous 3 batches of scones, and each batch makes 8 scones.  For party purposes (I'm thinking a fancy brunch with these as the star of the show), one bag of mix makes 24 scones of very filling proportions (one could make these smaller and still have a generously sized portion).  As a fine scratch baker I've honestly never found the knack for the perfect scone, but now I don't need to worry - even if I weren't gluten free, I'd purchase this mix by the case-full (diet be damned).  Three cheers to Gluten Free Mama for making gluten free eating the most delicious yet!

It was wonderful to find it on Amazon.com.<br />  The package arrived quickly and was in excellent shape.<br />  The 'use by' is Feb. 2013 so that is great.  I store all my gluten free products in the freezer and the fridge so they last quite a long time.  But I do make scones about once a week.  You can make many different kinds of scones with this mix.<br />  This is a great way to get the mixes.

And, not only is their coffee excellent, they also have excellent business practices. Chocotal, is my favorite variety of their coffees. It is made from cacao nibs and coffee beans. It is not a flavored coffee in the usual sense in that it is not made of artificial flavoring and does not have that disgusting artificial taste. Chocotal with cream and a bit of sugar can replace dessert... it's that good.

review/summary: low carb bagels that taste good
review/text: These bagels toast up nicely and actually have some flavor and a nice chew.  They also don't seem to mold easily; I put them in a ziplock bag on the counter next to the toaster and they keep for over a week

review/summary: Not great.
review/text: My husband ordered these for his low carb diet, but could not even make it through the entire package.  The taste was not great and the texture very funky.  I recommend just eating a regular bagel and maybe only having half or maybe try the thin bagels.

review/summary: Good everyday Hot Sauce
review/text: I'd definitely recommend this one.  It's hot and tangy, but not too hot.  It has a refreshing taste to it, probably due to the lime and carrots used in it.  I've had other Habenero sauces that are just over the top, but this one has heat, but not over powering.  It is a great "everyday" sauce, and perfect on Chicken Tacos!  It's also really, really good on Avocados, so if you make a lot of Tex/Mex food, this is the Hot Sauce for you.

review/text: When I got this as a gift, I wasn't sure I wanted to try it. A hot sauce with carrots? Also, I don't like vinegar in my hot sauce.<br /><br />I was happily surprised with this sauce. It is very flavorful and hot but not too hot.<br /><br />It won't replace my favorite hot sauce: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014P3C64">Tapatio</a>. But I plan on keeping a bottle-full around the house.

review/summary: AWESOME ....
review/text: I bought this hot sauce from world market because I like to add a little kick to my lunch. When I tried the hot sauce I was pleasantly suprised especially considering it's arounf 4.50.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Very economical<br />2. sweet taste offsets the habanero.<br />3. Add's some nice color contrast when used as garnish.<br />4. Don't need alot to get the flavor you want.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Make sure you shake the bottle before applying the sauce. The flavor sometimes goes to the bottom.<br />2. If you find hab's hot the person won't like it.  (Taste preference)<br /><br />Overall, it's a hit in my book.. I personally dont' find it VERY hot but it's tasty!  enjoy.....

review/text: These treats can create a very serious problem.  I just opened the new bag I bought from Amazon and gave one to each of my three dogs and TWO OF THEM GOT THEM STUCK IN THEIR THROATS.  Both were choking and both had to have them pried out of their mouths by my husband and I.  Very scary.  I have thrown them out.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUY THESE.  Based on their shape, size and the fact that when they get wet they get sticky, they can choke your dog.  DON'T BUY THESE. PERIOD.

review/text: I have used Roland products for years. The sliced bamboo has always been good -- and consistent (quality of the bamboo and size of slices). The 24 cans are a good deal shipped free to you door. I use them up fast enough in Asian-inspired soups and many Asian and other stir-fry dishes.<br /><br />It's handy to have a supply always available to whip up a soup or stir-fry in a hurry. I keep broccoli and boneless chicken cutlets (and boneless pork) in freezer, while I keep bamboo shoots, mushrooms, etc., and lite coconut milk in pantry along with various Asian flavoring sauces, pastes, etc. to cook 'real' food in the microwave in a short time.<br /><br />From freezer/pantry to table, the stir-fry is ready by the time the rice is cooked.

review/summary: Well - they are Bamboo Shoots
review/text: I've eaten a great many bamboo shoots in my life, and usually they are not a very distinctive item in any way.  It's rare to get a woody, tough one.  So I'm not sure really what would constitute a really exceptional bamboo shoot product.<br /><br />Having clarified that, I'm very happy with these.  They are as I would expect, typical tender, delicately flavored, lightly crunchy, evenly cut etc. bamboo shoots.  They are not salty, they don't taste like the can, they are not discolored; everything is great.<br /><br />Bamboo shoots are healthy, low in calories, and add nice variety to one's vegetable intake.  They are a hassle to prep from scratch since they are poisonous raw (perfectly safe in this form though).  Besides Chinese dishes they are actually good in anything you might add a root vegetable to, since they have a similar texture and quality.  I haven't done a lot of experimenting yet with them, but I suspect they offer up a lot of possibilities beyond the typical stir-fry.

review/text: You can easily make this on your own: just mix together raw cacao, agave, and coconut oil... Agave isn't that healthy actually (because of its high glycemic index), so you might want to substitute raw honey instead to make it sweet. It's great by the spoonful, if you want something sweet, but for some people eating too much coconut oil at one time can cause loose stool.

They say if you put it in the freeze it's like ice cream, well I haven't tried this but I'm guessing it is true.  It was smooth and creamy just like any ganache made from a high quality semi or bittersweet chocolate.<br /><br />I was worried it might seem gritty, but it is totally smooth.  A great alternative to satisfy the sweet chocolate cravings with a healthy, lower sugar option that isn't full of artificial stuff and doesn't taste like it is 'health'.  I will definitely be buying more in the future!

review/text: The Szeged Steak Rub is a great product; however, the vendor I ordered it from (Otto's) does not actually have or send the 28oz even though they are listed as a seller of this item. restaurant size. This has been reported to Amazon that product is not as described here. Different UPC code for the tins. The reason I wanted the large container is because I do restaurant cooking and small tins just don't meet the demand. Plus, the larger container has a lid that seals better after repeated openings whereas the tin containers have lids that often won't close with heavy use. After the hassle of receiving the wrong items I am going to look locally for this item. Again though, the steak rub is great on any cut of beef, mixed into hamburgers, etc. Add your favorite marinade and people will think you are a pro!

review/summary: Freshen Up with No ARTIFICAL Sugar!
review/text: The reason for me purchasing this gum is because it was NOT made with ARTIFICAL SWEETNERS.  Every gum today is made with a low calorie SWEETNER and it was madding trying to find one that used real sugar but Freshen Up Gums do.  This gum has a nice burst up juicy flavor in the center which helps carry the gums taste along.  It is soft not hard which sometimes is a problem I found with finding gum made with real sugar. And then the flavor last a good long while which was another reason I like Freshen Up over other brand. So nice flavor, soft texture, long lasting, and no ARTIFICAL sweetners. For me that rounds out or should I say squares up to be the perfect piece of gum.

review/summary: Good Green Tea mix w/ no artificial sweetener
review/text: I wanted a fruity iced green tea mix without artificial sweetener, and this fits the bill nicely.  This product is sweetened with plain sugar.  I do think you need to put in more powder than it says you should to get a bit stronger and sweeter taste, so it is more calories and won't last as long as the packaging says, but I'm okay with that.  The only thing that would make this better is if it were sweetened with stevia - natural, but lower calorie.

Sams Club was giving samples if this tea, I tried it, liked it, and got my husband to try it.  It was an instant hit with him and for at least the past 8 months its all he drinks!  We find it refreshing and hydrating.  Its saving me alot of money since we don't buy Dr Pepper anymore and no more empty soda cans to clean up! Regular deliveries from Amazon is another bonus, it just appears at our door on a regular basis, this is a great way to shop!

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: Give this green tea mix a try, especially if you like fruit flavored teas.<br /><br />I had previously tried lipton iced tea mix in a white tea flavor and really didn't like it, so much that it got tossed, so I was a little hesitant to order this tea mix.  It was on sale so I figured I'd give it a go since the blackberry pomegranate flavor sounded great. I usually brew a pot of tea each day and thought this would be a quick and easy way to make a glass at a time for the summer.  I am so glad I gave lipton tea mixes another chance and tried this flavor, it is delicious! You can use a little more or less tea mix to taste, even  just a teaspoon gives a nice refreshing flavor to a glass of ice water.  The fruit flavor doesn't taste artifical and it is sweetened just right.  Will be ordering this one again for sure, even if it isn't on sale.

review/text: I drink this regularly, and it tastes very good.<br /><br />It tastes sort of mild and fruity, then the finish in the back of your throat is of the tea flavor.  It is very mild and nice tasting, again it has a predominantly fruity taste but not overly sweet, it is mild and tastey.<br /><br />Hard to believe this but, I bought two 28 quart cans of this from the 99cent store here in California.  I had never tasted it before that, and there were like 7 cans left (28 quart size) so I bought two thinking that if I didnt like it Id only be out $2.  They expire in June or August of 2013...<br /><br />When I started drinking it I loved it and wished I bought more!  $1 a can that makes 28 quarts!  WOW, what a deal!  I have about 40% of my last can left and I decided to look for more.  But 20 quarts only for about $9 each can?  WOW, that is crazy!  I had no idea!<br /><br />If it is sold by Amazon Im sure the price is good.  The 99 cent store only had those one time only, it is not a regular item (as alot of their merchandise is that way). I shop there frequently to get the best deals, which always go FAST!<br /><br />I hope this review helps, this drink mix tastes pretty good, fruity is the main thing about it with a mild tea after taste.  Also, not too sweet, very nice and refreshing.<br /><br />good luck!

review/summary: Yummy In My Tummy
review/text: Last time I ate ramen was when I was a 16 yrs old and even then I didn't care for them much (but in a pinch was a quick meal). I bought a whole bunch of noodles for my nephew who is in college and seeing the prices these were going for I HAD to try them myself.  I prepared it as instructed in the packaging. Only difference is I only used half of the seasonings packet. I always found seasoning packets too salty for my taste ( I also never drink the left over broth saves both calories and sodium) . I also shredded a left over jerk chicken breast from last night. I must say it was very good. The noodles went great with it. Next time I will add some frozen mixed veggies as well. All in all I am quite surprised and pleased with these. I know I can have them on hand for the occasional meal when I am not feeling well enough to cook a full meal.

I have tried several flavors of these noodle trays and these are my favorite. They come with the ubiquitous noodle brick and two packets, one dried vegetables, the other flavor powder. Just fill the tray to the line with water, add the noodles and veggies, microwave covered for 4 minuts then add the flavoring and let set for a couple of minutes. No soup, just great tasting noodles in a thick, flavorful sauce.

review/text: I bought this for the price.  I have been a fan of Godiva's Hot Cocoa (Dark and Milk) for about a year.  While much better than those instant hot cocoa (Swiss Miss, Carnation etc) that are made with water - it leaves a slight aftertaste that I do not like.  Also, it did not mix as easily (dissolve) as the Godiva did.  I think it (like wine and food) is just a personal taste.  Try both brands and see for yourself.

review/summary: Absolutely the best sipping chocolate!
review/text: I am incredibly picky when it comes to chocolate, and most chocolate mixes are simply sugar with a few specks of chocolate.  Bellagio sipping chocolate is by far the BEST chocolate mix I have ever tried...and I've tried many!  It is a little more expensive than other brands of cocoa mix, but you definitely get what you pay for.  A little goes a long way, and you can make anything from hot cocoa to thick sipping chocolate to "spoon" chocolate to chocolate mousse....the list goes on and on.  I even made a great "chocolate emergency" frosting by simply mixing some of the chocolate in with a bowl of whipped cream.  And as an added bonus, the tin the chocolate comes in is super cute and makes a wonderful gift.

It's not just the regular hot chocolate you find at grocery stores...it's very rich. I follow the instructions except I substitute whole milk with straight heavy whipping cream, which is what the chocolate store uses. It tastes like a melted candy bar. The one ounce packets are the perfect portion too. Will definitely be getting this again!<br /><br />Update: I tried this with skim milk, which I usually drink, because I wanted something lighter. It was only ok with skim. It tastes a lot better with heavy cream, where the flavors just seem to blend better. It's also good with a dash of Irish cream.

review/text: I used this sipping chocolate for hot chocolate and I enjoyed a wonderful experience. I have grown up on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JJRS6K">Swiss Miss Milk Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix 80 Ounce Value Cannister</a> and Bellagio blows Swiss Miss out of the water. I do recommend adding sugar, because like others have said it is dark chocolate and it can taste bitter to your palette. I mix it with hot water because I find it to be too rich for my taste using milk. My own recipe involves water, sugar, a splash of real vanilla, and sometimes cinnamon and chili powder. I then add a large dollop of milk to bring it to a nice drinking temperature and then it is perfect for immediate consumption. The reason I gave this product a four star rating was due to the fact that I had lots of trouble mixing it with cold ingredients. At first, I tried soy milk and I got left with little bits of mix that would not dissolve. Thinking the soy milk was the problem, I tried whole milk and got the same results. So don't expect <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M050T8">Ovaltine Chocolate Drink Mix, Rich Chocolate, 12-Ounce Container (Pack of 4)</a>! Anyway, this is a great product for the dark hot chocolate lover in your life, so mix it up and enjoy!

review/summary: Beautiful for a gift presentation...excellent cocoa!
review/text: First off, the tin is gorgeous.  You would be hard-pressed to find a more artful tin of cocoa for gift giving.  I wouldn't feel bad to gift one tin of this wrapped in a beautiful paper as a birthday or holiday present - unwrapped it could be given as a hostess gift without worries of looking 'cheap'.  Careful thought was taken on the container this cocoa would be housed in.  A fine gift for a man, too, as it's not 'foo-foo' looking.<br /><br />Upon opening the tin, there is a silver packet of cocoa, sealed tightly.  Expiration date is 2 years from now (as IF it will last that long).  On the first cut of the packet, the aroma of chocolate filled my senses.  Deep, rich, pleasant chocolaty promises of tastes yet to come. I will be keeping the cocoa inside the silver packet as opposed to pouring it into the tin directly.<br /><br />Now, on to the best part ... the taste of the cocoa.  I licked the cocoa off the silver packet top that I cut off and wow, what an impact.  The first taste to hit was definitely chocolate - and not overly sweet chocolate I might add; was a bit bitter at full strength but expectations of my first mug of cocoa were pressing at this point.  I put 8 oz milk, 1 oz half and half, and 1 oz heavy cream into my Back to Basics Cocoa/Latte maker, then added 3 heaping teaspoons of Bellagio Sipping Chocolate, a splash of vanilla, and a spoon of sweetened condensed milk, then turned the machine on.  Within minutes a rich, well blended, decadent cocoa was soon at hand.  Poured it into a 16 oz mug, (nuked it for 20 seconds since the cocoa/latte maker doesn't make it as hot as I like it) and topped with fresh whipped cream. Realizing that it wasn't 'plain' cocoa at this point, the resulting flavor  was still utterly delicious.  The cocoa taste was still the star and rang through even with the add-ins, the flavor of chocolate was pronounced: strong and bold, yet smooth with a slight 'fruitiness' was to be discovered.<br /><br />Now for the final merits: YUM!
