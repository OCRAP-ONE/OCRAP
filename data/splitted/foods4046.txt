review/summary: Bite sized peanut butter cups - melting smooth heaven in our mouths
review/text: I've loved these Reese's as far back as I could imagine. Every bite has always been smooth and the combination of peanut butter and chocolate makes me drool just as I am typing this. If you haven't tried Reese's before, do it! If not, enjoy the peanut butter cups every once in a while.<br /><br />Also, the bite sized Reese's makes it easy to enjoy as a "finger" snack.

Each candy was no longer a cup shape but a bag of abstract shapes, nothing like their oringinal form. They were ordered to be favors for a wedding. Labels had been bought with the newleyweds monogram in the shape of the pb cup. What a disaster!

review/text: Amazon advertises this with their Halloween specials, however, despite the fact that I ordered it on Oct. 20, the shipment confirmation indicates I will not receive it until sometime between Nov. 15-30. Maybe it should be advertised as a Thanksgiving or Christmas special instead. I had difficulty rating it because I'm guessing the product will be the usual great taste of Reese's PBC but I'd rate Amazon a zero on the false advertising & delivery.

review/text: I've purchased cereal from Amazon before, but I didn't even think that some of my favorites would be sold here. Fruity Pebbles is perhaps my most favorite. Lucky Charms and Cocoa Pebbles are a close second. I love the fruity taste of this cereal, although this processed garbage could be a whole lot healthier. It seems like the price fluctuates up and down, so I will wait until this 4-pack drops lower than $14.55.

review/text: My 2 yr old mini poodle has had digestive problems. He seemingly cannot eat anything that does not crunch and needs alot of chewing. Bil Jacs, Red Barn, tube foods, chewy heartworm tabs, even canned food gives him problems, as in, they come back up. So dry food is the food of choice and sometimes treats, except for these. Even tho they say "Made in China" they also say "Tested Safe for USA" and so few ingredients, especially the Peas and Carrots, his fav, make me happy I can get them to make him happy. He loves them. We cut them into tiny bit size for training, and seek games, as well as, the "Brain" games.  Have tried other "Made in US" treats--No go.  So please keep these on your inventory.

review/text: Our rat terrier, Frisky, is diabetic and also had trouble with her liver and pancreas two years back.  I am very careful what food she eats, but I feel these snacks are okay for her.  She loves the Freeze Dried Chicken Liver Plus with pumpkin and apple  Our vet once told us that pumpkin was good for bowel movement so that is another plus.  Giving her 3 or 4 pieces in her dry food sometimes entices her to eat all the dry food.  They are her favorite snack.

review/summary: Read the fine print, mine was saying treated by iradiation
review/text: It is not my intention to hurt anybody's sales but this product's package was saying "treated by radiation".<br />I found it only at the third package and decided rather not buy it again.<br /><br />There are lots of good pet products that are not irradiated and are going quite nice. I am ok if it is made in China like most of the pet products, I trust your quality control until proven otherwise. I trust an honest effort to make good quality products and inform the customers.<br />If it matters to the producing company, I would rather not feed my best friend with something treated by nuclear radiation. Steam it, freeze dry it, but don't nuke it and leave it natural. If a restaurant would sell you irradiated food, would you consider safe for you?<br /><br />To me, if advertised looking like natural, it must be exactly that, no sneaky fine prints on the back.<br />If the producing company would offer such alternatives (non-irradiated) I would reconsider the review and would buy again this product. I would appreciate any positive feedback. Thanks.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: My 2 yr old mini poodle has had digestive problems. He seemingly cannot eat anything that does not crunch and needs alot of chewing. Bil Jacs, Red Barn, tube foods, chewy heartworm tabs, even canned food gives him problems, as in, they come back up. So dry food is the food of choice and sometimes treats, except for these. Even tho they say "Made in China" they also say "Tested Safe for USA" and so few ingredients, especially the Peas and Carrots, his fav, make me happy I can get them to make him happy. He loves them. We cut them into tiny bit size for training, and seek games, as well as, the "Brain" games.  Have tried other "Made in US" treats--No go.  So please keep these on your inventory.

review/summary: Great, healthy snack
review/text: Our rat terrier, Frisky, is diabetic and also had trouble with her liver and pancreas two years back.  I am very careful what food she eats, but I feel these snacks are okay for her.  She loves the Freeze Dried Chicken Liver Plus with pumpkin and apple  Our vet once told us that pumpkin was good for bowel movement so that is another plus.  Giving her 3 or 4 pieces in her dry food sometimes entices her to eat all the dry food.  They are her favorite snack.

review/summary: Read the fine print, mine was saying treated by iradiation
review/text: It is not my intention to hurt anybody's sales but this product's package was saying "treated by radiation".<br />I found it only at the third package and decided rather not buy it again.<br /><br />There are lots of good pet products that are not irradiated and are going quite nice. I am ok if it is made in China like most of the pet products, I trust your quality control until proven otherwise. I trust an honest effort to make good quality products and inform the customers.<br />If it matters to the producing company, I would rather not feed my best friend with something treated by nuclear radiation. Steam it, freeze dry it, but don't nuke it and leave it natural. If a restaurant would sell you irradiated food, would you consider safe for you?<br /><br />To me, if advertised looking like natural, it must be exactly that, no sneaky fine prints on the back.<br />If the producing company would offer such alternatives (non-irradiated) I would reconsider the review and would buy again this product. I would appreciate any positive feedback. Thanks.

review/text: We tried this soup when they had it on sale at Safeway in the Specialty Items section.  It is so good we wanted more.  They discontinued it, so we Amazon-ed and were pleased to find it here.  This soup is great made to order or with all sorts of items added.  We put chicken, black beans, corn, 2 small cans of authentic salsa, jalapenos and sometimes leftovers of all sorts into the mix and it is always great.  Wonderful winter warmer.  Try it, you'll see.

review/text: I buy this at TARGET stores, it comes in a smaller box. While the recipe basically calls for just water and tomato sauce i found that you can add a lot more to it that makes it SO much better.<br /><br />-- Mexican or Cheddar Cheese (this is a must!) You top each bowl before serving<br />-- Baked chicken - my mom used already seasoned chicken meat but I bake 4 breasts in the oven seasoned with chili powder and slice up to add to the pot.<br />--  Green Onion diced<br />-- Tortilla Chips, doesn't really matter what kind. It just thickens the soup and makes it hearty.<br /><br />Basically it's really easy to make. And the leftovers really taste good too. I haven't tried the other flavors of this brand, didn't really care to. But this is one that i keep stocked in my pantry and those who have tried it really enjoyed it. You could serve as a main dish or perhaps a small side soup with a mexican meal.

review/text: I introduced several other people to this soup and all of them love it.<br /><br />When I make the soup I combine the mix, the water and the tomato sauce in a 6 qt pot.  I add a pound of boneless chicken breasts.  Simmer soup until chicken is tender enough to shred.  Remove chicken to cutting board and shred with a fork (the texture is much better in the soup than cubing it).  Return chicken to pot.  Add 1 can each black beans, pinto beans and Green Giant's Mexi-corn.  Heat through.  Serve in bowls.  Top with shredded cheese of your choice, chopped green onions and Tostitos Dipping Strips.

review/summary: Great Tasting Soup
review/text: I bought this to try as I love Chicken Enchilada soup at Chili's.  Obviously making a pot at home is cheaper than always going out.  The first time I made this, I made it according to the directions by just adding tomato sauce and chicken.  It was good with melted cheese on it.  Then the next time I started adding things; corn, pepper, onion, salsa.  Each time it gets better.  My husband cannot eat cheese so I try to make the soup as good tasting as possible since he has to stay away from one of the best parts of it.<br /><br />I have bought this soup a few times and will continue to buy it.  I have a pot cooking right now with the canned chicken, some marinated chicken breast from yesterday, mexican corn, red pepper, green pepper and cilantro.  It smells good and my sampling tastes good.  Husband will be happy with dinner tonight when he gets home from work.

review/summary: Tasty and satisfying 5 minute Chow Mein
review/text: Ever since I was a young one, I've had a pack of ramen here and there. Simple small snack even with the high sodium.I am normally content with instant ramen which requires 20 minutes to prepare(boiling the water and etc) 2 Months ago my brother handed me a pack of Nissin Chow Mein, at first i thought what the heck is this? this can't be better than 25cent ramen.Decided to try it out, figured what could i lose besides 1 cup of water.I rip the contain open, and see the liquid sauce/seasoning and the premium which is dried vegetables and bits of beef. First i added the vegetables and beef and poured water up to the line inside the container.Place it in the microwave and slam the door and put it on 5 minutes exactly.After 5 minutes, i take the contain out and examine the noodles and vegetables/beef. These noodles are pretty stable and thick, the kind you would find from any take out place on the corner.The place you've been to a million times but they don't recognize your face or name even if you order the same thing. Anyways the pieces of beef and vegetables are brought to life and have a hint of flavor, after seeing that i added the sauce and stirred the noodles until they were all coated evenly and equally. I stuck my fork in and twirled a good amount of noodles and I have to say, these noodles are pretty good quality consider they sell for $1 a pack.<br /><br />Last Week, i checked up on these noodles on amazon and found 8 packs for 7.92, that is a steal, $1.83 is the price at my local supermarket.Anyways i place a order using my amazon prime account and they arrive 2 days later. I really enjoy 2 day shipping!<br />I opened the box from amazon to see the 8 pack of noodles, in the bulk type packaging. The type of packaging the supermarket gets before they are opened and placed on display for people to buy.Hopefully these can last a month, I can't imagine them lasting longer.<br /><br />If your a busy person or your on a budget like myself, these are a great way to satisfy your hunger while on the go. Pretty easy to prepare and they will leave you feeling full. Here's a tip of mine, add your own meat/vegetables.It's fun to customize your meal up.<br />If your expecting restaurant quality noodles with big pieces of beef and lush vegetables stick to your local "spot" we all got them.

review/summary: One of the Best Microwavable Meals, but Beware of Trans Fat
review/text: This was one of my college staples. I had at least 5 of these a week for years.<br />After a while my parents said that it contained trans fat.<br />I initially ignored their claim after reading the package and seeing "0g Trans Fat."<br /><br />However, I later read that food manufacturers may put 0g if it contains up to .5g. There are two servings in this package, which is why they can say that it is "trans fat free." If it only listed one serving, this product would have to say 1g trans fat.<br /><br />This is still my favorite microwavable noodle product, but I no longer purchase it. Unnaturally occurring trans fat is simply not good for you, no matter how delicious. Should this product ever remove the trans fat, I would rate it 5 stars and go back to eating it every day.<br /><br />Look for partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients. It's not worth it.

review/text: If you're diabetic or just a low carb eater, you have to try these brownies.  Half a softened stick of butter, one egg, the powder mix, 15 minutes at 350 degrees F, and you will be a very happy camper.  These are really good and virtually indistinguishable from a "regular" brownie.  And these have lots of nice baby chocolate chips in them too!<br /><br />Prepared as directed, I found these a teensy dry, which a little more butter or two tablespoons of water will remedy, along with baking the minimum time- check with a knife inserted in the center coming out cleanly.<br /><br />Just shop this item a little.  I have found this product elsewhere on the 'net for as low as $4.29 and will keep this in mind before repurchasing... which I definitely will do.

review/text: I can't believe there aren't any other reviews here yet. These are hands down the best. I bake them a little under done and they are like molten chocolate cakes. Would be great with low carb ice cream. Thrifty's makes some very good ones (even a peanut butter fudge swirl). I swirl almond butter, or splenda sweetened cream cheese, or both into these before baking.  I make some type of low carb dessert whenever we're faced with a holiday or birthday so that we have a legal treat. It helps us to avoid the "illegal" ones. Don't hesitate to try these if you're a low carber and need a treat.

This product has natural ingredients, no preservatives, and is sweetened with erythritol, a sugar alcohol that seems to be gentle on my system. YUMMY!!

review/text: I confess that I love this peanut butter.<br />It has that addictive combination of sweet, salty, and crunchy fat & protein. Sounds like the perfect food, right?<br />Well, nuts are natuarly fatty and to make the peanut "butter" you need to add oil (more fat).<br />In this "reduced fat" version Skippy compensates by adding sugar. So this peanut butter is still very caloric. It also is sweeter than other versions. But on the whole I prefer this version.<br />Hope that helps you decide!

review/summary: Better than Skippy's mainstrem product.
review/text: I have made my own peanut butter from simply peanuts, the "true" peanut butter. It's quite yummy, but the oil floats to the top and so the product must be stirred before use. Somewhere along the line our national food brands felt they needed to improve on basic peanut butter, so added a few things like hydrogenated oils, various sugars, salt, and a few other things that many, including myself, wouldn't recognize. Yes, for the most part they taste good, but not quite like homemade. From the hydrogenated oil, consumers gain a lot of extra fat and sugar they may not necessarily want and mostly don't need. The added oil smooths the taste of the peanut butter, keeps the oil from separating from the butter and makes it more spreadable.  While Reduced Skippy states "25% Less fat" hydrogenated oils are still used and the sugar has been increased. These, however, can be overlooked easily. Particularly when you've just bitten into your first cracker smeared with Skippy Reduced Fat.  It also is pretty yummy.

review/summary: Just about the best for a reduced fat peanut butter
review/text: I started buying Skippy several years ago after reading a number of consumer reviews that gave it a top ranking. The one that stuck with me the most was a polling of 12 year-olds, who gave Skippy peanut butter a resounding recommendation for its taste and texture. In writing this review, I went back and checked to see what more adult reviewers think. I'm taking the liberty of quoting from the CookingLightly website so far as its review of Super Chunk:<br /><br />"Raters  loved the ultra-smooth butter portion and the pleasantly salty flavor. Besides the abundance of nuts, the peanut aroma and appealing caramel color won us over..Good for baking, ice cream, dessert sauces, satay sauce, or to thicken a winter vegetable stew."<br /><br />This is my opinion, too, and while the above review was for the regular Super Chunk,  it applies in my opinion to the reduced fat version just as well. I love this peanut butter. I know that Jif and Peter Pan are also often ranked highly, but Skippy is by far my preference.<br /><br />While I use it on sandwiches, I often just eat a tablespoon or two as a quick snack and source of protein. It is so good in this role that I gave it to a diabetic friend. She uses it in lieu of orange juice if she's starting to feel hypoglycemic. The peanut butter stays with her longer and has a smoother effect.<br /><br />One caveat so far as Super Chunk, though. If you have soft teeth, best to stick with creamy. Otherwise you're taking chances with possible tooth or gum problems because of the bits of nut, which can be very crunchy.<br /><br />While I have often bought the reduced fat versions in the past, some nutritionists are now raising questions abou he value of this approach. They have two basic points:<br /><br />1. The process of removing fat is n fact removing monounsaturated oils which are healthy for us.<br /><br />2. To compensate for any loss of taste, manufacturers are putting back in sugars and oils which may not e so healthy.<br /><br />My rating is based on taste and texture. I'm not taking a position in nutritional debates but do suggest that you check these matters out separately if you are concerned about this kind of issue.

review/text: This reduced fat peanut butter version doesn't mean it also doesn't taste good.  I have tried the regular Skippy Peanut Butters, but this reduced fat version in both smooth and crunchy tastes great.  I believe it's because it tastes sweeter than the others.  If you like a sweet tasting peanut butter that has reduced fat (added bonus) than give this item a try.

That's why we craft FEARLESS CHOCOLATE unroasted and with low heat under 118� preserving its natural nutrients, marvelous minerals, and abundant antioxidants.<br /><br />Also, it is organic chocolate so no pesticides and toxic garbage like that.<br /><br />The super seed Crunch is my favorite and the seeds are Hemp, Chia, and Flax.  It is certified organic by Oregon Tilth.<br /><br />It is 70% cacao.<br /><br />NO EMULSIFIERS!  This is great to leave out those!<br /><br />Ingredients listed as: organic raw cacao, organic rapadura (unrefined whole cane sugar), organic flax seed, organic hemp seed, organic chia sred<br />May contain traces of dairy, peanuts, and soy from shared equipment.<br /><br />My local Whole Foods sells these for $3.99 each but I buy them by the CASE!

review/summary: Cat that NEVER vomited has been vomiting daily since formula change
review/text: This used to be one of the relatively few "urinary tract" formulas out there that my cat could stomach AND was readily available at most super markets but since the recent formula change, he has been throwing up nearly every day and has started turning his nose to it. It's pretty awful and kind of scary to see him lose half of his "nourishment" every day of late. This was something he had been eating every year for the last decade (half mixed with a high-end catfood that is only meat and poultry and none of the grains and corn crap that is so bad for humans and completely counter to what cats naturally eat!).  So now I am at a loss.  I wish there was a grocer's catfood out there on the store shelves that is all meat and poultry, no sugars, no grains and no corn and has the urinary tract ingredients for these little creatures that have this problem.  I wonder if just feeding him the food he would be eating in the wild would change things around--even for the urinary tract complications...anyway, the Purina Urinary Tract Formula is no longer any good.

review/summary: Caution: Made my cat very sick!!
review/text: I've been feeding my cat this food for years without a problem. Recently she began vomiting uncontrollably after eating the food. Around her feeding time, she was at her bowl crying an begging for food like she usually does, but when we fed her she refused to touch the stuff. We thought maybe she just didn't have an appetite because she wasn't feeling well, but she scarfed down the treats and tuna we gave her. That was when we started to suspect that something was wrong with the food. We went out and bought her some canned food, and she ate that too. The only thing she wouldn't touch was the Purina food that she had eaten for years. She also stopped throwing up after we switched her food. After that, I turned to google to see if there were any recalls. I didn't find any, but I did find numerous complaints on the consumeraffairs dot com about cats (and dogs...apparently the problem isn't limited to cat food) who have recently gotten sick from Purina food. I would NOT buy this food. I have already stopped feeding it to my own cats, and I would suggest that everyone else do the same.<br /><br />If you pet has already gotten sick from the food, call this number to complain. 1-866-787-4621

review/summary: ~*~*~NO MORE URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS~*~*~
review/text: My cat is 10 years old and he used to get UTI's ALL the time(like every few months) not only was his vet bills expensive, I hated that he was in pain. I used the very expensive food I bought from the vet for cats who get lots of UTI's but since I am not Donald Trump I decided to give the Purina One Urinary Tract food a try. For years my cat didn't have a single UTI so one day at the store when they were out of the Purina One, I decided to give a cheaper Urinary Tract cat food a try. Within a month my cat was whining in the litter box and I knew he had another UTI. I took him to the Vet and sure enough, he had another UTI.<br /><br />I immediately went to the store and bought him Purina One Urinary Tract and that is what he has been on ever since. I will NEVER again try a different brand of cat food, that was over 4 years ago since I tried the cheaper cat food and he hasn't had a single UTI since. My cat LOVES his food, he is very picky but thankfully he loves his UTI formula.<br /><br />If you have a cat who gets UTI's I totally recommend giving this food a try. It costs more than the cheaper food but what it saves me in vet bills and having a happy & healthy Kitty is well worth it : )

review/summary: A decent price and quality
review/text: Its been almost a month since I switched my two cats over from Meow Mix to Purina Sensitive System. Both of them love it, and the older of the two cats has significantly vomited less after eating this food.<br /><br />I came to realize the poor quality of ingredients in Meow Mix, and hoped to find a better quality food for a good price, but its no surprise to me that even a good bag of dry cat food has some undesirable ingredients (corn gluten meal, chicken by-product, etc.) and its almost impossible to find anything of high quality without those ingredients and still be paying a decent price for it. The 3.5 lb bags I get at Target are about $6.00. Not too expensive, and the bag lasts my two cats a little over a month.<br /><br />Although Purina Sensitive Systems isn't the best ever, its not the poorest either. It falls just in the middle, and I'd recommend it to those who can only afford an inexpensive dry cat food, but with better quality than the cheaper Meow Mix brands.

review/summary: Much Healthier Cats Since Switching
review/text: I have two cats with chronic problems. Marci had chronic diarrhea. I took her to the Texas A&M pet clinic. Several tests were run to identify the cause. None of the tests results identified any problems. After I switched to Purina One, her diarrhea cleared with no recurring problems.<br /><br />My other cat, Beauty-Bells, suffered from recurring urinary tract infections. She has not one since eating Purina One. I have not had to buy the formula for urinary tract infections. The regular Purina One formulas have been sufficient.<br /><br />Being on a tight budget with 8 cats, I had long hesitated to switch to food that is so much more expensive. My cats actually eat less. They are also much healthier with shiny, soft coats and more energy. I switched 3 kittens to Purina one and the differences in health were obvious much quicker than with the older cats. I keep threatening to put them on cheaper food because they are tearing up my house with all the energy they have! Of course, I them to much to do that!<br /><br />The switch has been well worth it. Being so happy and amazed with results, I don't think I'll ever feed them anything else.

review/summary: Purina One Sensitive - great for a cat with digestion trouble
review/text: We recently took in a cat that could not keep any food down.  She would throw up multiple times a day, usually within an hour or so of eating.  We thought she may be overeating, so we limited how much food we gave her, we tried to spread out the food to force her to breath and chew between pieces.  We tried many different foods, including multiple foods recommended by the vet.  After a lot of money spent on vet visits and tests, with the vet finding nothing wrong with her, I saw this food and figured trying a food for sensitive systems couldn't hurt.<br /><br />We'd already tried other Purina One formulas without success, so we weren't particularly optimistic, but hopeful.  Our cat has been eating this for about two or three weeks now and she has not thrown up at all.  I love this food, it was hard to watch her throw up so much, and, frankly, it wasn't pleasant cleaning it up so frequently.  I'm glad I found this and fully recommend it to anyone with a cat with similar problems keeping food down.

review/text: My little guy suffered two urinary blockages. For anyone who has gone through this knows how scary it is and EXPENSIVE it is to treat. My vet told me I could keep him on his regular food as he mainly eats wet food but I started feeding him Halo's cat food- the wet chicken formula since it's not as high in protein which caused part of his problem. This dry food is excellent for urinary health issues. My cat has not suffered another blockage since I have had him on this food regularly and he hasn't had anymore UTI's either which I am happy about and hope it continues. And the best part is he loves the food so I didn't have to worry about that either. They use real chicken in this food and there is no by product or fake crap. If you have a cat who suffers from FLUTD or UTI- give this food a try- it works geat!

review/summary: My two kitties love Purina One.
review/text: I have two cats.  They have eaten Purina One for six years now. Their coats are shiny and they both look healthy and have lots of energy. They are both eleven years old.  I started feeding them Purina One because the first ingredient on the label was chicken. There are also no artificial colors or flavors and unlike some pet foods it is manufactured in the United States. Those are enough reasons for me to choose this particular food. I think that even though Purina One is not the best of the best of cat foods, it is a good value for the price, and the cats love it. My male kitty will not eat anything else. A tip for anyone just introducing a new food to your kitty:  Introduce the food slowly by mixing just a little of the new food with the old food.  Increase the amount each time you feed the kitty eventually eliminating the quantity of the previous food.  This will help to alleviate any stomach upset that your kitty may experience from a new food.

review/summary: My cat's favorite dry food
review/text: I have a very picky older cat. She is probably extra picky because she's old and has trouble digesting some cat foods. This one though is her favorite dry food. She begs for it and waits by her bowl one hour before dinner. My other cat also gets very excited about this food. I've found with other foods that they get occasional hairballs, but with this one it's a very rare occasion for either of them to have a hairball- maybe once a year. Previously when I fed them the cute cat foods (like Meow Mix) half of the food would stay in the bowl and the older cat was particularly adept at separating out the shapes she didn't like.<br /><br />Although the price on Amazon is very competitive to buying single bags at the grocery store, I found that the 16 pound bag at Pet Smart goes on sale for $18.99 and the last bag I bought included a $5 Pet Smart gift card. If I only had one cat though I would definitely buy from Amazon for the convenience factor and the price is competitive with Tar get and other grocers.<br /><br />Both of my cats got shinier coats as well since making the switch to Purina One a few years ago. There are several formulas (in addition to this one) to meet your particular cats needs:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEXBCS">Purina One Cat Food Sensitive System, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br />Purina One Cat Food Vibrant Maturity 7+ Senior Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BEXBAK">Purina One Cat Food Advanced Nutrition Hairball Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0QQ">Purina One Cat Food Salmon & Tuna Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDEI7G">Purina One Cat Healthy Weight Management, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0RA">Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BETMEO">Purina One Cat Food Chicken & Rice Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDI0RK">Purina One Cat Food Urinary Tract Health Formula, 3.5-Pound Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Love the packaging.
review/text: I was buying the big 16 lb. bag, but it ended up getting ants in it before I could finish it (even with four cats!).  These individual bags are also wrapped in plastic, so the ants really couldn't find a way in - yay!

review/summary: Food for finicky stomach.
review/text: Purina One is the only food we feed our cat who has a picky (stinky) stomach issue.  She doesn't seem to tire of it and has been eating it for a year.
