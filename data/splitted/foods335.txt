review/summary: Tastes like vanilla
review/text: I did not like this coffee because it tastes more like French Vanilla.  I thought it was Hazelnut.....that is what the title says but it has vanilla in it.  The company was great and exchanged the coffee for me.  Buy this only if you like vanilla taste in your coffee.

review/summary: Nice Hazelnut Coffee
review/text: I would say that the Timothy's Hazelnut coffee has a rather nice flavor.  The coffee is medium mild in strength, probably a 5 on a 1-10 scale for strong coffee taste.<br /><br />I find the hazelnut flavor to be nicely done.  I like Duncan Donuts hazelnut coffee and I find the Timothy's to be a decent replacement to this.  I favor the Timothy's over Gloria Jeans Hazelnut but I am looking forward to trying the Timothy's dark roast hazelnut as I would prefer a slightly stronger brew.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Smooth coffee
review/text: As others have stated, this is indeed a blend of vanilla and hazelnut coffees; that being said, I like this better than any other hazelnut k-cups I've tried, including Gloria Jean's, which tastes incredibly burnt. Far too often large-scale coffee chains burn their beans. As a former roaster, this kills the flavor. Timothy's World Hazelnut is nice and smooth -- and definitely not blackened like the others.

review/summary: Yummy and good price
review/text: I finally bought my man a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas -- we have one at work and Timothy's Hazelnut is one of his favorites. Good price for 2 boxes. Other stores in our area have them around $10.99 for one. It's definitely a "flavored" coffee and not bold, so if that's not your style, go for a bolder brew.

review/text: (I posted a similar review for Timothy's French Vanilla K-cups) Has a mediocre taste but its very weak even when brewed on the small cup setting. Generally, i find Starbucks coffees to be too strong and Duncan Donuts to be too weak. My preference is somewhere in between. Unfortunately, these Timothy's k-cups just taste like water.

Not a bad cup of coffee, but there are others I like better (the Kona blend, the Private blend, the Columbian Dorado, and my personal favorite Sugar Bush Maple (seasonal)).

review/summary: Awesome product
review/text: I have used agave for many things and find that it is a better alternative to sugar.  It will not give you the sugar plunge you get from sugary products.  If you are using this product in beverages please realize that it is not going to give you that same sugary, syrupy flavor that some people are used to from regular sugar or substitutes.  It is a subtle sweetness.<br /><br />I have served this product to friends, and those who are used to a sugary taste in their tea didn't care for it as much as those friends who don't use a lot of sugar.  It really depends on what you are used to.  I have no complaints about this product.<br /><br />Agave is also better for people who have diabetes, as it does not spike blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Don't pass up on trying this great alternative to sugar.  It is worth letting your tastebuds adapt to the subtleness.  It is also great for baking.  Also, this is now labeled as organic, so another reason to try it.

review/text: I bought this in an effort to help myself quit smoking while watching my weight.  Also, I'd been looking for a smaller honey container to use to sweeten my hot tea when I'm at work.  These honey sticks definitely helped.  The honey was very good, the stick/straw seems to be a great way to package it as it doesn't spill out easily.  Plus, each stick is only 15 calories, so you can watch your proportion if that matters to you. I will definitely purchase this again.

review/summary: convenient way of taking your agave with you!
review/text: I was hesitant about this product based on some customer reviews that said there were difficulties opening the little sticks and that they (the customers, not the sticks) got agave all over their fingers... I wonder if Stash read the reviews and changed their packaging?  I have not had this problem, and I'm usually *awful* at opening packaging! With these, I simply bite off the end (gross, I know, but I am a student and I don't/can't carry a knife around with me in my bookbag all day) and squeeze it into my coffee.  It's a great way to have my agave with me because most coffee shops and cafes have not yet started stocking this alongside their poisonous sugar alternatives (you know, those pink, blue, and yellow packets).  Keeps my blood sugar from spiking, sweetens my coffee--what more could you ask for?

review/summary: Smell delightful, taste not so much
review/text: I picked up these honey sticks because I'm in a chai tea phase and thought they'd be nice to add to a simple black tea. Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn't much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I'd much rather just buy chai tea bags.<br /><br />All in all, don't expect it to taste the way it smells.  Far too weak in just a simple black tea, but smells divine still sealed up!

review/summary: Portable Health
review/text: I agree with other reviewers about Agave in general and also specifically this product.  Know that I have a pretty big sweet tooth, and thanks to Agave I feel I'm slowly taming it.  I do find Agave to be sufficiently satisfying -- with the right amount.  And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.  I have not found this to be the case.<br /><br />Regarding the sticks specifically, you do have to squeeze fairly hard and repeatedly to get it all out, and inevitably some gets on your fingers.  However, given the above pluses, in the absence of anything better I'm willing to settle for the drawbacks as opposed to putting sugar or -- quel horreur -- artificial sweetners into my body when I'm away from home.

review/summary: Deceptive Term = "Sticks"
review/text: When I ordered these, based on the description, I thought the honey was somehow hardened into stick-form and thus would 'melt' into a cup of hot tea.  I was surprised when I discovered these sticks were actually thin plastic straws filled with honey!  There is no way I'm going to insert a plastic straw into a hot cup of tea. I'm not sure it would work anyway; I suppose you could cut open each end and then blow the honey in the tea.  Does Stash think you're going to sip on these straws?  I don't know what the company was thinking when they produced this product, other than as a candy to be eaten.<br /><br />I believe the term "stick" does not accurately describe this product and is misleading.  I doubt it's intentional, however.  The Stash Tea Company is an excellent company and has many high quality teas and products.<br /><br />The honey flavored with chai spices is good enough but frankly, it it a very expensive way to buy honey.  Better to buy a jar and flavor it yourself.  I wound up using these Chai Honey Sticks by cutting open one end and pressing out the honey into a tea cup/pot, which was messy and time consuming.<br /><br />I love Stash tea... drink it every morning.  But this product is a bust and I would never purchase it again.

One recommendation for the distributor is to also offer the Sencha Green Tea in the nylon mesh bags. This is what I thought I was getting, and got I believe the same product in a different tea bag. The nylon mesh allows for more mellow brewing.

review/text: Let me first say that I am an AVID green tea drinker. I go through anywhere from 6-10 tea bags a day, so I am always on the hunt for new and better teas. That being said, I had really high hopes for an authentic Japanese Sencha. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of what I got.<br /><br />When I brewed my first batch of this tea, I noticed the very green color, which is hard to find in teas from America. But, when I started to smell the tea as it was steeping, it smelled like something familiar, but I just couldn't put my finger on it. The smell wasn't exactly bad, but it was definitely not how I wanted my tea to smell. Eventually it hit me. This tea smelled like CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP!<br /><br />At first I thought I was crazy, until other people would walk into my house and ask if I was making soup... The taste is very strong, and unusual. Needless to say, I only used about 4 out of the 100 tea bags. I won't be buying again.

review/summary: A nice option to have
review/text: These were an appropriate addition to a baby shower theme.  If you live somewhere where these are not sold, this product is nice to have for your event.  Be advised that weather and shipping conditions might alter some of the M&M's.  It was so with me because I pulled some chipped and broken pieces.  The colder weather they shipped in probably added to the hardness of candy.  All in all, I'm glad there is a customizable option for M&M's.

review/summary: NobodyKnowsWeight=9ozToShip,or~Item1.3Lbs!
review/text: Nobody here really Knows: what's the 'mango powder's pure<br />Weight'(:=X)? - Let's try to find out - from this seller's info:<br />~ Wt1 = 9 oz , - as 'Weight To Ship' [ that's ~270 g ] ,<br />or<br />~ Wt2 = 1.3 Lbs (pounds)~ as 'Item Weight' [ that's ~ 590.2 g ]!<br />Surely: .....Wt1 > Wt2..........(1), - because 'Item Weight' is<br />included in 'Weight To Ship' , - at least it sould be so. -<br />But...Wt1 = 270g &lt; 590 g = Wt2..(2), that contradicts with (1)!(*)<br />- So if they take 590 g , pack it, put in a box to ship, -<br />& then it becomes more than twicely less in weight, - probably<br />they poor out that mango powder & just send to us an empty can(?)...<br />To buy it - everyone wants to know the 'netto' weight (=X?) of<br />this can/jar of mango powder. - Otherway just nobody buy it!<br />If empty 'can with cover' has weight:= Wo, then ...Wt2 = Wo + X...(3),<br />where X is the weight of pure mango powder that I'm trying to find.<br />If an 'empty shipping box with something besides' item that prevent<br />item to be broken, - has weight:= Ws, then ...Wt1 = Ws + Wt1 .....(4),<br />Then from Equations (3)&(4) we transitively have:Wt1 = Ws + Wo + X..(5),<br />where X is the weight of pure mango powder that I'm trying to find<br />yet. Let's suppose that "approximately"  Wo = ~90 g & Ws = ~ 100 g.<br />How "approximately" close is it? - it doesn't really matter. Then<br />from Equations (5)&(3) we have two equations:<br />{...270 g = ~90 g + ~100 g + X ...(6);... 590 g = ~90 g + X ...(7)}.<br />So from the First Equation(6):X=270g-(~100g)-(~90g)= ~80g;-but from<br />the Second Equation(7):X=590g-(~90g)= ~500g,-that's more than 6 times<br />heavier than the same weight X from the First Equation(6)!(**)<br />After both contradictions: (*) & (**) , I just couldn't trust<br />this seller! - I rest my case! - Somebody please correct this seller<br />or amazon's weight arithmetics info or it would look like gypsy 'bazar'?!<br />- Does anybody really know this one mango powder pure weight?!<br />- It looks like only X= ~2.7oz of mango powder is packed in very heavy can<br />with something else heavy - just like such complete waste of my money!

review/summary: Getting More for the Road
review/text: I have tried 'all sorts' of licorice. I would put Tire Tread in the same category as traditional laces/threads/ropes. In that category, this is the most flavorful/moist licorice I have tried. Both me and my wife agree.<br /><br />As some reviewers have noted, it is a little sticky, but I can't see why/how that is a bad thing. The licorice is firm, but not so chewy as to make your jaw sore and literally is bursting with strong licorice flavor.

review/summary: Tire Tread is a Good Name for This Licorice
review/text: Because that's what it tastes like.  Seriously, this licorice is awful.<br /><br />It is sticky.  Some licorice you can hold between your fingers and pop into your mouth.  Not this stuff.  And heaven-forbid you get it near an angora sweater.<br /><br />I also find the texture vaguely unpleasant.  Some reviewers appreciated the softness of the product.  To me it just felt characterless and mushy in my mouth.  Not completely unpleasant, but not pleasant.<br /><br />But more important than the tactile feel of the confection is the taste.  And it gets worse with every bite!  I've had some food items that tasted unusual at first, but got better and better the more I ate.  Not Tire Tread licorice.  Every bite has me sinking further into the taste of the manufacturing of vulcanized rubber.<br /><br />I don't think this candy's problem is too much of a licorice taste.  I've had various licorice products from Europe and Asia.  No, the candy has a vaguely dirty taste, like it's been tooling down the road before hopping in my mouth.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy product!
review/text: I use the rice bran and avocado oil from this company. I have been using using both oils for months and just discovered I can start getting it on Amazon - I am so excited!! The rice bran oil has little to no taste when I cook with it- which I like because it doesn't take away from the taste of the actual food. I have been doing a lot of research on oil smoke point levels and how cooking with oils like olive oil at high heats changes the good properties into bad ones (it basically turns it into a trans fat).  I decided to switch to rice bran or avocado oil exclusively for cooking purposes because they have higher smoke point levels. Now I just use my olive oil for salads and dipping bread etc.

review/summary: Excellent Brown Rice, And So Handy!
review/text: I had a bowl of Cooked Organic Brown Rice for lunch today. The brand was Minsley and I found it at Costco in a packet/box of six bowls. The individual bowls could be microwaved for 90 seconds and then opened and stirred. It couldn't get any simpler. The rice turned out a bit stickier than expected, but no problem. The rice was quite excellent and this is such a handy way of fixing up a bowl! Then, the question is, what do you want with it? Well I had a can of wild sardines packed in extra virgin olive oil and I added most of the oil to the mixture plus a small amount of an Asian hot chili sauce for extra flavor. Very good. Add the quality of the brown Rice ingredients to the sardines in olive oil, and you have a nutritional powerhouse. This is a great product, and so handy. I'll be having it with a lot of other things.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: My two mixed breeds *love* pressed rawhide bones; a good thing as pressed rawhide is supposed to be better and safer for them than the regular kind.  The problem is that pressed rawhide is also a lot more expensive than the regular kind, almost $3 each at the local pet store.  These are about $1.66 each (w/free A-Prime shipping), which is about the same as my other online source in lots of 20 + shipping.<br />Good quality (imho better than the pet-store chews), and the dogs like them.  Only minor criticism I have is that it seems the Q50 bulk price should be a little better than the Q20 price.

review/summary: Great chew, great price.
review/text: I have three power-chewers, and pressed rawhide bones are a must-have around our house. My dogs will quickly destroy cheap rawhides. With the choking hazard presented by bones that come apart too easily, it can be a challenge to find a decent pressed rawhide without breaking the bank. We were paying $5 - $7 a piece for a good quality bone at our favorite pet store. We can go through as many as 5 a week...ouch. Adds up fast.<br /><br />I dug around to try to find a quality replacement that would save us some money and stumbled on these on Amazon. I figured they would be flimsy for the price, but decided to give it a shot. I was astonished at the quality. They are great. These bones last as long as the ones I was buying from the pet store. The price is unbeatable. About a $1.70 a piece. That's a HUGE price difference. Even the box is great. We tear off the front flap, the way the item is pictured, and put the whole thing in a deep drawer in our kitchen. Very handy for us. We average about 1 box every three months. I haven't really counted, but it seems we burn through less of these than the others, too.<br /><br />I am a firm believer that what you don't pay out in quality food and treats for your dogs, you pay out in vet bills, poorer health and shorter life span. So we buy top quality pet foods, etc. I really love it when quality comes with a great price, too. These have made three dogs VERY happy. They've made my wallet VERY happy, too. Excellent bang for your buck! I highly recommend these.

review/text: WORTHLESS - NO GOOD "Enerjets Wake Up Energy Booster Drops, Mocha Mint Flavor - 12 Caffeinated Drops/Pack, 12 Packs"<br /><br />This is $2 (two) dollar candy sold for $30 buck + shippping.  This is this the biggest RIP-OFF product I have ever experienced in Amazon.  This seller should not be allowed to sell products in this site. Amazon is a higher quality of products and much superior than ebay or other sites.<br /><br />The product shipping was delayed by 2 weeks, when it got there it was semi-open (the box) we tried the product and does not do anything AT ALL.  it is simple cheap candy coded with a little bit of mocha some Caffeination so lite it hardly does any ting to boost energy.<br /><br />IF  you have money to waste, or charity money proceed to order this product from this supplier.<br /> WORTHLESS

review/text: Moving from Brooklyn, NY to Phoenix, AZ in 1970 was quite a culture shock.  Only one Italian Deli.  Couple of years ago Progresso stopped making their Caponata... I searched high and low for one that was as good.  Well, I found an even better one, 'Cento' Caponata is great!

review/summary: Near Perfect
review/text: For this review you're going to get two opinions.  Darshan1 and chocolate enthusiast extraordinaire, Darshan's Mom.<br /><br />Darshan says:  As an amateur chocolate consumer, I found this fairly similar in taste to Hershey's Special Dark at first, um, chomp, but after a couple chews, I noticed it's a fair amount creamier and much more satisfying than Special Dark.  I favor milk chocolate (I think Cadbury milk is my favorite) so this was a little bitter for me (it actually is a little stronger than Special Dark), but compared to some 82% stuff that my mom sometimes has where I feel like I'm going to choke for the bitterness, this was quite good.  A very good compromise (in my opinion) if we were going to split a chocolate bar for dessert. I like the fact that it's "Fair Trade" chocolate since a lot of cocoa harvesting involves some harsh child labor practices, and since it's one of the few fair trade brands that I can get at the nearby regular grocery store instead of having to trek to a gourmet store, I'd probably start buying their milk chocolate variety.<br /><br />Darshan's Mom says:  Newman's Own organic dark chocolate satisfyingly combines the creaminess of milk chocolate with the taste of a somewhat mild, but luscious, dark chocolate.  Since it's merely 54% chocolate, the heavenly, bitter tang of 75% to 8o% chocolate is missing.  However, the rich smoothness of the product almost makes up for that.  Being a confirmed chocoholic, I've taste tested chocolate in France, Belgium and Switzerland, the holy trinity of European chocolate according to a local chocolate store owner, but, in order to be perfectly fair, of course, I've forced myself to sample chocolate in Germany and Italy as well. I've made pilgrimages to American restaurants famous for their chocolate temptations, visited a cocoa plantation in Tobago and prepared numerous chocolate desserts over the years.  So, I think I know chocolate.  Yes, for those of us who crave deep, dark chocolate, Newman's Own comes up a little short, but it is surprisingly delicious nevertheless.  Another plus, it's organic.  If it's priced well compared to the better-known European chocolate bar brands, it could easily become one of my top choices for everyday enjoyment.

review/summary: Neither Here Nor There
review/text: What I mean by its neither here nor there is that it is somewhere in between a dark and a milk chocolate. The result is that it lacks the intensity, bitterness and depth of dark chocolate yet is slightly creamier, yet it also lacks the smoothness and sweetness of a milk chocolate. So it really is not my favorite at all. Plus, it has a strange aftertaste that I have difficulty describing. All in all, its very decent and much better than an ordinary Hershey's bar yet is just not satisfying enough that I would want to get it again. I do appreciate the fact it is organic and like the size and thickness of the bar, but I just didn't enjoy it that much.

review/summary: If You Enjoy Dark Chocolate You Will Enjoy This
review/text: Regardless of a food brand's mission statement, it all comes down to taste. I don't drink organic milk because of a concern for cows, but because it tastes so very very good. And I wouldn't buy this chocolate if it tasted more like chalk. Well luckily, it tastes very good for dark chocolate. Even my wife, who while liking chocolate in general does not like the straight stuff, says that this is the best dark chocolate she's tasted.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I sampled some Starbucks in house chocolate last week, and it was noticeably more bitter than this.<br /><br />I would prefer thinner bars, these are a bit hard on the dental work to bite off, but in general a quality product.

review/text: This chocolate bar was so good.  Dark chocolate is my favorite kind of chocolate and this bar didn't disappoint.  To me it tastes like a Dark Chocolate Hershey bar.  This chocolate bar leaves a good aftertaste.  I tasted the chocolate for a good half hour or so afterwards.  It kept making me want more.<br /><br />This bar is 330 calories, a little more than I wanted in one sitting so I divided it into 3 separate servings.  This was easy to do because it's like 6 little squares put together so I just broke them into 3 different bars.<br /><br />I highly recommend these chocolate bars.

review/summary: Dark Chocolate for Beginners (misnamed but tastes good)
review/text: Perhaps they should have given this bar a different name, maybe "Dark Chocolate for Beginners". It is a "Dark Chocolate" bar but with only 54% cacao. It is still more than typical milk chocolate (in the 30s), but it may confuse fans of dark chocolate. This is more of a bridging-the-gap type of a chocolate. For someone coming to this from the off-the-shelf mass-market milk chocolate, this is not as "bitter" as typical dark chocolate, so if you want to eat healthier chocolate, this may be an option. It is also sweet, sweeter than most of the dark chocolates (60%) I recall trying out, and it does not have the "bitter" taste.<br /><br />However, for someone coming to this from the 60% and 70% and 80% dark chocolate, this may come as a surprise, as it is sweeter and it doesn't have the high percentage of cocoa one would expect. Newman also has a 70% "Super Dark" chocolate <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHSQRM">Newman's Own Organics Super Dark (70%) Chocolate Bar, 3.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> but I haven't tried that so I can't really compare. However, the choice of a name (70% being called Super Dark) is a hint that these are perhaps intended more for the mass-market grocery store consumer, not the dark chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, the whole chocolate bar (2.25oz or 64 grams) has 330 calories and it provides one-third of the RDA fat calories and two-thirds of the RDA saturated fat calories. There is 0% cholesterol, 0% trans-fat and only traces of sodium (5mg). Also good is 4g of fiber and 3g of protein, but a jumping up and down 28g of sugars. It is candy after all :-) The cocoa is Rainforest Alliance certified.<br /><br />The bar is made in a way that can be broken in six (probably uneven unless you are careful) pieces, so theoretically you can break it into six servings, which significantly lowers the calories and fat intake. More realistically, one-third of the bar is a reasonable compromise for one person per day, bringing it down to 110 calories with 10% RDA fat and 22% RDA saturated fat. (the numbers are based on the standard 2000 calorie diet found in most of the food labels).

review/summary: Disappointing...
review/text: I just LOVE dark chocolate! The highger the cocoa concentration, the better is my motto. While this bar's concentration is higher than a lot of readiliy available drug/grocery store picks it really doesn't shine for me. There are so many more easily purchased choices out there that are truly delicious. Highlight of this bar? It's Organic and that's important to a lot of people today. Low Point? It has a really waxy consistency that borders on the artificial. Mouthfeel is important to me...if I'm going to "spend" calories eating dark chocolate, I want it to be the most amazing taste experience available. The overall taste is not bad, there is just better to be had. I recommend that Newman's Own go back to the drawing board on this one. Oh, and it's kind of an odd sized bar. Larger than an "individual" bar, but smaller than the average multi-serving bar (in case anyone is interested!).

review/summary: Smooth, not too sweet.  Very good though a bit simple for hard core chocoholics
review/text: Summary: a very good "starter" gourmet dark chocolate for those who aren't into strong flavors...<br /><br />We eat a disturbing amount of chocolate around our house, whether it's Lindt, Ghiradelli, Sees, Cadbury, Toblerone, Scharffen Berger, Godiva or even Hershey's, we've had it.<br /><br />We tend towards the very dark chocolates, although i do have to say we had some Lindt in the 90% range which was just a bit too sharp.  I'm also a espresso aficionado.<br /><br />This chocolate has a very smooth texture.  It's well tempered and starts out quite firm in the mouth, then melts to a very smooth consistency.  It's fairly sweet for a dark chocolate - not as sweet as a Hershey's special dark, but more than other dark chocolates in this range.  54% cocoa gives a much stronger taste than Milk chocolate and here it still has a very creamy finish with no sharp aftertaste.  Still, I found it simply "chocolate" without any accompanying flavors you tend to notice in the stronger chocolates.<br /><br />If you like your coffee black or like cappuccinos then this might be for you.  If you drink Turkish coffee or espresso then this probably won't have enough punch for you.

review/summary: Ethically responsible and organic, but there are other brands to try to figure out what tastes best to you
review/text: I received 1 bar via the Amazon Vine program to review. Let me just say I love chocolate in any form, but dark chocolate is probably 4th down on the list of favorites.  That being said, I find most dark chocolate is either too bitter for my liking, often leaving me with a slight pucker in my mouth and/or a chalky after-taste.  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate was a pleasant surprise on the taste front.  Yes, it's dark chocolate, but no bitter aftertaste.  It's smooth and just sweet enough to remind me of bittersweet chocolate, more than dark.<br /><br />The reason for 4 and not 5 stars has more to do with the price of being environmentally aware.  Perhaps that explains the price hike on this bar of chocolate versus some others?  I love that Newman's company puts a portion of its proceeds back into helping others, and that too may explain the price hike, but I don't have to like it.  Not when other brands are just as tasty and cost much less.<br /><br />Similar chocolate in quality and taste: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV04E">Dagoba Dark (59%) Semisweet Bar, 2.0-Ounces Bars (Pack of 12)</a> focuses too on being environmentally friendly.  My suggestion if you like dark chocolate and want to help the planet, you consider Dagoba, Newman's Own Organics and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUF9CK">Endangered Species Black Panther, Extreme Dark Chocolate (88%), 3-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> for your own head to head taste test to determine your favorite.<br /><br />If you're going to be purchasing your chocolate with the environment and natural ingredients in mind, you should also figure out which one tastes best to you.

review/summary: Chocolate Excellent, Newman's Own Great, But Vine Only Sent 1 Bar
review/text: This is great dark chocolate. It is 54% cocoa which might make you think it could be bitter but it is not at all: it has a very light and enjoyable sweet taste. It also has a very silky texture. I have had almost every expensive dark chocolate out there (me a chocolate addict? Big time!) and I have to say this is one of the nicest surprises--a very nice chocolate, not too sweet, still tastes like dark chocolate but none of the "too dark" taste you often get from expensive chocolates. Also, it's organic.<br /><br />You have to hand it to the folks at Newman's Own, they not only find great products, but they do wonderful work in the world. Paul Newman left a legacy that is far larger than his films: he left the world with a dose of great humanity.<br /><br />That said: The Vine newsletter said this would be 12 bars, I got one. When I wrote and asked why, I got a typical runaround from some "customer service" employee (I think they need to rename this people something that better reflects what they really do which is to, as we said in the 60's, shine you on) who gave me the company line. In other words, our mistake, tough luck. But I take this Vine program seriously and put a lot of time and effort into reviewing products and I think if Amazon is going to ask Vine members to review things fairly, they should treat the people who do the reviewing fairly.<br /><br />But the chocolate, out of this world good. And Newman's Own? Perhaps the best organization on earth.

review/summary: My new favorite dark chocolate bar, organic and "slave-free"
review/text: I tend to prefer darker chocolate -- 65-70%.  So I was expecting this 54% bar to be sweeter or creamier, thus not entirely to my liking.<br /><br />I found this bar neither waxy nor chalky, as some of the darkest chocolates can be. Neither is it quite creamy. Rather, it melts very slowly in my mouth, leaving none of the bitterness of some dark chocolates and none of the filminess, either. I guess you'd call it a clean finish!<br /><br />Neither my palate nor my reporting skills are entirely sophisticated when it comes to chocolate. I can't pinpoint the flavor as being like that of any tropical or tree fruit. And, like most people, I have my preferences and so my opinion is highly subjective.<br /><br />What I can say is that I like this bar very much and will be interested in the other bars in this Newman's line.  I also like patronizing this brand, as they do so much good work through its non-profit efforts.  I also like the fact that it is organic and that, as best I can determine, this is slave-free chocolate.  That is worth paying a few cents extra for, in my opinion.

review/text: As I get older I prefer darker chocolates to the more sweeter milk chocolates I liked as a younger person.  Now I find it hard to get tasty dark chocolates that are made with the quality you would expect for the price.  Dark chocolate in high percentages - 50 to 70% cocoa (or higher) are usually fairly pricey.  If you are planning to look for organic on top of that, then expect to pay even more.  I was very excited to try Newman's Own Organics Chocolate - not only is it a trustworthy brand name, but Amazon's prices make it the perfect fit for my dark chocolate cravings.  I feel a lot less guilty about buying high quality, thanks Newman's... thanks Amazon.

review/summary: Not just organic - environmentally responsible
review/text: This particular chocolate bar was "perfect" in my opinion, since I often find dark chocolate bars to be "too bitter." Instead, this one seems somewhere in the middle, between the REALLY Dark chocolate and the light chocolate. It is smooth, and enjoyable.<br /><br />While the information lists a bar as a "single serving," I consider one square (there are 6 in a bar) to be adequate to meet my desire for chocolate, and still maintain my girlish figure. ;-)<br /><br />Background for those who care about organics, fair trade, and sustainability:<br /><br />Nell Newman co-founded the Organics line back in 1982, and it split from Newman's Own in 2001. The company has a serious focus on organics, and is a member of the Rainforest Alliance, ensuring that the chocolate is not only grown organically, but also in a socially and ecologically appropriate manner. Newman confirms that all chocolate is purchased at fair trade prices.<br /><br />Since the Rainforest Alliance recently issued a joint statement with Fairtrade and UTZ Certified, you can be assured that this chocolate was not produced by slave labor.<br /><br />For most people considering purchasing these bars, this is not an issue, however, I try to be conscious of social issues, and researched this information for those who find it important.

review/text: Like most dark chocolate this bar is not sweet nor creamy; however, it doesn't have one of those "I just gotta have it" tastes to it either.  It comes scored in six squares so you can break a piece off when you're having one of those "I could rip the curtains off the window if I don't get some chocolate," days.  If you are purchasing it because you prefer organic, then you won't hate it, but I'm not really in love with it either.

review/summary: Tasty enough, but too hard
review/text: This 54%-cocoa dark chocolate bar from Newman's Own is tasty enough. Picky chocolate lovers might find it too sweet, but it whacks the craving as far as I'm concerned. I just find it way too hard. It's a quarter inch thick, so it's a solid chunk of chocolate when you bite into it or break off a piece. I've been putting it in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it, but I can see disaster looming there!

review/summary: Decent not fantastic
review/text: This was a good but not incredible chocolate bar. A little too much sweetness masked the chocolate flavors. I've definitely had better but overall its quite tasty.

review/summary: Marred only by initial waxiness
review/text: This is very nice chocolate with a strong, dark-chocolate flavor. The finish is also very nice with a hint of cherry flavor. We compared it favorably to Calibut and Ghirardelli dark, among others. The only reason it loses one star is due to initial waxy texture.

review/summary: An average bar of chocolate
review/text: I love dark chocolate and, in fact, prefer it to the sweeter milk chocolate.  While this was a perfectly satisfactory bar of dark chocolate, it didn't stand out as exceptional in any way.  I'm disappointed that, as of the writing of this, there is no price listed for this product.  My guess, based on the branding and the organic nature of the product, is that this is going to be priced above the average for this size chocolate bar, which would make it more expensive than I'd be willing to pay for a product that was really just average in quality.

review/summary: Good Chocolate & Organic to Boot
review/text: This is good chocolate and I probably would have eaten as much of it as I had.  The only dark chocolate that is better in my experience was some from Switzerland I received for a Christmas present.  The fact that Newman's Own is organic is a nice touch and for some reason makes it seem okay to eat more of it.<br /><br />I don't think you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Chocolate lovers should like this
review/text: I pretty much love any kind of chocolate (other than white chocolate which I can't stand). I enjoy milk chocolate as well as dark chocolate so that may explain why I liked this so much. It seems to me that it is in the middle, between the two in flavor. It doesn't have the totally creamy, sweet flavor of milk chocolate, but doesn't have the bite sometimes associated with dark chocolate (and no aftertaste I sometimes find with dark). Some folks may find that being in the middle equals bland but I found it delightful.<br /><br />The bar itself it a bit bigger than an iPhone and bigger than a Hershey's chocolate bar, but it's not huge. The bar was scored into 6 squares and I ate 3 yesterday and 3 today. I found that amount completely satifying and felt no real desire to eat the entire bar in one sitting -- which is a VERY good thing.<br /><br />The organic nature of the bar also appeals to me since I am trying to be more aware of the chemicals I put into my body. I eat my share of junky food, but am trying to eat more fruits and veggies and this organic bar fits in with that.<br /><br />For anyone that enjoys chocolate, this bar is very, very good!

review/summary: Good dark chocolate, but not great
review/text: It's hard to be critical of dark chocolate. Like pizza and sex, when it's good it's great and when it's not good it's still good. Both of the adults in our family tried this and we're both dark chocolate fans and we had the same "good, but nothing special" reaction.<br />So, this is a good dark chocolate, not great. At 54%, it's one of the lower concentration "lighter" darks out there. I'd probably be a bigger fan of their "super dark" but my guess is it would still pale in comparison to other dark darks from Ghirardelli, Endangered Species, etc.<br />If I'm going for a natural eco-friendly choice, I'd stick with Endangered Species. If I want a premium brand I can find anywhere, Ghirardelli has Newman beat there too.

review/summary: good dark chocolat but a bit sweet.
review/text: This chocolate is good, but it tastes more like a candy chocolate due to its sweetness.  It has a good mouth feel and texture but for "dark" chocolate it tastes a little to sweet.  Packaging is good, and the sample I got was well preserved, not old or dried out like some chocolate bars you get in the store.<br /><br />Overall as a candy or treat this is good, environmentally responsible chocolate.

review/summary: 54% Cocoa Selection That Split Our Household On Taste--Try One Before Making A Big Investment!
review/text: So, I don't really know how to express my feelings over a chocolate bar.  In my household, there is no other choice besides dark chocolate--that's all we do.  Whether it's the conventional Special Dark or the ritzy high end selections, we've tried it all.  I was excited to check out Newman's Own, an organic variation weighing in at 54% cocoa.  When we go upscale, we tend to venture into the 72% range, so I was interested to see the difference.<br /><br />Me:  I liked the bar.  It was appropriately sweet (but perhaps not dark enough) and had a smoothness I enjoyed.  Spouse:  Didn't like it as much as I did.  Not enough cocoa content, rather generic in conception.  Value:  While we split over quality, we agreed that the price tag on this chocolate was probably a bit high.  We've had better alternatives for less--in some cases a lot less!  Obviously, no one is going to hate a chocolate bar--I'd just recommend that you sample one before investing in a large quantity.  Make sure it delivers the bang you require for your buck!<br /><br />3 Stars from my spouse, 4 stars from me--product at 3 1/2 stars.  But since I write the review, I get the round-up!

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: While I prefer German chocolate, this was excellent--not too sweet, the way I like it.  Most American candy is way too sweet.  This was just right.  The "organic" label will appeal to some, but I simply thought it was a quality candy bar.

review/summary: Not Dark Enough :-)
review/text: I love Dark Chocolates so does my daughter, But Newman's Dark Chocolate bar does not have enough coco to make it a true dark chocolate.<br /><br />It tastes like any other milk chocolates that I have tasted before nothing much better, I know these are organic chocolates, But what is so different from others? I do not think you can make chocolates with just inorganic materials!<br /><br />If you love Rich Coco taste you will surely love this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HQNBSU">Lindt Excellence Extra Dark Chocolate 85% Cocoa, 3.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Having said, Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate is okay but for me it was on the sweeter side, I love chocolates that tastes slightly bitter...

review/text: Rich and smooth, with slight crumbly texture. It has a nice balance of dark rich bitterness with a satisfying sweetness. Very creamy mouth feel. An excellent dark chocolate. Very easy eating.
