review/summary: Wake Up To Caffienated Perfection!
review/text: We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as "extra bold" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand.

review/summary: Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups
review/text: I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.

review/summary: the best of the best
review/text: My husband and I are crazy about Coffee People k-cups.  A friend gave us a box of the "Donut Shop" cups and they are spectacular.  Very rich and bold, not bitter, but packs a nice punch.  Reminds me of coffee from an old-fashioned percolator.  A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.

review/summary: A perfect "Anytime" coffee that is sure to please.
review/text: I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites.  The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood.  Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NP30XQ">Green Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend</a>  But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees.  The Dunkin Donut brand.<br /><br />This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand.  Not bold or bitter.  Not weak or under flavored.  It is smooth and very flavorful.  It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night.<br /><br />I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Amazon when you join their club.  A great value.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would change the name by removing "Extra Bold".  It is not.  It is, at most, a medium roast.  Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold.  It comes out great on the medium size setting.  Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner.

review/text: This coffee is exactly what you would get at a coffee shop. Sweet and aromatic, not bitter or too bold. I like the pack of 50 and it comes in one box, so there is no waste of packaging or more trash to throw away. If they only made a box of with 100... We love the K-Cups and get great consistent coffee every day without wasting half a pot. My favs are Timothy's German Chocolate (desert coffee!), Donut Shop (mid Morning) and Emeril's Big Bold Easy (first thing in the morning!).

review/summary: Quality control needed ASAP!
review/text: Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.

review/summary: better than Frappucino -- WOW!!!
review/text: I was very skeptical when first trying the Iced VIA, particularly since, as another reviewer noted, the addition of sugar (NOT Splenda, alas) to the mix is clearly stated on the package.  Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00451WLYI">Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a>), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even though it's now no longer summer, this is still my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.<br /><br />Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I use one bottle, then refill it with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!

review/summary: strong iced coffee just like starbucks worth the $$'s
review/text: i wasn't too eager to be paying $6 to $7 for only 6 packets of instant iced coffee mix at my local safeway supermarket but i had to remember how much i spent at Starbucks just for their coffees and iced coffees and so i wanted to try these out and I'm glad I did because I loved it and realized they were definitely worth the $$'s.<br /><br />I'm not really a coffee drinker (i probably drink 1 cup of coffee once or twice a week max) and only drink coffee when I really need a pickup.  I can't drink coffee straight either and need a moderate volume of milk or half and half in it because the coffee taste is too bitter for me.  I'm ordinarily a tea drinker.  But I love iced drinks in the afternoon or night, especially iced drinks that I can instantly make without having to wait a long time to heat water and having to cool them in the refrigerator or freezer.<br /><br />Each pack contains 6 little packets of starbucks coffee mix powder. It's true as the other reviewer said that you can make 2 to 4 or 5 cups of iced coffee just with one packet so it's really worth the $$'s and really you can just use half or less of a packet to make your cup of iced coffee - the coffee is that strong!!  If it had sugar, I could barely taste it because the coffee was VERY STRONG so I had to add 3 packets of  stevia sweetener packets and 4 mini-moo half-and-half cups.<br /><br />Lately, to make it creamier, I'll take half a packet and dissolve the coffee powder into the water first along with the sweetener, then adding milk, using a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 of water:milk.  Just like Starbucks, add a large dollop of whipped cream on top for a luxurious iced dessert drink.....mmmmmm......

review/summary: saving grace
review/text: I have two Persians and they are quite a chore on upkeep. Well the little boy developed a urinary tract infection last year (a common occurence in persians), so the vet recommended this food, I had used Science Diet or Iams up to this point and had overall been really happy with them. The vet explained that she thought the simple change in the food might help him, she said that all three of those foods were really the best on the market and he probably just had trouble with digesting certain ingredients in the food. So I changed to the Persian 30 and have been very happy, his infection cleared up and both of the cats have experinced less coughing up of hairballs. one other benefit I have noticed is the litterbox smells less.

I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />Maybe someone can explain this phenomena and proof that im wrong?

The types of noodles you use in soup do change the flavor, these enhance the soup flavor. They take a little longer to cook than other pasta but very well worth it. Best to buy online here as 1.00 cheaper each bag if you buy from the store; even cheaper than ordering direct from Manischewitz as they charge the same amount for the bag as in the store plus they charge for shipping (this can be up to $15.00), at a Amazon this item qualifies if you spend $25 or more shipping is free!

I ordered 4 bags - all of which have sell by dates of more than 10 months from now, so I know they are not supposed to be "stale" by Oberto's standards - and they are simply horrible, grizzly, shoe inserts of cardboard with no flavor.  Ironically, I found Oberto by a google search of "tender" and "beef Jerky", and was obviously mislead by someone's spin on this inedible garbage. Shame on Oberto for passing this off as "premium steak strips"; these taste like unwanted slaughterhouse scraps.

I have sent them to my son, he loves this brand better than others, and has never complained it is dried out or tough.  It is beef jerky, it is supposed to be a little tough!  None of the packages have had quick expiration dates, it takes me a couple of months to go through 4 packages (whereas the son takes about a week, or less), first is as fresh as the last.  It is not too spicy, the flavor is meaty, the  pieces are not fatty, like some types I have purchased.  The amazon price beats anything in the grocery, and service is always prompt.

Oberto's other jerkys, it has just the  right mouthfeel - tender enough to chew without that artificial, over tenderized texture that many brands of jerky have.  Beware!!  This will spoil you for any other brand of jerky!!!

review/text: I ordered this "lucky" bamboo to wish myself a good luck with a new job.  But the one I received has two Bamboos bent and knotted to each other into a lovely heart shape!  And when my wife saw it, she almost had tears in her eyes... Hummm...  Bamboos arrived in good shapes and conditions, and  the artificial flowers match very well with the Bamboo.  With included vase and pebbles, they look marvelous. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />Update - It's been almost a year, and this bamboo is still growing and looks beautiful.  It it quite tall now, so I have to trim the leaves once in a while.  And all you need is water and light!  This thing is amazing...

review/summary: Best Cat Food!
review/text: When we adopted our cat, she had spent 9 months in a cage at the humane society.  She was scrawny, cranky, and not happy.  We went to an all natural pet store, and the woman suggested this type of food.  At that store, we paid nearly $30 for a small bag that lasted maybe a month or two.<br /><br />But, this food was like a miricle!  Our cat perked up, started playing, was curious and happy.  Her coat was shining.  She was like a new cat.<br /><br />Something else awesome?  Her poop doesn't smell nearly as bad as it did with regular, crap-filled food.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing.  Why only 4 stars, then?  The price.  This is one of the best prices I've found for this type of cat food, but the brand itself is very expensive.  But, our cat is part of our family, it's worth it.

review/summary: Great cat food, stellar ingredients
review/text: We have a household of 6 cats and they all love this dry food.  The ingredients are wonderful and you tell the quality of the food because it does not contain fillers such as cornmeal which is used in the cheaper brands.  In cat food, you often get what you pay for and although you may feel a bit woof sticker shock with the price of an 111 lb bag .... It is worth it.  You save money on the other end when you buy a food without fillers ... Less feces in the litter box and a lot less odor.  Our cats have coats that are silky soft and they lave this food.<br /><br />I've been a Wellness dray cat food fan for 6 years and they a love it.  This formula has been popular with all 6 cats.<br /><br />Thumbs up!

Her hair is shiny and she has put on a healthy amount of weight. She is no longer anxious and seems so much happier! We are so grateful!

review/summary: My cats are not fans
review/text: I've been switching my cats over to healthier food and it's been a struggle. They love Purina Indoor Formula but any dry food other than that? They refuse to eat. After trying a few different 'healthy' brands, I've settled on this one.<br /><br />It's a pebbled hard food that's probably really tough on an older cat's teeth, so fair warning. It's also smelly as heck. It smells a bit like wheaty cardboard and is the same color. My cats turned their noses up to this for DAYS and I worried that they wouldn't eat it. Now they eat it, albeit reluctantly. It's the cat equivalent of broccoli or brussel sprouts. It's good for them, but they're not enjoying it.<br /><br />I've been giving them the Indoor Health recipe for about a month now, and they eat it, but very slowly and pickily. I supplement their diet with Wellness Core canned food (which they love), and will stick with this a bit longer. It does make a difference in their coats. I have one cat that has dry skin and her coat has been a lot healthier and with no dry skin flakes, so that's a success. Hairballs have gone down to almost nothing, too.<br /><br />I just wish they enjoyed it more!

review/summary: Fixed all my cat behavior issues
review/text: This cat food has been a miracle. I have 4 cats, I had one that would pee on the floor by the door and two others that puked almost daily. Within 5 days of changing the food all these behaviors stopped.  After a month or so, I switched back to the old food to use it up and the behaviors started up again. Needless to say, I took the old cat food to the trashcan and started Wellness cat food again.  I have not and will not change to anything else ever again.  I also have a cat with chronic urinary infections and was having to use science diet prescription food.  It cost a lot but when I learned the junk that was in this food I felt deceived. These issues have also not been a problem on the Wellness cat food.  I have called up all my friends and family with cats and told them to change foods to Wellness!  I would recommend the same to you!

review/summary: Best cat food
review/text: I started buying Wellness cat food after my vet recommended it. I've been using it ever since. My cats are both healthy and both have very soft, thick fur. I recommended it to my parents who had one cat that was losing fur and throwing up. They had always fed their cats cheap food, and when they decided to try Wellness, they noticed a big difference. Her fur started growing back and she was throwing up a lot less often. Their other cat also felt silkier after the change. I don't always buy the best foods for myself, but it's important to me that my pets get the best. The expense is well worth it for me.

review/summary: My cat seems to be the healthiest on this food
review/text: My indoor cat is about 6 years old, and has long hair. Over the years, we tried a bunch of different foods with her: Evo, Merrick (she got gas from merrick...hilarious, but couldn't have been good for her), Newmans, and Taste of the Wild.  She used to have major hairballs, and her fur looked a bit haggard.  When we put her on Wellness indoor formula, she stopped having so many frequent hairballs, her fur looks great, she actually sheds less, and she just seems to be happier and has a more energetic disposition.  I think she likes the taste of this food the best as well -- she just gobbles the stuff down.  It was really strange how this food just seemed to transform her into a healthier cat, but it works incredibly well for her.  I'm really grateful to wellness for making such a great food -- highly recommend.

Even Science Diet Sensitive Skin formula contains corn and she breaks out in a matter of days.  My other cat has a cast-iron stomach and digestive system...Nothing bothers him.  They both thrive on this food.  Yes, it's a bit more expensive than some other brands but with no sales tax and free shipping it's less expensive than buying it at either of the 2 local stores that carry the brand.  As long as I pay attention to the amount I have left in the food bin, I'll continue to purchase it through Amazon with its Super-Saver Shipping. It's worth the price to have healthy pets

review/text: I don't know what has happened to this brand over the past couple of years but it has gone down tremendously in quality. My two cats developed urinary blockages and crystals recently while eating this food. They could have died if I didn't rush them to the vet as soon as I noticed a change in their behavior. One of my cat is at the animal hospital right now as I type this review. I have paid almost $3000 to have both of them treated. I have half a bag left of this product and the vet told me to immediately throw it away.<br /><br />I used to also feed my cats the Wellness wet food but stopped doing so after the recall last year. This product is high priced garbage.

review/summary: High price, but worth it
review/text: I have 4 cats, 2 that just turned a year old, and 2 that are almost 10.  Hathor and Nephrys, my elder kitties, were having bad urinary tract infections, we we had to buy them Pruina Vetrinary UR, which was $50 for an 18 pound bag and only available from the vet.  And they did not like it.  But after trying that and buying them a Drinkwell pet fountain, no more infections.  Great!<br /><br />Then a few years ago I heard about wellness and decided to give it a shot.  We upgraded to a Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain (becuase the resivour is awesome) and started them on Wellness.  Now, no more UTIs, much fewer hairballs, soft sleek kitties, and I much happier owner.<br /><br />The 2 new kitties came to us at 4 weeks old and they both had eye infections and upper respritory infections.  They were on wellness kitten for about 6 months, but then they refused to leave alone the indoor formula, so they are all on the same stuff.  They are both in much better shape, and although Odin has never fully recovered (he is blind and has seizures) Hel is a tiny terror with more energy than I have ever seen on any cat.  I think a big part of that is the wellness.  She is also soft and silky and will attack anyone who walks by her while she is on the cat tree.<br /><br />I would recoment this to anyone to at least try.

He wasn't happy at first with the new cat food but after a bit he turned around and I'm happy to say he has a healthy appetite and coughs up fewer fur balls (as a long hair, he had always left slimies around the house and worse, on the front windowsill where he could gross out passersby). I also have to say that his coat looks really good and I'm glad that this is a better quality diet for him. Very happy that Amazon has this on prime delivery.

review/summary: Excellent dry cat food
review/text: I had researched dry cat food online before deciding to try Wellness Indoor Health for our five year old female calico.<br />For most of her life I have fed her the best food I could find. I wanted a high level of protein, but not extra high as some are recommending. I definitely did not want corn, corn gluten, and all of the grains that even the best of the supermarket foods contain. I wanted her to get the highest level of omega 2 fatty acids I could get for her. She stays outdoors for several hours each day and gets some exercise, I suppose, but she was gaining too much weight.  I tried a weight control food, and for the first time in her life she had problems with hairballs and vomited at night on the carpet.  I took her off of that food and started her on Wellness Indoor Health, even though she is not old and isn't just an indoor cat.  The vomiting stopped almost immediately.  Her fur looks better than ever.  I guess the extra omega 3 fatty acids in this particular formula is the reason.  Her weight has come down, but I have to be sure to limit her food to 1/2 half cup per day, which I space out over multiple feedings. Amazon had the lowest price I could find, including shipping. Having it delivered to the back door was handy.

review/summary: Ok but gave my cat loose stool
review/text: Hah, ok, that is a gross title but it is accurate. I usually feed my indoor cat Eukanuba Senior or Lamb & Rice. She is a bit overweight and has recently started to have what I interpreted as stress or allergy behaviors (lots of meowing, overgrooming on her back legs). So I thought it might be a good idea to give her a more "natural" food. Wellness food got good reviews & recommendations so I tried it.<br /><br />I guess the food was fine, the cat ate it - but her stool was looser than when I fed her the Eukanuba (which is more annoying to clean up and smellier). There wasn't really a noticeable change in the cat's grooming behavior while eating this food so I guess she doesn't have a food allergy after all, or if she does then the same thing is in this Wellness food.<br /><br />For my own sake, once I finished the bag I switched back to feeding her the Eukanuba Senior. Everything in the litter box is back to normal and I also think the cat's fur is softer now. YMMV though - my mom feeds Wellness food to her dog and they both love the results. So maybe your animal's digestive tract would be just fine with this product.

So far so good, but it is just a few days.<br /><br />I may amend this review depending on what Spike does.<br /><br />I am grateful for the free shipping and it is a brand of food that is not sold in my region.

review/summary: Ants
review/text: Six years of having a cat, and have never had a problem with ants, until we tried this food.  Pretty much an ant-free home.  These were very very small grease ants or something, showed up after 2 months, but they could have been there longer, as they were so so tiny. (in the food bag, especially the bottom of the bag, and a lesser amount in our everyday food container; no problems at the cat's dish)<br /><br />Food is stored indoors, on a shelf in a non-food closet.  I suspect that maybe some ants or ant eggs came with the food.  Either that, or there's something in the food that attracts them like flies.  Super super disappointing to lose half a bag of food to ants.  Plus ant cleanup.  Plus pain and suffering.<br /><br />As for the food itself, seemed like pretty good stuff.  The cat took to it after a couple weeks, and we didn't have any serious digestion issues.  Our cat's been a bit picky lately, as in what goes down, sometimes comes back up.<br /><br />If you use this food, be sure to use air tight containers to store it.  As for me, I'll be trying other foods.

review/text: I love the wellness brand. My dog went crazy for the food, so I thought I would switch my cat over to it. Now granted she was on some not so natural ingredence cat food from walmart. She was not and is still not a fan of this food. However, I know this brand is very good and healthy for her. I still purchase it, but get the cheaper, "junk food" treats to keep her happy. We all need to splurge on some junk food every once and a while!

review/summary: review on Wellness Dry Cat Food
review/text: I purchased this cat food after reading how much better it was for my cat then Science Diet or the other comparable dry cat foods that are found in pet stores. When I first tried it out, I mixed it with her regular dry food and over the course of a month gradually increased the new food and reduced the amount of the old food. Occasionally she threw the food up but by the time she went to the new food alone, she was throwing it up regularly.  I have put what was left (3/4 of the bag) in the garbage and will never order it again.

review/summary: My cat got a UTI while eating this food exclusively
review/text: For the money I pay for this food, I would expect my cat to be in great health. However, after about a month or so of being on the food we saw that the cat was in distress. She was rubbing her butt on the carpet and attempting to pee several times an hour with no or very little success. Her urine had blood in it. We took her to the vet and she has a urinary tract infection. They say you get what you pay for but I think in this case you do not.

review/text: Do not buy Crunchies products in the Hot summer months.  They are heat sensitive. As the packaging states "IMPORTANT- STORE IN COOL DRY AREA". The two cases I purchased arrived chewy and clumped together.  They probably cooked during shipping and are not a "Raw Food" and not as "Nutritious" anymore.  Two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened.  Amazon.com does not accept grocery returns.  It was a waste of $40.

review/text: I like this snack, though it is not without its negatives. First, it is expensive... but then again it is suppose to be healthy, so that's a plus that makes up for some of the expense. Also, it seems like a good snack for kids. However, sometimes there is an unpleasant flavor with the "Tropical Fruit" flavor. It is not pleasant when you get a bad piece of dried fruit in your mouth. I also tried the "Organic Strawberries" and like those better, probably giving them a 4 out of 5. The strawberries are good to eat with dark chocolate.

review/summary: don't buy for travels
review/text: I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food.  However, they are a decidedly poor alternative for travels, since most of the outer coating of the fruit turns into very messy powder.  The strawberry flavor is slightly less of an ordeal in that regards but still messy.  They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.  I've bumped it up from two stars to three, however, after considering how they keep the enzymes intact and don't add sulfites.

review/summary: Really good - little powdery but good
review/text: These taste wonderful.  They are a little powdery, which is to be expected since they are freeze dried, so don't breathe in as you're eating.  Fresh blueberries are better, but these are very good.  I saw a few reviews that mentioned everything arriving as powder, but mine arrived in good shape.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that the only ingredient is blueberries.  There's no sulfur (which I'm allergic to) or corn syrup.  These are good in cereal and as a snack, though you might want to have some water on hand in case you breathe in some blueberry dust.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

If you're going to a festive occasion, or on a big date, or thinking of using it for your lunch break, stick with Sensible Foods Cherry Berries. But if you're at home, or somewhere where you wont mind getting a little messy, try this. The price is well worth it.

review/summary: Best of the freeze dried, and my whole families favorite flavor
review/text: I started buying these as a "to go" snack for my baby/toddler who is allergic to a lot of stuff.  He loved fresh mangos so I selected this flavor.  Now he loves these so much, he seems to object to fresh mangos.  Now the whole family loves them.  We buy all the other flavors (except blueberries, tried them once -- they'd be okay for baking with, but not a great snack).  I've tried 2 other brands of freeze dried foods and I'd say Crunchies brand is the best -- size of pieces, texture/look of pieces, flavor.  Only improvement would be for it to come in a large cannister size too, and even the 1.5 ounce would be better if it was in a hard sided container like "Just ___________" brand (also okay, but more shrivled up, less like airy).<br /><br />Good Job Crunchies!

review/summary: Low Calorie, Nutritious and DELICIOUS...what more could you want?
review/text: I was at Costco one fine Saturday afternoon when they were handing out samples of the Mixed Fruit Crunchies. I was immediately struck by how flavorful they are! Crunchy, and crisp, not leathery like most dried fruit. On their own they are a fun snack for kids and adults alike. I've also discovered that they make great flavoring agents for frostings, truffles, cakes, etc. I used a mortar and pestle to turn, for example, the strawberry Crunchies into a powder, then used that for the Triple Berry tea loaves and the Strawberries & Cream truffles I made during the holidays. The intense, refreshing, true fruit flavor is what I love about these. And the crunch, but then I'm a texture person!<br />p.s. the other reviewer: It's the banana crunchies you think aren't good, I would bet money on it. My daughter doesn't like them either.

review/summary: Stale and Poorly Packaged - No Reply from Manufacturer
review/text: I've bought these pineapple Crunchies in my local grocery store and they were good (though very expensive at about 6 bucks per serving). So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply. I think the Crunchies people are selling Amazon bad batches. Avoid these at all cost!

review/text: Crunchies Blueberries are my new favorite snack. Mine arrived whole and in good condition. There was some blueberry powder at the bottom of the bags, but this is only a problem if you love them as much as I do and insist on sifting through the powder to ensure you get every last blueberry. I haven't tried rehydrating them, as I like them crunchy, but my experience with other freeze-dried items is that they rehydrate well. Incidentally, freeze-dried blueberries are a lot cheaper than dried blueberries, but they retain almost all of their nutrients unlike regular dried fruit.

But they kept him very happy for a while.

review/text: I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added.  I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?

review/text: Ok, so I have never had freeze dried pineapple before, so I am not sure if they are "good" compared to other freeze dried pineapple. But I found them weird. I mean, they taste like pineapple, but they were not crispy-crunchy like freeze dried strawberries, corn, peaches, and other fruit I have had. The texture of these are not like anything I've had before. As first bite, they crunch a little. Then as your teeth sink in, they are kinda hard-chewy, like those hard caramels. I guess they are just not what I was expecting, based on my other experiences so I was disappointed.<br />I don't think they were damaged in shipment, as it wasn't melted together in one big clump. They were still all individual pineapple chunk pieces.

review/summary: These are delicous
review/text: These are delicious, they did not last long. I brought them into work and between me, my coworkers and a 5 year old, they were gone. The selection of fruits in the mix is well balanced and they are easy to take with you (if you get the chance) in the bags.

review/summary: Crunchy? More like stale  O.o
review/text: Usually I buy freeze dried pears from whole foods but it costs an arm and a leg so I was SUPER excited to see this available at a decent price.<br /><br />Disappointment doesn't even come close...The pears weren't crunchy in the slightest bit, more like stale and chewy in such a way that it brought about a slight "ick" factor. I was expecting the same quality as Whole Foods (my mistake) but when I opened the bag, it looked like someone had taken a pear slice and crumbled it like a paper ball and dried it.<br /><br />We got this to have healthy snacks on hand but no one in my house can get over that slight "ick" taste and no one will eat it. Whatta waste :(

review/summary: Everything you could want!
review/text: I bought these for my wife who loves anything strawberry. First of all they must lie about the calories because they are very tasty andd sweet. They are not crunchy, by rather they are light and airy. The packages are small, but a great snack and there were twelve of them. That brings me to my recommendation for you to order two boxes, because I just put in an order for a box for my wife. She will be pleased.<br /><br />Also, try the other flavors, I love the pineapple. I was able to buy this set with a coupon that made them a real bargain.

review/summary: Taste great!
review/text: I bought these for my 12 month old son. He loves blueberries so I thought these would be great to have on the go or when we don't have fresh berries to eat. They're a little crunchy then the other kinds they make, and do stain your hands, but they still taste great.

review/summary: not what i expected
review/text: I understand the benefits this product offers, but what it lacks is taste appeal. Kind of like eating a little bit of flavored air. It is lacking a palatable texture. There is some flavor, but not what I expected. Very costly per ounce,$3 for 1.5 oz. It may take8-10 lbs of fresh fruit to make 1 lb of crunchies, but for flavor, texture, and cost, I will definately buy 8-10 lbs. fruit. Sorry I am unable to return the other 5 bags.

review/summary: CRUNCHIES IS DISAPPOINTING
review/text: I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there. This snack says it's made in the USA, while most others are imported.  One 1.5 ounce package has 150 calories, which makes it about average on the calorie scale.  "Crunchies" freeze-dried pineapple snacks are not chips, like other freeze-dried pineapple snacks.  "Crunchies" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store.  The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy.  But to me, the flavor was a little bit off.  I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple.  The package states that the only ingredient is "pineapple," so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off.  I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.  A third package was the same.  I will not be buying this product again.  If you are looking for a tasty freeze-dried pineapple snack, I recommend "Funky Monkey" or "Crunchy N Yummy" which are both sold by Amazon.

review/summary: you're lucky if you get all the fruits mentioned
review/text: besides purchasing this at the groceries, i ordered twice on Amazon hoping that this product would improve. there is an unequal amount of fruit distributed in each package. out of the six packages only one actually contained mangoes. also, there must literally be only 5 chips of bananas in each package and i have already gone through about 20 by now. the strawberry chips easily get pulverized so if you think you are missing them in your pack, they may already be turned into dust at the bottom.<br /><br />now why, oh why do i still buy them (at the grocery)? my toddler likes the banana chips and mangoes (we now buy the mangoes separately which is another hit and miss on quality). what doesn't get eaten by the little one gets thrown into my breakfast cereal or oatmeal so nothing goes to waste. so for that i'm giving it 3 stars.
