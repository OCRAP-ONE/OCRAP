review/text: I ordered the One Dozen Long Stemmed Rainbow Roses for mothers day for my wife, only to have her receive a dozen tulips. Not roses, and the tulips lasted 3 days.... barely.<br />They did make good and give me a complimentary order but still the fact that it happened, well I don't see how hard it is to keep orders right.

review/summary: For My Husband's Birthday
review/text: My husband had to be away from home on his birthday and I wanted to do something special for him.  I decided to send him a dozen long stem roses for the first time in 25 years.  My husband is motorcycle riding, mountain climbing kind of guy, so were the flowers a BIG hit... Well, probably not, but he did feel loved and remembered on his birthday and that's all I wanted.  The flowers came on time and as pictured (once they were placed in the vase).  Girls... don't be afraid to send your Guy some flowers.

review/summary: Great for Gluten-Free Diabetics!!
review/text: Wow!  I was surprised by the negative reviews because I think Miracle Noodles are great!  Yes, the liquid in the bag they come in has a strange odor.  Yes, the texture may seem a bit off-putting for some.  But for someone like me who can't eat normal pasta, these truly are a miracle noodle.  The garlic flavor in particular gives a nice mild taste to the noodle.  If you put a bit of Earth Balance (or butter, etc) on them, the salt helps to balance the flavor.  The texture is kind of chewy, but I would not compare it to a jellyfish like a previous reviewer!  I have tried seaweed noodles before, and THOSE taste and have texture like jellyfish.  If you are simply trying to low-carb diet, I don't know that I would recommend these.  Or, if you are gluten-free only, I don't know that I would recommend these.  However, I am gluten-intolerant and pre-diabetic, and I have had to stop eating grains entirely, and these are the only "noodle" I can eat.  At 30 calories and 6 grams of carb per bag, my blood sugar doesn't spike, and they keep me quite full!  For anyone with similar medical problems as me, I would definitely recommend trying them.

review/summary: no garlic flavor
review/text: I really like Miracle Noodles but was disappointed by this variety. There was no garlic or herb flavor.<br />The directions include the same rinse and parboil steps as the other varieties, doing it for a shorter<br />time, and maybe that is what washed away any garlic/herb taste. On opening the bag, there was the usual fishy<br />odor but no garlic smell then either and with that odor I cannot imagine skipping these steps. Also, these are<br />the fettuccine style and I prefer the spaghetti or angel hair type. Some people might also find the color<br />unappetizing--a dull greenish brown, kind of like ripe avocado skin or baby diarrhea. I will stick with the<br />other varieties.

review/summary: Good eating but not effective dieting
review/text: I like these noodles.  They do not have the texture of pasta, but I grew up in Japan often eating osoba with these type of noodles, so it was very familiar.  They also taste good with marina sauce and cheese.  However, my body is not fooled by them.  Less than an hour after eating a package, I'm hungry again.  I tried having two packages at once, and I still get hungry.  So they're a nice treat, but not helpful in trying to control my calorie intake.

review/summary: Miracle Noodles - DISGUSTING
review/text: I was very excited about the prospects of a noodle that had zero carbs, so much so I ordered 2 types of the noodles and the rice as well. I even invited a host of freinds to come over and enjoy the meal I was going to make thinking I just embarked on a new discovery only to find out and experience one of the most disgusting and foul smells once i opened up the package. As much as I wanted to beleive this could be true, given the videos I watched on the products and that other testimonials raved about how good the product was, I held my breath, rinsed the product thoroughly, followed the instructions and was thoroughly disgusted; the texture was mushy and it was axful!!!!! I wrote the company to see if they would refund my money but to no avail - I spent a lot of money only to throw the noodles and rice out in the garbage. VERY DISAPPOINTED and DISGUSTED!

review/summary: Poor Condition, old/expired
review/text: I purchased these because I had them at a friends house and couldn't find them anywhere else. I was on a new years resolution diet in January so I had them for a week or so after I received them. When I opened the candies, I noticed that they had a film over them like I have seen before on old chocolate. I don't see any sort of expiration date, and I don't know if they even do expire, but I think this age affects the flavor, texture, and consistency. The M&Ms were also 50% broken, which had nothing to do with packaging because it was packaged well. It just was not handled well before that point it seems. Overall I was a bit disappointed. Especially after I had been looking forward to a smal treat after the diet I did.

review/text: NO MSG. NO SALT. Only natural spice ingredients. But... and here's the amazing thing... it tastes great! We use so much of the various mixed blend Spice Hunter seasonings that we buy this stuff by the box at The Spice Hunter online. As someone who is allergic to MSG and sensitive to too much salt, this seasoning is perfect.<br /><br />I also recommend:  the Fajita seasoning (btw, the Mexican seasoning is also good in fajitas), the Steak Grill & Broil Seasoning Blend, the Seafood Grill and Broil Seasoning Blend and the Chicken Grill and Broil Seasoning Blend.  These blends are excellent and will SAVE you TIME when cooking. [FYI - I only recommend Spice Hunter BLENDS, not their single spices (e.g., garlic powder) because the single spices are too expensive to justify the cost in my opinion.] Recommended!

review/text: I have coffee every morning and I have been using Agave because I am Diabetic and it doesn't raise my glycemic index.  Some days, I have 2 cups.  I realized that Agave has 60 calories per tablespoon; therefore 2 cups of coffee daily I automatically acquired 120 calories.<br /><br />I sampled Zero at New York's 1st GreenFestival.  This after I put Stevia in my necessary morning coffee. Stevia has a taste that I cannot tolerate. And, I will not use artificial sweeteners although nutritionists recommend these to people with diabetes.  I would rather drink coffee unsweetened -- until now.<br /><br />Zero tastes like sugar only a little less potent.  It has No after-taste!  No chemicals!  The fact that it has 0 calories and doesn't raise my glucose -- I was ecstatic! Finally something not a chemical, that sweetens enough to satisfy, and no calories or affect on my diabetes.<br /><br />Now if we can only get it in the stores!!!<br /><br />Thanks Wholesome.

The  flavor is really overwhelming, too strong. The second time I prepared it I added more regular flakes to soften the flavor, but the texture was still unpleasant when compared to the real homemade one, and then it is hard to calculate the amount of liquid to add, unless you make a whole 2 or more servings of the regular mashed , which would be too much.<br />As a life saver if you crave sweet potatoes and don't have them I guess is OK, but I would not substitute the real one if you have time to get them and cook them and mashed them. I would never use this i.e. for a nice Thanksgiving dinner, when you NEED the sweet potatoes to treat your family and friends

review/summary: For dried potatoes this is a more than an acceptable alternative
review/text: I am not sure I understand why this product got such harsh reviews. I bought this because I love sweet potatoes but can't keep count of how many times I bought real potatoes only to throw them away because we didn't cook them quick enough to stop them from become soft and starchy. So I keep a few of these boxes in the house as a staple.<br /><br />As a rule I generally lighten up the liquid called for just a little bit and use one of the non margarine alternatives like earth balance or earth smart etc in lieu of butter or margarine. I like these quite a bit with a nicely grilled steak or chicken, etc. Are they as good as real sweet potatoes, no, but they are yummy enough to keep in the house for a quick an easy substitute, when you are hankering for a sweet potato but don't want to jump in your car to go buy fresh.

review/text: I bought a box of these on impulse at my local grocery store, and they sat in the pantry until the day came that I needed a side dish that wouldn't take much time to prepare.  My family loved them!  I'm sure they are not as good as the real thing (having never actually mashed sweet potatoes) but for a quick side we found them to be yummy and nicely seasoned.

review/summary: These are terribly artificial tasting and way too sweet!
review/text: I expected something that tasted along the lines of baked sweet potatoes, but instead I got a pot of orange glop that went straight to the trash. I followed the directions exactly and what I ended up with didn't look so bad at all.  The taste, unfortunately, was more like glue paste sweetened with chemicals. These seemed to taste like they were meant for going into a pie, as the sweetness and spicing leans in that direction. However, one look at the ingredients and there are no natural spices whatsoever. I wouldn't use this for pie unless you were making it for people you didn't like!!

review/text: I'm glad I bought one box of the Mashed Sweet Potatoes before buying a 12 pack of it from Amazon. My daughter made the mashed sweet potatoes following the box directions. The sweet potatoes looked just like the picture on the box. Looks can be deceiving though:  the Betty Crocker Mashed Sweet Potatoes had a funky texture and a bad after taste. I ate my serving and told my daughter she did an excellent job preparing the potatoes as I didn't want to hurt her feelings. In truth, this is a very poor product and not up to Betty Crocker's normally high standards of prepared food mixes.<br /><br />Two star rating based on ease of preparation.<br /><br />Do not recommend.

review/text: I don't understand how anybody could think that these are too sweet or too spicy. There is absolutely no sweet or spicy taste.<br /><br />I bought them in hopes I could make a quick side dish that resembled sweet potato casserole. Prepared exactly per directions. They were bland, sticky, and had terrible after taste. They tased like cardboard.<br /><br />I think it is the russet potatoes that are mixed in ?? I tried adding cinnamon, brown sugar, more butter, and cream. There was no amount of doctoring that could save them. My family tasted and YUCK was the resounding response. They went straight to the trash.<br /><br />I should have just bought real sweet potatoes, mashed them, and added in the extras like I always do.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I am from the south and I am used to eating my sweet potatoes in casserole, pie, or piled high with butter, brown sugar, marshmallows and cinnamon. I tried ! I wanted to like them !

I used the mix as directed but added a few extra things like brown sugar and marshmallows. It was a hit! Since I can't find it in any stores in my area I bought the 12 pack to make sure I have them when I need them. This product may not be for everyone. Unfortunately, I am not a cook and have never cooked with sweet potatoes so I can't compare this product to the real thing. One thing that I do know is that I will continue to purchase this item as long as it is available and my family will continue to enjoy it.

review/summary: Be the best elf mage you can be
review/text: You remember all those Do the Dew commercials with people doing all sorts of extreme things after drinking a Mountain Dew? Truth in advertising would be more like this, a bunch of people sitting around a table at a coffee shop, tall glasses filled with a clear, faintly chartreuse bubbling liquid and chunks of ice. In front of them on the table are sheets, maps that will help you through an imaginary dungeon laid out so that the prisoner monsters are running free in a labyrinth, oddly shaped dice, pencils and lots of paper. If there are women at the table, they are out numbered by men. They are drinking their Mountain Dew, and empowered to be the most powerful mages, thieves and clerics you've ever met. This is serious business, and Mountain Dew, with it's higher than average for a soda amount of caffeine is what these adventurers need to prove how great they are. It's liquid magic, it's the fuel for great things.<br />It's Mountain Dew! You can't be a good sorcerer without Mountain Dew! Even the people who have gone with technology away from dice and paper have it by their side as they explore their dungeons using their computers.<br />If you're a purist, I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Z5XW4I">Mountain Dew Throwback</a> instead since it is sweetened with sugar.<br />ETA: The flavor is citrus-y, but not a clean lemon lime. Maybe something more exotic like the very strange looking Buddha's Hand mixed with lemon, lime and grapefruit. The higher than average amount of caffeine before high caffeine sodas and energy drinks were common helps account for it's popularity.

review/text: This is great stuff, all of the Pace salsa's are wonderful, however I tend to steer away from the really hot stuff. I ordered my salsa from a place that depending on what you read is either called Great J & P Trading Company or Real Nerds J&P. In any case the name should have warned me. At my local small town Nevada already over priced grocery store the salsa cost per ounce was 0.12 cents, at this Amazon store it was 0.20 cents per ounce. This is real money at 76 ounces. My fault for not checking and will not make that mistake again. The other issue was the expiration date at the market was Dec 8 2012, and from "Real Nerds" it was May 8 2012. A month a two days from today. So it costs more and has been sitting on the shelf for 7 extra months. I know &lt;...> says it will last unopened for 12-18 months, it is still annoying to me. So lesson learned.

review/summary: Exquisite.
review/text: Unquestionably the most refined of teas, Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian (West Bengalese) Himalayas close to the Nepalese border, 7000 ft above sea level. Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called "Darjeeling," tea must have been grown and processed in that particular region.<br /><br />Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or "flushes": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.)<br /><br />This particular tea from Milikthong Estate is about as refined as you can get when it comes to Darjeelings (and hence, to tea culture in general): an exquisite, highly aromatic single-estate Finest Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe (FTGFOP), i.e. a tea of the much sought-after, supreme whole leaf grade containing a particularly high content of delicate, quick-steeping, golden-orange "tips," the very ends of the bud's leaves, which constitute a guarantee of quality. (The higher the content of tips, the higher the quality; and to qualify as FTGFOP, a tea must have a particularly high portion of tips.)  The addition of the number "1" designates it as one of the finest in its category.<br /><br />This is a tea for truly special occasions ... for a treat, there's hardly anything better than a cup of this, a good book (or a good conversation) and a plate of scones or other little afternoon tea cakes. Enjoy!

review/summary: Nice flowers at a good price
review/text: I've ordered ProFlowers tulips several times over the past few years and have been well satisfied with them.  As with any ProFlowers selection, they will arrive in a green box brought by a private carrier (UPS and others).  ProFlowers times these tulips (and most other bouquets) to arrive "in bud form" so don't despair if they look only partly open; that's how they are meant to look.  They will also be thirsty, so soak the stems in fresh water for a good many hours, recut them and arrange them in the vase with cold fresh water and the powdered floral extender provided.  You'll have the fun of watching them perk up and bloom over the next couple of days.  Tulips, alas, do not last as long as lillies or roses, but one way to keep the charm going is to cut the stems VERY short after a few days, when they start to flag, and put them in short container(s) like cubic vases or even votive-candle holders.  Don't forget to introduce the second packet of floral extender.<br /><br />Tulips are tricky little devils, being both phototropic and heliotropic (moving toward sun and any light).  Even the little seven-watt night light in my kitchen exerted enough of a pull that a whole bunch leaned toward it while soaking overnight.  The trick, as with a recalcitrant house pet, is to let the tulips think they're in control -- keep the retainer collar for the initial soak.  The included "free" clear glass vase is most likely a ginger-jar form and is well-suited for the tulips, which have the undeniable charm of being both rustic and severely elegant, and can look good in almost any kind of arrangement in almost any kind of setting.  I definitely think fifteen tulips (as pictured) is far preferable to a mere dozen, especially since classic floral composition is based on odd numbers, not even.  At the time of this writing (5-7-2012), nineteen ninety-nine for the bouquet is a very good price.  There is an extra charge for shipping, though, and possibly local tax.<br /><br />I can't help but notice that many of the negative reviews toward ProFlowers' bouquets are based on misunderstandings, especially from people who expected the flowers to look as fully formed (and arranged??) as they do in the publicity photos.  Amazon does not provide enough background information about the ProFlowers process, in my opinion, but you can scope that out by going to the proflowers dot com site and clicking on "Flower Care" below the featured offerings.  Once in a while you can get a better deal at that site, too.

review/summary: Truth in advertising...
review/text: When a company states something outrageous on a product's packaging, I want it to be true--or else why say it? Here's the statement, which concludes a brief descriptive paragraph of Tazo Calm's delicate complexity: "There's also a bit of magic involved, but it's really nothing we can talk about."<br /><br />I love such bold, yet subtle braggadocio--"a bit of magic involved" just sets up, well, a strong mental suggestion (reaction?). Since I'm of the fey people, I had to taste this magic! Had to! I was/am not disappointed! I love this tea. Allow me to count the ways:<br /><br />*Since it is herbal tea, milk or cream is not necessary, nay insulting. Just as a drop of water opens up the complexity of a good scotch, a very small amount of sugar/sweetener opens up the complex subtlety inherent in this blend of chamomile, hibiscus, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, licorice root, sarsaparilla, lemon balm leaf. Not surprisingly, then, Tazo Calm suggests a fine, subtle scotch on the tongue. I love this connection with my favorite spirit!<br /><br />*Even the color of the brewed tea appears subtle. To begin, there's the regular brown color of tea. Add a hint of rose from rose petals, and the magic (in this case) is explained. Perhaps...<br /><br />*In addition to the subtlety of scotch, there's also a hint of exotic. What has a more exotic flavor than blackberries (my favorite fruit flavor)?<br /><br />Perhaps Tazo Calm doesn't present a history to other tea drinkers, but Tazo and I--we connect, oh we connect (as George Castanza would say) Yet another connection!<br /><br />Tazo Calm also works as a relaxer. How and why, I don't know, maybe the chamomile? At any rate, Tazo Calm is a wonderful tea to have in the tea section of your pantry, at the ready for those uncomfortable times when sleep eludes. My tea is kept in its own separate drawer.<br /><br />So, really, why does Tazo Calm work? I think it's that "magic" at play....

review/summary: Nice Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Calm Herbal Infusion is a nice chamomile tea. I taste the chamomile and some flavorings, and they are not unpleasant, just hard to pin down as to what they are besides the chamomile. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />The ingredients in Calm are: chamomile flowers, hibiscus flowers, spearmint, lemongrass, rose petals, blackberry leaves, safflowers, peppermint, sarsaparilla, lemon balm, licorice and natural flavors. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a soothing blend of chamomile blossoms and other relaxing herbs." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Calm as "creamy, floral, minty, toasty, sweet, honey-like. As the name gently implies, Tazo Calm has a lovely floral bouquet with an apple-like flavor and distinct toasty notes.  Naturally sweet in a nice light way, with a smooth finish". Tazo describes the aroma as "minty, hay like, rose". I don't taste all of these various flavors, but I do taste the chamomile, and it is fine, not overwhelming or as artificial tasting as several of the other Tazo teas I've sampled.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Calm gets only four stars.<br />****

review/text: I love the description of this tea--egyptian chamomile and moroccan rose blossoms--I wish I could taste or smell either of these flavors!!  This tea mainly tastes like mint and hibiscus--neither of which is particularly soothing in my book.  As compared to the wonderfully complex African Red Bush or the dazzlingly subtle Lotus, this one is not in the same league!! A middle of the road herbal tea.

review/text: I've been using Satin Ice for a year now on my cakes.  I purchase it from local bakery supplies stores as well as online.  It is nice and smooth, soft and pliable. It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier.

review/text: First of all, these little cans are NOT fine dining.  It is, after all, a $2.50 snack.  That said, for $2.50--I love these things.  Great on a chip or a cracker for a little snack or pre meal appetizer.  I love the review that said to use it on Beef Wellington--which is a GREAT idea.  If you think you are going to get a fine piece of French Foi Gras, do not buy this.  If you want a great little Grocery Store quality can of spread that is fine to serve at parties or for snacking with a glass of wine, some cheese, and various things on crackers--This is perfect.  My wife and I like to have what we call "pick up dinners" where we buy some meats (like Cappacola) and cheeses and make some hummus, and get some french bread (cuban bread) that we make into crustini and maybe some olives or tapenade and set them out on ice packs on the counter and just nibble all evening.  I love to have a can or 2 of this for this type of meal.  It is great when watching a movie on a slow night!  Sometimes I just eat it out of the can for a low carb snack, light lunch, or even a midnight munchie.

review/summary: OK, I can die a happy man now.
review/text: While shopping my local Indian Grocery, I had robotically reached for a tin of Rajah Hot<br />Curry Powder and when I took my armful of treasures to the register, the owner looked at<br />me sort of weird like, shook his head and motioned me back down the aisle where I had found<br />the curry powders. He then took the Rajah out of my hand, and replaced it with a tin of<br />Bolst's. I always feel like an invading army in that store, so I didn't complain.<br /><br />In summary, I have used Rajah, Ship's, Crosse and Blackwell, and others and by far this is<br />my all time favorite. The aromatics are wonderfully savory, and this blend morphs into a<br />beautiful orange gravy that is a pure blessing to shrimp, fish, or chicken. This curry doesn't<br />have the full out blast of heat that Rajah's has, its there just not as intense. The flavor<br />is more complex, and the sweet savory aftertaste provides a nice buildup to the warming<br />sensation you feel all over your body about 5 minutes after scarfing down your first 6-7<br />bites. Its highly addictive.<br /><br />If you are unfamiliar with the healthy side benefits of eating curry, they are many and legend.<br />Turmeric, often the main ingredient in curry that gives it a yellow or orange color, is a strong<br />anti-inflammatory which cleans and restores the liver. As a result of these qualities, it is also<br />helpful in treating arthritis. Turmeric has also been touted as a possible cure for Alzheimer's<br />disease, cancer, lowering cholesterol, and heart disease. Additionally, chilies are a documented<br />healthy heart agent by cleaning out plaque in the arteries. Brits even believe curry blocks hangovers<br />by absorbing alcohol in the stomach. This is the primary reason English curry parlors stay open after<br />the pubs close to accommodate the after-hours crowd.<br /><br />This 3.5oz tin can be had for under $3 locally. If you are a fan of this style of cooking I implore<br />you to toss out that jar of stuff you found at the chain grocery, and seek out something more<br />authentic. You'll be pleased for your efforts.

There are other complaints of mold on here, which shouldn't even be a problem if they are STORED CORRECTLY. These cookies are all natural and need to be refrigerated. I guess no matter how many times people complain to Amazon about getting moldy cookies, they still aren't correcting the storage situation!! So that really bothers me, and I don't think I'll be ordering any more of these until they fix the problem. It's quite disgusting.

review/summary: Healthy? Yes.  Tasty?  Not so much...
review/text: I bought this product based on reviews that I read here on Amazon.  Generally, this method for buying products has proven beneficial for me.  However, this go around I was a bit disappointed (not completely though).  I had been looking for a tasty, on-the-go replacement meal for breakfast as I usually do not have time to sit down and eat before I leave the house in the morning.<br /><br />The cookies arrived in their individually wrapped packages, enveloped in a clear plastic wrap with a tie to seal them in.  One morning, I unwrapped one, placed it on a paper plate and heated it up in the microwave for a good 20 seconds.  The cookie came out warm to the touch.  I wrapped it in a few napkins and took it with me to eat while in my car.  The first bite left me feeling duped.  It tasted less like a cookie and more like a slice of whole wheat bread.  I was waiting for the double chocolate chunk (real belgian chocolate) taste to hit my buds, but it never happened.  I did manage to finish eating it and I have eaten over half of the initial twelve in the pack over the last few weeks.  This is because I do not want to waste them - they are healthy - and I will bear with the fact that they do not taste great in my opinion.<br /><br />Sufficed to say, I was disappointed after reading glowing reviews.  However, I would not venture to say that these cookies are disgusting.  They taste wholesome and healthy.  They are filling and do give me a full feeling for around three hours.  For those that are health conscious and are not picky about taste, look no further.  As for me, a person who loves chocolate, I would not purchase another batch of these cookies and will be looking for other breakfast alternatives.

review/text: Yum.  These will keep you full for hours.  The texture is chewy and awesome.  The taste is chocolatey, but not too sweet.  I just ordered more of the Double Chocolate Chunk and the I'm trying the Caramel Apple for the first time.  I do not expect to be disappointed.  Love Love!!!

review/summary: Great Find!
review/text: Yum! These are quite tasty for being so healthy! One cookie satisfies for a long time (3-4 hours). The product is everything it's promoted to be and the description matches the quality received.<br /><br />It reminds me of Clif Bars but much fresher. I'm ordering these "cookies" again! I'd like to try the oatmeal ones because, even though these are double-chocolate, you can taste the underlying oatmeal flavor and it tastes fantastic!<br /><br />Makes for a nice small meal ~ especially with tea and a piece of fruit. True, they can be crumbly when eaten so keep the wrapper or a napkin handy.

review/summary: Quick and easy:enjoyable snack with enough calories to satisfy
review/text: I have always been quite a picky eater, and at times have trouble upholding myself to a certain eating schedule, which results in me not eating enough. While trying to change this around, I started to think of possibilities that I could use in order to assure I sustain myself in a healthy way. This lead me to searching amazon for suitable snacks that are somewhat healthy, and provide enough calories to get you going for a little while. Erin's Baker's breakfast cookies is the result of this search. With a good 300 calories, these cookies provides you with a good balance of calories and the needed nutrients (especially coming from the whole grains) while at the same time being a pleasurable eating experience. I have not tasted anything other than the double chocolate chunk, however I can safely say these did not disappoint. I have been ordering them for a few months now, and have now signed up for the monthly subscription option.<br /><br />These are highly recommended as snacks, especially for the mornings where you couldn't help but stay in your nice warm bed a little bit longer, and do not have enough time to make a proper breakfast before having to head out for work or class.

review/summary: Fantastic.....and not only for breakfast ;)
review/text: These cookies are fantastic.....I work long hours at my Mac,  so these are great at around 4pm with my Bustelo Instant coffee, combined they give me energy for about 4 to 5 more hours of work,  and their so satisfying,  that Im fuller by dinner time,  so I eat much less at night,  which is a plus, at .99 cents a piece delivered you cant go wrong (I subscribe so I get 12/$11.90) another excellent deal by Amazon.

review/summary: Taste ok, other flavors are better!
review/text: So I have had several flavors of these breakfast cookies and have to say this is one of my least favorite flavors.  I think the flavors that are built on oatmeal are better because they taste like they should, like the oatmeal chocolate chunk with raisins are better than these because they taste like an awesome oatmeal cookie with add-ins and not like a oatmeal cookie trying to taste like a chocolate cookie.  The peanut butter ones are three stars too for the same reason.  The oatmeal flavors are all 5 stars!

review/text: Yumm.  These taste like a slightly more substantial chocolate chocolate chip cookie, but they are delish and heat up 30 seconds in the micro and you've got a treat.  These are a life saver quick snack (mini midday meal) for me when I'm on the road, quick breakfasts, whatever, they feel like a treat but are substantially feeling like a meal.

review/text: I got hooked on these last summer. They really hit the spot when you'd otherwise be skipping a meal - it is quite filling for its size, with its first ingredient being rolled oats.  I have a constant supply on hand.

review/summary: These breakfast cookies were a wonderful surprise!
review/text: I happily stumbled upon Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies while browsing around on Amazon. I had never heard of them before. Studying the comments, I ordered the 3oz cookies, two packages of double chocolate chunk and one of candied apple. They arrived in a flash! Both flavors are excellent but I am a dyed-in-the-wool chocolate aficionado, so those are my favorite treats. I have been looking at other so-called "diet cookies" and "breakfast bars" since my boxes arrived. I now know that I am getting the best cookies, the best value and the best breakfasts that I have ever known! Would that my mother had been able to buy these during WWII--I could have escaped the horrible Spam, the too-crispy eggs and the watery mush.<br /><br />Erin, I am so glad I found ye!
