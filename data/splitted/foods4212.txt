review/summary: He Loves Them
review/text: My dog had many sensetive skin problems. I bought "Grizzly Salmon Oil All-Natural Dog Food Supplement in Pump-Bottle Dispenser" from Amazon and coupled it with the Zukes Mini Naturals in "Salmon" The treats are small, but he could care less he loves them, and all he cares is that each time he goes out and comes back in is that he gets a couple (usually 3)<br />He goes out just to come back in and get a treat about half the time, but these are small so they will last. They are not messy. They are very easy. They come in a resealable bag. Even with him they have lasted a month and the bag is not empty yet!

review/summary: My Favorite Cereal
review/text: I love this cereal; I eat it every morning with maple syrup or honey, raisins, and walnuts.  It is never pasty for me, as it is for the other reviewer, unless I let it cook way too long or let it sit to cool too long.  I cook it for five minutes, turn off the heat and let it thicken a couple of minutes more as I add my raisins and walnuts and maple syrup.  Then I stir in rice milk until I get it to the consistency I like.  Though I don't like rice milk by itself or on any other cereal, it does taste really good on this rice cereal, with the added benefit of making the whole thing easier to digest.  Rice cereal is the easiest cereal to digest, anyway, but adding rice milk instead of cow's milk makes it even more easier.

review/text: I tried this product because I am TRYING to eliminate the white stuff from my diet and as a southerner, I love grits (well, hot cereal to the rest of y'all).  I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is on it's own merits. It stands up to any bowl of grits I've ever had. Follow the directions though on the proportion of water to cereal and you won't go wrong.

review/summary: Bob's Creamy Rice Cereal vs. Erewhon Rice Cream Cereal
review/text: This cereal is perfectly fine, although I prefer the Erewhon Brown Rice Cream Hot Cereal (organic).  I purchased it because the Erewhon cereal was not in stock, but now I will go back to my preferred rice cream cereal.  It is likely a matter of personal preference, although I enjoy the taste and texture of the Erewhon cereal versus Bob's Red Mill Rice Hot Cereal.  I would not discourage anyone from trying Bob's brand since it is likely a matter of personal preference.

review/summary: Gluten free AND some fiber - Tastes Yummy!
review/text: After finding out I am gluten-intolerant at 41 years old (boy what an adjustment) I don't know what I would do without this!  This cereal has been my comfort food for weeks now.  It tastes even better than cream of rice or wheat and doesn't give me heartburn.  The fiber makes it digest slower so it seems to 'stay' with me longer.  I've also tried the Mighty Tasty Gluten Free Hot Cereal which has a more complex, sharper taste from the buckwheat.  I find a mix of the two is a great change of pace.<br />I haven't tried it as a savory side dish yet but with cheese and scallions sounds good - maybe one night when hubby isn't home :-)

review/summary: Nice hot cereal
review/text: My family really loved those sugar packed instant oatmeal packets. The ones with tiny servings for grown men and entirely too much sugar. I started mixing up hot cereals for them instead. This is a favorite. With dried fruit, cinnamon, raw sugar and powdered milk mixed in with the farina, we keep it in the fridge in a sealed container. When my family wants some, they boil up some water and make this. They really prefer it to the oatmeal, and it costs less per serving with a lot less sugar.

None of us eat breakfast, per se, but I have a couple of savory dinner recipes using this that are simple:<br /><br />1)  Cook fresh broccoli in chicken broth.  Puree in blender and return to pot.  Thicken with the farina.  Season to taste.<br /><br />2)  Cook farina according to pkg directions, adding a drizzle of olive oil, a big spoonful of minced garlic, salt, pepper, and a handful of grated cheese.  I also add cayenne to ours.<br /><br />Absolutely delicious!

review/summary: better than cream of wheat
review/text: I used to love Cream of Wheat (wheat farina) as a kid. But over the years I've developed an intolerance to wheat products. I saw this the other day at Sprouts and picked it up on a whim, and I'm sure glad I did. Its delicious. I even like it a little better than Cream of Wheat because it has a little more texture to it.<br /><br />I make mine with water, cook it for 5-6 minutes, than add some organic half&half, sugar, and cinnamon and then stir for a couple more minutes with the heat off to thicken it. By the way, cinnamon doesn't just add flavor but also aids in the stabilizing of blood sugar levels when added to high carb foods so I highly recommend trying it. A bowl of this along with a side of 2 eggs over-easy and some OJ and I'm in breakfast heaven! I intend to try this sweetened with blackstrap molasses one of these days, I'll add an  update if I do. If it tastes good with BSM, that would be one powerhouse of a breakfast.

review/summary: Good alternative to instant oatmeal breakfast
review/text: I love Dr. McDugall's orginal organic instant oatmeal (discovered it as a backpacking food) that I end up having a pack or two each work day morning as breakfast.  Since I don't want to get tired of it, I have been looking for alternative hot breakfast and ended up finding this one.<br /><br />I had grits for only once in my life time therefore I did not know what to expect.  Granted, this product takes more prep time than instant oatmeal.  After a bit branstorming I found a quicker/no fuss way to fit it into my morning routine.<br /><br />The night before I'd put 1/4 cup of it in a bowl and a cup of water, add a bit of salt or chicken stock (powder form), stir and then cover the bowl with a plate.  Let it soak over night.<br /><br />In the morning while getting ready for work, I put the bowl with cover in the microwave to zap it for 3 minutes.  When zapping is done, stir a bit and let it sit.  By the time I am ready to eat it, it'd almost be perfectly soft, gooey, and not too hot.<br /><br />I prefer eating it with dried pork (pork sung) and diced pickled turnips.  If you like savory breakfast hot cereal, maybe you can be creative to come up with your favorite additives to this wonderful and healthy product!

review/text: I was curious about the differnce between the two mixes and called the company.  There is only one difference:  All Natural mix uses  natural real vanilla and it is only sold in retail packages. The Original mix uses artificial vanilla flavoring.  That's it! The taste for both products is the same: Great!  Natural is our choice.<br /><br />In our opinion, the mix makes great pancakes and excellent waffles.  The malted flaver is more distinct in the pancakes. Enjoy!

review/summary: Easy, quick and customizable
review/text: My hope is that someday amazon starts adding the ingredients to these products.  I hate having to search to find the info so I can figure out if the product has something I can't eat, so here is the ingredient list:<br /><br />Enriched Wheat Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflaving, folic acid), Corn Flour, Leavening (Baking Soda, Monocalcium Phosphate, Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate), Malt Powder, Salt, Sugar, Buttermilk, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />CONTAINS: WHEAT AND MILK.<br /><br />ALright, now that that is out of the way, these are great, and easy to make, you just add butter, eggs and water for waffles (I've not tried it for pancakes).  You can also halve the recipe on the container to make a half batch, which is nice when you aren't feeding a whole family.<br /><br />The texture and flavor are excellent for something that mixes together so quickly (2 minutes tops), and the picky eaters in my house love eating these, including the super picky toddler.<br /><br />I've also found that the mix is easy to customize.  I have replaced the butter with flax seed oil and added a cup of froze blueberries for tasty blueberry waffles.  I've also mashed up two bananas and mixed those in for banana waffles.<br /><br />All in all, I am very happy with the produce and I will be buying again.  It has made waffles a regular treat rather than a sometimes treat, and completely justified owning a waffle iron.

The waffles and pancakes are still amazing with the All Natural, and I still get requests all the time from my kids for "Daddy's Waffles" and "Daddy's Pancakes".  Needless to say, I'll be sticking with Carbon's over any other mix, and I'll be sticking with the All Natural.

review/summary: Decent mix, requires eggs/milk/butter
review/text: I usually make pancakes/waffles from scratch, but I wanted to buy a mix to compare against the recipes I use, and for convenience.  I chose this particular mix because it's all-natural, it has good reviews, and Amazon has a great price.  Since receiving this mix, I've made waffles twice (chocolate and plain) and pancakes (plain and blueberry) once.<br /><br />Taste/texture: Making pancakes/waffles as directed, I felt both the pancakes/waffles were only so-so.  Adding vanilla extract, a little powdered sugar, orange zest, and miniature chocolate chips really helped.  However, I am a fan of plain pancakes, and would almost always prefer plain waffles/pancakes if they're really good.  The waffles/pancakes made from this mix are only so-so.<br /><br />Convenience: This mix requires that you add your own eggs, milk/buttermilk, and melted butter to the mix.  I had hoped that the mix would contain powdered egg and milk solids, so that I would only have to add milk or water, and would still be able to make it when I'm out of eggs.  No such luck.  From the "bare pantry" perspective, having this isn't much of an asset.<br /><br />Amazon has a great price on this product, but the dry ingredients of pancakes/waffles are even cheaper.  You can easily mix flour with a bit of baking soda, baking powder, salt, cornstarch, and (in some recipes) yeast, store it in Tupperware or Ziploc bags, then measure out what you need and add the wet ingredients whenever you want to make waffles/pancakes.  Alton Brown has a really simple recipe, and there are all sorts of other fabulous recipes online.  Depending on how much you pay for flour, you can probably save about $10 in 10 minutes by mixing your own dry ingredients.

I saw this mix and decided to try it. WOW! The first hint that you are in for a good waffle is the smell of malt and hint of vanilla that comes out of the can when you open it. Following the easy directions, you are going to be in for a real treat. These waffles come out crisp, yet fully tender. They seem to hold their crispness under syrup longer and the flavor bings you back to a time when quality meant something. I highly recommend this product. I also bought the original mix and it works equally well.

review/summary: Golden Malted Natural Waffle and Pancake Mix 3 pack
review/text: Fantastic product.  Tried the All Natural for the first time.  Although it doesn't fill the house with that fantastic intense Golden Waffle smell like the regular does, it tastes just as good (if not better).  One catch is to let the batter sit a bit before using it.  The first couple waffles came out a bit heavy and not as crisp, but after the batter had sat a bit it came out very light and crispy as you would expect.  This will be the one I buy from now on.  Price is a bit less than what I pay locally and saves me time and money since I don't have to make special long trips to the only store that has it in our area.  Glad Amazon has this.  Next I will be trying some of the other flavors.  By the way, try adding a tablespoon of this to your favorite cake, muffin,  or bread recipes.  You will be amazed what it does for them.

They are a bit on the pricier side since they require the addition of butter, eggs, and milk. I'd still suggest adding some fruit and good syrup when using this mix. The flavor is not particularly strong without them.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? Yes. But would I not buy another brand that was on sale in order to buy this? No.

Best waffles I've ever made including ones I've made from scratch with fresh ground organic whole wheat flour.<br /><br />Addendum 4-2012<br /><br />With four grandkids, we eat a lot of waffles and pancakes and have tried a dozen different mixes.  Although this remains our absolute favorite, we buy cheaper products (e.g., Pamela's Ultimate Baking Mix) and spice them up.

review/text: This mix baked in the Hamilton Beach 26050 Four Square Belgian Waffle Maker is a match made by the waffle gods. Quick to mix (don't overmix, leave some clumps and let the wet/dry mixture sit for a good 5 minutes before adding butter) and bakes without a trace of sticking. Add in minature choclate chips and the kids will be asking for seconds.

review/text: I LOVE WAFFLES.  I always have and I'm always looking for new waffle products.  There are other recipes that I like but I also like variety.  So, I like trying new products.<br /><br />I ordered this product based upon the huge number of product reviews.  The product arrived as promised, well packaged, expiration date a year out in the future.  This product will be as good as it is going to get.<br /><br />I use a Waring Pro Belgian Waffle Maker.  I've been using them for years.<br />We have our own free range chickens so our eggs are top notch.<br />I mixed the recipe precisely to the waffle instructions on the can.<br />Using the recipe yields 4 perfectly cooked waffles.  I'm going to post an image to user images so you can see the results.<br /><br />So, I must confess, I was disappointed by the results.  The waffles were okay.  "Malted" is in huge red letters on the can.  If I give you a range of maltiness from 0 to 10, 0 being newspaper and 10 being the center of a malted milk ball, the product is a 2.  The malt is just detectable.  I'd want at a minimum a doubling of maltiness.  The waffles were crisp on the outside and light on the inside.  The flavor was just lacking.<br /><br />I also ordered the Heartland products.  I'll review them when I get around to cooking them.<br /><br />This added later: Using a different syrup improved the experience.  I'll up the rating to 4 stars.

review/text: Have been using this mix for about a year for my hubbys waffle obsession.  (I never really cared for them myself)  Ordered the Waring Pro double waffle maker and a 3 pack of mix for his Christmas gift.  After tasting these waffles,I have been a waffle addict since!! Have tried both the original and all natural and I think the all natural tastes the same, although I taste a hint of artificial vanilla in the original mix.  You cannot go wrong with this mix!!  I consider myself a good cook and baker, but I have never been able to duplicate a recipe that tastes anywhere as good as Carbon Waffle Mix.

review/text: My 10 year old daughter received a professional grade waffle maker for Christmas and 3 containers of Carbon's Golden Malted  All Natural Pancake and Waffle Flour.  She made the best waffles our family of four had ever made at home.  The flavor was perfect and no modifications were needed to the ingredients, something we find we often have to do with other mixes.  I also typically add vanilla to mixes and there was no need to do this.  Great taste.  We are getting ready to make our second batch and think it will be a weekend tradition.

review/summary: No more making Belgian waffles from scratch!
review/text: After making Belgian waffles from scratch for years, I ordered this product after my neighbor recommended it.  They enjoy going out for breakfast, and ask which brand of mix the restaurant uses when they particularly enjoy the waffles.  Carbon was always the answer.  I tried it, and will never make waffles from scratch again, as this was far superior to homemade!  They make crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, flavorful waffles every time.  The only difference between the two types is that the "All Natural" variety uses real vanilla extract and the other uses artificial.  DELICIOUS in either case.

review/summary: Hyped beyond all belief
review/text: I don't like to think of myself as a waffle connoisseur but when it comes to breakfast, everything else can take a hike. I bought my first waffle iron on Black Friday and immediately began scouring the Internet for a waffle mix of epic proportions. I was super excited to purchase this product given the amount of positive reviews it had gained. Sadly, I was swept up in the hype and came in expecting something that just wasn't there.<br /><br />The instructions were simple enough and I definitely can't complain about the size. These three large cans could last a good 2-3 months if prepared once or twice a week. I didn't buy the product because it was all natural (that was more like an added bonus). I wanted substance and flavor and that's something this product just couldn't deliver. I made the batter exactly as instructed, not even adjusting the measurement to a single serving and gave it a whirl. After my first bite I swore to myself that I missed something. That must have been it. These things couldn't be bland, not after hearing so many good things about them but alas, the truth was a hard pill to swallow.<br /><br />I didn't give up on this mix after one batch and began my quest to vary the ingredients. I tried adding more sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and practically everything under the sun to elevate some flavor from this batter but it just wasn't working. I have to macerate these waffles in syrup and butter just to enjoy them but I was really hoping for a flavorful treat right out of the box.<br /><br />These waffles aren't bad but they aren't really that good either. The texture is nice when cooked and if you know what you're doing, you can get a nice crispy crust while still leaving it a little soft in the middle. I will give it credit for that but as far as everything else is concerned this package leaves much more to be desired.

In fact, as it stands now, I'd probably buy those before buying another 3-pack of these.<br /><br />Like I said, the waffles aren't bad, there's just nothing "special" about them like you'd be led to believe from other reviews posted here. Maybe they need more malt in the can, who knows? SOMEthing's missing. They just didn't "grab" me any more than the cheap competitor's product did.<br /><br />Give them a try if you'd like. Yes, the cans are huge. But overall, I don't feel you get what you pay for here.

But I have to take one star off for the fact you have to add eggs, melted butter, milk (for pancakes) and water to the mix. If I have to do all that I might as well make my own mix from scratch and save a lot of money. No, it probably won't taste quite the same, but I won't be losing any time or making much more effort. And, who knows, maybe all homemade will taste even better!

review/summary: altitude issues?
review/text: I've had waffles made with his mix before and usually they are second to none as far as light crispy outside and tender moist inside. With that unmistakable malt scent they are exceptionally wonderful; since I don't live too close to anyplace that serves these I was happy to find the mix here. I followed the directions for waffles and used them with my mini Belgian waffler only to find that the mix did not rise well and only made "half height" waffles. I also tried a reviewer suggestion to allow the batter to sit for a while to see if this would improve the result but no improvement was seen.<br /><br />I live at a fairly high altitude these days (about 3700 ft) so this may be the problem. I emailed the company several days ago for recipe instructions for high altitude but so far no response.<br /><br />Other than the half height, the waffles were not the usual texture - seemed sort of steamed or limp instead of crisp+tender. The taste was almost as good as usual though so I'm hoping there is a recipe fix for the texture and rising issues. In the meanwhile I'll tweak the next batch with a little baking powder and less water to see if that improves things.<br /><br />I'll update if/when I hear back from the company.<br /><br />(if anyone knows the high altitude recipe please leave a comment - thanks!)

review/text: We purchased this flour mix because we liked waffles that we tried at Red Roof Inn. We bought it after reading many reviews and some people said it was very sweet. On the contrary, these waffles are NOT sweet at all. When we prepare them, we add several spoons of sugar and vanilla, although the flour mixture contains them, but it is not enough. The waffles do not turn exactly 100% as those at hotels, but I think this depends on the waffle maker you have. In general, this is a yummy mixture and makes very soft and tasty waffles.

My wife tossed out the waffle maker we got as a wedding gift the day after the wedding, and we've never had one in the 43 years since.  I apologize to whomever bought it for us.  She doesn't like waffles so I've begun ordering them everytime I go to a restaurant for breakfast.  Decided to make them at home and got this mix which is very simple to put together with a couple ingredients, i.e. egg, water, butter and you're ready to go.  Makes great tasting light fluffy waffles and I add my own twist of special ingredients like strawberries and sour cream to make a real treat.

We have tried several other brands on-line as well as from local supermarket. So it's safe to say it "we approve it".<br /><br />At first, adding butter, egg, in addition to water seem just a bit more work then "just add water" types. Consistency for crispy/smooth surface and tender inside was a challenge from second month onward. With the frustrations we turned to other mixes.  But over time we learned maintaining clean waffle iron was key to consistent smooth texture and crispy (oil wipe down after every session instead of deep cleaning every month). For inside tenderness, instead of following direction to mix everything, we learned to mix egg yolk in with mix and others in first. Then as last step, gently "swirl in" the intensely beated egg white. The waffle turned out great every time now.<br /><br />Once we do the above, our enjoyment of this mix is very consistent. We no longer use other mix for as long as this is still selling at around $15 per 3 pack from Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: I discovered Carbon's Golden Malted while staying in a Hampton Inn.  This is the delicious waffle mix they serve with their wonderful breakfast buffet.  My husband fell totally in love with those waffles.  I searched out the lady who prepared the breakfast and begged to know what they used.  THIS IS IT.  So far Amazon has the best price available too.  I paid $16.62 for three 33 ounce containers...no shipping.  Good deal.<br /><br />This is not a "complete" mix.  It must be made with eggs, butter and water.  I also add a little vanilla.  VERY GOOD.<br /><br />I also recommend the Presto 3510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker.  It works great. It flips.  It's inexpensive and takes up very little shelf space to store.  Just perfect for the occasional breakfast waffle at home.  Spray with a little butter flavored Pam before each use to avoid any sticking.<br /><br />A note to all the wives and girl friends hoping to be wives:<br /><br />As "they" say, " the way to a man's heart is through his stomach."  TRUE!  Make his favorite foods, keep a clean home,  don't nag...EVER,  and just be nice.  You'll have a happy marriage.  Ours has been great for 45 years and counting.

review/summary: Very good tasty mix
review/text: This mix was purchased for use with my New Waring Double Waffle maker. It is an excellent mix, very light and tasty. Some reviewers say that it requires milk, eggs, and butter. It does require eggs and melted butter, but it calls for 1-1/2 cups of WATER not milk, and water works fine. I would have liked it better if the eggs, etc. were included in the mix, but this is O.K. I just know that when I'm going to make waffles, I must have eggs and butter in the house. I LOVE the malted smell while the waffles are cooking. Will definitely purchase this product again.

review/summary: Taste great, but more expensive
review/text: The Golden Malted All Natural Waffle & Pancake mix is a great product.  Add melted butter, eggs and water and you get a rich, tasty waffle.  I bought this for waffles and have not tried the pancake recipe yet.  It takes more ingredients and more time and is more costly than a "complete" mix to which you add only water, but this makes much better waffles.  For me, it's worth it.

review/text: Yummy, not super sweet. I can see how these can easily transition into other dishes aside from pancakes and waffles. Sadly I like to eat mine plain, and will have to add a little sugar to make them just right. Overall I prefer Daddy Cakes, but these are more pocket friendly. ;)<br /><br />P.S. For the health conscious: I made mine with low fat milk, no butter, and they weren't missing anything (aside from sweetener).

review/summary: Sweet worthless calories.
review/text: After reading all the great reviews, I ordered the product. I guess most people just love a very sweet waffle which is why so many people buy those worthless sugarary breakfast cereals. I cannot understand how the product label says 0 grams of sugar and yet, have most of the ingredients being sweeteners. As far as being a healthful product, all you are getting is white flour loaded with sweeteners which is bad for anyone trying to stay away from high glycemic foods, those which flood your blood with glucose and forces a fast insulin rise. Of course, adding syrup just adds to the flames. This product simply gives you lots of empty calories which adds weight. I would suggest the many higher grain mixes that are available and which adds some fiber to your diet and does not give you an insulin rush. By the way, they taste just fine.

review/summary: Vanilla Paste is terrific
review/text: Based on recommendation from King Arthur Flour (KAF), I bought the vanilla bean paste. It came in quickly. I tried it and came to several conclusions. First, the flavor is outstanding..rich vanilla flavor. As described at KAF, the paste contained small vanillla bean specks which were visible in the lighter colored preps I made, like French Vanilla ice cream. It gave the preparations a special touch. One caution. If used in a thin batter, the specks will sink to the bottom. I learned this when I made Creme Brulee. The vanilla flavor was great, but at the bottom of the ramekin were all the bean specks. Use the paste in recipes where the specks will stay suspended and not sink.

review/text: I purchased a bottle of the Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla about a year ago through Amazon and noticed how the vanilla enhanced<br />the flavors of whatever I used it in. Cookies had a richer flavor as well as pancakes and other baked goods. When I ran out I purchased<br />a couple of smaller bottles of vanilla at my local market, but the flavor just wasn't as intense.  So, I recently purchased another<br />bottle of Nielsen-Massey and am very satisfied again with this product.  Keep in mind this is "pure" vanilla as opposed to "imitation"

review/text: Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla is BY FAR the best vanilla I've ever used in my baking--and I've used a lot of vanilla from numerous companies over five decades of baking.  There have been store-brands, spice company brands, the famous vanilla sold door-to-door years back, and even vanilla brought home from a foreign country.<br />When I opened this bottle of vamilla, the aroma was fresh and fabulous.  Then I tasted the "old" cakes and cookies I've baked umpteen times.  I could have sworn they were new recipes, and my guests responded likewise.<br />I proudly recommend Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla for your use.  Buy the 32-ounce bottle, because you're going love baking with it :)

review/summary: None Better
review/text: Stop what is going on and bring out the baking materials because a cake is on the way and it will be the best cake ever as long as Nielsen-Massey Vanilla is one of the ingredients.  I have used almost every type of real vanilla over the years and none is better than this one.  The taste fits my needs perfectly and those who eat the end result agree.  Even though cheap imitation vanilla is readily available at a low cost per unit and other real vanilla is also readily available this one is the absolute best.  I thought that the 32 ounce size would be too much and it might not get used before expiring but I was just plain wrong.  It will be gone long before its expiration and all the consumers in this house will say thank you.  There is nothing quite as pleasant as having one of the church ladies or a guest extolling the goodness of a pound cake made with Nielsen's.  I know the vanilla is just an insignificant part of the total product but it is the one element that adds so much to the flavor and goodness.

review/summary: A Passion for Vanilla
review/text: Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar "Bourbon Islands," Mexico and Indonesia. I find the flavor was truly superior to normal vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream.<br /><br />Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean. Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.<br /><br />Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract.<br /><br />You can use the vanilla beans, rinse and dry them, so they last longer. After drying, you can store them again in the glass tube or in their own plastic bag for reuse.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Weak Vanilla Flavor
review/text: After researching brands of vanilla bean paste, I decided to go with this one as it consistently has the best reviews. However, I'm not happy with this product at all. The vanilla taste just isn't there. It's great for adding the vanilla bean "look" to my recipes, but I found that even if I use a lot, I still can't achieve a good level of vanilla flavor. I used about 1/3 of the bottle for a frosting recipe but it still didn't have the vanilla flavor I was seeking. I had to add vanilla extract for that.<br /><br />I thought it would be thicker and have more vanilla beans in it, but it's about the consistency of maple syrup. It shouldn't be called a paste, as it really isn't. Pastes are very thick and don't run. I won't be buying this again.

review/text: I feel bad writing a bad review, but I feel cheated and I don't believe other people should buy this product based on my experience with it. Maybe other products of theirs are good, but this one is exceptionally bad, especially since it is supposed to be gourmet. The small bottles of vanilla that you can buy at Walmart taste much, much, much, much, much more like vanilla than this product, which tastes to me, like vodka with a dash of vanilla in it. I feel like I have been cheated, even though for the price it should be a good value. I am actually scared to purchase vanilla now on the Internet in bulk other than from companies I can find and try out in the stores. I can only speak about the bottle I purchased. I would recommend something else. Most vanilla is gluten free although many have corn syrup in them. This one has sugar in it. I really don't understand positive reviews about this product. I bought it because it was cheap (for the amount) and gourmet. It (I think, tastes worse than the imitation). Imitation at least tastes like vanilla. I apologize for writing such a review but other people need to be aware of this product. If you want to buy from this company try something that will have more vanilla in it.

review/summary: Awesome taste, tiny box!
review/text: I didn't pay attention to the box size, so was astonished when I opened the Amazon box and saw these TINY boxes of cereal! I also ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPMN2">Kashi TLC Fruit & Grain Bars, Dark Chocolate Coconut, 6.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> at the same time, and I swear the boxes are the same size! I swear I've ordered this cereal (or bought it locally) and it was a more normal-sized box... Oh well. Lesson learned--pay attention to the box size.<br /><br />That said, this cereal is DELICIOUS. Great chocolate flavor. Great slices of coconut. Crunchy granola. What more can you ask for? (Well, other than MORE of it for cheaper?!)

review/summary: Yummy! Tons of Coconut, Almond and Perfect Chocolaty flavor.
review/text: Good cereal.  It is cereal...not granola bars, if you're wondering.<br /><br />- not too sweet<br />- large chunks of the good stuff (coconut, almonds)<br />- healthy<br />- crunchy<br />- much smaller box than normal cereals, but has same amount<br />- maybe enough for 4 bowls of cereal<br />- in my opinion, not worth $7/box (maybe $3 or 4)<br />- more snackable than museli.  (this Kashi has larger chunks.)<br /><br />Check out my uploaded pictures for evidence :-)

review/summary: Addicting...
review/text: This stuff is so good, but you can't find it anywhere.  I've tried the locator on [...], but nothing.  I just happened to find it at a Big Lots($2.80 a box!)and wish I hadn't, because now I'm hooked and desperate to find it.  Glad Amazon did have it, but it's expensive. Bad Kashi people!

review/summary: delicious but... a little hiccup
review/text: I found the granola itself to be very delicious and it is exactly what I wanted. the chocolate element makes it just indulgent enough so I'll be motivated to eat breakfast and not skip it. Considering I ordered this "bulk" item, I thought the expiration date would be like 2010 or 2011. However, it expires in September! It gives me like two or three months to finish the boxes. I thought that was kind of ridiculous.

review/summary: Nice things come in small packages (see hint about serving size).
review/text: This tastes fantastic, and the kids love it (as do adults!)  Several reviewers commented on the small package.  It's 14.3 oz, which provides nearly 8 servings per box.  Serving size is 1/2 cup, 1.9 oz, and that gives you 230 cal from the cereal alone.<br /><br />This is HEALTHY food, but it's definitely not DIET fare.  If you grab a big soup bowl and pour a third of a box into it (as suggested by one reviewer), you'd better have a full morning of physical activity planned.<br /><br />The vendor's nutrition informaiton is here:  http://www.kashi.com/products/nutrition_info/kashi_granola_cocoa_beach<br /><br />The cost is very reasonable.  Hint:  order this on the subscribe and save program to get it for an even lower cost!

review/summary: Chocoholics rejoice!
review/text: What a delicious cereal! It is chock full of almond slices and tastes of natural chocolate and coconut. It is a really tasty granola cereal with an excellent crunch factor. Plus, if you're a chocoholic like me, it is very satisfying.<br /><br />The box proclaims, "Natural cocoa made from seeds of the tropical Cacao tree is mixed with our grain blend and then baked into chocolaty whole grain clusters. To complete our irresistibly rich cocoa blend, we added coconut and crunchy almonds for a heavenly treat you'll always come back to."<br /><br />I have to agree: After trying this cereal, I definitely want more of it! It is just that good. Do note that 1/2 cup is 230 calories with 9 grams of fat, 36 carbohydrates, and 11 grams of sugar. Also: 7 grams of dietary fiber!<br /><br />This cereal box is quite a bit smaller than some other Kashi cereals. The size of this box is 1 3/4 inches x 9 inches. Kashi's 15-ounce cereal boxes are physically quite a bit larger. Just something to be prepared for when you open that outer packing box if you order through Amazon! Good to know: each cereal box is packed tightly with product: you get 14.3 ounces of cereal.<br /><br />Also a sidebar about Amazon's "frustration free" packaging for this item: When I removed the packaging from this product, it was taped to the cereal boxes, which caused the labeling to peel off the Kashi boxes. Including, in my case, the list of ingredients on the side of the cereal box for two boxes, and the nutritional information (calories, fat, etc.) on three boxes. I ended up using scissors to save one box.<br /><br />This is a delicious and nutritious breakfast cereal and great if you are a chocoholic.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />~~<br /><br />"I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: Cocoa Beach is great! Pretty good for you, especially compared to other granolas, and absolutely delicious. I could probably eat it every day. It's a little expensive, but worth the extra $$$.
