review/summary: Please offer in 8 oz size
review/text: My daughter has milk allergies and she loves this stuff...just wish we could get it in the 8 oz size so that we can take them on the go.  (Also, from our experience, the 8 oz sizes of the plain Soy Dream and Rice Dream arrive intact compared to the larger cartons, so 8 oz cartons offered in this would hopefully help with that issue)

review/summary: excellent item!
review/text: I started ordering both chocolate and vanilla soy dream in bulk every few months a couple of years ago. I am a student without a car who uses milk frequently for meals and coffee. I having to walk to the store everytime the milk ran out. Instead I keep a supply of these boxes in my closet and rotate them into my fridge as needed. I've tried other brands of soymilk, ricemilk, etc but I LOVE the flavor and texture of Soy Dream! It spices up my cereal and makes my coffee taste like mroe of a dessert. I highly recommend this product!

review/text: I was in a Stonewall store and sampled this Blueberry Cheese Ball Mix (I am not even a big fan of blueberries!). It was so good I had to buy one and when I shared it with others they enjoyed it as well. It is cheaper to buy it from Amazon as it was $4 at the store for one box. Serve with Cinnamon Sugar crackers or grahams for the perfect combination.

review/text: These mixes are nice to have on hand quite easy to make I like to add a little vanilla to the basic mix to intensify the flavor  a bit.<br /> It is easy to add other ingredients  such as poppy seeds or dried fruit to make flavored pound cakes. This mix is not overly sweet and cakes come  out a bit dryer than some. All in all, it makes  a pretty decent basic cake

review/summary: What happened to the Recipe?
review/text: I am so disappointed--Betty Crocker changed the recipe. This is not the product advertised. This new recipe can no longer be made with egg whites, and now it calls for the addition of butter! In the old recipe, I had finally found something I could indulge in without the added fat and cholesterol. The egg whites made it so light I could eat cake as a snack or as a dessert without feeling overly full. This recipe is very 'heavy'. I issued a complaint on [...]and was told that it was changed due to consumer poles (?). If anyone prefers the healthier recipe as I do, please contact them and let them know that Change is NOT ALWAYS GOOD! (Amazon, update your description!)

review/text: This was a bargain compared to what cereal costs in NYC. The cereal arrived quickly and tasted fresh. It is pretty good cereal and has a really fruity taste. It is kind of like fruity pebbles, fruit loops, etc. It turns the milk pink and is pretty sweet. If you like that, then you will love this cereal. For me, I thought it was a little too sweet.

review/summary: Happy Birthday Sweeties!
review/text: I have heard Fry's Chocolate Creams discussed on many, many occasions whenever my Brit husband and other Brit friends remininsced about the "sweeties" they enjoyed as children.<br /><br />Whenever we went to the UK the time was so jampacked I found all of his and his friends other treats but not the Fry's.  Don't feel too bad for them, returning from our last trip we had a suitcase packed full of nothing but British treats!<br /><br />Amazingly, I was checking the British Shoppe (our favorite) fare last wkend and immediately ordered these for my husband's birthday this Tuesday, not knowing if they would arrive in time.  They were in Saturday's post!  I will divide them for birthday and save some for his Christmas Stocking.<br /><br />He will be over the moon!!<br /><br />UPDATED:  11/02/10 He loved the Fry's candy so much it had some with his breakfast coffee.  After seeing the small package of candy, I relented and gave it all to him for his B-Day.  He is one Happy Birthday boy!

review/summary: The best nacho cheese chips I've ever tasted.
review/text: I saw these nacho cheese chips 2 months ago at a local salvage grocery store and decided to buy a bag just to see if I'd like them. I was so pleased and satisfied with the taste that I needed more of these chips. I bought a grocery bag full of them and they were gone within 2 weeks of my purchasing them. I just couldn't get enough of these tasty chips. What I like about this brand of tortilla chips is that the oil penetrates the whole chip and it makes it crispy, yet moist at the same time. Also, the nacho cheese flavoring is delicious, mild, but very flavorful, not at all overpowering. I also liked the shape of these chips because they weren't the regular shape of a triangle like so many other brands. This brand is a keeper and if the price ever goes down a bit, then I'm going to purchase this product in bulk.

The United States is the largest producer of food in the world yet we can't afford a little thing like sugar to make our own candy? I bought a bag before I realized what had happened and didn't know until I had actually finished them.  Wondered the whole time why they tasted differently than in previous years.  Well, there you have it. We're buying our own name brands made outside of America.  Hope they bring this back - they're not the same and Chicago needs the jobs!

review/summary: What a blessing this cat food is!
review/text: The Pro Plan Hairball Management Formula has literally been a life saver for my cat. She's a four year old Ragdoll, and has always had problems with regurgitating her food, regurgitating hairballs, and loose stools. Recently she had a particularly bad bout with hairballs, and I changed her diet to this Pro Plan formulation. It only took her a day or two to completely accept it in lieu of her previous (competitor's product) food. It is higher in fiber, so she does eat more of it.<br /><br />The result has been a complete turn around. No more hairballs on the carpet. No more regurgitated food. No more loose stools, and no more cleaning it from her long haired butt!<br /><br />She had been to the Vet in the past with her 'issues', and the last time I didn't think she was going to make it. She's just fine now. I've got my happy, playful cat back!

review/summary: Cat love the taste!
review/text: I usually buy my cats all natural organic foods, such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. Well, all of those are VERY expensive and PetSmart doesn't carry Halo brand. I'm really big on only giving my pets foods that have decent ingredients. Wellness, Halo and Blue Buffalo all have all ingredients that I would eat, and ideally this is all I would ever feed my pets. Sadly, times are tough and this product is much more fairly priced. Though the ingredients aren't all great, the first ingredient is a true meat and not just by-products or corn meal. So, hesitantly I bought this instead. I also had a coupon, which is almost always available on their website- for $3 off. ALL five cats LOVED it. It must be a VERY palatable food. They went from eating one bowl every three days each to one whole bowl a day each. They don't seem to be getting getting fatter from it, and I haven't seen one hairball since. I think this is a decent food if your low on cash, but not great for all the time. I kind of view it as a junk food or snack for my kitties. I would recommend one of the other 3 brands mentioned before this one, but it is still MUCH better than some other brands out there. For instance, Friskies, MeowMix or even some other Purina products out there are just plain garbage ingredients.

review/text: We have seven cats, one with terrible hairball problems.  The first thing we noticed is that the cats ate easily twice as much of this food as they did of the grain free we usually feed. Like human junk food this food seemed to create appetite instead of satisfying it. This food is as expensive as the grain free.  The cat with hairballs showed no improvement after two weeks of feeding this product. We have gone back to the grain free food we were feeding.

review/text: For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Paula Deen Collection Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite.  I made up my mind about this product only after using it once on a particular item of food.  The overall flavor of this hot sauce is pleasing--I like its saltiness and tanginess, for example.  Also, it is neither too hot nor too mild.  Paula Deen Collection Hot Sauce is a product that I can recommend.

If I wanted to spend that much for a 7 ounce box of salt, it better come in a gold plated box!<br /><br />Also, the fact that this company will take a consumable item back concerns me. How do I know that I'm not eating something some other customer returned?? ..Amazon itself, doesn't even want deodorant sent back-- much less an item that you actually eat!!

review/text: This coffee is very smooth without any bitterness. Perhaps it is not for everyone but it is a change of pace from the heavy roast coffees currently in favor. I usually drink three cups in the morning at work and this seems to be easy on the stomach as well as the nerves. I usually like Jacobs Meister R&ouml;stung fresh coffee at home but at work we use a dark roasted coffee which is too strong for my taste. I keep a jar of Douwe Egberts in my desk. Jacobs Coronet instant is similar but a little stronger.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041QGC0Q">Douwe Egberts Pure G.old Instant Coffee, 7-Ounce Jar</a>

review/summary: The best instant coffee. Period.
review/text: I've been reluctant to leave a review for this stuff, even though I've been buying it though Amazon for over a year. I was if it became too popular, I wouldn't be able to buy it anymore! Seeing all the reviews it now has, I'm hopeful it will permanently be available here in the US.<br /><br />I drank this same instant coffee when I lived in Australia. It's branded as "Moccona" there, but it's the same stuff. This particular variety is called "Moccona Classic", and is the best one in my opinion. I loved it so much that I brought a couple of jars back with me.<br /><br />It's better than Nescafe freeze-fried, although that's also good and I like to change them up occasionally. Freeze dried instant is always superior to granulated instant.<br /><br />Like I said, I hope it sticks around. I think all the instant coffees in Douwe Egberts' line could be very successful in America.

review/summary: The Best Instant Coffee
review/text: This is easily the best instant coffee I've ever bought and I wish I could give it 10 stars.  I like a strong tasting coffee but that usually just gives me a bitter brew that needs cream to make it drinkable.  This coffee though, tastes thoroughly and strongly like coffee but with no bitterness or overpoweringness.  I've tried various methods of brewing and brands of coffee in the past, and due to current living situation have been using instant coffee.  But since I found this brand, I don't see any reason to ever stop using instant even when I move into my own home.<br /><br />The closest I've found to a con is that it was so wonderful when I first tried it, I kept making more and ended up drinking way way too much coffee.  I was just so happy to be drinking flavorful coffee that didn't make my stomach hurt.  So I got a little wired when it first got here, but seriously - I'm in love with this stuff (and while my reviews tend to be mostly positive in nature, I've never been so over the top before lol).

review/text: The reviews made it sound like this was exceptional, but I'm not as impressed.  I've revised this review after a couple more tries, and decided it's better than I initially thought, although still not the best I've had. This initially struck me as largely chemically and tasting obviously like instant coffee, but to it's credit it does have a more subtle coffee flavor than most instants...but overall it's not as good as I'd hoped.  I'm still looking for some instant as good as I found years ago while traveling.

review/summary: Best Instant Coffee
review/text: I've been a coffee snob since the mid '80s.  I've done all but roast my own, and was preparing to try that.  However, my stomach is no longer into my deep and abiding love for really good coffee.  After I tried to stick with just tea for a couple of years, a friend from England convinced me that instant coffee is worth at least a taste.  Gasp!  I ordered some Nescafe Gold, on his recommendation, and it was actually... good.  Really good.  After happily drinking it for as long as my pocketbook would allow (those pesky import costs), I found this Douwe Egberts Pure Gold, here on Amazon.  I'm not sure I'll go back!  It's lovely!  I drink it hot, and also cold in the summer time.  I pour about a 1/4 cup of cold water into the grounds and let them sit for a few minutes, give it a quick stir (it even foams a little), and then I add milk to fill the glass, and a little evaporated cane juice.  Although I still enjoy a good latte, made RIGHT... for daily drinking, I don't think I'll go back to home ground and brewed coffee.  Just don't tell anyone. ;)

review/text: As a huge fan of Davidoff coffee, I decided to try this coffee based on all of the good things I have heard about it. As some people prefer Douwe Egberts Pure Gold to Davidoff, I thought that, at worst, I would wind up with an equally good cup of coffee if not a better one. Boy was I wrong! Not only is this coffee extremely weak, the taste and aroma are no better than what the Walmart brand offers for $10 less per bottle. I will never buy this coffee again. My advice to anyone looking for a good instant coffee is to try Davidoff. I've tried several instant coffees and Davidoff is, by far, the best.

review/summary: Not Bad, but Not Great
review/text: I've been a coffee user to the point of roasting my own coffee beans for over a decade now, so I know good coffee.  I was a bit disappointed to see this product is made by Sara Lee (says so in very small print on the label).  They aren't known for top shelf quality.<br />I purchased this to compare to 2 other instant coffees that I use until we replace our recently broken espresso machine.  One is a popular store brand Nes...., and the other is the only organic instant available.  I enjoy both of them equally after tasting side by side.  Douwe Egberts is priced in between.  I use this product either in hot water with frothed milk or in drip coffee with frothed milk when I want something stronger.  It's fine when mixed with milk, sugar, etc.  But, when drinking black against the other two, it is more acidy/tangy tasting.  You think it should be smoother since it is a lighter roast.  Also, something that puzzles me, is the other two brands sink in water, where as this brand floats on top.<br />It is okay, but the store brand tastes better and is a better bargain, so I probably won't order this again.

review/text: I am a rose junkie. Perfumes, lotions, even jams, they all catch my attention. When I saw *candied rose petals* I went through a serious struggle between my desire and my financial wisdom. These things are 'spensive. I finally caved to myself when I found two for the price of one compared to another Amazon merchant.<br /><br />Thank goodness I got that much, because no matter how prepared you think you are, 0.5 ounces looks mighty puny in real life!<br /><br />That's not to say I didn't like the candied petals. They were crunchy, sweet, rosy but not overpowerfully so, no bitter aftertaste or "earthy" flavor. Still, they were a little mild for my liking. They are also very small. Like beads.<br /><br />I alternated between sucking on the ones that came stuck together and chewing the individuals. I preferred chewing, but had I chewed my way through 0.5 ounces, I'd have been done in ten minutes or less!<br /><br />It's impossible to review these candied petals without focusing on the amount you get for the price you pay. At this rate, it would be quite, quite expensive to use these as decoration on cupcakes or cakes. You'd need at *least* 3 bags, unless you wanted one lil bead of a petal per cupcake. But if you want any sort of impact, you need a lot of these. It adds up.<br /><br />Eating candied roses was fun, but definitely a one-time treat.<br /><br />NB: shop around for the best value! "Value" being a relative term here, unfortunately. Is it that hard to candy flowers?

These brownies are easy and fun to make as a mom-and-child activity, and everyone eagerly watches the oven timer to see when they can eat the yummy and nutritious snack.  One neighbor told me that her daughter compared the list of ingredients in "Naturally Nora Doubly Fudge Brownies" with the brownie mix they had on the shelf...and it was a real "Aha!" moment when the daughter said she would only eat natural ingredients she could pronounce.<br /><br />Fabulously fudgy brownies and a 'teaching moment' too!<br /><br />Thank you, Nora, for all of your great products and for taking the worry out of my gifting.

review/summary: OK for "All Natural" but falls short of richer mixes
review/text: Last night, our house was filled with the delicious scent of chocolate as my wife baked batches of Naturally Nora Doubly Fudgy Brownies to give away as Christmas gifts. The mouth-watering aroma was a pleasant accompaniment to the Christmas tree and music.<br /><br />Naturally, when the first batch came out of the oven, my sons (ages 9 and 7) scampered into the kitchen to `negotiate' a nibble before dinner. I waited until after dinner, and after our children had gone to bed. My wife made tea and brought a plate of brownies into the room. I noticed that she wasn't eating.<br /><br />"Don't you like the brownies?" I asked.<br /><br />"They are OK for organic."<br /><br />"They aren't organic. They are `all natural.'"<br /><br />"They are missing something. I don't know what it is, but they're OK for `all natural' or organic."<br /><br />I tried a brownie and couldn't discern the reason my wife was less than enthusiastic about the brownie mix. I'm not a chocolate expert, so I defer to my wife's taste buds when it comes to rich desserts like brownies. I did later learn that the plate of brownies she set down was from the first batch. My wife said she `doctored' the subsequent batches to make them richer.<br /><br />Rating: Three stars.

review/text: Like another reviewer mentioned, these brownies just aren't chocolaty enough. I actually ordered the mix with the chocolate chunks (having already tried the regular) thinking the chunks might add a bit more chocolate flavor, but it just wasn't so. It's such a shame because they bake up perfectly chewy with a sugary top, but for all that great texture and presentation they lack that chocolate fudgy taste. They are bitter and have a slight chemical smell that reminds me of imitation vanilla extract. The 2 stars are for convenience and texture, but even after trying to doctor several boxes with numerous substitutions and additions, a huge portion still ended up in the trash. But not to fret, the Naturally Nora cake and cookie mixes are excellent so if you're in the mood for a home baked chocolate dessert, go with her chocolate cake mix and frosting instead.

review/text: I shared a can of Amy's Organic Chili (Medium) with my boy (3.5 yrs old) for lunch. We had some corn bread crackers with it and a drink (him chocolate milk, me iced tea). The chili was very good, much better than I'm used to coming from a can (14.5 ounces). It cost a bit more but I think it was well worth it. The flavor was excellent. The meat was finely ground and was somewhast granular within the sauce rather than in little chunks of beef. The fat content was fairly low and there was little oil evident when the can was opened, quite unlike other available canned chili. The sodium content was alittle higher than I like, but not bad. The chili had lots of good fiber. It was ever-so slightly spicy, but not nearly as much as the hotter variety. The chili formed a good quality meal and I'll be back for more.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Great Tasting Natural almond Butter, Please note that this is NATURAL almond butter and it does not contain any hydrogenated oils or other chemicals/additives (like most other major brands), so you will have to stir it or mix it when you get it home since the oil will separate and make it runny on top and very firm at the bottom. I like both almond butter flavors and the 3 peanut butter flavors i got with the same order:)I would recommend buying this product from Amazon.com and not from the wild squirrel website since Amazon.com has free shipping:)

review/summary: Alchemy in a Jar
review/text: According to Wikipedia, "Alchemy is the art of liberating parts of the Cosmos from temporal existence and achieving perfection which, for metals is gold, and for man, longevity..." Something I had to borrow to help describe what can only be realized through the mix of ingredients found in the Wild Squirrel Nut Butters. Peanuts, almonds, sunflower seeds with just the right combination of chocolate or vanilla makes these a perfect spread, snack or staple. Like most Baby Boomers, I grew up on one or more of the mainstream brands of peanut butter mixed with jam, spread on toast or scooped with a stick of celery. While one or more of these traditional peanut butters can still be found on my shelf, they are slowly but surely being replaced by Wild Squirrel nut butters. While Vanilla Espresso Almond Butter and Chocolate Sunflower Seed Almond Butter are my particular favorites, I would highly recommend sampling them all which has been made even easier with the addition of single serve pouches. If your looking to expand your peanut butter palate or just want something new to replace the majority of over-salted or sugary snacks, Wild Squirrel Nut Butters provide some highly recommended alternatives.

review/summary: EVERYONE runs away from these!
review/text: These Robbie Dawg snacks have been rejected to the extreme degree by every animal!<br /><br />I bought them originally for a cat whose who loves Temptations snacks. Not only did she not touch these, but when one of these was in her Temptations snack dish, she wouldn't even go near the bowl, as if this snack contaminated all in its vicinity.<br /><br />I next tried it on an outdoors cat who lives in the neighborhood. Since he lives the life of a homeless scavenger, one wouldn't expect him to be picky. Yet not even real hunger would make the bridge for him trying this.<br /><br />All right, how about dogs then? While this was made for cats, my experience is that many dogs will bascially eat anything you hand them (gulp it down first, and ask questions later). Outcome....<br /><br />My neighbor's dog answer: No way. Next two dogs, same answer. One of those dogs I've known for over a decade and this is the very first time she has ever refused anything I've offered her. We left one of these treats on the dining room floor for the evening, and it statyed there all night, until we resigned and threw it in the trash.<br /><br />Also tried it on a pair of rats. These two rats eat brown rice as part of their daily diet and one of them in particular has a liking for fish. Since those are two of the -alleged- ingredients in the product, I should have been hopeful for this match. But no, same answer from these two as everyone else.<br /><br />Last, tossed some into the backyard, just in case any of the many birds out there might be hungry enough to give it a go. Well? I bet you can guess the outcome.<br /><br />All that is left to check, I think, is whether even the ants outdoors give the same answer....<br /><br />It is a major mystery what is going on here. One thing in my mind is that whatever is stated as the ingredients on the package does not correspond to what is in the product I received. That something went badly wrong at the plant, and it would be for lab analysis to actually determine what these little brown block things are actually composed of.<br /><br />All I know for now is that there is a universal verdict from every animal in the jury: it is absolutely inedible.

review/summary: Great for storage, iffy for use with adapter for feeding
review/text: These VIA containers are great for milk storage.  Easy to clean and easy to stack.  However, I have had issues with using them with the blue adapter top for feeding from it.  No matter how firm or hard I screw on the adapter, when the entire unit is assembled, sometimes the bottom cup will just unscrew and fall off.  After having one too many bottles of pumped milk fall on the floor or come apart on the counter, etc. I refuse to use these for feeding from.<br /><br />I do use these with the Avent ISIS for pumping and then immediate storage.  However, your better off transferring the milk to a regular hard plastic Avent bottle to do feeding from, don't use these for feedings.

review/summary: Good idea, Really bad execution
review/text: I bought these to store my milk in while I pumped at work.  I liked that they hold about 6 oz, and I use Avent bottles, and thought it'd be good quality.  I was VERY disappointed because once you start using them, the lids stop working properly- they become extremely hard to close because they don't seem to screw on correctly.  And once you think it's screwed in well, you push down on the lid and it's still loose.  Many times when I get home, I find that milk has spilled out of the bottles while I was driving!!  And another problem is that when milk gets in the grooves of the lid, it makes it really hard to open.  And when you put it in the refrigerator, and milk gets cold, it's almost like it becomes glue in the grooves. So you're fighting to open the lid, just to have it spill when you finally open it because you're using so much force.  Sure, it's nice that the bottles stack, and it's easy to store the lids together, but at the end of the day, do not use this to store milk.  I'm a working mom and EVERY drop of milk I pump is priceless.  Unfortunately Avent didn't do a good job in designing this for it's primary purpose - to save and store milk.  Oh, I also went to the Avent website and saw in their Q&A section a question about the lid/leakage problem.  The answer in the website was that they didn't recommend using these more than FOUR times because the cups/lids become warped and could lead to leakage.  Really?  Four times?  I mean, did they really expect me to buy a new package each week?

review/summary: Good concept but the lids aren't
review/text: I like the concept that you can pump right into them and feed out of them as well.  The problem is that the blue lids are a pain in the butt to get off but if you don't screw them on tight enough then they will leak. I bought two boxes of them and I am kind of disappointed because I have really ended up not liking to use them because they are two hard to get the lids off and at 2am you don't want to fight with the lids and then spilling it all over the place.

review/summary: I LOVE THIS SYSTEM!
review/text: EBF family, so a pump is a must! These cups fit perfectly with my pump, and I love how I can keep a bunch stacked with lids in my pump case. This is a huge timesaver.<br />Since we started feeding rice cereal, I use these cups to mix the cereal and breastmilk in, and love that I can use them in the warmer, as opposed to a bowl.<br /><br />To the negatives I've seen in some reviews: most of these can be fixed with a little common sense.<br />1. Lids leaking- just check them! These don't leak if on right. I see if I can push on the lid- if it moves, or makes a popping sound, I re- thread it in while pushing down gently. Works for me.<br />2. You can use them way more than 3x! I've used the same 10 pack for 6 months, still in great condition!<br />3. Writing the Dates- I hand wash these- write date/time in PEN and it washes off! I just use the scrubby side of the sponge, and it comes right off! No need to cross off! Of course, I don't use permanent markers.<br />4. They are a little bulky, but only when full, and not too much. They fit just fine in my cooler pack, and I love that I can pump directly in them, stick em in the fridge, or bring them to the car for a trip! It helps that if we are traveling, when we get to our destination I just wash & sterilize & can re use them the whole trip. Scene they stack in each other when empty, it takes up much less room than bringing 4 bottles!<br /><br />The only thing I'm not in love with is the plastic smell. This has been true across all brands of plastic baby bottles I've come across, so not just Avent - specific. When I heat the milk, I may transfer into a fresh cup which does the trick.<br />For the adapters, I did buy a second pack, and now keep two dome adapters in the pump bag,while I have the other 2 available to convert the others into a bottle or sippy cup.

review/summary: Very happy
review/text: Good product! Glad to have an alternate solution to storage bags! Whoever said "don't cry over spilt milk" must have never breastfed! I like the larger storage bottles better but these work out just fine. I was worried when I read how someone struggled to put the lids on so I tested it out first thing by filling it with water and dropping it on the ground. Didn't have any problems! Sure you do want to pay attention as to not miss thread them and perhaps wiggle it around to make sure the lid is on well but it does just fine. The biggest complaint I have is to how easy it is to over fill it because you may not be aware that it is overfilled until the cap is on and the milk is running over. Overall I'm happy with these things. Don't have an Avent bottle to test out the compatibility but to be honest, I don't even want to try.

review/summary: Awesome product
review/text: I have used agave for many things and find that it is a better alternative to sugar.  It will not give you the sugar plunge you get from sugary products.  If you are using this product in beverages please realize that it is not going to give you that same sugary, syrupy flavor that some people are used to from regular sugar or substitutes.  It is a subtle sweetness.<br /><br />I have served this product to friends, and those who are used to a sugary taste in their tea didn't care for it as much as those friends who don't use a lot of sugar.  It really depends on what you are used to.  I have no complaints about this product.<br /><br />Agave is also better for people who have diabetes, as it does not spike blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Don't pass up on trying this great alternative to sugar.  It is worth letting your tastebuds adapt to the subtleness.  It is also great for baking.  Also, this is now labeled as organic, so another reason to try it.

review/summary: convenient way of taking your agave with you!
review/text: I was hesitant about this product based on some customer reviews that said there were difficulties opening the little sticks and that they (the customers, not the sticks) got agave all over their fingers... I wonder if Stash read the reviews and changed their packaging?  I have not had this problem, and I'm usually *awful* at opening packaging! With these, I simply bite off the end (gross, I know, but I am a student and I don't/can't carry a knife around with me in my bookbag all day) and squeeze it into my coffee.  It's a great way to have my agave with me because most coffee shops and cafes have not yet started stocking this alongside their poisonous sugar alternatives (you know, those pink, blue, and yellow packets).  Keeps my blood sugar from spiking, sweetens my coffee--what more could you ask for?

review/summary: Smell delightful, taste not so much
review/text: I picked up these honey sticks because I'm in a chai tea phase and thought they'd be nice to add to a simple black tea. Upon taking one from the box, I was treated to a wonderful scent of cinnamon and spices that reminded me of Christmas time.  I brewed my tea, added the stick of honey and stirred.  As I took that first sip, I couldn't much smell the honey I just added.  As the tea coated my tongue I was waiting and waiting for the scent of the honey stick to hit my tongue and it never really did. I could taste a tiny bit of honey, but nothing more than if I added plain clover honey to my tea.  It was rather underwhelming.  My second cup I tried 2 sticks and it was a little better, but for the price, I'd much rather just buy chai tea bags.<br /><br />All in all, don't expect it to taste the way it smells.  Far too weak in just a simple black tea, but smells divine still sealed up!

review/text: I agree with other reviewers about Agave in general and also specifically this product.  Know that I have a pretty big sweet tooth, and thanks to Agave I feel I'm slowly taming it.  I do find Agave to be sufficiently satisfying -- with the right amount.  And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.  I have not found this to be the case.<br /><br />Regarding the sticks specifically, you do have to squeeze fairly hard and repeatedly to get it all out, and inevitably some gets on your fingers.  However, given the above pluses, in the absence of anything better I'm willing to settle for the drawbacks as opposed to putting sugar or -- quel horreur -- artificial sweetners into my body when I'm away from home.

review/summary: Deceptive Term = "Sticks"
review/text: When I ordered these, based on the description, I thought the honey was somehow hardened into stick-form and thus would 'melt' into a cup of hot tea.  I was surprised when I discovered these sticks were actually thin plastic straws filled with honey!  There is no way I'm going to insert a plastic straw into a hot cup of tea. I'm not sure it would work anyway; I suppose you could cut open each end and then blow the honey in the tea.  Does Stash think you're going to sip on these straws?  I don't know what the company was thinking when they produced this product, other than as a candy to be eaten.<br /><br />I believe the term "stick" does not accurately describe this product and is misleading.  I doubt it's intentional, however.  The Stash Tea Company is an excellent company and has many high quality teas and products.<br /><br />The honey flavored with chai spices is good enough but frankly, it it a very expensive way to buy honey.  Better to buy a jar and flavor it yourself.  I wound up using these Chai Honey Sticks by cutting open one end and pressing out the honey into a tea cup/pot, which was messy and time consuming.<br /><br />I love Stash tea... drink it every morning.  But this product is a bust and I would never purchase it again.

The second time they arranged return of the wrong item nut kept saying a manager is needed to talk about my order.  3 days later and no calls nor emails back.  Also, they seldom answer the phone.  The products may be good if you get them but way too much stress.

review/summary: Smooooooth!
review/text: This coffee is VERY smooth and not acidity like some others.<br /><br />I have never liked instant coffee, thanks to a friend I tried Colcafe and loved it, so I decided to give Sello Rojo a try since its from the same family but its NON-Instant.<br /><br />I like my coffee real strong, so this coffee managed to be strong without giving me any heartburn, and that my friend its a HUGE selling point for me since I love coffee but have days when some coffee brands would give me excess amount of heartburn.<br /><br />Overall this bag has 17.6oz of true Colombian coffee for $8.99. I usually pay about $4 and change for 10oz of the local brand *Cough*Bustelo*Cough* and pay around the same $8 for 12oz of "goumet" coffee *Cough* Starbucks *Cough* Khalua *Cough* Godiva *Cough*Cough*Cough*.

review/summary: oblong
review/text: The color is that perfect oblong gold - yes should be. But I both the same tea and color is almost black and tea is dry. Not fresh.<br />Before both from Adagio.com - always was perfect. It is better to pay $4-$5 more and get a good stuff.

review/summary: A lovely Oolong without the tea shop price.
review/text: I enjoy loose leaf teas...and this Oolong is lovely.  I can get three pots of tea off of one set of leaves.  (A good oolong should give you multiple pots off of one batch of leaves a lot like high quality grean tea will.)<br /><br />The flavor is delicate and flowery.  The color is that perfect oolong gold.  If you're looking for an inexpensive oolong that doesn't cost $50/lb...I highly recommend it.  Yes...there are better teas out there if you hit the gourmet shop...but if oolong is one of your everyday teas this won't disappoint.

review/summary: Excellent flavor for an out-of-the-box Pho
review/text: This is a great product.  It is fairly convenient to make, and I found the flavor to be very authentic.  I have been eating at Vietnamese restaurants for a long time, and the flavor of the soup is right up there with some of my favorite places.  Having tried my hand at recreating the flavor at home, I can assure you that the soup packet is much easier.  Yes, you do need to add your own meat and vegetables, but would you want that stuff to come out of the box?  I've been using chicken broth and chicken (note that the meat option says to use beef).  I also recommend adding a thinly sliced onion to the broth when you start to get that authentic flavor.<br /><br />This is the perfect product if you have celiac, as it is gluten free and you can control what goes into it.

review/summary: Fantastic Pho
review/text: Happy Pho is fantastic. Delicious, healthy AND easy to make. I've made the soup and I've used the noodles alone in stir-fry. Both were delicious.<br /><br />I traveled to Vietnam a couple years ago and have been a big fan of pho ever since.  When a friend mentioned Happy Pho to me, I went ahead and ordered some.  Healthy Pho I can make at home?? I'm in. Keep in mind that I'm a bachelor and don't do a lot of cooking.<br /><br />The first time i wanted to make it, I realized i didn't have a few of the basic ingredients that it calls for. So I just stir-fried the noodles with broccoli. The noodles are made from whole grains yet only 2 minutes to boil? A healthy bachelor's dream. In fact, since then I figured out that its pretty easy to just cook them straight in the wok. But I digress.. The noodles were delicious! The tastiest noodles i can recall making at home.<br /><br />Ok, second time around I went all out and made the Pho soup. I rarely cook for other people, but i had someone coming over so figured we'd eat in, and I'd cook Happy Pho. I felt like Kung Fu Pandd making my delicious secret soup!  I was a little nervous, since i hadn't tried the spice pack. Well, it was delicious too.  My friend and I both loved it, and it only took about 10 minutes to do everything..<br /><br />Its a keeper! I can easily see it becoming one of my healthy bachelor staples.

review/summary: From a Happy Mo Pho!
review/text: OMG-dreams really do come true.  I wished for a product that was healtful, gluten-free, easy and quick to prepare, fun to eat, and tastes amazing and found Happy Pho.  I have made it the vegetarian way each time and even my carnivorous husband loves it!  (I take all the credit, but all i really did was boil the water!)

review/text: I love PHO.  I could eat it all the time.  The problem is that PHO isn't so good for those with health issues that require low sodium and low carbs.  In comes HAPPY PHO and I'm happy once again!  This stuff is great.  I could and do eat it 3 times a week.

review/summary: Wow!  Super Delicious!
review/text: I truly enjoy this wonderful soup!  I picked it up at my local store figuring it would be a quick and easy lunch when I was in a hurry.  It is that, but it is also an amazing dinner!  I added some bok choy, cilantro, beef and voila..Dinner!  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our cheap and delicious dinner. You can basically add any type of meat and veggie you would like or not add anything at all...either way it is really delicious.  The spice pack adds just the perfect flavor. I am now purchasing this stuff by the case!

review/text: Just tried your Happy Pho noodles last night. I sliced up mushrooms, zuchini and squash and added it to the mix. I let it stand so the vegetables could soak up the broth and it was great!!<br />Thank you for a superior product.

review/text: My husband would eat Pho every day of the week if I had the time and NOW, I do! These are so convenient and very authentic! The flavor is just like it was simmering in my kitchen all day. I love the brown rice noodles as well!  Our family was nothing but impressed. :)

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I bought a box of the Garlic Goodness.  It's delicious!  The noodles are as good as or better than the best pho noodles I've had, and I really like the flavors in the spice packet.  Plus, you can add salt to your liking, unlike most other soups which are loaded with sodium.  The directions for cooking the beef, however, will cause it to come out tough.  I recommend using super thin, decently marbled beef (like the brisket at Korean BBQ restaurants) and just put it raw on top of the soup after the noodles have been cooked.  Also, use lots of lime juice and fresh mint!

review/summary: Genius!
review/text: I love this stuff. If you're like me, you LOVE pho but love being healthy too and sometimes the two just don't mesh well together. No, this does not taste EXACTLY like the pho you'll get at a good Vietnamese place...but it's close enough and a lot better for you. I mixed mine with vegetable broth and tofu instead of the standard beef broth and meat trimmings. I would test this out if you're even halfway thinking about it. If you end up hating it, you can send the leftover boxes to me! :P
