review/summary: Unprepared
review/text: I was planning on using this product as a dietary supplement and I had the wrong idea of this product and perhaps didn't read the right reviews.  I was expecting something like other liquid supplements that I've taken in the past.  This is very very similar to crisco.  For me it was the texture that I was unprepared for.

review/summary: Smells terrible, but works great for skin
review/text: This is just my opinion, but I think this coconut oil smells terrible! I have to turn my head in the opposite direction wen using it because I hate it that much. However, that's just my thought on it and I realize other people love the smell-so you'll have to try it to see what you think.<br /><br />I use this in the shower as my last step before getting out. It melts right in your hand when you use it and absorbs in your skin fairly quick. I don't have to put additional lotion on after the shower, which is<br />awesome.<br /><br />Also-I recently got a pretty bad sunburn and have been using the oil on it. It works MUCH better than aloe and it took away the painful sting.<br /><br />You just can't beat this product for the size and the cost.

Effa Gold met all the ingredient requirements we were advised to look for before purchase.<br /><br />We had also tried other brands before settling on Effa Gold, but always found that nothing could compare to this product.  Plus, buying it from Amazon is so convenient.  You provide an automatic refill, relieving me of always having to remember to reorder, plus reducing the cost of each jar of the oil.<br /><br />.

review/summary: Coconut Your Way to Health
review/text: I have been using coconut oil for my hair and skin for sometime.  I'm not sure about it's benefits for my hair alone as I combine it with oils.  For skin, I find it to treat dryness better than any over the counter skin lotions.  Recently, I've become aware of benefits of ingesting coconut oil.  I do believe it gives me more<br />energy and helps lower my blood pressure.  I also use it for oil pulling of teeth and find it to loosen particles from teeth dental floss can't reach.  The cooking<br />benefits of coconut oil cannot go unmentioned as it does have a rather high smoking point.  I love the taste of fried chicken,fish and popcorn and the knowledge that<br />this is one of the most healthy cooking oils.  I find the 32 Oz OfaGold Coconut Oil<br />most disirable as this size can last a whole month for all the things I use it for.

For me this adds no taste only a slight coconut smell to food. And the coconut smell is not strong.

review/text: This product is the one I stick to, for the price and quality.  There is a good balance and smooth coconut flavor with this oil.  Trader joe's brand is bland by comparison, and many others also fall short of this brand.  Whole food's own brand is the only one I like better but at $10+ and more per 16oz, this one is the best deal.

review/summary: High Quality CO!
review/text: I use this coconut oil daily, in many ways, and find it to be a fantastic, quality brand. I stop short of eating spoonfuls straight from the jar, but I bet it'd taste good. It definitely smells very nice and adds a wonderful, tropical flavor to my green smoothies. Works well as a replacement for other oils/butter in cooking. I also use this oil topically as a moisturizer and deodorant (really!) and it works wonders on my dry patches of skin. Those of you that cannot stand the taste/smell of coconut may want to consider a different, more refined brand, as Nature's Way is noticeably coconut-y.

review/text: Isn't the price supposed to get cheaper when you buy in lager quantities? With this product, the 16oz price is simply doubled for the 32oz size. What kind of benefit is that? Why would anyone bother paying before they have to by getting a lager size before the smaller size run out, when you're paying the same price anyway? Just get it when you need it, or you might find something even cheaper by the time the 16oz runs out, then you can really save money.

review/summary: Tasty, Healthy, and Practical
review/text: I've been eating Wasa Crisp Bread for the past 10 years with cream cheese, jam, ham, and other toppings for breakfast and sometimes dinner. It is quite filling despite being so light.  I like the Multigrain the best because it feels and tastes more substantial than the others.  Some people complain that it is too hard - but that's how it is. That is the reason it is so good - it feels like toast, but you don't have to toast it. It is not rock hard, just hard enough so that you use your teeth. Even my 16 month old son eats it... So if you've only eaten soft Wonder Bread all your life this might not be for you.<br /><br />Another advantage is that it lasts a long time unrefrigerated (just keep it in a zip lock to avoid bugs) so is very practical to have around for a quick meal.  I suggest using a tray to put butter and cheese on it, otherwise it will break if you use an uneven plate.

review/summary: Good teeth strengthener
review/text: Originally looked to buy the WASA Light Rye, but it was out-of-stock. So, bought the Sourdough Rye and Multi Grain instead, and glad I did because they have broadened my selection of favorite WASA brand crispbreads. And while I normally avoid products with yeast, I feel that the toasty crispness of the Multi Grain has neutralized any negative aspects (that yeast is a negative is my story, and I'm stickin' to it!) that may be derived from containing yeast. As for varied uses, it's equally great for strengthening the teeth (and should be a great weight loss adjunct because it is not easy to eat fast, and requires some mastication which should satisfy the need to have eaten) when eaten as a cracker, or mechanically grinding to a pouder for use to coat salmon coquettes. Oh, some more good news is that moths will try to eat through a package of rye crispbreads, which means what's inside is edible for humans too. I keep mine stored in the freezer because it is so valuable. Should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well. Still my preference among all the WASA crispbreads is the light rye. Only 2 ingredients, rye flour and sea salt. Just give me the simple life... without the two accompanying airheads, that is.

Yes, someone referred to Wasa Crispbreads as "hard tack".  My Dad had something similar in the house when I grew up, as well.  It was so great to discover Wasa years later.<br /><br />I haven't ordered from Amazon yet, since I often can get it locally for $1.70 per 9.7 oz. package.<br /><br />Crunch or munch fans, this is a great replacement for chips, crackers, etc.  Current nutrition says 45 calories per 14g slice (20 per pack) zero fat, 80 mg sodium, 10g carbs, 2g fiber, 0g sugar, 2g protein, 13g whole grains.<br /><br />I love the flavor, but if one is accustomed to refined and processed foods, this may be an "acquired taste".  Highly recommend.  Will subscribe here if Amazon knocks several dollars off the case price.

review/text: This cheese is so creamy, smoky and smooth, it's amazing on baguettes or crackers, or just by itself! I only wish I could find this cheese locally, or that shipping wasn't so high. I am glad to find it here on Amazon, as I'd been searching for quite some time in various cheese shops, grocery stores and delicatessens here, to no avail. If you've never tried it but like smoky cheeses like smoked swiss, gouda, mozzerella etc., you are in for a treat!

review/summary: Great tasting juice
review/text: I've been buying this juice every since it first came on the market and I really love the taste.  The diet drink is only 5 calories and to me I can't really tell the difference between the diet and the regular drink.  I drink this juice all the time and it really helps during cold and flu season.  A co-worker had a really bad cold she couldn't get rid of and I brought in a bottle of the juice and with a few cold meds she finally got over her cold.  She now drinks it on a regular basis now and have not had a cold.  I think the juice tastes wonderful and so does the rest of my co-workwers.

review/summary: What a disappointment!
review/text: We love most everything blueberry.  Was really looking forward to trying this diet blueberry juice.  Should have read the label before purchase, but trusted Ocean Spray products in general.  Turns out there is only 4 percent fruit juice in this product and drinking it readily proves it.  It tasted like a very weak grape-flavored popular powder drink mix that has a smiling glass pitcher on its packet. Don't waste your money, this is not blueberry and hardly even a juice.

review/text: I absolutely love the taste and texture of these bars!  They are very satisfying and fill me up when I'm feeling the need to snack on something.  In fact, I don't even need to eat an entire bar in order to satisfy my hunger or craving. I sometimes eat one in the morning for breakfast and it satisfies me throughout the morning until lunchtime.  They aren't too sweet and I feel that the protein from the peanuts helps stabilize my blood sugar.  I will definitely continue buying these bars. They've become my favorite snack when I need a boost!  The combination of crunchy and chewy texture is delicious!

review/summary: i like it! a lot!
review/text: Just picked up one of these at target and after trying it yesterday i must say that i quite like this flavor!  I'm not sure why some of the reviews are low. I love spinach, but I tried this flavor and the spinach w/tofu one and i was surprised to find that I prefer the chicken flavor.  I don't like mushrooms at all, the flavor & texture are repulsive to me. Sometimes i can get past the shittake in Chinese stir-fry, but otherwise i can't stomach them. So i was worried that i wouldn't be able to handle the few mushroom slices in this soup, but it turns out that they did not bother me one bit. They do not have a mushroomy flavor or texture and i ate them with no problem.<br /><br />One thing lacking in this soup is the veggies. There's not a whole heck of a lot but that is to be expected i guess. I always find that I wish for more veggies in these instant noodle soups no matter the brand. So I recently bought bags of freeze-dried "just peas" and "just corn" to throw into my instant soups and they are proving to be a great investment. It's great because you can control the amount you add, i can really "beef-up" my soups with lots of corn n peas if i choose to. I plan on getting carrots next....anyway, I added a little extra corn in this soup before preparing & it was great :)

review/summary: I love this soup!
review/text: Annie Chun's Chinese Chicken is one of my favorites! Of the Annie Chun soup bowls, I've also tried the Udon, Pho (another big favorite), and Miso. I can't decide if I like the Chicken or the Pho the best, they are both quite tasty. I found the taste fine on its own, but if you think it is bland you could try to add less water and see if that improves it for you. I don't use the microwave method - I boil the water first, often I will pour some in with just the noodles, put the lid on and shake over the sink and then drain it to separate the noodles. Then I add the veggies, flavor packet and water (to the "water line" or just over it), and wait the two minutes or so before eating. It's convenient and delicious. I really think it's great that it is made with high quality ingredients - not many of these convenient soup bowls have organic and premium ingredients - which is probably one of the reasons these soup bowls are higher priced than your average ramen bowl (and these bowls taste much better than those cheap & salty soup bowls too). Definitely worth a try! The chicken and pho bowls are probably good intro soups in this line; but give any flavor that interests you a try and see which is your favorite. Also, they use minimal packaging and biodegradable bowls so those of us who are environmentally conscious can feel good about that too.

review/summary: The Best Instant Noodle Meals You Can Buy!
review/text: Why?  Because the noodles come SOFT, sealed in plastic!  If you are tired of noodles that "crunch" or that have to be reconstituted out of the original cardboard, you are in for a treat!  Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)<br /><br />Note: Of them all I believe this to be my least favorite flavor.  Why? Because it is the blandest.  I think this was intended to be the one that entices ordinary Americans unfamiliar with Asian foods into sampling their products, but in the process they overdid it, producing a rather boring extremely mild tasting chicken soup with of course their excellent thick, soft, Hokkien noodles.  I'd agree with other reviewers that this is the one you are most likely to want to add things to in order to spice it up.

review/summary: Pleasant ginger taste, soft non fried noodle, but a bit bland. An 'on sale' purchase only
review/text: I thought that adding ginger to chicken soup was pleasantly tasty, but it was a bit bland. I wish this had more ginger flavor. If you dont have MSG, or more salt, you gotta add something. The vegetables were still pretty hard - I cooked it by adding boiling water and waiting 3 minutes. Also, there was a very small amount of pieces of vegetables. I think even one or two actual slices of mushroom would increase the perceived value greatly. The noodles reconstituted nicely, as they do with all versions of these soups, and there was a nice serving of them. I would have liked to see maybe even slightly less noodles if it meant more vegetables. An optional spice flavor packet would be really nice too.<br /><br />I didnt think this was bad but I wasnt that impressed. This would probably be improved with a little soy sauce or spice. I know they are trying to limit the salt but i've had other soups with 1000mg of sodium (the amount in this soup - they claim 2 servings but thats a joke and deceives many people) or less, and it tasted better. Also, when cooking, do not use more water then specified. 1 cup is enough; any more will substantially dilute the taste. I would recommend trying this once but after that, unless its $1.50 or less, I dont think its a repeat for me.<br /><br />I saw this at my local publix for - get this - a whopping $4.79. Its certainly NOT worth that price. With annie chun you are partly paying for the gimmick - the cornstarch recyclable packaging, charity donations, organic ingredients, no msg (although does contain yeast extract which has free glutimates I believe..), etc.<br /><br />My recommendation is to only pick this up if you see it on sale, and then add in something extra - maybe even more ginger. If you are able, some diced chicken would really improve this soup. If you are on the go, you could also add canned chicken breast since its shelf stable. I think the overall consensus is that if you were to try any one of these annie chun soups, try the udon.

I've thrown in raisins and chopped veggies which work ok - but plain for this seems best.<br /><br />Anyway- if you are feeding a bunch of people - this is a good option.

review/text: I bought this product at Yoke's in Sandpoint, Idaho, and it's fabulous. Hot, hot, black pepper flavor with a savory burn that feels good on a crisp winter morning. A real plus for me is that it has NO MSG. But the real reason why I can eat this is that it has no soy protein of any kind. Soy is an extreme allergen in certain people, like me, and frankly, has no business being in food. I salute Old Trapper for making a delicious, soy-free, MSG-free peppered beef jerky (my favorite flavor) at a reasonable price. MADE IN USA.

review/summary: Really good pasta!
review/text: Most "multi-colored" pastas lose both flavor and color with cooking, and you end up with a bunch of noodles that are sort of gray-ish and relatively bland.<br /><br />NOT SO with this product!  The flavors and colors hold up well in cooking.  The mixture of shapes adds interest and vibrancy to any pasta dish.<br /><br />I've used this pasta for baked chicken alfredo, for pasta with sausage and peppers, and for a quick pasta with marinara sauce.  The flavor is excellent in all three dishes.<br /><br />Although this is a 10-oz package, it cooks up to an amount equivalent to a 12-oz package of lower-quality pasta.<br /><br />Finally -- this high-quality pasta is lower in calories and fat (and higher in fiber due to the veggies) than others -- which translates to lower points if you're on Weight Watchers: about 200 calories or 4 pts per generous serving.<br /><br />All things considered, this is an excellent value.

review/summary: Decent quality but a few shortcomings
review/text: This is a nice quality cup and infuser -- it's sturdy and comfortable.  The infuser is resistant to staining and the little lid that is used to keep the heat in when steeping can be turned upside-down to act as a holder for the wet infuser when you remove it from the tea.<br /><br />However, there are some problems.  My main complaint is the design of the infuser.  The sides are a nice, fine mesh whereas the bottom is plastic with some perforations.  These holes in the bottom allow small leaf bits to flow-out.  I have a Teeli infuser that has the mesh in the bottom also and it keeps all of the leaves contained.  Second, and far more minor, the cup is rather small.  It makes a nicely sized cup of tea, but if you're used to drinking from larger cups and mugs, you will find yourself gulping this one down pretty quickly.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad product and if it had the full mesh infuser, I would have given it 4 stars.

review/summary: Good for tea, difficult to hold...
review/text: I got this little guy as a small Xmas present, and have been pleased with it.  Very useful.  I agree with small bits of tea comments above through the holes in the bottom of the infuser, but it's such a small amount that it wouldn't cause anyone trouble.  The general ergonics of the design are lacking.  It's quite hard to hold by the handle, with no way to leverage the cup vertical (fingers slip down the handle).  Only way I can figure out is to hold the cup itself, fingers through the handle but only near the very tip of the rim when hot.  Needless to say, I enjoy using it, and the lip does have some significance to it, so it can be held in this manner quite easily.<br /><br />Looking forward to many tea infusions at work now, and moving up to better loose teas in purchases.  :)

review/summary: For those who want to drink real tea.
review/text: It absolutely amazes me that some people spend over two dollars for a single cup of coffee, yet still buy those low cost tea bags from the grocery store, and then claim to like coffee better.  Many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea.  Good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all.  It should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected.  The cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf.  Yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.<br /><br />Unless you're really lazy (which, I admit, I am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag.  Teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag.  Why?  Because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor.  You can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. Cost Plus), or tea shoppes.<br /><br />Now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person.  This mug solve the single serving dilemma.  It's big, sturdy, and made of glass.  The most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser.  It looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug.  Just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there.  The result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank.  The brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink.  If you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but I believe the right tea needs none of that.<br /><br />To make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes.  No - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out.  Just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down  until the desired temperature is reached.  Count those seconds.  Next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug.  Easy.<br /><br />I suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one.  My personal favorite is Green Well Green Tea, but I still have a lot to try.<br /><br />Tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer.  Quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.

review/summary: Great little product!
review/text: This is really a fantastic little product.  I am using mine for the first time this morning to brew some Yerba mate 'gringo style' and it works great.<br /><br />I would give it five stars but the other reviewer has a point, the holes on the bottom of the infuser do let out little pieces of the tea, however a bit of common sense can get around this problem.<br /><br />After you load up your tea and put the lid on the infuser, turn it upside town (holes up), and shake vigorously.  The small particles will sift to the bottom (the top) so when you turn it back over they're all at the top of the tea.  Problem solved.<br /><br />One other problem I just discovered is that the lid of the infuser doesn't seal so after you're done making your tea and you turn the infuser over to set it down (holes up) the liquid still in the tea slowly leaks out the bottom to make a small mess on your counter.  Not cool!

review/summary: Nice, light useful tea filter
review/text: The glass mug is excellent, sturdy, thick enough not to transfer too much heat when it's full of hot tea, and you can see the color of the tea inside, easily.<br /><br />The infusor is big enough to allow even the boldest of teas to unfurl completely.  The white plastic of the mesh is surprisingly impervious to staining, and the plastic structure is strong and flexible. It's not the finest mesh I've come across so some dust will end up in your tea, but it's as good as most of the commercial filters.<br /><br />The lid that helps keep steeping heat in the infusor when steeping doubles as a holder for the infusor when you take it out of the tea.  It's very useful for the office and anywhere you can't get to a dish for holding the filter easily.<br /><br />I like it a lot.

review/summary: Small tea flakes will fall through
review/text: I've been using this cup/filter combo everyday for 2 months or so.  The cup is nicely constructed and I have no problems with it.<br /><br />However, the filter does not perform very well if you use tea leaves that are very small.  I drink PG Tips loose leaf everyday, 3 times a day.  The leaves are fine and the holes at the bottom of the filter allow the tiniest tea particles to fall through.  If this doesn't bother you, the system works.  If you don't like tea particles at the bottom of your clear cup, it will begin to annoy you.  I bought this system thinking that the few flakes at the bottom of the cup would not bother me but i have resorted to using the filter in another cup and pouring the leaf-free liquid into my drinking cup because there are many unfiltered leaves at the bottom of the cup.  Imagine the entire bottom of the cup covered in the tiniest leaf particles...<br /><br />Also, the filter stains easily.  After two months, there is a hint of yellow orange stain on the side filters.<br /><br />Therefore, if you use larger tea leaves, this system may work decently for you.  If you drink tea like the loose leaf PG Tips that have fine leaves, I would look for an alternative.  Hope this review helps people thinking about drinking PG Tips with this system.

review/summary: Neat and tidy tea mug infuser
review/text: I have recently been brewing my own herbal blend infusions, not actually tea, and have found this mug to fit my needs.  The mug is simple and streamlined, and very easy to use.  I appreciate the mug and infuser design, which is sturdy and clean.<br /><br />I simply boil my water in the glass in the microwave, add my herbal blend to the infuser basket, and dunk the basket into the mug.  I let it set for however long I want, then reheat in the glass as appropriate, and enjoy.<br /><br />My only concern is that the infuser would be nice if it had a plunger mechanism.  I just press the herbs with a spoon to get the full flavor.  Also, the mug does not hold heat, and I usually like my infusion boiling hot!<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product, which I anticipate much use out of.

review/summary: NOT 13 ounces as Listed.  Misrepresented, only 10 ozs. (0.3 liter)
review/text: this is a thick, clear glass cup/mug.  it is unlike <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N3D61S">Bodum New YoYo Personal Tea Maker Set, includes YoYo Black Infuser and 12-Ounce Mug</a>, which i already own, in that this mug is NOT double-walled, thermally insulated.  this means the glass gets very hot making it necessary to handle the mug by the handle only.  this also means the tea cools down much quicker.  i prefer my tea cup lose heat slowly as i take my time enjoying the tea.  i bought 3 of these believing they were 13 ounce size.  as of the date of this review, the seller has this mug listed as 13 ounces.  it is only 10 ounces.  i really wanted that extra 3 ounces and would not have purchased this product if i knew it was the smaller 10 ounce size.<br /><br />on the plus side. i prefer the plastic mesh infuser.  i've owned both types of infuser, plastic and metal.  in my experience the plastic infuser has surprisingly remained intact much longer.  my metal infusers have come apart while cleaning.  i have never had to discard a plastic infuser.  neither infuser type had a "taste" that transferred to my tea drink.  in fact they had no taste at all.<br /><br />knowing what i now know, the noninsulated glass and smaller size make it not worth buying for me.  others may consider it a value.  if you haven't already, do try one of double-walled, thermally, insulated, type tea containers from bodum.

review/summary: So Far, So Good.
review/text: Some sediment will fall through the bottom but i found that this usually occurs when you first put the tea in the yo yo.  Solution:  Hold the Yo Yo over your tea container/tin while while loading it.  Then, give it a little shake so that it settles and anything that will fall out falls back into your possession for later use.  Once it is all in there very little falls out.  Then, when you add the water, the tea swells up a bit making it very difficult to get through the small holes.<br /><br />The cup is larger than i'm used to but it's a welcomed change.  I'm not sure what size Big Gulp cups the below reviewer is using for his or her tea, but this one is certainly adequate.  Also, i really like watching the tea brew through the clear glass.  It comes with a cover that also acts as a base that you can set the Yo Yo on.  This will eliminate any mess made by dripping.<br /><br />Cleaning the Yo Yo, for me, involves turning it upside down and give it a couple soft taps against the included cover/base.  The tea usually just falls right out on command.  A quick rinse in the sink and it looks brand new again.<br /><br />And oh, by the way, it makes a great cup of tea.

Other than that little issue, it has been fantastic.<br /><br />I drink approximately five cups of tea per day

review/summary: Good price on organic sugar
review/text: Organic sugar is hard to find and usually comes in small packages.  While this does indeed come in 12 bags of 1.5 pounds each, the cost per pound is great.  I just cut the bags open and put four in my canister at once.  It seems like a waste of packaging but until they offer a larger package of organic sugar this will have to do.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the Domino organic sugar in the store, which I haven't, it is more coarse than the refined sugar you might be used to and has a slightly darker color and a bit more caramel taste.  It is similar to most other organic sugars though.  I've used it in all of my traditional recipes and haven't had any problem.

review/summary: Does NOT contain 120% Iron!!!
review/text: After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error.

review/text: I had purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QOKSRK">Hartz 8 Oz Dental Pig Ear Pieces  98413</a> for my 8 week old Golden Retriever.  She wanted nothing to do with them.  Then I gave her one of these and she is acting as if I just put a nice juicy steak in front of her (even though she just ate).  Looks like it's going to keep her busy for a while.  We'll see.

review/summary: My dogs love them, but why is the 24 pack more per ear than the 12 or 20 pack?
review/text: My dogs just about freeze in place when I pull the bag out they are so focused on that bag! Great quality and sizing is pretty uniform.<br /><br />Order the 20 pack for best pricing, the 24 pack is more per ear.  I do not understand...

review/summary: Tasty, made in USA, but not very durable....
review/text: These seem tasty, my dog loves them.  They say they are made in USA and all natural, which is good.<br /><br />However, my dog devours these ears in about 20 minutes.  The other pig ears we bought in the pet store take him 2-4 days to completely chew up...  But these don't even last an hour.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 3 month old doberman.

review/summary: Smokehouse pig ears with no smoke...
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Y2TWQ">Smokehouse 100-Percent Natural Smoked Pig Ears Dog Treats, 24-Pack</a>  I was disappointed in the quality of this product.  The pig ears where supposed to have been "smoked" but they have zero smoke smell and almost smell a little on the spoiled side.  The pig ears cost $1.25 each when you buy them in the 24 count bag which is the same price I can buy non-smoked pig ears locally at Petco and Pet Smart.  Also the size of the pig ears are on the small side compared to similar products I have purchased in the past at the same price from other suppliers.  There is nothing really wrong with the product, my Boxer will chew them up regardless.  I guess I was expecting a higher grade pig ear based on the Amazon product description than what I actually received.

review/summary: IT'S A SMALL, SMALL EAR
review/text: After researching "roasted pig ears" for my beloved dog, I chose this product...the package arrived in a timely manner; the bag was so small and lightweight I couldn't believe it contained my order...Unfortunately it did. I didn't bother to un-tie the hand-knotted bag but put the LIGHTWEIGHT package back into the box in which it arrived and will now return them...For the price paid, I could go to one of the local pet supply stores and purchase MORE than 24 ears...and also would have an ear large enough to satisfy my large mix-breed pet! These ears are SMALL...while they appear to be ears, not strips, they are ridiculously small and have no weight to them. Color me disappointed. I thought about ordering another brand but this experience has made me gun-shy...or ear-shy !! Poor product; cheaply packaged in thin hand-knotted plastic bag...No thanks. My dog--and my wallet--deserve better !!

review/summary: Best extra firm Tofu available! Shelf stable, too!
review/text: MoriNu Tofu is easy to have on hand since it is shelf stable. We stick the case in the cupboard and love the convenience. We get the Extra Firm style since it is good for everything, drinks, stir fry, dips, or any recipe. MoriNu is the finest quality soy bean curd available. Highly recommended.

review/summary: great for egg/dairy allergies
review/text: I'm allergic to dairy and egg. I've been using tofu for many years in no-egg egg salad (use regular egg salad recipe, just use mashed tofu instead of chopped egg) and dips and puddings. For no-egg egg salad, you can just use a fork to mash it up. Let it chill an hour or two for best flavor.<br /><br />For dips - just use any dip recipe or mix. A box of Mori-Nu will work fine for a mix envelope, just blend until creamy (and the silken-style extra firm type does cream up well this way, if you want something all-purpose) and add some oil and lemon or lime juice to substitute for sour cream. If you want, you can follow instructions and actually slowly pour the oil in while blending, but just dumping it in works also. You can try without oil if you want, but I like the oil. Let it chill for at least an hour or so. If you think the flavor is too intense, you can just use part of another package to get the volume you want, but nobody's ever complained about the 12 oz box method.<br /><br />The consistency of tofu is great for really instant pudding from any junky pudding mix you like (who says tofu has to be healthy?!?) or your own recipe for whatever you usually add to milk to make pudding. I look for mixes that don't have dairy myself. If desperate, I'll look for recipes... But all you really need to do is blend the tofu with the mix and voil&agrave; -  it's pudding. Chill for a while, but it tastes pretty good even just out of the blender. Don't know how well it freezes for "pudding pops", haven't tried, but I've seen a recipe for tofu fudgsicles based on a tofu chocolate mousse recipe (using firm or extra firm silken tofu, as is available here), so it probably works fine. You might need to add some sweetener to taste if you don't think it's decadent enough. This is much easier than trying to make soy milk work...<br /><br />Thin strips of tofu cooked in a pan  with soy sauce (or baked with any sauce) are pretty good also if you're into cooking. Tofu soaks up whatever flavors you toss at it, given sufficient time and encouragement. The instructions I have for baking are to bake for 30 min until "firm but not tough", turning half way through, but I've only personally tried the pan method. I've seen recipes for "veggie bacon" using tofu and nutritional yeast (such as Red Star), liquid smoke, and oil.<br /><br />You also can use tofu as the base for quick ice cream, just mix the box with frozen fruit, sweetener to taste, and blend. It can be used for regular smoothies also, of course. Look for recipes at vegan hangouts for both fancier ice cream recipes (often combining with soy milk, although I wonder if coconut milk would work well) and smoothie recipes.<br /><br />There are also recipes for pumpkin pie using blended tofu instead of dairy. You might need to add some oil to fatten up the tofu a bit.<br /><br />The Mori-Nu boxes are really handy since they don't take up refrigerator space and can be always available. The case price is much, much cheaper than at my local grocery store for individual boxes. I just wish Amazon would give an expiration date for current stock (or at least a no-earlier-than expiration date), as some other sources are now doing.

review/summary: Excellent, Convenient Product!
review/text: Please note that the product image is different from the product packaging you will receive; they're the same, just that the present proper name is "Mori-Nu Silken Tofu Extra Firm," not "Silken Style." But it doesn't matter, as this is one of the most convenient products for your pantry if you enjoy tofu in your miso or stir fry. This product, according to the manufacturer, has a recommended shelf life of one year from date of manufacture. I ordered and received this 12-pack in April 2009 and received boxes marked with a late October 2009 expiration, which is fine (this is one of my concerns about ordering food from Amazon; my local Publix supermarket can't even rotate its stock properly [found a dozen packages of out-of-date gourmet Italian cheese there today - but i digress]).<br /><br />This is great product. A real time-saver, and considering that I'm the only one in the house that will eat tofu, saves me money, as there is less waste.

review/text: This was a great find at Amazon.  Shelf items are so handy!  And if you want to make the product even firmer, freeze it.  Tofu is what you make of it.
