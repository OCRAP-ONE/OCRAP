review/summary: Sweet and Delicious
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Best Kit Kat Bar I've Ever Had!
review/text: I will never eat a regular US kit kat bar again.  This is the best tasting candy bar I've had in a while...<br />Why is it the US's chocolate bars, usually made by Hershey's, tastes like it has wax in it???  I quit eating our chocolate YEARS ago.. it's just not the same.  :-(<br />This particular one from the UK, has a smooth texture, where you could almost swear you made the chocolate yourself.  Sooo Smooth and soooo much sweeter then the ones we have here in the US!<br />The other ones I would LOVE to try are from Japan. Something like 60 flavors.. Gotta get me some of those!!!<br />Anyway, give it a whirl, I know you'll love it too.<br />Cheers!!!

I vaguely recall how it was made, but I used to eat it by the bowl full! This is the closest thing I have ever found to their recipe! It is delicious! Great to eat alone or along side a meat dish, slice of roast or meat loaf! Zero to no fat and low in calories! YUM!!! Highly recommend! Best when cold!

review/summary: I changed my mind -- Not a healthy alternative to sugar
review/text: Fructose is sweeter than glucose so you can use less to achieve the same sweetness.  I don't know about a low glycemic index on somethig that is 96% sugar.  It has a neutral flavor.  I don't used refined sugar anymore and I'm not buying anymore agave nectar either.  I've changed my opinion about agave nectar after reading up on how it's made.  It's very similar to high-fructose corn syrup in many aspects -- a product I avoid like the plague.  Type "agave nectar health risks" into your favorite search engine and judge for yourself.

review/summary: Kinda chalky, Go with Happy Melts
review/text: I was super excited to see these at Safeway for only $3. I have seen them at other places for as much as $4.50 and the competitor, Happy Melts Yogurt Melts, on sale for $5. I have to say, go with the Happy Melts version. The Gerber ones lack the flavor and texture of the Happy Melts version and are actually kind of chalky and bland. Happy Melts are all organic and are smaller, which is better for your baby and for you. I prefer the strawberry flavor but the wildberry is also quite good. I think the way they melt in your mouth is quite similar to astronaut ice cream.

review/summary: Great treat! My dog loves Dr. Harvey's Power Patties.
review/text: My dog's trainer at Unleashed by Petco, introduced us to Dr. Harvey's Power Patties. It was love at first smell/bite. My 4 month old pup Aubrey, LOVED it! His first day of puppy class went very well, and I know that the power patties given to him as reward aided in his success. At first, I was not to thrilled to learn that the treat was raw tripe! Bacteria came to mind, and I was grossed out. Our trainer reassured me  it was safe for dogs and explained all the health benefits. I was reluctant to pay so much for a dog treat (retails $12.95 on Dr. Harvey's website to $19.99 at Unleashed by Petco), but after considering the benefits, my puppy's delight for the treat and trainer recommendation, I purchased it for my dog.<br /><br />The product comes in a resealable bag. The 3oz bag lasted me 2 months. I used it specifically for his weekly training (1 power patty/week). If you have a small dog, I recommend breaking the power patty into little pieces. Yes, it smells, but it's not that bad. Your dog will love the smell!<br /><br />I think it's too early to say if the product lives up to it's health claims. I do know that it aided my dog's appetite after his neuter surgery. It was the first thing he allowed us to feed him. We tried his kibble, wet dog food, and Wellness puppy treats, and he refused them all. My family saw an instant improvement in his recovery. We were very happy to see that.<br /><br />I decided to buy my 2nd Power Patties bag from Amazon, because it was sold out at my local store. It's only sold at specialty pet stores (about 10 in San Francisco, CA). I considered purchasing it from Dr. Harvey's website directly, which was cheaper (retail - $12.95), with shipping it came out to $20. I saw the product on Amazon for $15.99, and since I am an Amazon Prime member, shipping was free, however due to low inventory, the price went up to $17.10! It is a hot item! Definite great buy. You'll have your dog's tail wagging like crazy!

review/text: I could not believe my eyes when the dog treats arrived.  I had not checked how much my $12 would buy, but there was 3 oz!!!!  That brings the price per pound to over $60.  Do I want to feed my dogs Kobi beef or Russian caviar? No.  And I surely will never buy this again either. What a mistake.  It baffles the mind that this product is in production.  It seems immoral to waste resources to dry tribe, put it in plastic lined foil bags and ship it.<br />Yes, one of my dogs ate it, the other not.  So save your money.

review/summary: Perfect gift for a wife or girlfriend
review/text: Ok let's face it guys, women love to be pampered so spending a little extra on a nice gift is ok for special events.<br /><br />My wife has bad sleep apnea so we have tried pretty much all herbal teas, natural sleep aids, etc and nothing has really helped.  So I did some research on bath oils that help relax you before you go to bed.  I came cross the Fresh Rice Sake bath oil and was a bit skeptical of the reviews I had found on some other websites.<br /><br />Well I took the plunge for Valentine's Day and gave it to my wife as a gift and told her how it can help her sleep.  She was skeptical as well and wanted to return it right away.  However with much convincing I had her try it.<br /><br />Needless to say, she got good sleep for the first time in about 2 years (yes two years!).  She was up at 6am bright as the sun on a texas summer and that hasn't happened in a long time.<br /><br />So how does it work?  Well the box recommends water as hot as you can take it.  My wife confirms that, you need it really hot, but you must be able to tolerate it.  15 mins minimum, anything else isnt worth it.  Now as the previous poster said there is no instruction on how much to use.  We did some experiments and I found that a large bath tub needs about 6-7 capfuls, maybe more.  The cap is pretty small, maybe the size of a teaspoon.  You will need to experiment on your own though but remember this is bath oil, not bubbles so don't expect suds.  Instead you get some nice foam, a pleasant odor and you will notice a bluish/green hue to the water.<br /><br />Guys - do yourself a favor for the women in your life that love a bath and buy this!

review/summary: Good Treats. But Balanced?
review/text: What's not to like about these potato heavy treats with fish and limited ingredients. These small breed treats are just the right size for our two girls with petite mouths.  I like that they can be finger-broken easily to make them even smaller. After some intitial hesitation because of the newness factor, the girls asked for more treats with enthusiasm.<br /><br />I do have a couple minor quibbles about these sweet potato and fish treats. One would assume that sweet potato and fish would be predominate ingredients. However sweet potato is listed second after dried potatoes and salmon is listed fifth, right after cane molasses. Further down the list whitefish meal is listed after canola oil. I think these treats should be called Natural Treats With Sweet Potato and Fish.<br /><br />On the front of the package L.I.T. is listed prominently. The letters are an acronym for limited ingredient treats. One scanning the package quickly might subconsciously or subliminally register Lite and think these are low calorie treats. I'm sure this was not the intention of Natural Balance.<br /><br />Despite my quibbles, I think these are worthwhile snacks with understandable ingredients. I'd certainly buy them again.

review/text: This is a great product. My Yorkshire terrier happends to be allergic to all foods but fish. He is also alletgic to sweet potatoes and potatoes but amazingly this item doesn't make him itch as much as other dog treats. I'm definatley sticking to this product. Also if your dog isn't eating well like mines (only eats fish because he is allergic to all other things) you can use this as a supplement for him. Five or six a day helps my dog poop regularly. He loves the crunch to it and its hickory smoke flavor.

review/summary: They're hard little biscuits
review/text: I assumed Potato and fish treats would be softer.  These are hard treats. I gave my two bags  to a repairman who happened to be fixing something in my house.  Maybe his dog will like them.  Mine sure didn't.  My Bichon Frise wouldn't go near them. She actually spit them out.

review/summary: Sweet Potato and Fish did not go over well
review/text: I bought these because my vet had recommended using the Natural Balance Roll for treats so I added these to my order because they seemed like they would be more convenient if I was out hiking.<br /><br />My older dog, a chow hound since birth, loves them but she does not go hiking due to her age and condition.<br /><br />My younger dog, a fussy eater, literally spits them out.  She won't even do a trick for them.  I believe if she were starving she might eat them then but only to avoid death.<br /><br />So my review is mixed.  The very dog I bought them for could care less.  I will try another flavor combination next month.

review/summary: Small, crunchy, but I didn't like the side effects
review/text: I bought these treats because I like to feed my dog hard treats for the tooth cleaning they provide, and I didn't like the idea of my dog eating treats that were predominantly grain.  I also like small (and breakable) treats so I can treat my dog for proper behavior several times a day.  These treats fit the bill for all of those reasons, so I bought them.<br /><br />Upon opening the bag I noticed a too-strong smoke odor.  My first thought was "why?" This can't be for the dogs, my guess it is probably to disguise something unpleasant.  My dog eats them readily enough, but I have found the product has two really negative side effects. First, it gives him really disgusting breath, I mean BAD.  Second, he smells them in his feces and sometimes decides to eat them - he doesn't ever do this when I feed other treats.<br /><br />I went back to Milkbone and both problems are solved...

review/summary: Great product but strong smoky smell
review/text: This is a good quality grain free doggie treat.  The product has a strong hickory smoky fish smell upon opening the bag which was not so pleasant at first.  I have two Shih Tzu puppies and they are not picky eaters so they enjoyed these treats.  They do have sensitive stomachs and these treats appear not to irritate their tummies.  I was a little disappointed to find out after purchasing this product that the company Natural Balance has had product recalls in the past.  I believe these treats are produced in the USA and quality control has improved.  I may try other products by this manufacture in the future.

review/summary: Great flour for gluten free bread
review/text: Set bread maker to 'rapid'. Heat 1 cup milk, then add 3 egg whites and 1 egg. Add 1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast, 3 tblspns maple syrup and 1/4 cup oil. Mix and put in breadmaker. Add 1 1/2 cups tapioca flour and 1 cup garbanzo flour. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon xantham gum over top then press 'start'. Use a spatula to scrape down sides and bottom of breadmix as it is mixing. Ensure mixture is moist enough to flatten out within 20 seconds (if it stays in a ball shape, it will turn out too dry).<br />This has made THE fluffiest, tastiest homemade bread I have tried (and I've tried LOTS!). Don't use potato flour. Sorghum flour makes it taste yucky. Rice flour takes away the fluffiness.

When I went back to purchase more, it was no longer available.  We searched grocery stores and found it at Giant.  Purchasing by individual cans is more expensive, so I'm hoping Progresso will begin to sell by the case again. I love this soup.

review/text: I thought this was supposed to be premium soup.  Progresso is usually associated with the higher end soups compared others such as Campbell.  Well this particular soup was all broth.  I think I encountered 6 pieces of chicken, and I think I'm being generous with the term piece, as they are more like a tiny scraps.  As for veggies maybe 5-6 potatoes carrots, 5-6 peas...just pathetic.  The picture on the can would lead you to believe that it is filled with wonderful ingredients all the way to the brim of your soup bowl.  But in reality I'm staring at a bowl full of broth.  I guess that is why those people are in marketing and I am not.  I believe in TRUTH in ADVERTISING!!!

review/summary: Good soup, but the calories are a bit high
review/text: I take one star off of this soup only because the calories are higher than I like to see in a bowl of soup. This is 150 calories per serving, and I prefer the calories to be closer to 100. Of course this isn't advertised as a light soup either. My wife recently tried combining a can of this with a can of the Light Chicken and Dumpling. The result was a pleasing lunch at an average of only 115 calories per bowl.<br /><br />There is no question that this is a good tasting soup. We used to be strictly Campbell's customers, but discovered many Progresso soups earlier this year as we explored alternatives which would complement our new style of eating (losing weight instead of gaining weight! LOL). To our delight we found, on average, Progresso soups seem to be lower calorie, lower sodium, and better flavored than Campbells. There are a couple of Campbell's that we still like better (New England Clam Chowder, for example) but other than just a few exceptions Progresso has the bulk of our soup business now.<br /><br />Sadly, Amazon has recently raised their prices on all Progresso soups. Last summer and fall they were considerably more cost effective to buy 12 at a time on Amazon. Now the Amazon prices are quite similar to the prices at the upscale super-market we patronize. Even the Subscribe and Save prices are not currently much of a deal compared to buying locally, and locally we don't have to buy a case at a time. Be sure to compare your local prices to these prices before you order here. Also, make sure you are getting free shipping or you will pay more. Finally, be very wary of buying food products from Amazon Resellers. Their prices are normally extremely high compared to local markets, plus they will always have shipping added.

review/summary: GREAT Cotton Candy Making Sugar
review/text: We bought a home Cotton Candy Maker this year, and it works with both sugar and hard candies.  We did some experimenting one evening and had a great time, but when I saw these Cotton Candy Floss Sugars, I had to try them and I was absolutely amazed at the difference they make!<br /><br />This sugar makes the best fluffy and flavorful cotton candy.  We made it at a summer block party and both adults and kids just loved it, with many coming back for more.<br /><br />I will certainly be getting this sugar again!<br /><br />Tip - if you are going to use this for a party or big group, buy some wooden dowels to use in the place of traditional cotton candy cones.  The sugary floss sticks just fine to them, they are easy to wash, and they are less expensive than the cones.

review/summary: AWESOME
review/text: When I finally decided to purchase the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00443W2W8">Cotton Candy Express - Cotton Candy Sugar - 5 Floss Sugar Flavor Pack - 12 Oz. Containers</a> it was not an impulse buy. I had done research on multiple different brands and styles (Yes I have OCD) and in my mind, this set triumphed. I had bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FA0KN4">Nostalgia Electrics PCM-805 Hard & Sugar-Free Candy Cotton Candy Maker</a> about a week earlier but it was not a kit so I still had to make the decision over the sugar. I have to say that I made the right decision. This sugar works perfectly with the  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FA0KN4">Nostalgia Electrics PCM-805 Hard & Sugar-Free Candy Cotton Candy Maker</a>. I used the mesauring spoon that came with the machine (1 tablespoon) and poured it in. This sugar made beautiful, light, colorful cotton candy. The only critique that I can make about this product is the Cherry flavor. UGHHH!!! Do you remember when you were a kid and your mom/dad had to give you that awful, cherry flavored chewable Motrin? If you do, that is exactly what Cherry tastes like. If you don't remember, just try the Cherry. Other than that I really have nothing else bad to say so if you are OCD and cannot make a decision like me, take my advice and but this awesome product.

review/summary: We Love ALL These Cotton Candy Flavors!
review/text: My daughter rec'd a Cotton Candy machine for Christmas. We ordered this pack of 5 flavors to make our first batches of cotton candy. They work beautifully in our home candy floss maker (machine purchased from Bed, Bath, & Beyond). We loved trying all the flavors, but found the Cherry and Blue Raspberry to be truest to flavoring like what you would buy at the carnival or circus. We particularly like the Pink Vanilla - our new favorite flavor. There are no negatives to this package of candy floss flavors. We very highly recommend this product to all!!!

review/text: I bought this item for a friend who was lost because she received the maker, without any sugar, as a gift.  I decided to send her the sugar as a gift and had it sent next day courier.<br />She absolutely LOVES this product and has had cotton candy every day since it arrived. Unfortunately, I have not tasted it myself but I have seen all the pictures she has posted on Facebook.  It looks fantastic.<br />I'm hoping she will still have some left for when I visit but I am seriously doubting it.

We WILL order from this company again when/if we run out of cotton candy sugar!

review/text: These pre-mixed sugars work great!  The flavors aren't very strong, except for the Cherry.  Gag.  The cherry tasted exactly like children's medicine. Everyone in the family hated it, so we threw it out.  The other flavors varied very slightly in flavor, but it was fun having the different colors or cotton candy.  The texture of the cotton candy it produces is pretty decent.  I have found that the granulated sugar that I personally flavor gives the best texture, but this product gives a very good texture also.

I purchased the 5 flavor pack from COTTON CANDY EXPRESS and it saved the day! The kids loved the flavors, not over powering but just right. The adults even had a good time. I must say it will bring out the kid in you. I also want to mention that it goes a long way so you get good servings out of all 5 containers. Buy this, you will be glad you did.

The flavors were distinctly different and came through just fine.  I would receommend this sugar for anyone that has a home use cotton candy maker.

We tried a variety of flavors that were all pleasing.  It never stopped working for a neighborhood party and we mustve made approx. 30-40 cones counting all the adults.  Cleanup was a breeze, just drained right out.  No washing or turning it around to get all the water out.<br />Our only regret was that we didnt purchase this 5 yrs. ago.

I love we can close them tight. They performed and tasted great.

review/summary: Delicious, but not enough!
review/text: Excellent! However, I think each jar makes considerably less cotton candy than it states, especially considering none of us were proficient at spinning it, so each cotton candy serving was small. About half the size of the carnival servings. I'm estimating we got about 10-15 servings (again, not huge) from each jar. Yep, we used it all, packing up bags for take-home. Very fun to try all the different flavors, but if you're looking to serve a crowd, go with the Pink Vanilla and the Blue Raspberry in larger containers. One other thing: we doubled-up on the cones as one cone was not strong enough to support the candy.

Will purchase again when they run out.

review/summary: excellent candy floss sugar
review/text: I have one of the small, Nostalgia-brand cotton candy makers that uses either crushed candy or flossing sugar.  While I like the results of the crushed candy, I've really been craving the more traditional cotton candy flavors, and was curious about the results I'd get with flossing sugar.  I was really pleased!  You do need to take a bit of care to not spill the sugar (because it's so fine, it starts melting instantly, and can be a mess if you miss the target),but the results - flavor, volume, and texture - were fantastic.  Try blending the flavors, too.  We did so, unintentionally, when we first received the sugars: we wanted to try them all, and used one right after the other.  Got some very novel blends that way!  :-)

review/text: My family loves cotton candy, but it can be very hard to find it in stores, and sometimes the product just isn't that good. So when I bought my own machine, I wanted the best deal and the best tasting sugar I could get. By purchasing the 5-pack of sugar, I got just what I wanted! The sugar spins out very light and disappears on your tongue instantly leaving behind a delicious flavor! My family hasn't tried the grape or orange yet, but we love the cherry, blue raspberry and pink vanilla flavors. I'm sure we'll love the others too. And it was a great buy for 5 nice sized jars. I look forward to eating more cotton candy soon!
