review/summary: Stop drinking coffee and start drinking this!
review/text: I'm not going to tell you what yerba mate is and all that.  I just want to tell you that this stuff is amazing.  The cans, the bottles, the tea bags: they're all great.<br />I can (and have) chug an entire can of guayaki yerba mate and feel amazing.  it gives me a tingly sensation throughout my body, makes me mentally aware of everything (try drinking it in a nice shady park or something), and never ever makes me crash like coffee or energy drinks do.<br />The price might be a little high, but I feel it is worth it.  It also depends where you buy it.  I've seen the cans go for as high as $2.50, but i have found a place that sells them for only $2 a can!  i'm not going to tell you where though!  it's all mine! all mine!<br />the cans and bottles are my favorite.  they have great flavors.<br />for the cans, the flavors, from greatest to least greatest:<br />lemon elation<br />enlighten mint<br />revel berry (don't really care for this one too much, but if the other two are out, it's still good)<br />for the bottles, i can't name all the flavors since there are quite a few, i would recommend the cardio one, i believe it is raspberry flavor and red.  other ones i would suggest are the pomegranate one and the mint one.  the pomegranate is extreme!  makes me feel super duper! whoooo!  and if you look closely at the bottle, you can see sediment at the bottom.  give that bottle a shake, pop it open, and enjoy.  you don't even have to chug this stuff to feel the energy, just sip on it, and i promise you each sip will make you feel better and better.<br />there is no hfcs or anything artificial.  it is completely organic and has very little sugar.<br />if i were you, i would stop paying an arm and a leg buying coffee at starbucks and use that money to buy guayaki yerba mate.  just try it once.  but make sure you actually get the flavored ones.  if you try the pure yerba mate flavor, you probably won't like it.<br />oh yeah, and for each product you buy, a portion of your money is donated to helping south american rainforests.  so not only are you drinking healthily, you're also helping the planet out.<br />AND one more thing, this stuff is great if you're on a diet.  look more into this, because i don't want to get into that.<br />but yeah, my most favorite drink.<br />TRY IT OUT!

review/summary: Refreshing Minty Aftertaste, Quite Good, Very Pleasant
review/text: I enjoy trying new things and my nearby Fresh and Easy grocery store has a lot of them. Recently, I picked up some Guayaki Yerba Mate Enlighten Mint drink. Well, I've never had anything quite like it. The drink has a slightly sour taste, but has a somewhat refreshing minty aftertaste. It's quite good and goes down easily. Very pleasant. The calorie count is modest and it only has 14 grams of sugar in a 16-ounce can. I drink it ice cold, but without added ice. The can says it's a powerful rainforest experience, and I'm not certain what that entails. We'll see. This  stuff is good enough that I won't stop at one. Mmmmm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Does The Job
review/text: At last we have seen a lush green back yard for the first time since the arrival of the puppies 2 years ago!  This product is definitely worth considering, especially if you have a female dog, who tend to deliver urine to a more confined space (vs. males, who tend to have a less directed spray), and are more likely to burn the grass.<br /><br />How does it work?  Their website says that the Yucca plant extract helps break down the urea and that it is natural, safe and approved by veterinarians.<br /><br />My only concern is that it is not clear if there may be health risks to long term use of this product.  In reviewing the listed ingredients, however, I see nothing that seems particularly worrisome.

review/text: Anyone who is a fan of the Mahi-Mahi fish knows that it has a very distinct flavor. It's non-fishy. A true Mahi filet is delicious. I've eaten Mahi at many restaurants, and in the Caribbean. I can tell you that what I just took out of the box and baked, is NOT Mahi. Some parts of it were EXTREMELY fishy, and it just didn't have that Mahi taste. Texture seemed to be that of a Mahi fish, but taste wise, absolutely not. I wouldn't buy this again.

review/text: This product always provides the light, fluffy and crispy coating I have desired. I've used it when cooking vegetables such as cauliflower and broccoli with excellent results. Of course the primary usage is with shrimp, scallops and other seafood including salmon.<br /><br />When unable to find this product I have used other brands but could not get the same results. The coating is too heavy and does not "fluff and crisp" the way I like it.<br /><br />I now buy Hime Tempura Batter Mix online by the case to insure I have it available when I want it. My grocer is frequently sold out due to its apparent popularity.

review/summary: This dogfood is great!
review/text: I started using Holistic Select when I got an English Mastiff puppy because it was well recommended by a number of breeders. Georgia, the puppy, did so well on their food I decided, two years ago, to try the Senior food for our elderly Golden Retriever. Soccer had been on Purina Dog Chow all his life. He was really starting to act and show his age. He was overweight, slowing down, and getting gimpy from laying around too much. What a difference!! Now he is much more trim, playful again, and actually runs around the yard - at 13!! The only difference has been the change in food so I give Holistic Select complete credit for this remarkable transformation. I discovered that I could buy Holistic Select products from Amazon about a year ago. Their price is a few bucks cheaper than the pet stores where I was buying and delivery is free! Since I live in a rural county, this saves me driving to "the big city" to get their dog food. Having it delivered makes my life much easier!!

review/summary: Great for getting non-veggie lover to eat his greens
review/text: I like giving my son (now 14 months) a variety of flavors throughout the week, and this is one in the arsenal of guaranteed-to-be-eaten foods.  He has loved sweet potatoes & apples since he was 6 months & starting solids.  I give him this and other Earth's Best cereals (Banana, mixed whole grains, etc) combined with whole milk, yogurt, wheat germ, etc.  THE KEY is he's not fond of his green veggies, but I can mix pureed asparagus, broccolli, spinach, etc. with the sweet potato Earth's Best and he's none the wiser & loves it.  For the multi-grian, I just add pureed pears, banana, etc with the pureed veggie to sweeten it up a bit (I get the Plum Baby purees for travel- another great way to "hide" the veggies-, or make purees at home in the blender & freeze).  This flavor cereal is not overly sweet at all (I've tasted it, since I wouldn't expect my son to eat anything I think is yucky-tasting).  I suspect that the other reviewer might've been jumping the gun on the solids, hence the poor response.  I've read that babies have more tastebuds than adults, so I can see their little palates getting overwhelmed by new flavors, but this cereal is *way* less sweet than any jarred banana or other fruit baby food, to give you an idea.

review/text: I adore my little dog. But sometimes you can't take her with you -- not to pick up the pizza, not to the supermarket, not to the Post Office, not to work. Madeleine never understands this, of course. "Stay!" I order, and she watches thru the window, surely wondering if I will be home by sundown.<br /><br />This is no longer a problem. All I have to do is toss a few Wellness jerky treats in the back seat, and she's set.  Madeleine now looks forward to all her parking lot sojourns, and I can leave guilt-free knowing how much she loves these Wellness surprises.<br /><br />I've been using them for months.  Now that I've found I can get them on Amazon for a lot less (my local store charges $16 for a 6 oz. bag), we can be sure Madeleine will never run out of them.

review/text: These are excellent treats and great for my smaller dog who is about 16 lbs. He doesn't like really hard treats and will sometimes give up on chewing those when it's just too much work, but these are chewy, and not too soft like other soft treats might be. They rip/break apart really nice so you can do multiple tricks without going overboard on treats. I would also recommend these for dogs with reverse sneezing problems. My dog has reverse sneezing bouts from allergens, cold air, excitement, and from too hard treats or food. With these, I don't have to worry about him having "an attack" and he just loves them and I love that they are grain-free too!

review/summary: Fantastic Lemonade
review/text: This used to be available locally and I was a big fan. When our local supermarket stopped carrying it, I was bummed, checked Amazon and no go. A few weeks ago we were traveling and I found it again and, what the heck, checked again and here it was, even available via Subscribe and Save.<br /><br />This is excellent lemonade. Probably the best I've ever tasted. Perfect, real lemon flavor--sweet, yet tart--and absolutely refreshing. The calorie count is a little high, but a definite better option than soda. And, most important of all, simply delicious.

review/summary: Cappuccino Delicioso!
review/text: I have both a Dolce Gusto "Piccolo" machine, and the Tassimo coffee maker. I have tried making cappuccinos on both machines, and by far I prefer the Dolce Gusto. For my palate, it has a much more authentic cappuccino tast. I think that this is because the Dolce Gusto machine uses a high pressure, 15 bar system and the Tassimo does not. The Tassimo does make a delicious drip style coffee, especially from the Starbucks selections. I generally do not like sweetened coffee drinks, and again for me, the main difference between the Dolce Gusto "Cappuccino" and the "Skinny Cappuccino" seems to be the sweetner added to the milk capsule of the regular cappuccino. I really look forward to my daily Dolce Gusto Skinny Cappuccino and highly recommend this product.

review/text: I drink mostly Lungo or Americano with half and half.  Some days I am out of it, this is my backup.  I like the original cappuccino once a while, yet gets too rich for daily consumption.  This is acquired taste;  the more I have this guilt free gourmet foamy coffee drink, the more I enjoy it.

review/summary: Pretty darned good
review/text: I have had cappuccinos all over the world and have long contended that the ones that are made from boxed milk (Parmalat, LALA) are the best and creamiest.  This comes pretty close to it...one small trick, add your sweetener to your cup before you steam the milk pod to get the authentic cappuccino experience of having your full cup of coffee taste sweet, including the foam.  This is a trick that Starbucks has always refused me...something about them not being allowed to taint the milk.  Whatever.

review/summary: My favorite, due to the calorie count...
review/text: Of all the coffee flavors available for the products with milk capsules (I must have milk), this is my coffee flavor of choice, due to the calorie count only.  I do not like all the sugar in these capsules, and this one has the lowest sugar content.  I guess I could just order the coffee flavors that don't come with milk and add my own, then I could add my favorite type of artificial sweetener, but the reason I purchased the machine was for the frothy hot milk, so I am settling for 50 calories and 5 sugars, since that's the lowest I could find at this time, but I can't offer it to my diabetic sister, due to the sugars.  I think it tastes great, but I do add a little more sweetener, since I am a sweet freak.  I noticed that the Nescafe company offers more capsule options in the UK, such as Skinny Latte Macchiato and Latte Macchiato Unsweetened options.  I hope those become available here, for those of us who would prefer no sugar added so we can add the sweetener we like, the amount we like, or no sugar at all.  If they would come out with milk capsules only in a box, I would try their coffees that contain no milks, but they don't seem to want to do that so far.  Even the UK, which seems to get things before we do, doesn't have that option.  If I were to drink any of their flavors, based solely on it's flavor, I really enjoy the Mocha capsules over the Skinny Cappuccino, but there's a lot of sugar in those.  I have a diabetic sister who drinks coffees with me quite often, and I would buy the plain coffee choices for her that contain no sugar if I had the milk capsules to offer her that frothy goodness.  I think they would have much higher sales if they allowed us to decide if we want our coffees sweet and/or milky or not.

review/summary: Nescaf&eacute; Dolce Gusto Brewers, Skinny Cappuccino
review/text: I find the skinny cappucino flavor to be the weakest of the dolce gusto capsules. While it is pretty good for a skinny coffee why does every skinny coffeee have to have a less flavor and taste than a regular coffee beverage? Surely with all of that technology they can find a way to make a skinny beverage not taste like a skinny beverage? It has a pretty good taste but I am slightly disappointed.

review/text: I have been getting the skinny cappuccino pods for a few years now and with this recent purchase I was shocked at the price jump. It's actually more than what it costs on the Dolce Gusto website (and they have jumped in price too). I always count on Amazon being well-priced but unfortunately it's not the case with this product right now.<br /><br />The skinny pods are ok but I'm realizing I like the regular cappuccino pods better as I think they taste great without anything else added- especially since they are far less expensive . I had been able to justify $1/cup (even less with subscribe and save) for these pods but the skinny pods are climbing to more than I like so it's back to the regular cappuccinos for me!<br /><br />All in all, I've been very happy with the Dolce Gusto machine and cappuccinos for the past 3 years just not happy about the higher price.

review/text: I love the cappuccinos for the Nescafe Dolce Gusto, and these taste just as good without the fat. These drinks are really easy to make. I like my coffee drinks pretty sweet, so I add just a little bit of flavor syrup to mine, but they are almost perfect without it. My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. The price seems to continually increase, and pretty soon it will be just as expensive as going to Starbucks.

I assumed these pods would fit the Nespresso machine I ordered as a gift for my wife but they do not fit. Amazon states their policy is not to take these items back. This was a very misleading representation of the products you sell and poor marketing.

review/summary: Delicious alternative tea
review/text: Runa is a brand new tea that I drink everyday. I love the balanced, energizing feel I get from it. Apparently guayusa has been drunk for thousands of years in the rain forests of Ecuador and is now making its way to market in the US for the first time. Runa also seems to have a great back story of environmental conservation and social empowerment of indigenous groups. In fact I just heard a story covered on NPR's Marketplace about the partnership between Runa, the socialist Ecuadorian government and the farmers.<br /><br />The Amazon Spice has a nice cinnamon undertone with high notes from the lemongrass, the Ginger Citrus is also really good and slightly spicier from the ginger with clean citrus zest flavor, the traditional is good to see what guayusa by itself tastes like- smooth and naturally, subtly sweet with no tannin. I've never had the spearmint but I bet its good for people who like mint tea.

The flavor of this tea is also smooth and sweet, with perfectly balanced hints of cinnamon and lemongrass. It tastes nice hot but I find that I like it best cold.

I'd say the smoky/salty flavor is a bit strong, but in a good way.  It does contain some sugar (2g) but doesn't taste very sweet, thankfully.<br /><br />The package is so thin/flat that it's nearly two-dimensional, so I was kinda expecting to open it and find a flattened pasty mess, but actually the appearance isn't bad, and there were many large whole chunks of meat.<br /><br />As with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDJYWA">these Season-brand Skinless and Boneless Sardines</a> that I first tried a few months ago, I was quite pleasantly surprised by how good fish-in-a-can (or bag) can be.

review/text: Living in Houston, Texas, we are challenged by the threat of hurricanes every year.  Besides preparing in advance to meet the dangers of wind and water, we must prepare to face brutal heat, lack of electrical power, lack of clean water, and food shortages.  What can we buy that will not spoil?<br /><br />At the suggestion of a safety director, I first tried SeaBear Ready-To-Eat Smoked Sockeye Salmon this year, and I love it!<br /><br />SeaBear Ready-to-Eat Sockeye Salmon was recommended to me as a "hurricane survival food" with a shelflife of about 4 years.  Of course, it is routinely sold to the rest of the world as a delicacy -- and it is.  I now eat this ready-to_eat salmon about once a month or so as a treat (with Triscuits or mixed with a little mayo and celery as a salad).<br /><br />It should be mentioned that the salmon comes out of the packet looking pretty much like raw smoked fish -- not like the highly perishable, "sleek-looking" salmon that one sees at expensive breakfast buffets.  (By the way, this kind of salmon can be bought at the SeaBear website.) It doesn't look like canned commercial salmon from the grocery store, either -- not pale pink.  It is a moist, red or dark-red, rich, smoked salmon that looks very "authentic."  The texture is firm, moderately oily, and perfectly seasoned with a smoky taste that is not overpowering.  You should experiment with this salmon before serving to guests to be sure that you like the appearance.<br /><br />Since eating too much smoked food is not recommended, I limit my portions when I am not concerned about storms.  At the SeaBear site, you can buy different kinds of salmon and other products, and perhaps they offer salmon that hasn't been smoked, as well.<br /><br />I am a picky eater "when it comes to fish," and I love this salmon!

review/text: I buy the Old Bay Salmon Classic mix at the grocery store very often.  The product is quick and makes a salmon cake that is delicious!  When I saw a box that contained 12 packages of the mix on Amazon, at a great price, I bought it!  The box of salmon mix was much, much cheaper than purchasing it at the grocery store, one or two packages at a time.  The box of salmon mix was nicely packaged and arrived quickly.  Thanks!

review/text: This kelp actually TASTES GOOD! I've tried the Starwest Botanicals organic kelp (Ascophyllum nodosum species from Canada) and it was dry, unpleasant and chalky but this organic Laminaria digitata species actually tastes like sea salt and is super yummy on its own or mixed into savory dishes!<br /><br />Also, this acts as an excellent, natural thickener which I put in my cat's moist food with pumpkin and extra water and this kelp thickens it up and gives it a nicer texture for his consumption (and it is also supposed to help constipation because of the naturally occurring alginate).<br /><br />I've also tried this as a facial mask mixed with a little water and raw honey and it is very soothing and moisturizing.<br /><br />This is definitely going to be my "go to" kelp from now on! Very high quality and the serving suggestion and iodine information [as another reviewer stated] is on the back of the package.<br /><br />For you folks owned by cats: From a different brand of organic kelp for pets, I found the serving size for cats is 1/8 teaspoon a day.

When I moved back to the U.S. it was hard to find this tea.  I now see it sold in most Asian markets however the labeling is different.  I guess the manufacturer wanted to appeal to the Western market.  I try to get as much as possible but I live 20 miles away and it is more convenient to purchase it on Amazon and have it delivered.  The cost benefits is pretty much the same.  I recommend that you give this tea a try.

I found it at my local Asian grocery store, bought a case and then couldn't find it anymore so thank you Amazon for providing a way to access it. I subscribed to get a case a month. I agree with the other reviewers about its taste, smooth and excellent when cold although I picked one up from my last case and drank it at room temperature and found it to be just as refreshing. The packaging is different in stores and the bottle looks like the Oi-ocha green tea from Ito-En but with a yellow/tan label. Happy drinking.

Firm and tender, they are high in protein and fiber and VERY low in carbohydrates (something other beans are loaded with). This picky eater thinks they TASTE GOOD! Just give 'em a good rinse with water before use. I make chili with them, a fabulous three bean salad and there is nothing better than mashing some up and sauteing them with a little garlic in a splash of olive oil (huevos rancheros, anyone?) Although you can find these (if you're looking for them) in health food stores, they are virtually absent from main stream grocery stores. Why bother with any of that when you can get 'em here at the best price (especially if you can use Super Saver Shipping)

review/summary: Use instead of black beans!
review/text: I first became aware of black soy beans when I read the Atkins low carb diet plan.  I had been using black beans in various dishes and I thought I would try these instead.  I tried to find them locally in my hometown health food stores but they did not carry them.  So I took a chance and ordered a case of 12 cans here.  They are great!  They're not exactly black the way regular black beans are - they are sort of a faded red color, somewhat similar to a kidney bean in appearance.<br /><br />Just so you know, in a half cup serving they have 120 calories, 6 g of fat, 8 g of carbs, 7 g of fiber, and 11 g of protein.  So run to your pantry and grab a can of regular black beans and compare!  I no longer have any regular beans in my pantry so I can't compare for you.<br /><br />Also, Eden Foods has a custom can lining that has NO bisphenol-A (I believe they are the only canning company which has done this), so that's another really good reason to get these beans. I am so happy with these beans and since I do use canned beans on a pretty regular basis, I have signed up to get an automatic shipment of a dozen cans every few months.<br /><br />Fear not. It's simple. These are great.
