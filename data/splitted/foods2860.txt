review/summary: Weird after-taste for me (try one bag before you buy a box)
review/text: I bought a box of these baked barbeque Kettle brand chips from Amazon in somewhat larger-sized bags, because they came so highly recommended by other reviewers, but I really don't care for them at all (though other people to whom I've offered them  munch through them quite happily, and are pleased to take the rest of the bag home with them when I make the offer).  I can only conclude that individual palates may respond very differently to these particular chips.<br /><br />So, if you've bought a bag of Kettle's baked chips in this particular flavor recently in your local grocery store and found them quite tasty, you'll probably be quite happy with buying these by the box-full from Amazon.<br /><br />However, if you haven't yet tried them, do NOT invest in a multi-bag shipment until you first discover whether or not these particular chips appeal to your particular palate.<br /><br />I'm busy giving away every bag I bought, because I developed a distaste for them after eating the first few chips from the first bag I opened (which I ended up throwing away half-full).  But my dislike for these baked barbecue-flavor chips from Kettle brand (whose other, 'full-fat' chips I've almost always relished) is definitely a minority opinion among my friends and neighbors, so far.

review/summary: Great chips, but a little too salty for my liking
review/text: Considering these are baked, they are very tasty.  They are super crispy and taste like fried goodness, but without the oiliness.  The only bad thing I have to say is that these are supposed to be "lightly" salted but I still found them overly salty (that's why I only gave it 3 stars). I actually found the Baked Salt & Malt Vinegar ones less salty than these. So for those watching their sodium intake or don't like things too salty, then you may want to consider the other flavors.

review/summary: Junk health food
review/text: I hope that one day this snack can reach the point where it is truly healthy and consistently good.<br /><br />A) Claiming to be healthy, at least - last bag I munched on had nutrition info that would in one serving give you the bare minimum healthy cholesterol score (&lt;300) for an entire DAY. Many snacks do this. Like peanuts. Or popcorn. The idea is that since the products are from 'natural' sources, there is less control over the batch. But seriously - less than 300mg per serving? Give me a break. This gives no one trying to help themselves in this area any hope of control. It's almost like writing a blank check. To yourself. To state that your product's single serving falls less than the daily total max recommended is garbage. Read the label.<br /><br />B) The batches may be uneven in cholesterol, and they may avoid legal issues by setting it at the 'max'. But the uneven textures and flavors you may get (I consumed, along with family and friends, several cases of these over 2 years or so) don't add up, either. I had burnt tones, teeth-cracking textures at times.<br /><br />I used to love these chips, much as the majority of the reviews portray. I thought I was enjoying at the least a fair product, staying healthy, keeping the fat away. But - they are simply simple carbs with a little twist of fat that get you by in the place of their higher-fat brethren. In case you are not sure of where I stand, I am one of those people who think carb-laden chips are not a great food. You don't miss health until you lose it. These chips will not help your health. They might, at best, make it slightly less worse than everyday chips - at twice or more the price.<br /><br />A leading non-profit consumer org concluded this was 'junk health food'. They cited other causes, as well. I wholeheartedly concur that this is not a healthy food. It is a junk food that is masquerading as one.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br /><br />Just got around to adding this. My wife purchased a bag of the "Hickory Honey BBQ" at the beginning of July. They were real dental-rattlers, uneven but thick-cut and baked into seriously hard material. The spices were horribly uneven.<br /><br />Lot mark: 12JUL12 090227921:37

review/summary: Not your ordinary use ...
review/text: I bought these shells for a rather unusual reason: housing for my colony of shell-dwelling cichlids, Neolamprologus multifasciatus. On the off chance a fellow fish fancier is looking for shells, these are the ones you want. They're 100% clean (no soaking required), and the perfect size for any of the shelldwellers. My multis just hatched out their first batch of eggs in one.<br /><br />I can't say how good they are for serving escargots in, but if you're breeding any of the Tanganyika shelldwellers, you can't go wrong with a box of these shells, and the price is right. They arrived in perfect condition, without any breakage. One box will furnish up to a 20-gallon aquarium.

review/summary: Great Escargot Shells!
review/text: After reading the reviews, I too bought these shells for Tanganyikan cichlids, and I was very surprised and happy to see that so many people were reviewing these shells for this purpose rather than just for haute cuisine!<br /><br />Due to a childhood with French food fanatics,  I do also know that these shells would be great for use when serving escargots as well.  They arrived in great shape in terms of minimal breakage because the shells clearly belonged to sturdy, well fed and cared for snails (before the...tragedy)!  The company also makes sure that the shells are cleaned, so that they are hygienic enough for a kitchen and, thus, they would make for a great presentation on the table right out of the box with a cursory rinsing.<br /><br />They are beautiful, and I plan on buying another box just to put in a vase on display.<br /><br />In fact, I would recommend them across the board-- whether you are looking for homes for cichlid shell dwellers, are a food fanatic or French person (same difference), or are just looking for a beautiful decoration!  You have to love a product that covers so many needs!!!

review/summary: PERFECT PRODUCT FOR AN UNUSUAL PURPOSE
review/text: Like some other buyers, I found this product a perfect solution to my need, but not for the purpose that the manufacturer intended.  You see, I too have an aquarium for Tanganyikan cichlids - some of which are shell dwellers.  Appropriate shells for these fish are difficult to find as these fish are rather rare.<br /><br />Internet sites (including Ebay) and Tropical Fish stores did not really offer good solutions. The shells must have large round openings, be lightweight (so the fish can move them to their liking) and offer a roomy interior (for breading and hiding).  The Escargot shells are all that and the perfect size as well!!!<br /><br />The price was reasonable, shipping was fast and I was amazed that none of the shells were broken.

review/text: I recently ordered some shells (in order to cook escargot) from another website (the frenchy bee). Poor quality (alot of broken shells) so I decided to order from this place since the reviews were much better!  I must say, these are a better quality shell. Thicker than the previous ones and very few shells were chipped.  Out of 72 shells, I had 1 broken one, 2 chipped and 5 that were non-existent. It only came with a total of 67 shells.  It's a simple counting error.  I honestly would buy from them again because the quality was very good.  Much better from "the french bee"!  They were a very very good price too!

review/summary: Crunch N Clean Taste Test
review/text: To see if the claims were true I decided to do a taste test with the Hartz Crunch 'N Clean bone-shaped biscuits and chop-shaped treats from another national brand.<br /><br />Not having been snubbed before with the chops, I was somewhat surprised to see my pups choose the Crunch 'N Clean biscuits first.  These dogs have never been known to be choosy eaters, and all the biscuits were eventually consumed, but it was apparent they they liked the flavor of the Crunch 'N Clean treats.<br /><br />The biscuits have a texture similar to whole wheat Danish crisp-bread just not as tasty or savory (yes, I tried one, too).  They also break into pieces with uneven edges to help scrape off gunk from tooth enamel.<br /><br />So all in all the dogs like the flavor of the biscuits, the treats are crunchy, and the texture helps keep their teeth clean.<br /><br />Pretty good.

review/summary: Crunchy, Smelled Good, Large, Heavy on Wheat
review/text: Our Ridgebacks and Dobermans all scarfed these up immediately. Opening the box the treats smelled fresh, there was no greasy feel to them when I handled them and they did not have that icky odor that some of the chemical coated red colored, cheap biscuits have. I also liked that each biscuit was really large and thick. Even the elderly dogs liked them and the 16 year old Doberman with very few teeth left had little trouble eating this biscuit. These are hard, crunchy biscuits, but they do break apart with a little effort so they can be managed for an older dog. Our whole pack seemed to like the flavor and texture and there were no crumbs left on the floor afterward.<br /><br />Two days is too soon to tell if the Crunch 'n Clean biscuits will actually help with bad breath or tartar on their teeth or not. Honestly, no dog biscuit or treat or food is going to eliminate tartar on your dog's teeth - only annual cleaning by the vet will do that. (Proper nutrition will certainly help keep the problem in line)<br /><br />The reason for the four stars instead of five is simply due to the primary ingredients. We have Rhodesian Ridgebacks and they are prone to food allergies with regard to wheat and corn. The high wheat content in these biscuits means I cannot give them to the majority of my dogs. Many other breeds out there have the same allergen issues as well - if you are feeding an organic or wheat/corn/soy free diet for an allergy prone dog then you'll need to stay away from the Hartz treats.

review/text: My dog is actually a bit picky when it comes to treats. When you give her something new, it takes her 2 or 3 tries before she decides to try it. So I was pleasantly surprised when she immediately decided these dog biscuits were acceptable. She chowed down pretty quickly and was looking for another one. This is the highest praise I can give a dog treat product. I don't know how effective these biscuits are at tartar control, because (a) my dog is still pretty young, and (b) it takes a long time to see a difference in doggie dental hygiene. But as far as taste is concerned, Stella votes yes. I would definitely buy these again!

The medium size is just about right for his since he just a puppy. They biscuits are mostly protein with a few percent of fat. I have purchased other biscuits and he just refuses to eat them. He will sniff them and just ignore them. He didn't even hesitate with these. I had these on the counter and his nose was right up there trying to figure out if that box was for him. These biscuits are loose in the box. They are not sealed in a bag and in the box. I threw these in a plastic container to seal the scent and to keep them fresh. Although, I don't think dogs really care about freshness. I will be purchasing these again.

review/summary: Very pleased with these biscuits & will buy more.
review/text: I am reviewing the "small" size Hartz Crunch 'n Clean dog biscuits.<br /><br />I believe I've finally found a biscuit to help with the tartar problem I've got with both my dogs -- a dachsund and mini-pin.  When the box arrived, my dachsund became so excited he was shaking from the smell!  Now, he eats anything and everything, but he was especially anxious to gobble up these biscuits....and even started a fight with my other dog over the shipping box!  Even my mini-pin ate 2 of the biscuits right away, and he is a very picky eater.  Of course, I didn't taste the biscuits, but the smell was similar to that of seasoned "curly fries."  They are shaped like a small, short bone with flared ends -- dimensions are 2" long, 1" wide at each bone end tapering to 1/2" wide in middle of the bone, and 1/2" thick.  I noted that pieces crumbled off, as opposed to splintering off, when the dogs were eating them, which I liked for safety reasons.  I just tried to break one with my hands and could not, so, even though I don't see any immediate teeth cleaning after just two biscuits, I would assume that the hardness will help remove tartar after a few days.<br /><br />There is along list of ingredients in these biscuits, many of which are vitamins.  There is also "sodium hexametaphosphate," which is a tooth whitener found in Crest toothpastes.  Other ingredients are flavorings, meals, flours, fats, and sugars, and I didn't see anything in the list that made me reluctant to feed them to my little guys.  The suggestion is to feed dogs 4 of these biscuits daily "for maximum dental benefits."<br /><br />I will be buying more of these, as my dogs love them, and it's very hard to brush their teeth, the little monsters.

review/summary: Dry and Not as Appealing as other treats
review/text: I love the idea of this dog treat, that it cleans teeth and freshens breath.  However, to get the maximum effect of that, the box suggests feeding him two bones a day every day for the cleanest teeth.  I normally don't treat my dog that often, because I don't think it's that good for him and also the cost of treats.  I'd have to buy a box a week to keep up with that!  But as to the taste of it, my dog was very unappealed by it.  He still ate them, as he is a dog afterall, but he would put it down and come back to it and work on it almost in the way he does actual dry bones.  I just think it lacks the taste and therefore his interest.  He much prefers tastier treats as he gobbles them up or spends his time gnawing on his bones. But I still give 3 stars as it does seem to help his teeth and breath!  Now if they could just make it more appetizing.  My guy is not, by far, a picky eater, so if he's pickin' there's a problem!

review/summary: My Doggy Gave this 2 Paws Down...
review/text: Wayyyyyyyy down.  I received a box of the small biscuits for my 15 lb, West Highland Terrier, and mind you, she's a little piggy.  The saying "will work for food" describes her perfectly, but these?  She wouldn't even take them out of my hands!!  Now, that's just crazy!<br /><br />To be fair, her treats include more holistic brands like Old Mother Hubburd, and Innova Evo Dog Treats, which includes no chemicals, by-products, or grain.  It's a rather high protein, low carb treat....the complete opposite of these which is filled with all sorts of fillers including grain, by products and chemicals, and hardly, if any real meat at all.<br /><br />Hence why I don't blame her.<br /><br />And as for the price, it's kind of high for being in the same category as milk bones, and for only a dollar more, you can get much better quality dog treats out there, such as Innova Evo and Dogswell.<br /><br />She gives these 2 paws down.... way down, and I can't say I blame her.

review/text: My dog loves the taste. Even more importantly, she tolerates them very well, which is not always the case as she has a very sensitive stomach and is normally on a limited ingredients diet.<br /><br />I don't know how the teeth cleaning factor is supposed to work. It does not take my dog long time to eat a biscuit. I believe more in dental bones as she spends considerably longer time chewing on them.

review/summary: Dogs liked it better than I did
review/text: Hartz isn't the brand that comes to mind when I consider 'quality' dog treats, and I wasn't sure mine would eat them.  My "small" dog weighs in at 25 lbs, and these biscuits were just right for her.  Her big sister, at 65 lbs, did also have to chew them before swallowing. I also tried them on my boss's crew of 5 miscellaneous dogs, and they all ate them except the one who won't eat anything. I wouldn't put much faith in their effectiveness as teeth cleaners though.<br /><br />As a "dog mom", I was not impressed with the ingredients.  These biscuits had far too many ingredients that just didn't measure up as "health encouraging" to inspire much faith on my part.  I can find treats that are far healthier, and chews that are far better as tooth cleaners than these biscuits do either one.<br /><br />All in all, its a 3 star ho-hum product.  Nothing to get excited about, and I won't be excited enough to seek them out at the store either!

review/summary: Better than green beans, not as good as kitty poop
review/text: My Boston Terrier eats these, but does not appear to enjoy them any more than Milkbones. They are very hard and crunchy, which should be good for cleaning their teeth as advertised.<br /><br />My ancient Pekingese mix (with a very small mouth, and snaggly, horrible teeth) either can not, or will not chew them. She just holds them in her mouth or sets them down. I broke one in half to see if the size was the problem, but she still did not eat it.<br /><br />I did not try these myself, but I'm going to say that my household consensus is that these are not a favorite.

review/summary: A bit large for a small mouth, but definitely enjoyed
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:59 Mins<br /><br /></span>What better way to review a dog biscuit than to show how much a dog enjoyed eating it? That was my logic behind this very amateurish but heartfelt video review starring my 1 1/2-year-old Shih Tzu, Missy.<br /><br />The video was very impromptu and, in hindsight, I realize that I didn't do a great job of explaining why I only gave the product 3 stars, so I'm adding some further explanation here.<br /><br />First, I took a star off because I felt that if you're going to make a multi-sized dog biscuit, the small should be small enough for the very small breeds like Yorkies and Chihuahuas.  As you can see in the video, this small biscuit is not only 2 inches long and quite thick but VERY hard, so I feel like a very small or more delicate breed may have trouble with even the small biscuit.<br /><br />Second, the ingredient list on the box is almost 3 inches long.  Sugar and salt are within the first 10 ingredients and, while there are a lot of vitamins and minerals included, there is also partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, several food colorings and chemicals I can hardly pronounce.  I just prefer to feed Missy more natural foods and snacks.<br /><br />Third, the "feeding instructions" (which hardly seemed necessary) direct me to give Missy 2 biscuits twice a day.  That's 4 large (compared to the small Mother Hubbard bone-shaped treats she usually gets) treats a day, which seemed a bit much, especially much considering my issues with the ingredient list.

review/summary: I LIKE them....
review/text: Hi, my name is Herdle and I am a fox red lab.  Milk bones are my usual brand and though I am a recovering biscuit addict, I decided to try these.  I've never met a treat I didn't love ...greenies, milk bones and when I can snag it, people food.<br /><br />Anyway, these treats are thicker and shorter than my usual brand (~1inch x 4inches) and they have a few lines and dots stamped in them along with Hartz on the top.  I actually preferred them to my regular brand when tested -- three times out of three.  I was given the option to freely choose one or the other.  This is not unique for me as I often love a new brand of food, but tire of it before the bag is empty (why does she buy those bushel bags?).<br /><br />The biscuits smell like people food.  The box says they contain 'denta-shield' and breath freshening crystals.  The crystals are really small, but the buiscuits do seem to leave my mouth smelling better than usual... kind of a 'fresh bread' smell.  oooh I love bread and marshmallows too.<br /><br />I could eat the whole box tonight but she's only giving me one per day.  I highly recommend them.  ingredients (in order from the box):  wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, wheat germ meal, sodium hexametaphosphate, Poultry fat, salt, poultry digest (what?), Sugar (I LOVE SUGAR, but my vet sez it's not so good for me), Dried Whey, Malted Barley Flour, Dried cane molasses, calcium carbonate, brewer's yeast, citric acid, corn starch, choline chloride, sodium metasibulfite, partially hydroxogenated vegetable oil (if it's not good for mom, can it be good for me?), mono-diglycerides, mixed tocopherols (preservative), veg oil, rosemary extract (there's that people food smell), chlorophyll, aritificial coloring (red lake #40, yellow, blue) ferrous sulfate and other vitamin supplements (E, B12, zinc, A, copper, Niacin, Manganese, Riboflavin, D3, thiamine, Calcium Iodate, and Folic acid).<br /><br />Calories per biscuit - 170  wow, it's kind of like a candy bar for dogs.  Treat that tastes great, but not so great for you.

review/summary: Hard Biscuits -- I didn't taste them, but my dogs liked them
review/text: I have two dogs and both love their daily biscuits. To keep their weight within reasonable parameters I do limit their treats, but am nonetheless familiar with most brands.<br /><br />These biscuits are quite different from any I've purchased in the past. They are at least twice as thick as a normal dog biscuit. I know this because I usually break biscuits in half, and in this case it was accomplished with great difficulty. I assume the hard consistency is part of what helps remove tartar on teeth.<br /><br />The dogs loved them and begged (yes, they did) for more. Notably there were absolutely NO crumbs at the bottom of the box -- NONE. That's something I've never encountered in a box of dog biscuits -- more evidence of the thick, tough texture.<br /><br />So, why didn't I rate the Crunch 'n Clean five stars?  Additives. I read the labels for my food and my dogs, and I don't like, in particular, added colors. And, not just one color, but three were added (why?) Yellow Lake #5, Blue Lake #1 and Red Lake #40.<br /><br />Also, it seems a bit incongruous to me to add sugar and dried cane molasses to tartar control dog biscuits. How good is sugar for dog teeth? I admit I'm not a chemist, but I suspect the sugar might be best avoided.  Salt is # 7 on the long (46 item) list of ingredients -- something else I believe isn't too good for dogs.<br /><br />Some of the many ingredients are unpronounceable and worrisome. Some are vitamin supplements. I prefer ingredient labels to reflect a simple straightforward list of deciferable food stuffs, and I'd rather no added vitamin supplements to treats because almost all basic dog food includes them. It is time consuming to keep track of it all. That said, my dogs loved the biscuits and I liked giving them something really hard to munch on.

review/summary: Four Dogs like Crunch n' Clean but they don't read ingredients
review/text: I received a package of Crunch n' Clean Dog biscuits and Wow, did my dogs like them!  A Sheep hound mix, a Jack Russell, Chihuahua and Mini-Pinscher all loved the biscuits with equal enthusiam.  Four solid stars.<br /><br />But... I might point out that the above dogs like chicken, cheeze bits, kibble and dead birds and mice not to mention the odor of other dog's butt.<br /><br />So as I dog owner, I read the ingredients and found it to be typical of commercially prepared pet foods, relying on grain, meat byproducts and sugars for the bulk of the volume.  I can't endorse it as a "healthy snack"  for my pets.  But then again,  just like I visit McDonalds occassionally as a treat, neither can I complain.

review/summary: Apparently a great product
review/text: I got this for my friends dog (I don't know much about dogs). I always thought a treat is a treat, but apparently, her dog has high standards. We went over for the weekend, and I brought them. She warned me of her dogs narrow tastes and was fairly certain that Tobi would not like it. Well, to her surprise, she was wrong. Tobi ate the treat and wanted another. The weekend was a success, and my friend now has a new treat to offer her dog. This was pretty hard and I wonder how good it would be for a small or small/medium sized dogs teeth. I suppose the hardness helps to remove the plaque. I suspect it would take more than a weekend to evaluate how well it cleans, and I'm sure that you still will have to take your dog for cleanings, though I don't know the frequency. I would guess this would give you a little more time in between cleanings. I think the most important thing is that a dog with picky tastes enjoyed it and also did not get sick from it. Just getting back to the hardness, it is not really harder than some of the other chew toys I have seen other dogs eat, e.g. bones, etc. Lastly, for the price, it seems like a good value. You get a lot of biscuits....and I suspect this 24 ounce box will last a while.

review/summary: lukewarm reception
review/text: I gave my dog one of the Hartz Crunch n Clean dog biscuits and he was very excited. He ran around the house with it in his mouth, drooling like a faucet. After playing for a while, he laid down to eat it. I could definitely tell it was harder to crunch up than the similar sized milkbone, he had to work it around and position it in his jaws just right. Once bitten into a couple of pieces, he ate one half and then took the other half and buried in the couch cushions. Sadly, I think that's probably a "paws down" vote from my dog. Also, at 35 calories, it's a pretty significant contribution to the daily intake for a small dog compared to a small Milkbone at 20 calories and a Liva Snap at 13 calories. If my dog had liked it more, I might give them to him as a special treat which wouldn't really help with regular dental cleaning because it is recommended to give them two biscuits a day (we would have to short him on kibble if we added the treats at that quantity). As he isn't in love with them, I think we'll just see if one of our doggie friends likes them better.

review/summary: Satisfying, and sensible in moderation
review/text: When we brought our new pup for her first check-up with our longtime family vet, he told us that the two ailments he and his partners see most often in their practice are pets that are overweight or have tooth problems. Both can lead to serious issues and health risks, but as he pointed out, by maintaining good habits, we owners can reduce the chances our pets' health will be affected.<br /><br />However, let's face it, no matter how eagerly our dogs greet their daily servings of healthy kibble, there are a whole lot interesting smells in the world, especially when your sniffer is so much more powerful than those of your human companions.<br /><br />Our pup, who loves to eat, is a lab -- a breed noted for its appetite and its wheedling expression as much as for its happy nature.  In our household, that means accurate measuring at mealtime and strict rationing of treats.<br /><br />Because she's food- and praise-motivated, we've been able to use bits of dog biscuits when introducing a behavior and to transition to clicker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMDIL6">StarMark Clicker</a> reinforcement and praise pretty rapidly ... and save the "treat calories" for a substantial chew or bone each day.<br /><br />I was eager to see what our pup would think of the Hartz Crunch `n Clean <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q9EFWI">Hartz Crunch n Clean Dog Biscuit, Large</a>  because it's got a pretty nutritious list of ingredients and includes a product developed at a dentistry university that's designed to block formation of tartar on teeth. Right out of the box, the bone-shaped treats have a nice heft and mild, pleasant aroma. My expert hovered hopefully, tail wagging, and seemed surprised that the treat was much heavier than her usual Checkups-brand treats. She nosed it around and licked it a few times before settling in next to my herb garden to polish it off. More later on this.<br /><br />While I'll have to wait for her next check-up to find out whether these biscuits are helping with our regular toothbrushing program, I could tell from the very first biscuit that her breath was better. (She has an unfortunate habit of nosing in our fish pond; thankfully the fish are faster than she is.)<br /><br />Our pup's daily maximum is 1,100 calories, which means that we're picky about the content and calorie count of snacks and treats, since they come straight from that bottom line.  To crunch a few numbers, these Hartz treats contain 170 calories each, and the recommended feeding is two per day. There were 14 treats in the carton. By comparison, her usual treat comes in at 137 calories, with a recommendation of two to three per day. The most we give her, though, is one a day so we don't have to short her on kibble. So far, she's seemed fuller for longer with the Hartz treats, which counteracts the slightly higher calorie count.<br /><br />When offered her choice between the two today, she promptly and politely chose Hartz, and headed straight to her niche between the rosemary shrubs. Turns out she's not just a chow hound but also a bit of a gourmet -- these treats are flavored with rosemary extract.

review/summary: Approved by three Miniature Schnauzers
review/text: These very hard biscuits seem to do their job. I have given one to each of my three Miniature Schnauzers and have not had any adverse effects.<br /><br />One of my dogs has a rather sensitive stomach and I was a little nervous about giving her these biscuits and so with anything new I usually try just a little to see how she can handle it.  She handled the biscuit just fine so these passed the sensitive stomach test.  I am now comfortable with giving her the whole biscuit and have not had any problems.<br /><br />Another one of my dogs has a tendency to wolf down his food so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the density of these biscuits to be hard enough to warrant him breaking the biscuit down to chunks to eat it rather than one bite and it's gone.<br /><br />None of my dogs stuck their noses up to the biscuit but only one of my dogs is a real food snob so that's not saying much.<br /><br />I'm not big on giving my dogs junk food even those which are supposedly healthy or beneficial such as these but if you don't have time or don't want to take the time to clean your dog's teeth and treats such as bones just don't do it for you then these are better than doing nothing.<br /><br />Ingredients listed is: wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, wheat germ meal, sodium hexametaphosphate, Poultry fat, salt, poultry digest , sugar , Dried Whey, Malted Barley Flour, Dried cane molasses, calcium carbonate, brewer's yeast, citric acid, corn starch, choline chloride, sodium metabisulfite, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil , mono-diglycerides, mixed tocopherols , veg oil, rosemary extract , chlorophyll, artificial coloring (red lake #40, yellow, blue) ferrous sulfate and other vitamin supplements (E, B12, zinc, A, copper, Niacin, Manganese, Riboflavin, D3, thiamine, Calcium Iodate, and Folic acid).<br /><br />Calories per biscuit - 170<br /><br />If I was to recommend anything to Hartz it would be to get rid of the food color, lower the sugar content and add real chicken. I don't have a clue what chicken digest is, is it the stomach or extremely cooked down chicken?<br /><br />Four out of five stars for me.<br /><br />Though my dogs like these and they didn't upset my dog's stomach so no adverse affects at the end of the box I won't be repurchasing. I think I can find a better options for the health of my dogs than this.

review/summary: My dog loved them
review/text: My big girl dog has an indoor crate where she spends her nights, usually by choice, and some time while we are out. On top sits a box of milk bones and a big bag of cookies from the farm store.  They have sat there for months, we occasionally replenish them, and she never bothers them, she waits until we give her one.  My plan was to do a video review of this product, I was going to go outside and put out a couple of different brands, and see which one she ate.<br /><br />That night, when I got home, she was wagging her tail, obviously happy to see me as she always is when I return to our pack. And the cookies were gone. Oh, the milk bones were there, and the generic cookies were there. They still are. But these were gone.<br /><br />All I can say is that she has a sensitive stomach, and eating a box of these might have upset her stomach, but it didn't. I have no idea how they would have kept her teeth clean in the long run, because she ate them all at once!<br /><br />I'm rating them by how irresistible my dog found them. A product like this won't do any good unless the dog eats it, and she ate it.

review/text: Our dog, a 10 year old bichon frise, goes wild when he sees these coming, so the flavor must be pretty great; he is not a huge fan of dry dog treats usually.  After his recent difficulties with a teeth cleaning at the vet, I resolved not to have him go through that again, so it is a good thing to have the extra dental shield ingredient that protects teeth from tartar build up. There are also a lot of vitamins in the biscuits. The recommended feeding is 2 biscuits twice a day, which I think is way too much. This would be too filling and cause the dog to not eat enough of its dog food. If 4 biscuits per day are needed in order for the dental benefits to be realized, that is not good. Overall, I would use these biscuits several times a week to possibly give the dental benefits, but not as often as recommended.  :)

review/summary: the smalls not small enough for small dogs
review/text: I guess when they did the taste test for these and stated preferred two to one sadly my dog (Chloe) was sitting in the other group. I have a 12 lbs. Papillon and give her the competitor bones and she loves those. I don't think it was the flavor as much as the size with these. For being `small' the bones are twice as large as the other ones. I think that was the issue for my `Chloe', she could not get her poor small mouth around it. She would try to suck it until it was ready to break. Even if I broke it, the pieces were too thick. I think if they were not so thick she would not have any issues. As far as the breath factor I did notice it improved in that area! That alone I would buy them but the size is what would deter me. I gave some to a bigger dog, a 55 lbs lab mix and he did not have a problem chewing them but still had to break the bone up. Over all I think it is a good idea but the size is not what I would consider small. Maybe a small treat for a bigger dog but too big for small dogs.

review/summary: Hard to judge
review/text: This is a very large dog cookie that has 170 calories -- roughly what my dog would get if I fed him a candy bar.  The package says that for maximum benefit I should feed two of these to my dog a day -- 340 empty calories.  While my dog eats these enthusiastically and wouldn't object, that won't be happening any time soon.  The downside of this product is obvious, while the benefit of its contribution to cleaner teeth is much harder to assess.

review/summary: Tastes Great - but lots of filler
review/text: I have two pound puppies (well not puppies) who are not picky eaters - apparently living on death row in the pound will open up the horizens on edible vs non-edible.  Though they are both considered "medium sized" dogs, we give them the Large dog biscuits because they THINK they are large dogs.  Normally they each get one large biscuit every night before bed.<br /><br />So the box came in the mail.  I admit that I was surprised when I opened the box that more of them weren't smashed or broken in transit - I generally can't get the box home from the grocery store without smashing half of them.  So they now have a box full of non-broken snacks.  As the doggie mommy I inspected the ingredients - and was a bit dissapointed.  Lots of wheat and grains.  I had hoped for at least animal by-product or something as the first ingredient.  What really bothered me was the fake coloring, there's a list of artificial dyes - now I've never met a dog who would turn anything away based on color so I don't understand the point of colored dog treats.  The last ingredient was added on vitamines - so I was happy about that.  Still, lots of salt, sugar and grains in the box.<br /><br />Then I read the directions - feed 2 biscuits twice a day, so that's 4 biscuits per dog per day... that's a LOT of snack food for a dog.  After closer inspection it seemed to be stating that for maximum DENTAL benefit to follow that feeding routine.<br /><br />Rosco, our 30lbs 2year old sheepdog figured out pretty quickly that the box contained snacks.  After a sit then shake, I gave him one.  He was curious at first (he's a cautious doggie after having been abused so badly) there was some sniffing, some poking with the nose, but then once his big brother started moving in - Rosco crunched happily away at it.<br /><br />Indiana Jones (aka IndyBear) our 60 lbs 12-13 year old mix (maybe spaniel and austrailian shepherd? Who knows) has been on a weight management diet for over 10 years now, but severe arthritis and hip displaysia prevent much excercise.  Indy will eat anything - though I have recently started to worry about the hard food on his teeth.  Once Indy figured out that we were testing new biscuits, he went through the routine, sit, shake, laydown, situp - then he took off with his new snack.  Indy wolfed it down and came back for more.<br /><br />Over the next 24 hours there were no upset tummies or 2am walks due to the "runs" so we'll at least finish off the box.<br /><br />Final Opinion:<br />The Good - hard and crunchy to help prevent additional tartar buildup.<br />Apparently very tasty.<br />The Medium Size is good for the 25-40 lbs weight range.<br />I liked the added vitamins.<br /><br />The bad/questionable - I wasn't a fan of the dyes included.<br />Smaller or older dogs may not be able to chew these comfortably.<br />The dental benefit is only to PREVENT NEW buildup - not to help with current dental issues.<br />Feeding Directions may lead to plump puppies - especially with the ammount of non-meat ingredients.<br />Doesn't seem that it would be as beneficial on the teeth as a rawhide, at least with my dogs.<br /><br />Please remember - Doggies need their teeth brushed too, even if you give them hard treats like these.

review/summary: My dog wasn't big on these...
review/text: I got these treats for my extra large Chihuahua who will eat anything.  She wasn't a fan of these.  Whenever we decide to give her a treat we ask her if she wants a "snackee" & she gets very excited.  She'll run in circle & stand on her hind legs.  When we gave her this for a "snackee" she just looked at it, smelled it & then looked to us like we were joking her.  We left it there & she looked at it again & smelled it & then chose to walk away from it.  This dog turns down nothing except for lettuce.  After it sat there for about 30 mins I put it in her dog dish & about 6 hours later she decided to get it out & contemplate eating it for about 10 more minutes before she decided to finally try it.  She did finally eat all of it but we know she wasn't big on it because the next couple times we gave her one it was the same routine, it sat for hours before being eaten.<br /><br />Her opinion is that she's not big on them & wouldn't recommend them but if given one she'll eventually eat it to make it go away.

review/summary: Better than nothing
review/text: These biscuits are probably better than nothing, and they did seem to clean some of the yellowish gunk off his teeth; after three of these over the span of a weekend, my dog's teeth were noticeably whiter, although spots of tartar and plaque remained in the remoter portions of his teeth.<br /><br />I generally prefer organic dog food with short, simple ingredient lists, and at first was a little concerned when I saw that the  list on these things was half the height of the box. However, spot checking the ingredients shows that most of them (Calcium Pantothenate or Pyridoxine Hydrochloride for example) were just vitamin supplements; a few were harder to decipher, though (Sodium Hexametaphosphate?)  The most common ingredient is wheat, so if your dog has a wheat allergy, avoid these.<br /><br />As to taste, I refrained from trying them myself, but it did seem a bit dryer and more powdery than other treats I feed him; he didn't seem as wildly enthusiastic about them as he is about his organic kibble, but he sure ate every speck, and started noticing when I got the box out. (To be fair, he'd probably eat bark if I put it in a bowl with some kibble and water).<br /><br />Overall, these are probably a good option if you want to do something for your dog's teeth; they're certainly far cheaper than the other dog dental treats I've seen for sale. I don't think they're going to be an adequate substitute for getting your dog's teeth cleaned at the vet, though.

review/summary: Dogs love them! But certainly not a dental supplement.
review/text: I have 2 dogs, a sheltie mix and long haired chiauaua, I will say that the "LARGE" size biscuits were way to big for both of my dogs so I broke the large biscuit in half and gave each dog a piece of it. The dogs loved them! In fact I went to my front door to get the box and normally my dogs don't get excited about boxes. But this time I guess they could smell the treats inside because they both went crazy! I'll say that the box is bigger then I expected, contains approx 16 biscuits. The "serving size" on the box I'm not sure about as it says "for best results give 2 twice a day. If my math is right they want you to feed your dog a total of 4 of these a day and at that rate the box will last 3 and a half days.  If the treats were healthier and not so much filler I wouldn't see a problem with this IF it really helps the teeth, but with it being mostly filler I couldn't see feeding my dogs 4 of these every day. They are a good treat every now and then, but certainly not to be used as an on-going dental treatment because you would go through 2 boxes a week and at the current price it would be about $48 a month and that is just for 1 dog. These in my opinion are purely TREATS and not dental supplements. I will be submitting a picture of my dogs with these treats if you would like to see how excited they were when I got them out! I rated these at 3 out of 5 simply because of the healthiness of these compared to the "recommended serving." As far as my dogs go, I think they would give it a 5.

review/summary: Hartz Crunch n Clean Dog Biscuits (Medium)
review/text: If your dogs are like mine, then they love pretty much any treat you give them, but I must say then when I pick up this box they do seem a little bit more excited then with other treats. Also, my dogs will not let me brush their teeth at all, so I always look for treats to help protect their teeth. After about a week, I have to say I notice a difference. They have no plaque build-up and their chompers are pretty white and clean looking. So I would have to say they product definitely works. And seeing as how I am always curious what my dogs are eating, I took a bite of the treat myself, and now I see why they get so excited, it's pretty tasty. Yeah, I'm weird like that. For almost two pounds of treats, the price is also very good. I have a Boston Terrier, a Pug, and a little Chihuahua / Beagle mutt thing and the medium is a good size for them, though you might be better off with the small size for those breeds. Great product all around.

review/summary: My dogs really liked them
review/text: My dogs started eating these the minute I gave them to them, and they seemed to last a little longer than other biscuits I've bought for them.  I can't say if these biscuits really will cut down on the amount of tarter on their teeth just yet, but I'm sure time will tell.  For now I see no harm in giving them the 2 two biscuits each day that the box recommends, and hopefully it will help cut down on the tarter.  That they really liked them was an added bonus.

review/text: These biscuits are a hit with my German Shepherd. He loves them, and they really have made his teeth cleaner. I try to brush his teeth, but it can be a challenge to get to all of those back teeth before my pup is over the process. After only a couple of these treats this week, his teeth are noticably cleaner already.

review/summary: made 15 lb pom lose teeth!
review/text: Our 5 year old (healthy) pomeranian took these, although I could tell they were not his favorite treats, and ate them over a period of about a month.  I began to notice that his gums began to be sore, and he was having tenderness in his mouth.  I took him to our vet to have his teeth checked, and discovered that several of his teeth had become loose, and he had to have two of the front bottom ones extracted, and 5 more molars extracted.  A third (front tooth) is just hanging there tonight. The vet told me that several more were loose, and he could have pulled more.  I am heart sick that I fed these to my pomeranian....hindsight being what it is, they are way to hard for his little mouth and his teeth.  I thought I was HELPING him by giving him "Denta Shield" and instead he lost several of his teeth!  The small ones (for dogs up to 15 pounds) seemed OK for our bigger golden retriever, but are way to hard and thick for a small dog.  :(

review/summary: Great Product Outrageous Price
review/text: I have bred and sold dogs for over 45 years.  I know my dogs.  And I know what dental scaling and cleaning costs.  I discovered these biscuits and tried them and I am wowed.  They're fantastic.  All my dogs have polished white teeth now, and clean breath too.  I am so pleased with this product.<br /><br />Problem is that each and every store in America keeps running out of them.  So when you go to Amazon to find them to keep your dogs on the proper regimen (you can't bounce dogs around with their diet, it must be habitual), you get prices that are out of this world.  Wall Mart sells this product for under three dollars.  the LOWEST price at Amazon is OVER NINE DOLLARS.<br /><br />I have been a solid shopper at Amazon for over 15 years, but these prices have run me off to Wall Mart, where the shipping is free.  Shipping on this product is SIX DOLLARS OR MORE.<br /><br />Come on store owners!  Why do you want to screw your customers?  Are you JUST concerned with your own investment or your stock holders that you would screw your customers?  DID YOU REALLY SNAP UP ALL THE SUPPLY TO GOUGE US?  We want reasonable prices for products and a box of dog biscuits is NOT WORTH TEN BUCKS.  GET REAL!!!!

review/summary: Great treat for your best friend
review/text: I am sure my dog could do a better review but seeing as he can't type, I will try to translate.  My dog(Welsh Terrier) is actually a very picky eater and only likes a handful of things.  Believe it or not, he loves these treats and can't get enough of them.  Of course all dogs are different, but typically, if my dog is happy, your dog will be happy.<br /><br />Now for what I love about this product:<br />- the medium size bone is a perfect treat for a medium sized dog (25-35 lbs)<br />- if you want to break them into pieces (for training or just to give a small treat), it is easy to do.<br />- thes bones don't break into a billion crumbs when your or the dog cracks into them<br />- they have relatively no smell, yet my dog still loves them - they must have great flavor<br />- My dog has problems with tartar build up.  These bones appear to help reduce the tartar and certainly don't add to any build up.<br />- One box seems to go a long way.  I don't treat my dog everyday but my first box is still half full.  I am guessing around 50-75 bones in a new box

review/summary: Sick Beagle on crunch and clean hartz
review/text: My dog was fine and I gave him a Hartz Crunch and clean as we were going to bed. I knew something was wrong when I noticed that my beagle, Cocoa, who rarely lets me out of site, did not follow me to bed. Cocoa, who has been sick once in 5 years that I know of, has been throwing up for 2 hours. He has also been drinking insane amounts of water, and ran outside to eat lots of grass as fast as possible, which is uncharacteristic of him. He has stopped throwing up, but I suspect it is because he either has nothing left to puke, or is fighting it off as his diaphram is still jumping. He wont even lie in bed, which is where he lives. The list of ingredients is pretty long. My dog has a healthy diet(science diet), so this could just be a reaction to a healthy dog eating unhealthy food. Anyway, I am done with Hartz, and probably on my way to the vet.

review/summary: My dog loves these bones
review/text: I have a 50 lb retriever mix and she loves these bones for treats.  I have noticed no tarter build-up although I do brush her teeth 1-2 weekly.  Even so, I think these are helping.  For some reason, bone snacks like these are not something she normally likes to eat but these must taste really good to her because she gobbles them up!!  I do recommend them!

review/summary: Dog Candy!
review/text: My dogs love these.  I have a 65 lb, Golden Retriever that will eat anything I give her ... she operates on blind trust, and if it comes from my hand it must be good, so of course she eats these happily ... but hey, she drinks from the toilet so how picky can her palate be??  On the other hand I have a 9 lb Tibetan Spaniel that covets ownership of any and everything that has been dropped on the floor or has been offered to the Golden; however, he doesn't wolf it down ... instead he carries off any treasure he finds to his pillow where he will carefully, delicately, and privately decide if he actually wants it.  If he doesn't, she can have it after he is done inspecting it.  He is VERY picky about what he eats, and generally turns his nose up at most treats (after carting it away for the inspection ritual - mind you, he doesn't really want it; he just doesn't want HER to have it).  However, even this picky little critter enjoys these and gobbles them up, so ... while not having tasted them myself, I can honestly say most dogs will enjoy them thoroughly.  On a medicinal point ... I have not found any improvement to the Golden's bad breath after using these ... this is no substitute for brushing.

They did not bolt them down like they do with milkbone.  We only had the one box and I did not notice any difference in the way their teeth looked or their "dog breath."<br /><br />Because it is a vine product, I do not know if the price of the item is fair. I think I will just stick with Milkbone products.

review/text: So I got a box of these for my 3 year old Norwegian Elkhound. All dog owners know that there are many, many products out there that claim to clean your dog's teeth. So do it better than others, and some my dog flat out won't eat.<br /><br />When I first opened the box of these I was amazed at the size of them. The box does say large, but these things are huge. I would recommend this size for much larger breed dogs than my 50 pound elkhound.<br /><br />The benefit of them being so big is it does take her a little bit of time to chew the whole thing up and eat it.<br /><br />Results? Not really sure. The box says to feed at least two of these to your dog per day. But quite honestly, that would get really expensive and I am not sure what the dietary 'after effects' would be with that dose and I really  don't want to find out. So I can not really speak to the cleanabability that this product does.<br /><br />I can say my dog enjoys them and does take a little time eating them.

review/summary: Dog loves them, and they seem to work at cleaning teeth
review/text: When we first received the box of Hartz ProDent, which proudly proclaimed "Taste preferred 2 to 1 over the leading brand," we couldn't help but roll our eyes a little.  And as I tried to break a biscuit in half for my little dog, a couple snide remarks ran through my mind: "Geez, these things are hard as rocks - they're more likely to break teeth than clean them!" and "I hope those greenish-blue specks are just minty dental crystals..."  Over the course of a few weeks, however, my skepticism faded since a) it is very apparent that the dog LOVES them - they're by far her favorite treat now, b) her breath has actually improved noticeably (though i did NOT french-kiss her to verify this for a fact), and c) her teeth do look a bit cleaner.  I still think that the best way to take care of your dog's teeth is to brush them, but for those who don't want to bother with that, the biscuits will likely provide a handy/easy alternative.

review/summary: DOGS SHOULD ENJOY THIS TREAT
review/text: My cocker spaniel dog Lucky is always looking for treats. So I thought I'd get him a box of Hartz Crunchn Clean dog biscuit treats.<br />  Lucky was initially skeptical of this new treat. We put the treat in his dish and then poured his regular dog food on top of it. Soon, Lucky was digging through his food looking for the treat; like a child looking for the prize in a box of Cracker Jacks. Over the next several days, Lucky chowed down on every treat in the box. The biscuit is also supposed to clean the dog's teeth, or improve dog breath, or something. It didn't seem to do that for my dog, but Lucky seemed to really enjoy these. So I'll probably buy more of these treats for him in the future.

review/summary: Not Lily's Favorite, but Close...
review/text: I have inherited the world's most persnickety shih-tzu. I have bought her every brand of designer, organic, healthy treats on the market and she promptly turns her nose up at all of them. I was sure that Hartz Crunch 'n Clean dog biscuits would end up at the Humane Society (where I donate all Lily's cast-offs), but lo and behold she actually tried them and seemed to enjoy them. While she would gladly choose "Tiny T Bonz" over these at least these are good for her. Her veterinarian said she is going to have to have her teeth cleaned in the next year because there is some tartar on them which could lead to tooth loss. I'm hoping that Crunch 'n Clean Dental Biscuits takes care of that problem because I know how traumatic a teeth cleaning will be for her highness. I give her one every other day so she doesn't get tired of them and not respond when I try to get her to come inside by saying "do you want a treat?", which usually gets her running. I am interested to see what the vet says at her next appointment. If there is a major (or even minor) improvement in her teeth then these dog biscuits are worth every penny.

review/summary: My dogs love these!
review/text: I have two dogs, one is a Terrier, and the other is a Chihuahua. They are extremely picky eaters. They will only eat Cesar dog food, and the only biscuits they ever eat are the ones you get from Sam's Club. The multi flavor Members Mark brand. So when I got these, I knew they would be better for their teeth, but I honestly didn't think they would eat them. Well I was WRONG!<br /><br />Now I usually leave a little pile of the regular dog biscuits on the floor for them to get when they want one. So I decided to do the same with these. I put a small pile of these right next to the ones they usually have. They went straight to these. First my Chihuahua took one, and jumped on the couch. She wouldn't part with it. Then the Terrier got one and jumped on the living room chair. The Chihuahua ate it and the Terrier immediately started growling at her thinking she was going to get his LOL. She has continued to eat these and the pile of the regular ones haven't been touched since I got these. I guess I now have to change what biscuits I buy for them.

review/summary: Good dog treats, but make sure to monitor eating of them.
review/text: I have two dogs and one tends to chomp down whatever she gets and the other one tends to sniff it out first before chowing down. I got the medium sized Crunch 'n Clean and the dogs I have are a border collie mix and a black lab mix.<br /><br />Amber, my black lab mix, took to the treat instantly, eating it very quickly. As for Palmer, my border collie mix, it took him a little while before he was ready to try the treat. However, after his initial taste, he would grab the treat whenever he is offered it.<br /><br />The size of the treats are pretty good for medium dogs. It takes more than a few bites before they can swallow the biscuits completely so make sure to monitor them when they are eating this. Amber tends to swallow really fast without chewing so I can see these as potentially a choke hazard for any dogs who do not like to chew. Therefore, make sure to watch the dogs as they are eating these treats.

review/text: Very tasty dog biscuit meant for large dogs.  I have a lab and a min pin and I just break it in half for the min pin.  They both love this treat. The only bad thing is that it crumbles very easily so feed this treat to them outside, they tend to make a bit of a mess when they eat it.  It's so large and they have to break it into pieces, when it breaks, it creates a bunch of crumbs.  I'm not sure if the advertised Denta Shield ingredient really does block new tartar formation, but the dogs love it.

review/summary: she likes it, but what the heck is DentaShield?
review/text: We received Hartz Crunch 'n Clean biscuits through the Vine program, and our medium-sized dog can go through a large-sized biscuit in about a minute.  She enjoys them, but I'm concerned about the patented ingredient, DentaShield.  "Invented by researchers at Indiana University's School of Dentistry, the same researchers who developed flouride for you and me," DentaShield might be the sodium hexametaphosphate listed as the 5th ingredient after wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, and wheat germ meal.  It sounds like a salt, which isn't necessary to clean tartar from teeth, as the box claims.  Other ways are better to clean dogs' teeth.<br /><br />These biscuits are definitely loaded with non-essential ingredients like partially hydrogenated vegetable oil and artificial color (they're uniformly tan, so where's the color?).  The blurb about the same researchers who developed fluoride set off warning bells, as many people know the issues with mass amounts of fluoride in our drinking water, but people unfamiliar with those issues may feel this is a good advertising tactic.<br /><br />Our dog likes them, but dogs tend to like junk food, including human food.  So, if you're conscientious about what you feed your critters, consider buying locally-made biscuits or make them yourself from a recipe online.

review/text: My dogs loved these treats. Do they reduce tartar over time? I have no idea. You see, my dogs loved these so much that when I was at work, they somehow got the box off the table and ate them all! Stinkers! And they are VERY picky about treats.<br /><br />The biscuits are a fairly good size, about 4 inches long and about 1 inch think, which is much thicker than standard biscuits. They are very hard and crunchy. It took several minutes for my dogs to eat the ones I gave them, and they are good size dogs and big chewers, weighing between 50-85 pounds each.<br /><br />I'll be looking for this in my local market. If they don't sell them here locally, I'll get more from Amazon. Looks like I'll have to put them WAY up the top shelf in my kitchen though!

review/text: My dog, Max, will eat almost anything, and he's never found a dog treat or food that he didn't like.  The Hartz Crunch n Clean biscuits are no exception.  He is a miniature American Eskimo, around 20 pounds, so I got the medium size for him.  They are pretty stout for a medium (in terms of thickness), but they were a good size for his mouth otherwise.  He really enjoys them.  My mom's dog, Gypsy, is a frequent visitor to my house.  She prefers soft treats to hard and generally snubs any hard treat (to Max's delight, since he'll steal it from her).  I gave her one of these, and to my surprise, she devoured it.  She loves it!  That gets a gold star from me.<br /><br />I deducted a star because I couldn't tell whether or not they were actually cleaning the teeth.  (I suppose this isn't the fault of this product specifically but of all dog products which claim to clean teeth.)  Max's teeth don't seem to be getting dirtier, but they don't seem to be getting cleaner either.  Perhaps one box isn't enough to be able to make a judgment call -- but with Max and Gypsy both loving this treat, chances are I'll be buying it again!

review/summary: My pups will eat anything--but they won't eat these unless they're the big ones
review/text: I haven't had the same success as other reviewers here. My two sibling dogs are Rhodesian Ridgeback/Beagle mixes, and they are basically breathing vacuum cleaners. If it hits the floor, they eat it. I normally treat them to Stop & Shop brand treats in the assorted flavors (and colors) because they love them. The medium sized Hartz Crunch n Clean biscuits have been spit out repeatedly by my two 55 pound dogs. I even broke them in two to make them smaller for my dogs' mouths and they still reject them. It seems to be not only the size, but the fact that these biscuits are extremely hard. I'm sure that is what helps remove tartar, but my dogs only like a tough chewing job when they are enjoying a rawhide bone.<br /><br />On the other hand, the LARGE variety go over better, but not so much as quick treats but as if my dogs think I've just given them a rawhide to gnaw on. They're just in for a surprise when, after enough chewing of these hard bones, they actually break apart and become edible.<br /><br />Some of the main ingredients include wheat flour, ground whole wheat, chicken meal, wheat germ meal, poultry fat, poultry digest, sugar, dried whey, malted barley flour, dried cane molasses, citric acid, corn starch, and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Aside from also having vitamins in the ingredients, these treats are loaded with ingredients that are hard to pronounce and sound like things you learned bout back in chemistry class!

Two of the three, would turn their faces away refusing to take the biscuit in their mouth or even lick it.  The third dog would readily eat them but she also has a nasty habit of eating dead animals and squirrel poop.  After giving my single "test subject" 2 biscuits a day for 2 weeks I did not notice any reduction in the visible tarter on her teeth nor did I notice fresher breath.  Perhaps with a longer test trial, some benefit would become obvious, but given that the majority of my dogs won't eat them I doubt I will be purchasing this product in the future.

To give you an idea of whether these are size-appropriate for your dog, she's a 45-lb lab/terrier mix, about nine months old.<br /><br />So why did I only give it a four? When I first gave her one, she thought it was a toy.  It took her a good ten minutes to figure out it was food. This suggests to me that the flavor could be made more appealing (though I'm not planning on tasting them to find out); on the other hand, she goes straight for the crunch nowadays, having figured out what they're for (well, other than the tartar removing part, I'm pretty sure she doesn't much care).

But now as I just fed them the last three, they definitely know what to do with them and welcome them.  Each takes his/hers off to a remote place and works on it until it's gone.  Mine are the large variety so they last them a while.  I don't know if it's doing a job on their teeth, but there's enough chomping going on that it certainly should be cleaning them well.

review/text: There's not a lot I can say about the tartar fighting amazingness of Hartz's new tartar fighting Crunch 'n Clean dog biscuits. However, I can tell you that they MUST be delicious. Lily and Lola are Boxadors and large ones at that so the biscuits lasted mere seconds during the shark-frenzy-like consumption period.<br /><br />They did not bark at the UPS man when he delivered the biscuits which meant they were not a box of crumbs from a launch-delivery as he ran scenario. Lola, the finickier of the two (though both will eat fresh deer droppings, go figure ) didn't hesitate to snarf them down. And when I hovered the biscuits over their heads the Pavlovian drool strings appeared as if I was offering something truly dog-delightful (I suppose like a plate of wildlife droppings). Both Lily and Lola licked up every crumb of Crunch'n Clean after the biscuits broke up while being chewed.<br /><br />I do like the idea that the substance, DentaShield, coats the teeth to block new tartar formation. And I like that I can feed the girls treats that serve a purpose besides just tasting doggie-delish.

Stuff that comes in boxes, bags and who knows what else.  They got smart a few years ago and only bring home small bags, etc.  We take a sniff and walk away unless we like the stuff.  If we don't like it, they give it to some other dog and that poor old thing is huge, loved and not lacking for food.  He has his own stimulus plan.<br /><br />Sorry for the elaborate history but Hartz has done it again.  We really like these small biscuits and know full well that the humans will get more.  I can't wait to see the Vet to show off our clean teeth.  Even though it has been only a few days the difference is quite obvious  They almost sparkle and by the time we get to the end of the box they will look like TV teeth.  We simply do not care about all those human considerations like calories, fat, fill and such.  We care about taste and the ability to knaw and eat something that makes our mouths and tummy feel good.  Hartz Crunch 'n Clean fills the bill.  Thanks for stopping by and y'all come on back.  Wuff Wuff.

review/summary: Good crunchy bones
review/text: I had ordered the large bones, and they are truly large.  And instead of being the usual flat style doggie bones, they are very thick.  These are great for big dogs.

review/summary: "Small" sized biscuits
review/text: First off, my dog loves these buscuits.  I'm not sure if it is still just from the novelty of having something new, but even that would indicate that they aren't just the same old treat in a different box.  Now, like most dogs, she gets excited for just about any type of treat, but she clearly favors some over others, and she does enjoy the Hartz Crunch n Clean Dog Biscuit, Small.<br /><br />My dog is also 60 lbs, and would not be considered small -but these aren't too small for her.  The biscuits are very hard and might be a bit big for a really small dog.  I usually buy small to medium size treats anyway, so they are a good size for my dog.<br /><br />If you have concerns about ingredients:  these do contain artificial food colorings, lots of 'unpronouncables' and a high wheat content. I generally avoid these in dog food, but since this is the equivalent of doggie junk food, I can dole these out sparingly as rewards and not a diet supplement.<br /><br />The dog says five stars, but I'm leaning towards three stars because of the ingredients, so we have settled on four stars overall :)

review/summary: My dog likes the other brand better.
review/text: I gave a Hartz to my dog and he ate part of it and stopped. Then I gave him the "other" brand and he ate it up. So my dog only will eat this if there's nothing else around. It's hard to write a review since it's up to the dog whether he likes it or dislikes it. Each dog is different on what they feel is good so I didn't get to the point to see if it helped his teeth or not.

review/summary: our dogs get very excited
review/text: We have a Jack Russell & a Rat Terrier. We give them some kind of teeth cleaning chewie every night (usually Greenies). Our rat terrier can be picky... be she loves these. When she sees us get the box, she runs to her crate for her bedtime "treat". They are the perfect size for our dogs.

review/summary: Tasty biscuit according to my dog
review/text: As another reviewer mentioned, these biscuits are a bit large for a very small dog.  I have a maltipoo and do not usually give him bones this big so I would break them up -- which is no easy feat since these are hard as rocks.  I guess that is what helps remove the tarter?  Anyway, I would put a biscuit in a sandwich baggie and use a small hammer to break up the biscuit and give him a little piece as a treat.  My dog probably only eats one full biscuit daily since I don't want to over-treat and worry about weight gain.  He does love them though and he always enjoys eating them.  I cannot say that his teeth look cleaner to my eye but I do try to keep his teeth clean and am for anything that helps accomplish that with ease as these biscuits do.  I took off a star for the somewhat questionable ingredient list and also for the size.  An extra-small would be a good idea or a small treat size nib.
