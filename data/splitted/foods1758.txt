review/summary: Call me odd I guess
review/text: I've been using the Kahlua K-cups for a while now and just received my most recent repeat order of them from Amazon. I have a Keurig brewer at home and in my office so I use it often. I couldn't quite put my finger on the smell, but when the 1-star reviews mentioned "skunk" I initially thought "BINGO!" until others mentioned a caramel and rum scent - it can almost go either way, but to me is a very pleasing smell. Call me odd if you want but the aroma is one of the most enticing things about this K-cup - I just love the way it smells! My wife does not drink coffee - at all, she uses our Keurig maker for tea - but after I let her smell my cup she mentioned that the aroma of this coffee would be something that might actually get her to start. Of all of the flavored K-cups I have to say this is the bst I've tried so far, and as for the smell? No one at work has mentioned anything to me about it other than it smells great. The flavor isn't much like actual Kahlua in coffee, but I haven't tasted any of the flavored cups which taste like real liquor in coffee so I didn't expect that anyway.

review/summary: Not Bad, But Not Great
review/text: In regards to the reviews stating that it creates a horrendous smell, I find that not to be accurate in my case.  I brewed a cup and though there is a strong aroma, it is not consistent with "absolutely horrible smelling" like others have said.  I honestly find the Timothy's Irish cream to be horrendous smelling.  Anyways when the coffee is done there is a very good hint of kahlua that hits your nose.  Unfortunately upon taking a sip it did not impact my taste buds the same way.  It is not a bad tasting coffee, but it isn't the same as taking some real kahlua and putting some in your coffee. In closing if you want kahlua flavor just get yourself some real kahlua. Fortunately I have some to add to the actual coffee so I can get through the boxes I bought.  If you really love kahlua this is not going to satisfy you.  I would not buy it again.

review/summary: Quite possibly the grossest marketed drink I've ever had a sip of
review/text: I love Kahlua. I love Coffee. Kahlua Coffee K-Cup? I'm in! Has to be a winner, right? Dead wrong. I can't even think of anything that remotely resembles the odor of this brew. It's like a cup of coffee that's sat outside for 2 weeks to go rancid, then reheated. The flavor isn't any better: I thought maybe I was going crazy and had my girlfriend take a sip. Her response? "Oh no way... that is bad! Really bad! Throw it out - I don't want you to get sick!" Seriously, I have no idea how this can remain on the market. It's like a company marketing used bath water as drinking water.<br /><br />Listen, I'm sure if I put a half cup of half-and-half and a quarter cup of sugar in the cup, this might be palatable (as is what seems to be the case with the positive reviews). That said, you can essentially make any concoction somewhat palatable with that blend. Heck, wanna improve your cup of Kahlua brew with half-and-half and sugar? Remove the Kahlua from the equation and drink yourself a cup of half-and-half with sugar.<br /><br />You've been warned: This stuff is foul.

I just purchased a box of 18 from "another store" and paid $11.99 + $0.93 tax.  Amazon's per-serving cost is  $1.37.  My per-serving cost was $0.59!!  So, shop around! You may save some money.

review/summary: Single best Keurig coffee flavor so far!
review/text: So this is my first review, but I was compelled to write this. I've tried a lot of the Keurig coffee flavors so far. Maybe about 40 or so. My previous favorites were Timothy's Hazelnut and Coffee People Donut Shop, but this one blows those out of the water!<br /><br />The flavor and smell can only be described as the smell you get at a Gloria Jean's coffee shop. Apparently some people don't like that smell, but I LOVE IT! I never heard about Kahlua coffee liqueur before today, but I'm a HUGE fan now. I wish I knew about this coffee sooner...

review/summary: Tried it,... 17 K-Cups left,.... I'll pay you to take 'em
review/text: Oh if I had only read the reviews before I bought an 18 count box.<br /><br />Having tried and enjoyed many of the K-Cup varieties, I was excited to try something a little different. I like the flavor of Kahlua and looked forward to my first cup during ride to work as I set my travel mug in the brewer. I returned to the room a few minutes later to be assailed by a horrendous stench. I was certain our aging dog had befouled the house somewhere in hiding. Honestly, I made no connection between this horror an the scent of actual coffee. My wife came in and immediatley accused the poor dog of the same offense. Looking back, I know I'm a bit cheap, because I forced myself to muscle down a half cup of that steaming foulness before I gave up and poured it in the bushes in front of work. When I returned to my truck at lunchtime, an overwelming odor, akin to a soiled diaper, rolled out, simply from the empty mug left baking in the cab in the heat of the day. Just great, had I left the used K-Cup in the machine at home; I was sure I'd have to burn the drapes and rip out the carpet to get that godawful reek out of the house.<br /><br />I cannot fathom how there are good reviews on this stuff. The only thing I can think of is that they managed to make a decent batch at some point. Anyway, I just found the 17 remaining K-Cups in the back of the cupboard, where they've sat for months. I hope when I chuck the box in the trash they don't get broken open and exposed to moisture. I'd hate to have to call the city for a new dumpster and explain that no, I was not actually raising goats in the city.<br /><br />I've given it one star, because it did brew brown and it was hot. Two characteristics shared by real coffee.

review/text: Wehave ordered Timothy's Kahlua Coffee many times.  However, this time, we were unhappy with the product.  Over 12 K-cups have blown their lids, which makes the<br />grounds go in the coffee and in the insert.  Makes for a "gritty" cup of coffee.<br />Apparently, the lids aren't sealed properly. Not good to drink coffee with grounds floating to top and covering the bottom.  May have to rethink ordering this coffee again.

review/summary: Disregard The Negative Reviews
review/text: I don't understand all the negative reviews...this coffee is great! I had purchased a box of it and hadn't tried it yet; however, after reading the reviews here, I was ready to take it back to the store and exchange it for another flavor. But I thought I should at least give it a try...I'm glad I did! It is a milder coffee but it has a wonderful aroma and flavor! I was pleasantly surprised as I was expecting something disgusting (as per some of the reviews here). I certainly didn't smell SKUNK! It smelled very good as it was brewing...a little carmel-like. I added a little carmel whipped topping and it tastes scrumptious.<br /><br />I hope you will give it a fair trial and don't be biased by the negative reviews. People have different tastes; coffee is such an individual preference. That's why there are ten zillion variety of coffees. But I hope you'll give this one a chance...I bet you'll be glad you did! ;-)

I'd also like to play around with the various creamer flavors to determine which one tastes the best.

review/text: The only thing about this coffee that even remotely resembles Kahlua is the picture on the box. It smells and tastes like burnt coffee beans. While Kahlua does have a mild toasted flavor to it, it's nothing like the burnt over lighter fluid smell and taste that you get from this disapointingly bad cup of coffee. If you like Kahlua, get a bottle and pour some in your favorite brew. Don't waste your money on this swill.

review/summary: what's that SMELL?
review/text: I waited anxiously for this to arrive. The afternoon it came, I made a cup right away. A faint smell, similar to sewer gas or rotten egg smell, permeated my kitchen. Since the kitchen is next to the laundry room, I thought maybe it WAS a sewer smell. But once I started sipping my new coffee, I realized it's the COFFEE. It smells only faintly, but it's such a repulsive smell I had to dump the rest of the cup. I am quite bummed that I have 2 boxes of this stuff. I think I will buy a bottle of Kahlua, and add a splash to a cup of this stuff. Maybe that will help me get through the 47 more kcups I have.<br /><br />I read all these reviews on this site, and half the people seem to LOVE the coffee (and not get a bad odor)...the other half seem to get the bad odor and HATE the coffee. Are there 2 suppliers, with differing ingredients?<br /><br />I strongly, strongly recommend trying to get a sample of this before shelling out the money for a full box of these kcups.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: One word to describe this K-Cup: Yum! The kahlua taste is great and taste very similar to the Kahlua coffee they sometime serve at the coffee house (i.e., bruegger's bagels). The coffee is not as strong as I usually like, but the taste more than makes up for that.

review/text: I've adored Kahluah Original coffee since I first saw it in the store (in drip form).  I was happy to see that it is also available in a K-cup. For me, this is perfect. It's a strong cup of coffee with just a touch of flavor. My husband hates it.  Since I'm doing the review, It's a 5-star.

review/text: The only thing this coffee has related to Kahlua is the logo. I didn't expect alcohol, but I did expect some cream and sweetness included at the very least with anything branded Kahlua or Bailey's. It smells great but tastes horrible. All you really get from the Kahlua branding is a price markup with none of the qualities of Kahlua.

review/summary: Must have been a manufacturing problem
review/text: I bought the smaller box at the store and loved the flavor, so I bought the double 24 pack of 48.  More than half of the cups caused a big mess with liquid splashing all over the counter and grinds in my cup. With a little investigation I discovered that the top of the cups were sagging, not tightly stretched. This allowed the maker to pierce the top, but left space and conditions for leakage at the top.  No other cup has ever caused this problem with my machine including my initial purchase of this product. Yes,I cleaned and inspected the machine. The problem was with both of the 24 count boxes. It is a crap shoot having used nearly 3/4 of the purchase, some are OK, most will create a big mess on my counter and insert grinds into my cup.  I am not happy with this purchase.

I am almost to the point of not buying it again, however, because I keep having trouble with the seals on top of the k-cups coming open during brewing.  This wastes a lot of coffee because grounds get all in the cup I am brewing.  Not mo mention, coffee goes EVERYWHERE!  The water goes out the top of the k-cup and shoots out every which way!

review/summary: Skunk-fest!!
review/text: I ordered this for my mom because she has always loved a little Kahlua in her coffee and I thought this would make her very happy.  I couldn't believe the stink!!  I went outside with a pot and and a spoon clanking all around the house trying to drive off the skunk that was on a spray-fest - the odor was that strong and awful.  It burned our eyes and noses, and we ended up opening the windows and leaving the house for several hours until we thought it was safe to come home.  I now have a box of 23 Kahlua k-cups that will never get used and a bunch of money that would have been better spent if it were flushed down the toilet.  Heck, this coffee smells like it came from the sewer, anyway.  I went through a half can of Febreeze trying to bind up the acrid stench of this stinking coffee in my house.  Remember when you were a kid and you'd drive by a farm and everyone would rush to roll up their windows because the cow manure stunk SO BAD?  Well, this is worse!  DO NOT GET THIS coffee!!  Blech. :p~

review/text: Maybe they were better 3-4 years ago but today in 2012 they have gone down hill. Cracker Jacks have always been my favorite and as far as I know I'm the only person I've met that eats them. I went to try the 7Oz bag because I'm used to the little boxes and never had a big bag. Well let me tell you if you see a big bag just skip it alright. In this giant bag there were on 3! YES! I counted them! 3 Peanuts in the entire bag! "Carmel coated popcorn & 3 Peanuts!" is what the bag should say. One, Two, THREE! that is all I got! and you know what I noticed that over the years there has always been less and less and less peanuts in the box. I don't know what fritolay is trying to do. Is it so bad to put what peanuts in the cracker jacks? They're supposed to be in there. All you get in todays bags are mostly caramel covered popcorn. I've been eating Poppycock instead because they have more nuts in them (yeah go head an laugh at that sentence I don't care). I just hate it when companies mess with my favorites just to save a few dollars. I was okay with them putting in those crummy cheap stickers and calling it a TOY. but taking away the peanuts!

review/summary: Awesome, but not coffee
review/text: I'm a pretty avid coffee drinker, often of mid to high end coffee. At a local restaurant, I asked for decaf coffee, and they offered Dandy Blend as alternative. I tried it, and it was awesome, but not at all like coffee.<br /><br />However, it is delicious, and I've served it to really fussy people who have loved it. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's more of a flavor halfway between coffee and hot chocolate, but it really does have its own unique taste.<br /><br />Best way to serve it: 12 ounces hot vanilla almond milk (sweetened or unsweetened with a little Splenda), a heaping tablespoon of Dandy Blend, and... drink. It's been my evening snack the past few weeks and what I look forward to eating the most in my day.

review/summary: Another "thumbs up" review plus some storage tips included
review/text: Much has been written about how great this product is and of all kinds of benefits it has, so there is no need to elaborate on that, other than add my vote to it.<br />The purpose of this review is sharing some practical usage and storage tips with the "newbies" so you don't accidentally waste and have to throw away your supply.<br /><br />There are smaller packages of Dandy blend available even here on Amazon, however economically this size makes best practical sense, as it's the least expensive (price per oz) option, provided you will store it right.<br />The instruction on the label say that Dandelion is sensitive to moisture and the bag needs to be resealed completely after each use.  However I found out that itself is not enough (I live in area with high humidity).<br /><br />From my experience, the best thing to do if you buy this size is to either share it with a friend and/or do the following:  I put mine in a small size glass mason jar with a lid and store it in the fridge (or even freezer, either way).<br />What is left, stays in the original bag, gets sealed, put in additional Ziploc bag and stored in the freezer.  There it will last quite a long time.<br />What happens if you leave it at room temperature is, it absorbs moisture and hardens into a block pretty quickly, and you have to literally chisel it to break a piece off, plus it dissolves lot harder and loses some original flavor, so it pretty much gets ruined.  I found out the hard way and had to throw away quite a sizable amount the first time I bought it.<br /><br />Cold temperature will keep it nice, powdery and fresh for a long time.<br />You can play with the concentration (some people like less, I prefer mine stronger), drink it 'just like that' or put all kinds of enhancements in:<br />sweeteners (I don't use white sugar, prefer stevia, xylitol or coconut sugar),<br />"whiteners" (half and half, rice milk, almond milk etc.),<br />cacao powder,<br />cinnamon,<br />nutmeg,<br />natural flavoring like almond or vanilla, whatever your imagination comes up with), just as you would with coffee.<br /><br />Definitely recommended and worth giving a try!!!

review/text: Chicory and barley are both galactogogues, so this product is great for breast feeding moms who want coffee flavor, but do not want the caffeine to pass on to their little ones. I have been using it throughout my whole pregnancy and the 8 weeks since delivery. Love it!

review/text: I have been using Dandy Blend for about four years now as an alternative to coffee.  I drink it first because it is a great alternative but also because of taste.  I had tried so many dandilion teas that I lost count.  Most were just plain nasty.  I also have stomach problems and just have to avoid coffee.  I recommend this to everyone as a wonderful tasting alternative....they make great lattes too!

review/text: I like chicory coffee, tried this and am very pleased.  Nutty flavor - definitely not a coffee flavor.  I suggest finding a friend who has some and trying it or buying it with a few others who want to try it to reduce cost.  I also like it at twice the recommended strength so I get about 225 cups of beverage at about $.20 a cup.  Try it at high strength with almond milk. Yummmm.

review/summary: Pretty good, for a coffee substitute.
review/text: I am a picky coffee-drinker. I LOVE my Starbucks lattes.  I have been trying to cut back my 3-cup-per-day consumption, however, which led me to Dandy Blend.  I didn't expect it to taste like my Starbucks, I was just trying to appreciate it for its unique flavor.  I have to say it's a lot better than I expected.  I still prefer good coffee, but if I had to choose between Dandy Blend and cheap coffee, I would choose Dandy Blend.  It tastes a lot more like coffee than I thought it would.  My kids love it (they are 4 and 8).  I warm up some milk for them and mix it in and they have "lattes" with Mommy.  This way I don't have to worry about giving them too much sugar and Dandy Blend is good for the liver, among other things.  It's also a good substitute for hot chocolate for them, which I don't give them often because of the sugar.  But you have to drink something warm and creamy when you come in from playing in the snow.  It's definitely worth a try, and it's a pretty good value considering how many cups you can get out of a 2# bag.

review/summary: Delish and yes, according to manufacturer, gluten free!
review/text: I am, in general, not a fan of substitutes. It is just not how I am wired. That being said, however, I do understand the value of the concept. So even though I don't drink something to replace something else.... I can, absolutely report, that Dandy Blend is delish!!!!!!  As a result of Acupuncture, I stopped drinking coffee. An awesome side effect of treatment. My body kept saying.... "uh, no, coffee makes you feel like crap". But I have been drinking a lot of strong black tea ( awesome Yorkshire Red). While it does not make me wired like coffee and completely trash my adrenals, I recognize the need to eliminate caffeine from my daily routine. I recently tried dandy blend (a cute sample package from the Community Acupuncture office here)<br /><br />I really like it. The flavor is rich and deep. I have tried it w/ cream and coconut milk. It holds its own with either mixer, as well as alone.<br /><br />And for anyone concerned w/ gluten? According to the manufacturer, it is FREE of gluten.<br /><br />From their own website [...]<br /><br />How Can There Be No Gluten if there is Barley and Rye?<br />This is the most frequently asked of all questions about Dandy Blend.<br /><br />Dandy Blend is made of the water-soluble extracts of five ingredients--three roots and two grains. The ingredients are roasted separately and them combined in prescribed proportions, placed into a vat, covered with hot water, and allowed to steep for a prescribed period of time. The water, with the soluble portions of all the components, is separated from the grounds and spray dried. The remaining fine brown powder left after the water is driven off is what becomes Dandy Blend. All the gluten and other water-insoluble substances are left behind in the grounds to be composted.<br /><br />Hence, there is no gluten in Dandy Blend. Goosefoot Acres periodically submits samples of Dandy Blend to Elisa Technologies Laboratory in Florida, one of the most respected gluten testing labs in the United States for analysis, and so far, every test has come back gluten-free. Click to see test results letter.<br /><br />Therefore, from the standpoint of containing gluten, Dandy Blend is safe for celiac sufferers and other gluten -intolerant individuals.

I don't really care for the taste now ...so I'm giving it away to friends or keep it in the cupboard as a decaf replacement.

review/text: Caffeine free, gluten free and tastes better than coffee for people who don't like harsh coffee taste or the noxious smell of the real thing.  Actually what I bought this for was the chicory to re-make a tea/spice blend of a tea that has been discontinued by Celestial; I was able to make the spice blend but chicory was missing and I intended to add Dandy Blend to to my spice mix -- BUT, I find myself drinking the DB with soy milk and enjoying it this way before bed without unnecessary caffeine.  Pretty good when you convert a non-coffee drinker.  And not everything mixes well with soy milk, which is a pain for the dairy- impaired -- but this product mixes very well.  Very pleasant outcome for me.  No coffee breath! Very smooth and soothing.

review/text: My wife and I have been drinking Dandy Blend for years.  So long in fact that we used to have to order it directly from Dandy Blend and pay $10 for standard UPS Ground shipping, because you couldn't find it anywhere else!  It's so nice to be able to buy it on Amazon, and with Prime shipping!<br /><br />We still drink Starbucks coffee in the morning, using the french press that I bought at one of their stores, but we just can't handle the caffeine or acidity of coffee after dinner, so we use Dandy Blend in the evenings and for making iced coffee and desserts.<br /><br />Dandy Blend:<br /><br />Tastes like coffee but has no caffeine<br />Has no acidity or bitterness<br />Is naturally sweetened with its own built-In fructose (no sugar or fructose added)<br />Contains all the goodness of dandelions<br />Is delicious iced<br />Dissolves instantly in hot or cold water<br />Can be used in any recipe which calls for instant coffee<br /><br />It has a slight taste of chicory that coffee does not have, but when mixed with half and half, flavored creamers, or Baileys ;-) you cannot tell that it is not coffee.  And from the health perspective, Dandy Blend is made from just 5 ingredients: the totally water-soluble extracts of roasted dandelion, chicory and sugar beet roots, and two roasted grains - barley and rye.<br /><br />Using 2 tablespoons of Dandy Blend per cup, this 2 pound back lasts us about a year, and we can feel good about giving our kids a cup when they get jealous over seeing us drinking coffee.

review/summary: Dandy Blend, 2# Bulk Foil Bag
review/text: I really enjoy Dandy Blend.  Since I am unable to drink caffine, I find Dandy Blend to be an alternative that is delightfully tasty and yet not overpowering.  Since Kraft no longer makes Postum, which was my non-caffinated drink of choise, this turned out to be my favorite substitute.  I highly recommend this for anyone who is intollerant of caffine. This was recommended to me by a friend who can drink coffee and yet still enjoys this as a caffine substitute that can be consumed throughout the day without having to worry about getting a caffine-high during the middle of the day.  This is a wonderful alternative to coffee for those who are unable to drink caffinated drinks, is reasonably priced if you buy in bulk quantities (2# bag highly recommended).  Goosefoot Acres shipped it right out and I was back in simulated coffee heaven in short order!

review/text: I had been drinking coffee since I was a young teen. About a year ago I gave up caffeine because of my blood pressure and switched to decaffeinated coffee. I have never cared for decaffeinated coffee and soon grew tired of it. My blood pressure is down and my heart has a nice steady beat now, but I miss having something hot to drink throughout the day. I searched my local store for some coffee substitutes and didn't find anything. I searched Amazon.com and found three that I wanted to try: Cafix, Caf-Lib, and Dandy Blend. Of the three Dandy Blend was my favorite.

review/text: I got off coffee month's ago because coffee makes your body acidic for the day.  I now drink a cup of Dandy Blend every morning instead of coffee.  It's made from dandelions, which balances your body's ph.  Most people are too acidic.  The product has always been very good for the times I have purchased it.  I highly recommend getting off coffee and drinking Dandy Blend, hot or cold.  I don't miss coffee like I thought I would.  In fact, when I tried a cup of coffee, I didn't like it.  Dandelions are full of minerals and vitamins and very valuable "weeds" that you can eat in salad as well.
