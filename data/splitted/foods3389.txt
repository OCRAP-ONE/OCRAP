review/summary: made in usa, rawhide free
review/text: Great product!  Next time I'll buy bigger ones for my dog (cattle dog mix). She loves these but only takes 3mins to finish 1.  Made in iowa, usa (package says...), and only ingredient is 'beef pizzle' and 'natural smoked flavor'.  Good product to test with to see if your dog likes them or not.

review/summary: Wheaten gives it 6 stars!
review/text: My Wheaten terrier is a very fussy eater when it comes to treats and he gives these American made bully sticks 6 stars.  Some of the other sticks I've purchased smell so bad that I had to give them to other dog owners who were not as fussy as I am with regard to odor.  But, these he really loves and they DO NOT SMELL.  I will continue to buy them even though they are pricy because I love my dog.

review/summary: No Odor and Made in the USA
review/text: After my vet advised us NOT to buy rawhide from China, I searched far and wide looking for items made in the USA.  These are a bit expensive, but our dog loves them and it saves our furniture.  These are low odor -- which we discovered is not the case with other bully sticks.  I bought another brand at pet store yesterday, and I can't stand to be in the same room with him.  Not only does the stick stink, but the dog has the odor now.  We'll stick with the True Chews.

review/summary: Beware the vague language of seller
review/text: The item is called "3pk 6 Inch Premium..."  and the description says "3 Come in each Package" suggests 3 packs of 3 bully sticks for a total of 9 as "pk" facially appears to be a contraction for "Package."  Not the case.  There is exactly three (3) bully sticks total.  While some may say 'one can never assume,' one can also say 'if the seller isn't absolutely clear, they will get downvotes.'

review/text: This is expensive, but it does not stink as others have stated.  My dog loves these sticks, and it actually takes him a while to get through a stick.  I gave him one yesterday and he chewed off a side and has hidden the rest of the stick somewhere in the house.  Luckily, the thing doesn't smell and hopefully won't attract any bugs now that it's no longer summer.

review/summary: Rip Off!!!!!!!!!!  Do Not Buy!!!!!!!
review/text: I agree with one of the other reviewers.  The language and pictures are vague.  "3pk 6 inch" and the picture shows multiple packs.  You think you are getting three packs, each with three inside, so a total of nine.<br /><br />You only get ONE pack with three pieces - so $11.55 for only three thin six inch pieces?!?!???!!!  This is a super RIP OFF!!!!<br /><br />Also, the seller claims that the language is clear.  Well, if there is any doubt, instead of trying to defend themselves, why don't they just edit the words and pictures so that buyers know exactly what they are getting?  This is the simple answer.

review/summary: Transcendental - you gotta try it.
review/text: I'm a bit of spice hound and have flirted with other hot sauces before, but nothing has ever seized hold of me like Sriracha. An old Greenwich Village burger joint near where I worked at NYU used to serve it on the tables with popcorn and the combo was killer. The memory haunted me for years before I finally picked up a bottle. I shouldn't have waited. This stuff is amazingly addictive with a garlicky sweet hot yumminess that's hard to describe. It sits on my table in front of the salt and pepper and I've drained a bottle in a 3 month period. Incredible on eggs, superb on burritos, utterly transforms dull dietetic chicken vegitable dishes from the Chinese restaurant. I put a squirt in the health low-sodium soups instead of more salt and all of a sudden all the flavors perk up. Utterly highest recommendation.<br /><br />I, personally, do not buy the 28oz size - even though it's almost the same price as the 17oz size. (it's not a total freebie - Shipping is a bit higher on the 28oz).  While Sriracha has preservatives and doesn't need refrigeration it does oxidize a bit and at the pace I use it the bottom third of the 28oz gets a bit stale for me, while I suck the 17oz down while it's still fresh.  If I lived in a house with more spice hounds (I'm the only one around here) or if I were cooking with it more often in larger recipies the 28oz would be a big bargain.

It isn't just a hot sauce, it has flavor. It is so good. It's good on chicken and eggs. It is out of this world on cottage cheese, sounds like a strange combo but I haven't tried anything that it tasted so good on, the cool of the cottage cheese, the heat of the chili sauce, yum!<br /><br />It does have a good bit of heat to it. I have to have something close by to drink because it does burn the tongue a little.<br /><br />I'm addicted now and will be a lifelong lover of this chili sauce. I find myself looking through the refrigerator just looking for something to put my chili sauce on.<br /><br />Yes, it's that good.

review/summary: This is the new Ketchup
review/text: I was going to High School in California about 15 years ago when a Vietnamese friend of mine INSIST that I try this. I'm pretty open minded to new kinds of foods so I gave it a try. "Tongue Ought Shurocka?" I said. "DUDE!" "Not even close!" he said as he laughed like hell. I still have no idea how to pronounce the name but it has been my favorite Hot Sauce ever since. Over the years, I have been seeing it pop up everywhere from PF Chang's & Applebee's to Firehouse Subs. If you like hot sauce or any kind of spicy foods at all, then you MUST try this. I INSIST.<br /><br />Imagine going through your entire life without Ketchup or BBQ sauce? Just take a second and actually think about how plain so many foods would taste like without them. "The Rooster Sauce" is like that. As you can see from the other reviews, it has about the same applications as BBQ sauce or Ketchup would have for a person who likes it hot. No other hot sauce that I have ever tried has the same texture, heat and most importantly FLAVOR as this one does. It brings out the flavor in nearly anything that you put it on, from the obvious Tacos, burritos, Chow Mein, Chili, Meat & Poultry, to Clam Chowder, fish sticks or even.. OMG Peanut Butter Sandwiches? (haven't done that one yet but it's probably ... interesting).<br /><br />Let me try to describe this to somebody who hasen't tried "The Rooster Sauce" before. First of all, unlike standard hot sauce, it has the texture of Ketchup or BBQ sauce which makes it cling to any kind of finger foods, chips, etc. perfectly. The taste is what is the kicker though. A garlicky, sweet, HOT flavor that is vastly different from anything else. Since it comes in a convenient squeeze bottle, it can be applied to anything, anywhere. This stuff is a god send when living in a world of quick, frozen, packaged, fast food which is dull, bland and virtually tasteless. This is also great for anybody on a special diet who wants to add some flavor to a very limited menu.<br /><br />As far as the Heat is concerned, let me warn you that this stuff is pretty darn HOT. It's made from Red Jalapeno paste so it's not ridiculously hot but it definitely has some serious heat. If you don't like hot, spicy food then this stuff probably isn't for you. On the other hand, a little goes a long way. Just a few drops add good spice and flavor. A WHOLE BUNCH ... may take a little getting used to. I've gotten to the point where I literally submerge things like chicken wings into this stuff. It will really make you sweat out those toxins.<br /><br />"The Rooster Sauce" would also make a good gift for the person who has it all. A few years ago, I was living all the way across the U.S. and my Mom sent me a bottle. It sounds silly but it was one of the most cherished items in my house. If giving it to somebody who has never tried it before, it may very well be like introducing someone to BBQ or Ketchup for the first time. In other words it's a thing that they will always remember.<br /><br />Now as far as complaints? Well as stated in another review, the cap can get a little bit gunky, so you may have to run it under the sink a few times to get it nice and clean again. Not a real big deal. The other isn't a complaint at all but because they don't use any artificial colors, the sauce can darken after a few months. It will go from the original bright red to a deep red color. I haven't really noticed a difference in taste though. Since this is hot sauce, you can store it unrefrigerated without worrying about it getting spoiled. I actually prefer to have the color change slightly then to have it filled with artificial junk to keep it looking nice. If you really have to keep the nice bright red color, then I suggest keeping it refrigerated.<br /><br />One last thing to keep in mind. This product is MADE IN THE U.S.A. In an economy as bad as this one, we need all of the help we can get.

review/summary: Will not go a day without it.
review/text: I am still amazed at the number of people that have not experienced "The Rooster", as we have come to call it.  I have been using it for over 10 years, and have to say that it is hands-down the best, most versatile hot sauce in the world.<br /><br />The best part about this sauce is ability to not only add some heat to your food, but also blend seamlessly without overpowering it.  Pasta dishes, tomato soup, chili, to name a few that really benefit from The Rooster.  Come to think of it, I probably put it on 9 out of 10 meals I eat.  I have a bottle at my desk (which my coworkers' lunches have come to benefit from, as well), a bottle at the dinner table, and, of course, one on standby or travel.<br /><br />I only have two small complaints, and both are packaging related:  the green cap, in recent years, has become  a bit of a hassle.  Nothing major, but just noticeably problematic.  No one believes me, but I swear they changed the green cap.  Anyway, over time, the cap tends to leak out the red chili oil form around the threads.  It also seems to clog up faster than I have experienced before.  I tend to have to remove the cap and clean it out at the sink in order to unclog it and remove the excess chili oil from dripping down the side of the bottle.  Nothing serious, but when you use it as much as I do, it can be a bit of a nuisance.<br /><br />Anyway, I swear by this stuff: it is my "island condiment" (the only condiment i would ever need should I get stranded on an island.)

review/text: This is my favorite multiple use hot sauce, hands down. Don't be fooled into thinking this is low brow either, they use this on Iron Chef and they know how to make a meal!<br /><br />A few foods I recommend trying this on:<br /><br />Chicken Shawarma<br />Gyros<br />Sushi (mix some in with your wasabi and soy sauce)<br />Cheese Quesadilla<br />Macaroni & Cheese<br />Eggs on toast<br /><br />An few extra notes: It is very hard to distinguish Sriracha from ketchup just by looking; it is similar thickness, color and consistency. I would give it a 3/5 on the hot scale, with 2/5 being a med-hot buffalo wing, 4/5 = 1st degree chemical burn on the lips, 5/5 = strait additive only sauces. If you can take the hottest of store purchased salsas and buffalo wings this will be similar and have no long term discomfort/burning.<br /><br />Usage may vary, void where prohibited

review/summary: The most addictive hot sauce there is
review/text: What's in this stuff? I'm not a hot sauce fanatic, and I don't even like overly spicy food, but this stuff is positively addictive. There is a sweet component to it, and a garlicky component that makes this more than just plain tabasco or hot sauce.<br /><br />I particularly like it on sliced avocado, scrambled egg or fried egg, and on stir fries, especially plainer ones with tofu and veg. It's also absolutely delectable on shrimp as a cocktail sauce mixed with ketchup, or on fish in general.  When we go out for Vietnamese pho (a broth with rice noodles, bean sprouts and various meats and garnishes) we squirt in a good lashing of this sauce to liven up the broth.<br /><br />I even saw a "pyramid" of food groups cartoon, with sriracha sauce squirted all over the pyramid, and I can only agree with the sentiment. There's practically no food, save chocolate ice cream, that isn't improved by a dash of this.

review/summary: If it's edible, this hot sauce belongs on it!
review/text: Excellent quality and depth of flavor.  Add flavor and spice to any food without loosing the food's original taste.  Unlike other hot sauces vinegar is not the main flavor.  Add to real Mayo with a little onion juice and a pinch of chili powder for a great "southwest sauce".  Add with equal amounts of balsamic vinegar (instead of oil) for an excellent glaze that goes with any healthy dipping food or sandwich.<br /><br />Tips: 1) the more red the chili sauce the hotter, the more orange is a little less hot.  2) leave the screw cap in open position all of the time, otherwise the temperature change when going from the frig to room temp can cause a tiny amount of sauce to spray out when you open the nozzle and small amounts to ooze from the cap.  3) another user had a good suggestion by buying the smaller bottles to always ensure the freshest product.

I add this to soups and Chinese dishes which are just not spicy/hot enough.  This product is a little sweet, has a strong garlic flavor, has a vibrant and natural red color, but needs to be tasted to be judged - Taste is ultimately subjective.  Look at the ingredient list to get a better idea of what this product may taste like to you.  One of the real benefits:  You can add a little to a lot of food and still enjoy its taste.  One can use this as a dipping sauce, because its consistency is not watery - Before using, make sure to shake it a little.  I bought this around a week and a half before writing this review and the product's expiration date is in 2013.

review/text: I don't like spicy foods very much. However when it comes to Sriracha... I will eat it with anything. I usually put it into any Chinese or Thai food for a flavorful boost. I was amazed to find it here on Amazon. It was the first time I discovered food was available on Amazon too. I just thought... "Gosh! I am never leaving my house!". I couldn't find it in any supermarket in my neighborhood so I am very delighted.

review/summary: Walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha
review/text: Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NIND">Bon App&eacute;tit</a> magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show and shared, "If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on."<br /><br />There are many sellers offering sriracha on Amazon.com. I recommend you compare the shipping charges of each. You can save by buying in quantity (and sharing with friends and relatives). Many supermarket chains are now carrying sriracha for $5 or less per bottle, again depending on the size.<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed "Thai ketchup." Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars

review/summary: Huey Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (28oz)
review/text: I think the first time I had this was served by a Hot Dog vendor on the street in Crystal City, Virginia. It was so good I asked him for the name of the sauce and wrote it down. I have had trouble locating it from time to time in the local grocery and Asian food stores so I am happy to see Amazon carrying it. Great for anything you want to add some spicy heat on. My favorite for adding to any Asian or American meat dish, fish, chili, spaghetti, and many other things. If the top of your head isn't sweating a little it just isn't helping your immune system. Just tell any restaurant that you want the hot sauce with the rooster on the bottle with the green top.<br /><br />CA Luster

review/summary: Not as hot as I feared and quite tasty!
review/text: For years I'd seen what I jokingly called the "screaming chicken" hot sauce out at various restaurants, but I was always too intimidated to try it, even though I love hot sauce.  The mostly non-English labeling and contents made me think it was probably wicked hot. As with so many things I was put off by, I'm kicking myself now that I've tried it, as Sriracha sauce isn't that hot and in fact has a nice touch of sweetness to it that makes it a great addition to Thai and Chinese dishes.  Truthfully it's nowhere near as hot as Tabasco sauce and on the Scoville Scale of hotness it ranks only at the 1,000-2,5000 range making it medium (Tabasco is the next level up).  As a self-confessed hot-head hot sauce lover I have to admit Sriracha has a really unique consistency that is thicker than Tabasco, yet blends well in many Asian dishes.  I typically love northern Thai food and Sriracha works well with it and with Szechwan as well.  Sriracha gives a nice pop of hot without being overpowering like some hot sauces or the truly hot Thai chilies that rate up at 50,000-100,000 on the Scoville scale.  If something is a bit too bland for my taste usually a bit of Sriracha gets my mouth watering. As I've learned, if you like to spice things up ask your server about the sauces and chilies and try a small little sample, but don't live in fear of hot sauces.  Perhaps the best thing about Sriracha is it's a known quality and consistent, unlike the bowls of sauces and chilies in some Asian restaurants (believe me...I've had some that really took my breath away and I like it HOT).  And certainly don't be intimidated by the "screaming chicken"; it might well become your new friend!

review/text: Screw hot sauce, I put THIS stuff on everything! Add it to chicken, rice, beef, pasta, your shoe, or ANYTHING you're cooking to add flavorful spice. Hot sauce is alright, but it's actually kind of bland compared to sriracha. Hot sauce is watery spice and vinegar, sriracha is condensed chili, garlic, and other flavorful additions. In my mind, there's no comparison.

review/summary: Delicious hot sauce!
review/text: I first discovered Huy Fong's sriracha hot sauce at a local restaurant and I love the flavor and spice it adds to soups, noodles, meat or vegetarian dishes, sandwiches and nearly anything. Sriracha hot chili sauce is a good balance between hot and too-hot; this does not ruin but enhances the taste of food. My one complaint is the salty taste it leaves; salt is the third ingredient in the sauce and it is overused. Still, this is a reasonably priced condiment worth trying.

review/summary: Asian Hot Sauce Win
review/text: I had a roommate in college who practically drank this stuff. Our cupboards were constantly filled with the stuff. His daily ritual was to eat it with white rice and plain tofu after class every day. After a few months I got curious and wanted to try his "bread and butter" myself.<br /><br />The Huy Fong Sriracha sauce gave life to a pairing that I always considered drab and lifeless. I'm not much for spicy foods, but I thought it still delivered a nice kick- not overbearing but your mouth is definitely feeling the spice. While maybe not good before a date, the strong garlic flavor in the sauce is nicely balanced with the hot peppers. For a simple hot sauce, it's surprising versatile. I put it on all sorts of stuff now: pizza, pasta, and even steaks just to name a few.<br /><br />I now follow in the footsteps of my college roommate- I keep a bottle of this stuff in my cupboards at all time.

review/text: Googled "best hot/chili sauce in the US" the other day and Huy Fong Sriracha popped up. I read that this brand is one of the best hot chili sauce so I figured I would give it a try. I was hoping that a supermarket near my apartment would sell this brand, and to my delight it does.<br />I understand now why this is one of the best hot chili sauce out there. man! its so spicy and hot that I must have drinking water near me all the time I'm eating this sauce. Not only I like the spiciness, it has a little garlic taste to it too. Plus the squeeze bottle is a plus. I'm never gonna buy different brands again. This will do.

review/summary: The other great mild hot sauce
review/text: This is a great tasting mild hot sauce.  While it is milder than Tabasco sauce, or Cholula's hot sauce, Sriracha tastes a bit hotter because it is thicker, making it a perfect candidate to put on a sandwich or burger.  I tried this for the first time on a chicken sandwich a few days ago -- the sandwich was aleady great and the "Rooster Sauce" complimented the sandwich perfectly.  I have not tried it on seafood but the hot sauce was actually created with seafood in mind -- it does seem like it would be a viable alternative to cocktail sauce!<br /><br />I generally prefer much hotter hot sauces, but there is no denying this is a great tasting hot sauce and is perfect for lunch sandwiches.

review/text: After rave reviews from friends, I picked up a bottle of this exotic looking sauce in the supermarket. After using it in all three of my meals in one day (eggs, chili, and pasta), I am now a dedicated fan of this chili sauce. There's an initial garlic note, followed by a curious sweetness and then the wonderful, wonderful burn of chili peppers. It's as complete a hot sauce as you're likely to find. I recommend trying it on the tip of your finger first, and on its own as a condiment before mixing it into other sauces. It serves every purpose well, and is the only everyday hot sauce I'll need.<br /><br />Those who appreciate spicy food will find this sauce to be something of a culinary religious experience.

review/summary: Rooster Sauce...
review/text: As you can probably tell from the other reviews, this stuff is the new ketchup. It's popping up in restaurants and other venues, and for good reason: its tastes amazing! I can take really hot stuff, but this sauce isn't about killing your taste buds (or killing you). Instead, it lets you actually experience the flavor of the chilis front and center, while also complementing it with a strong garlic taste. I love to put this on hot dogs and hamburgers, as well as ramen noodles. Of course, feel free to experiment, I still experiment putting this on anything and everything if I think it might taste good.<br /><br />Believe it or not this sauce is made in America, despite its non-American-looking bottle. Its also as a pretty simple ingredient list that doesn't make you cringe when you look at it. I would recommend buying this (the 28oz bottle) as it is a much better deal than buying the smaller (17oz) one.

review/text: Huy Fong "Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce" is offered in just about every Chinese and Vietnamese restaurant in my area, and with good reason! Unlike at lot of hot sauces, this has a great chili pepper and garlic flavor that compliments most of the dishes I like (particularly good on Pork Lo-Mein) and also provides a good amount of spicy heat. This is not the hottest of the hot sauces but it is on the borderline for several of my friend.<br /><br />This is really good stuff and we almost always keep a bottle of it on hand to liven up or cooking or when take-out doesn't have enough "zing". It is also great to spread on chicken when grilling but watch the smoke when opening the grill lid, it is like OC spray if it gets into your eyes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Great Hot Sauce - Great Price
review/text: You see this hot sauce very popular at most oriental restaurants. Not only because of the low price but because of its terrific flavor. You get 28oz (compare that with the skinny tabasco bottle) of hot spice that will last for a very long time. Great especially for soup lovers who want to spike it up a notch. Also good with your pizzas, burritos, nachos, ... and more.

review/summary: A Potent Hot Sauce - it should be in every kitchen. Far better than Tabasco. The 28oz is only a few cents more
review/text: This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a cayenne pepper delivery device. A few drops add a lot of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a vinegar note - this product has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle sweetness with garlic notes to this sauce. While Tabasco can taste harsh if you add enough to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />I like this product and I'd recommend its purchase but I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem, in any way, exceptional. There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic sure beats the vinegar aftertaste evidenced in Tabasco.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to have it on hand.<br /><br />As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably only want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too "hot" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note

review/summary: Very Sweet
review/text: I got a big bottle of this, and ended up bringing it to work to let everyone else eat it for me.  It just tastes too sweet for me.  It is great on some things (I liked it on popcorn) but there are other hot sauces out there that have good heat without the sweet flavor.  For someone that likes the sweet flavor, it would be a great hot sauce, but for me, I couldn't get past the sweetness.

review/summary: Just hot
review/text: This is an ok hot sauce. I read the ingredients and thought it would add a bit of sweet to help balance the hotness. First ingredient is peppers. Ok, great. It's what I expected. Second ingredient is sugar. Ahhhh, that's good, too. The problem? There is no sweetness at all. I was hoping for a really nice blend of the two but it just isn't here. Don't believe I'll be buying this again. But, as a 'disclaimer', it IS hot sauce so I really like that part. If you just like it hot, you'll love this. Product was shipped in a very timely manner and I would use this vendor again for other things.

review/summary: Sriracha Sauce
review/text: I have looked at a lot of different places online for the Sriracha sauce. The cheapest place I have found for the 28oz bottle is from [...]. Even with shipping they are still the cheapest. I oredered 3 bottles and shipping was only $18.84. The next closest deal was almost $25. So if your a spice, or Hot sauce Connoisseur like myself, and want a great deal, then go to Buy Asian Foods. I am not in any way affiliated with any stores, or online sales. I live in the Midwest, and came across the 28oz bottles at a new Asian Restaurant that opened locally. Before I seen them, I could only find the 17oz bottles for $2.64 a piece. If your looking for a great deal, I have shown you the way

review/summary: The Legend of Sriracha
review/text: Tuong ot Sriracha, Tyrant of the Ancient World, was born before civilization as the offspring of an ordinary chicken raped by a fire-breathing Tyranasaurus Rex.  Through study of the occult and dark magics now forgotten he extended his life unnaturally to become practically immortal.  Terrorizing the ancient villagers was not enough - he formed a cult of horrid worshipers whose tounges had to be cut out so that they could drink of his blood and gain some of his power.<br /><br />Sriracha was challenged by Atlanta, the Water Serpent of the West, and defeated in a battle lasting three hundred years and ending on Cinqo de Mayo.  On his death he dissolved into a giant bowl of tasty, yet spicy chile paste which was gathered by his followers and put into a temple in the Himalayas to be guarded for his return.  It is to this day bottled by the Tongueless Monks of Tuong Ot and shipped to the uninitiated so that his soul can be spread out among the world to effect his return.<br /><br />Last night, Sriracha was reborn into the world.  At 3:00am, my stomach weakened by ibuprofen taken to prevent a headache, Sriracha found new life in the pits of my bowl.  A horriible pain - his unholiness pecking through my gastric wall no doubt - jolted me awake.  I finally passed out, probably from blood loss.  When I awoke a single stream of red substance was trickling down my nose.  Blood?  No.  Sriracha sauce.  His unholiness has returned to the world.<br /><br />Some facts about Sriracha<br /><br />- The bottle has instructiosn for reading an upright chest film for signs of bowel perforation<br />- His favorite saying is "Pa-caw!"<br />- It is good on any food, including ice cream - though it will melt a bowl of ice cream just by sitting the bottle in the same room with it.<br />- Those who eat Sriracha's unholy paste have to relive the pain of Sriracha's death until the next time they take a dump

review/summary: It's all WRONG!
review/text: Forgive me if I'm stuttering while I type - I'm on the run and working with a fever; I'm losing light and the dogs are baying in the distance...they're onto me.<br /><br />It's been...gawd only knows how long.  A day?  A week since I've had my beloved Huy Fong sriracha sauce...?  I don't know - time is irrelevant when your Jack is gone.  And in my case, there is only one Jack.  "The Rach."<br /><br />It was Visitor Day.  I'd been two months Rach-free (RF) and was looking forward to seeing people again - real people, not the sanitized, medicated zombies in the Ward... the stupified, insipid drones and their robotic dips of french fries into the sugared slick called "Ketchup."<br /><br />"Good enough..." the nurses would say.  "Remember, the taste is good enough..."  and nod in prescribed approval at our "progress."<br /><br />I hated the tastelessness of it all.  But what had my yearning gotten me so far?  Here I was, a Pathetic Wreck of man, who's hope and potential, wasted by the addictive pull of the bottle with the white rooster...<br /><br />"Lucille is here to see you, Wily."<br /><br />Oh gawd. Not her!  She was The One - did they not know?!  Was this a sick test of my will?!?!<br /><br />"Hellooo...wiLY!"  She sauntered to table, dismissing the porters with that look - did I see a smirk?!?  No!  In an unconcious flinch I snatched an individual portion-pack of mayo and began squishing it nervously - she slid onto the plastic seat with a sneering contempt and lifted the hamburger bun.  A slab of processed cheese product atop a rapidly cooling foodservice grade grade patty.  Of beef.<br /><br />Her eyes flicked at the condiment tray like a snake tongue tasting the fear of its prey - little packets of red, white, yellow and blue...and then...she... oh gawd...  she reached into her coat...and... damn her!  Damn her!  The shamelessness of it all!<br /><br />"Want...this?"<br /><br />The green nozzle peeked from her bosom and...I swear...it... it... did it laugh?  Did it howl?  Did it...<br /><br />(lightning flash, thunder - the sound of roaring rain, the gutteral humphs of bloodhounds)<br /><br />Time stretched and distorted - the space between the bottle and my reflexive snatch disappeared as if my arm had become the tongue of a chameleon; my hand the sticky  mass, the 28oz bottle of Rach in her coat, the prey...the food...the LIFE...<br /><br />SNAP!<br /><br />Foul, foul temptress...she'd removed the silver seal! But could I care!?  No.  At the moment, the deed was no betrayal of my Rach Sobriety but an act of glorious courtesy, saving myself the precious milisecond that it would have required to remove it before twisting the nozzle, dispensing the red SOUL onto my hamburger patty in a fantastic, psychedelic *splurrrrrrrtppplp!*<br /><br />Mwwwahhhhaaaaa...I shuddered in ecstasy, the wonderful aroma of rich, sensuous, spicy, sweet, delicious, holy Huy Fong Sriracha sauce filled my nostrils as Life itself fills the lungs of a submerged man breaking the surface of water, sucking in breath....<br /><br />Two bites and the cheeseburger was devoured...Rach spread across my face in a Joker-like grin, sprayed across my hospital whites, the result of a gruesome orgy of deliciousness...<br /><br />The alarm sounded like a WW2 air raid klaxon - "Flavor in Ward C!  Flavor in Ward C!"<br /><br />"QUick!  I've left the window open!"  She pointed to..well, one of the windows that was open and with 28oz Huy Fong Sriracha bottle in hand, made my break - landing in a spray of glass (in my haste, I jumped through the wrong window) and ripping of cheap nylon screen.<br /><br />How did I traverse the 100 feet to the fence?  How did I scale the concertina wired confines?  I have no idea.  It's all a blur.<br /><br />So.  Why the One Star (I keep giving Sriracha One-Star and people are starting to get a clue why)?<br /><br />28oz is lame!  It's just not enough!!<br /><br />I'm thinking a 3gallon bag...and a Camelback(tm) pack... this...this...28oz for the worlds most fantastically zesty and (it should be obvious by now) ADDICTING condiments?!?!<br /><br />More, please.

review/summary: Quinoa Not Like Anything Else
review/text: I got started on Quinoa when "health food" set off my food allergies and I was desperate to find non gluten and not rice or soy milk foods without the high fat concentrations of vegetable fat.<br />Quinoa was my God send to settle my system down. It has a flavor not quite like anything else. It is part crunch and part a rubbery texture.<br />For serving it I like it best with cream and sugar. I have noticed though I almost get hungrier eating it and sometimes a drier mouth later in the day. Why I have no idea, but different foods to affect the body differently.<br />While it lacks the "nutty" of a whole millet which is good too, it makes a nice alternative to the far too limited diets we have now.<br />I have tried the Quinoa flakes too which is like oatmeal, but without that horrid strong taste of oatmeal that I personally do not like.

I buy my organic quinoa (and other grains) at the ONFC.ca in Ontario Canada for $70 for 25lbs which is only $2.80 lb. That is a BIG difference. Worth buying in bulk. Then you can store in freezer or cold storage so it does not go rancid or split with another family. ;-) Find a local mill in your area if you don`t have a local buying club or coop.

review/summary: Most Nutritional Grain, Delicious, Cooks Like Rice; But Does Not Store for Long
review/text: Quinoa is a delicious and more nutritional version of rice and cooks very easily. It is probably the most nutritional grain because of it high protein (12-18%), fiber, phosphorus, iron and magnesium content. The protein in Quinoa is complete with all amino acids (unlike rice which lacks in lysine) which makes it an excellent grain for vegetarians.<br /><br />I cooked Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa just like rice and it was ready in 20 minutes. You have to rinse it well otherwise the grains are sticky. Soaking in water before cooking, like rice, also helps. It can be used in a variety of ways just-hot with meals and cold with salad - like rice. It is very sumptuous, filling and has somewhat nutty flavor.<br /><br />For people who do not like the flavor, it can be mixed with rice 30/70 or 40/60 and Quinoa flavor is masked by rice. The biggest downside to Quinoa is that it does not store well: I found fungus in air tight container after 6 months and bugs in a container that was not air tight.

review/summary: EXCELLENT!!!!!
review/text: First off, I have to say I am new to Quinoa. Never tried it before but I am so glad that I did!!!!!  Bob's Quinoa tastes EXCELLENT!  Slightly sweet and nutty you could eat it plain or add your own spices and things to it (such as beans or vegetables)  It's very EASY and QUICK to prepare - you don't have to rinse it because it's pre-rinsed. If you can boil water, than your set.  I'll be signing up for Amazon's auto subscription delivery on this one.  My only regret - THAT I DIDN'T TRY IT SOONER!!

review/summary: The perfect grain and a great price
review/text: Quinoa is a nutritionally complete grain -- unlike most other grains -- it has all of the essential amino acids.  It cooks up like something between cous cous and rice taking on the flavor of the cooking liquid.  Basically, this is an ancient grain who's time for a comeback has arrived.  I haven't run any through my grain mill yet but that's coming soon so I can make bread (with a hard red winter wheat mixture).

review/text: I have to say Id never heard of quinoa until I read about it being an excellent source of slow digesting carbs in Muscle & Fitness. So I bought some and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like the taste.  I tend to cook it in a steamer just how I would cook brown rice and it works fine.<br /><br />Overall its just food so I wont get too thrilled about it and rave about it in this review but if you want a good tasting and healthy food I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Highest praise for Bob's Red Mill and Amazon.com
review/text: My son introduced me to Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa and it has quickly become a favorite, replacing rice. I have searched the local area grocery stores for this product but it is not a stock item; although very few Bob's Red Mill products are available. I was fortunate to have found it through Amazon.com. What was even more astonishing is that it qualifies for free shipping to Alaska! Can't go wrong with this product nor Amazon.com.

review/summary: A little bitter
review/text: The coating of saponins is not completely washed off of Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa leaving it a little bitter. Ancient Harvest does a much better job of washing it off as evident by just tasting a little of each of the uncooked quinoa. Unfortunately Ancient Harvest doesn't do as good as job removing stems and grit from their product. I also prefer the packaging of Bob's Red Mill Organic Grain Quinoa so usually buy it despite the slight bitterness.

review/summary: Product is good, but not a great value for the price
review/text: I purchased this product because I was fascinated with the history and the touted health benefits.  It took nearly a month to receive and the shipping cost $9.00. The bags are very small, but a little goes a long way.  The actual food product is tasty, and I recommend it as a food choice, but the average consumer would benefit much more by obtaining it locally.  For those who cannot obtain quinoa in their area (like me), doing some cost-comparison shopping would probably be the best route.

review/summary: Excellent and Healthy "Good For You Food"
review/text: I have had this cooked in Chicken Broth which is Excellent, add your favorite ingredients to make a combination you like. My New Favorite way is plain, cooked in plain water, & have some in a bowl with a little butter and Agave, YUMMY!!! I know it doesn't need to be rinsed off as many brands do, however I still give my Quinoa a light rinse in a small colander before I cook it. I'm allergic to many grains, Wheat, Corn, Gluten, ETC. I was Happy to learn about one as Healthy as QUINOA that hasn't been Genetically Modified and made into something that doesn't agree with our bodies.<br /><br />Corn is in Many Products, in one form or another, Most Aspirn, Prescription drugs have coatings of Starch i.e. Corn Starch "Frutose AKA, High Frutose Corn Syrup." Try reading labels as I have to do, Very Frustrating, most packaged products have Corn in one form or another in them. Many people are allergic that are not aware of that. It can cause Inflammation in the body. It also causes more pain when it aggravates my Rheumatoid Arthritis, then I need More Source Naturals Activated Quercetin, http://www.amazon.com/Source-Naturals-Activated-Quercetin-Capsules/dp/B000GFJK8M/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=grocery&qid=1260255555&sr=8-2 ,  to help calm the allergic reaction, hence inflammation. Buy the Quercetin with the "Subscribe & Save" for a Good Price. Someone stated  in their review that the Tablets have no corn but the capsules do. I had not been aware of that so the capsules probably weren't doing me much good. I'll buy the tablets from now on. Excellent Products!!!

I'll be getting my Quinoa elsewhere thank you, for much cheaper and a higher quality too! I'd rather support a company that doesn't gauge the consumer and does it right. :)

review/summary: The best brand of quinoa I've found
review/text: The brand you buy matters more for quinoa than many other grains. Quinoa grows covered with a layer of bitter compounds called saponins. You want a brand that's been well-washed so you can cook it straight out of the bag. Beware! Most brands say that they're pre-washed. That doesn't mean that their quinoa won't require yet more washing before it'll taste good. Bob's Red Mill does a great job, with no bitter taste whatsoever, even when the quinoa is cooked like rice in a small amount of liquid.<br /><br />Also, some brands do a really bad job separating the quinoa from the chaff. I've yet to find anything but quinoa grains in Bob's packages.<br /><br />This usually isn't the cheapest brand of quinoa available. But, to me it's worth spending a little more to have quinoa I can just measure and cook, without having to rinse it more or pick out bits of detritus.

review/summary: Quinoa - Try It !!!
review/text: Quinoa is one of the healthiest grains you can eat - and one of the most delicious!  It cooks in less than 15 minutes, so you can make a fast dinner using it.  And how delicious it is!  Mmmmmmm!!!!  Softer than rice, it has a slightly sweet and nutty taste.  My favorite recipe is to cook it with a small onion, a tablespoon of butter, and a half cube of vegetarian boullion (or a half-teaspoon if using powdered boullion or fresh refrigerated type).  Bring the water to a boil, add the onion, butter, let boil for a minute.  Then add the quinoa.  Bring to boil again.  Add the bullion, and turn down to a low simmer for 10 - 15 minutes, and there you go!  A fantastic grain that leaves you feeling light and energetic.  As for Bob's products, they are always excellent.  Amazon's price is very good, especially if you live in a small town or out in the country, where it may be hard to get organic and specialty items like Bob's Quinoa.

review/summary: Finally tried quinoa to great success
review/text: Thankfully, this is prerinsed because the quinoa was too small for my strainer.  I steamed the quinoa the same way I steam rice i.e. in a pyrex bowl with boiling water covering it.  It was ready in no time.  It tasted fine until I added some salt and a spoonful of olive oil.  Even without other fixings, this product tasted fantastic.  It is definitely suitable as a rice substitute.  I had been eating steamed oatmeal for a week and gotten sick of it so this quinoa has turned out to be a great purchase.<br /><br />It took me a long time to purchase quinoa although I had seen it prepared many times on cooking shows because I couldn't tell quinoa from bulgur and couscous.  I will probably not bother with couscous because it is a wheat and is less nutritious than quinoa. I am trying to be efficient in preparing nutritious meals more than I am trying to expand my horizons. I am also trying to not aggravate diabetic potential.

review/summary: Excellent quinoa product, not the best value
review/text: Quinoa is a great food.  It is very versatile so almost anyone could make it in a way they found appealing... it's easy to cook and easy to experiment with, and best of all, it is good for you.  I agree with others that Bob's Red Mill has the best Quinoa product... at least the best that I've tried.  It's prewashed which is a big convenience over unwashed quinoa, and you can count on the quality (I recently bought some red quinoa in the bulk bin from the local natural grocers and there was something crunchy in the totally cooked quinoa... I couldn't stand it).<br /><br />This deal on Amazon is a slightly better deal than you are likely to get on Bob's Red Mill quinoa in stores.  It typically sells for $9-$11 per 26 oz bag.  So this deal works out to just under $9 a bag.  Unfortunately Bob's Red Mill does not sell their 25 lb bags on Amazon, which is by far their best value.  The 25 lb bag for me came out to $86.05 with shipping, though that may depend on your location.  If you are serious about quinoa as a staple of your diet and you'd eventually eat that much, here's the math: This deal works out to $5.53 per pound of quinoa, while bulk works out to $3.44 per pound.  If you eventually bought the same amount of quinoa via these 4 26 ounce packages you'd spend $138.25.  So you'd save $52.20 going bulk.<br /><br />A skilled google searcher can find where to get it 25 lb bags of quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, but hopefully Bob's Red Mill and Amazon will work out a way to sell them through Amazon.

review/summary: Incas To The Tables!
review/text: Quinoa has longevity if nothing else, it has pedigree and is recognized as a superior source of nourishment. Popular in Peru used to be the food of choice for the less privileged. Why? Because grains and potatoes where everywhere in large amounts and the poor could always eat that.<br />Quinoa in America, on the other hand, has taken a lot more classy reputation and very well deserved, may I add. First thing to consider: It is unique and has a long history. Extremely regional grain. Second thing to consider: How really really good is for the human body (google it, yahoo it, very high standards as a food choice). Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa is top of the line Quinoa. Washed over and over so it looses a possible bitter aspect and turns the Quinoa as a wonderful resource and should I include: Tasty? Yes, very tasty and here goes my personal best (to put my money where my mouth is), this is a sure proof way to enjoy a plate of Quinoa.<br />I cup Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa/2 1/2 - 3 Cups of Delicious Vegetable or Chicken Broth (never Beef!)/Cook at medium heat until Quinoa is fully cooked and most liquid is absorbed (please note that sometimes Quinoa becomes thirsty and needs additional liquid, specially a higher temperatures)/Planters Peanuts (4 Oz or as much as you want and may be any other nut for that matter, but peanut is Yummy!)grinded to a fine powder-set aside/Dice in fine pieces an onion (small, large, who's counting?) and Heat some Olive/Canola/Vegetable, etc Oil on a large frying pan/Add Fresh Garlic-Crushed Pepper (the better the pepper the better the taste!)Sea or Regular Salt (See? I am not picky!) at this point your most trusted herbs and spices can go into the mix/Add the Peanut powder on the mix and then add the Quinoa fully cooked and mix it all together/Last but certainly not least Add Curry Hot or Mild, I don't care, about 2 teaspoons-more or less, do not let this part stop you-and at the end make sure you add a little more liquid so the whole thing looks and tastes like it should.<br />Curry, Peanuts, Quinoa! Oh Boy, do they get along well. 5 Stars for this food from the Inkas To The Tables! PS: Since I already got into it please note that the curry powder is dissolved at the start together with the broth! It surely does not go at the end when everything is fully cooked, thank you for your understanding on this matter!

review/summary: Excellent whole grain
review/text: This is a superbly nutritious grain that is also easy to fix.  Because it has already been rinsed, one can use it without rinsing off the hulls.  I ate it first with some mushrooms with parmesan cheese sprinkled on it.  It was delicious.  I introduced it to someone from India and she found that she could use it with her Indian recipes.  Another woman ate it with her homemade chili.  It is a complete protein, so it serves as an excellent breakfast grain.

review/summary: Bob's Red Mill Quinoa
review/text: The package states that this quinoa is pre-washed. I could still taste some bitterness. I found that if I soak it for 20-30 minutes, rinse well and then cook it the taste is greatly improved. I had read that if you see suds when you rinse it there is still bitter-tasting saponins on the grain. I did see suds. I had also read that using less water than called for and simmering longer would give you a nice fluffy grain. I found this to be true. I use a little more than 1 1/2 C of water to 1 C of grain and simmer around 45-50 minutes. With these changes in preparation I rate this grain very highly.
