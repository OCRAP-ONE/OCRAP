review/summary: Almost a 5
review/text: I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.  It is great because this food is supposed to go to the cat at room temperature.  Unfortunately,  I believe I checked when I was considering changing to these smaller cans and found that they are more expensive for the amount my cat eats per day than the larger cans.  The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.  I don't understand why subscribe and save does not honor prime membership.  When customers choose subscribe and save they are giving Amazon long-term consistent business. I guess if Newman's Own packed 40 or 48 cans it would work better with subscribe and save.

review/summary: Cats like it
review/text: I have two Siamese kittens who are on a mostly all canned food diet. The Chicken & Salmon formula is one of the foods in their current rotation. They seem to really enjoy eating it, although I wouldn't say it's their favorite food. You can see bits of the ingredients (rice?) in the food, and the texture is not too firm, but certainly more firm than a pate-style food. I have already ordered my second case, and plan to order more in the future. These 5.5 oz cans fit the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E66">Petmate Kitty-Kap Can Cover</a> quite well.

review/summary: I loved that it was organic! My cat- not so much...
review/text: I purchased the Chicken & Salmon formula with the notion that- Hey! I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever... So after a few unsuccessful meal times, I tried spiking her meal with a dash of Fancy Feast? No dice. She ate the Fancy Feast and I swear gave me this look like- 'Nice Try Bucco- and you thought you were SOOO sneaky...'<br /><br />So to the previous Fancy Feast feeders- I say maybe try something else to slowly get your cat onto the health track? Or you might end up like me with 20 cans of food I can't use :( I've been trying other brands that have more gravy- with slightly more success! (Emphasis on the slightly-she drinks up all the liquid and I'm left with chicken strips!) Maybe I have a oober picky cat? But I'm thinking I will keep on trying and probably give this one another run once I've detoxed her from her fast food craves..

review/text: I thought I was getting something special for my babies. It was marked down and I thought I was getting a steal. But I had second thoughts as soon as I opened the can. It looks like something you would spackle a wall with. Seriously, it has the consistency of paste. Thankfully, I have one cat that is my little garbage can and I know when he's really hungry that I can get rid of one of these Newman's Own Organic Beef cat food cans.

review/summary: Best Choice for my Cats
review/text: I tried literally everything, from high end to low end, before settling on Newman's Own.  The reason?  All of my 5 cats enjoy the flavor (organic turkey) and come running when it is time to eat.  I feed them Newman's Own organic dry cat food as well, so their diet is about half and half.  I have one cat that suffers from IBS. She has to take prednisone daily, so I'm hoping the change in food will improve her condition.  Though Newman's products are expensive, I believe the organic ingredients will make a big difference in my cats' overall health, which in turn will mean fewer trips to the vet and more money in my pocket.  Besides that, I love the fact that there is strict quality control and oversight in everything that goes into a can or a bag, and all the proceeds from the sale of Newman's Own pet food are donated back to animal shelters and the SPCA.  No profit to me means that this company really does have the cats' welfare at heart.

review/summary: Super Finicky Cat Loves It!
review/text: This is for the Chicken & Brown Rice Canned Cat Food Formula<br /><br />My cat (now 15 yrs old) has always been a picky eater.  The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).  So, in the long run it's cheaper for me at least, and no headaches of trying to get him to eat something.<br /><br />I'm am extremely happy with the product and my cat is very happy with it as well.

review/summary: Good product, great deal!
review/text: Product Basics: My cat loves this stuff, although I only serve it once a week.  It's fairly consistent from can to can; to date, I've only opened one can that was "watery"-ish.  The texture is usually very thick and solid.<br /><br />Product Received, including Packaging & Delivery: Since a case will last several months, I was pleased to see the expiration date was well in the future.  The product arrived in a small box, packed with airbags to protect the item - not glamorous, but efficient.  The box was slightly dinged on one corner; one of the airbags had broken from the impact, but the product was protected.  No cans were damaged.  Delivery was quicker than I anticipated (took about a week).<br /><br />Amazon Experience: Amazon makes it easy to order this stuff; I've even arranged for automatic shipping (you can speed up or delay the next shipment, if you're worried about timing).  This is the best price I've found for this product.  Overall, I would buy this product from Amazon, again.

review/summary: Totally disgusting!
review/text: I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.  Will not be buying again but thank heaven for Amazon that always makes it right without any hassles.

review/summary: Treat for your tongue
review/text: I love all of the Just Tomato products but the grapes are really special. The crunchy, chewy texture and fresh, sweet flavor make this such a unique treat. They retain the fresh flavor of a grape, but the texture is neither grape nor raisin. It is such fun to go from crunchy to chewy...delicious! I do however wish Just Tomatoes had not changed their packaging. I preferred the tubs to the bags. They provided better protection to the delicate product and could be reused around the house instead of going straight to the landfill.

review/text: I was skeptical about paying $30 for some snacks on amazon since you have to buy 4 packs at a time, but given the 5 star reviews I figured it'd be cool.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are the most disgusting things I've ever tasted. It's basically eating like a sticky, chewy shriveled up old toenail that has a slight raisin/prune taste. Absolutely horrible. I was expecting a crisper/crunchier feel that wouldn't stick to your teeth like road tar.<br /><br />And unfortunately amazon does not allow returns on food items - so I'm stuck with $30 worth of crap.

review/summary: One of the most delicious seasonings I've tasted.
review/text: I really love this All-Seasons Salt. Featuring a really delectable blend of organic spices and salts, this stuff really can't be beat. It's good on pretty much anything you could put regular salt on, though I personally think it's much better than plain salt, as it incorporates salty, savory, tangy and even some subtle sweet flavors. I would absolutely recommend anyone who's tired of using just plain sea salt to give this seasoning a spin, because it's very delicious, and, as advertised, it does well in enhancing the flavor of just about anything you put it on.<br /><br />It's really good on pasta, but then again, I wouldn't be doing this seasoning justice by saying it's not especially good on just about anything. Try it out!

review/summary: A healthier, more delicious soy sauce
review/text: Soy sauce isn't just soy sauce.  There are many different styles of quality and flavor, and just like any other condiment people are going to have their preferences.<br /><br />Personally, I love pure tamari soy sauce.  This is the original stuff, darker and more flavorful; it is the traditional recipe for Japanese soy sauce as it was originally introduced from China.  Made as a by-product of miso production, tamari soy sauce has far more nutrients and health benefits than the mass-produced flavoring agent that can be found in any supermarket.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to production techniques and quality, tamari soy sauce is often considerably more expensive than the standard commercial variety.  Even though I love it, I confess that I don't use it when recipes call for large amounts, or when the richer flavor of tamari is just going to be lost in the blend.  However, whenever I use pure soy sauce, such as with sushi or sashimi, then I absolutely dish out the extra cash for the better flavor.  Tamari soy sauce and some real wasabi make a huge difference.

review/summary: Our New Favorite Coffee!
review/text: I live in the Northwest so good coffee is not hard to find. In fact, for the past year my wife and I have been buying our beans at a great little roaster around the corner from our house. The coffee was amazing and we paid almost $13 for a 12oz bag of whole bean. These roasters are coffee fanatics and they know their stuff. We were content.<br /><br />For some reason I had always thought of Boyd's as coffee for "old people" and thought it would probably taste like a step up from Folger's. I never bothered to try it until...........<br /><br />I was driving out in Gresham and had some time to kill so I stopped by Boyd's retail store. I picked up a pound of Q-Rated Gutemalan Estate for $10.95 and promptly went home and prepared a French Press. It was just as flavorful as the coffee from our local roaster, with a smoother finish. It was also a much better value. That was 2 weeks ago and I just picked up my 4th bag this morning. While there I also picked up some of their awesome flavored syrups.<br /><br />While Boyd's may have been in business for over 100 years, there is nothing stale about the way the do coffee. Get a fresh bag of this coffee and you will see what I mean.

review/summary: The best hazelnut syrup - organic is the only way to go
review/text: My husband loves this syrup every morning in his espresso.  He goes through about a bottle every two weeks.  Might seem extravagant but he deserves the best start to his day.  I have not tried this myself as I am not a hazelnut fan and if I love it, we couldn't afford it anymore if we were both using it.  But we have shared it with visitors and they always become a fan and write down the name and brand before leaving.<br /><br />I am really happy to be able to buy it six at a time.  Shipping was not super fast, but the items were packaged VERY carefully and arrived intact.  No leaks, no broken bottles.  And with my husband going through it as fast as he does, I hope this will last us about three months.<br /><br />I also ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BGZNXW">Monin Syrup Pump for Glass 750ml Bottles</a> you can buy separate on Amazon that goes with the glass bottles.  Works VERY well and now my husband can measure out how much he wants since each pump is considered a "shot."  And since coffee takes up 10% of his daily diet, I do my best to make it organic, fair trade and as healthy as possible.<br /><br />We also use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HBCVX0">AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker with Bonus 350 Micro Filters</a> and we enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027Z5J6G">Kicking Horse Coffee Three Sisters Medium, Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Pouch</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VIL44Y">Equal Exchange Love Buzz Blend Organic Coffee Bean, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)</a> brand coffees.

I was hoping for the nuts to be very crispy/crunchy since they are kettle cooked, but they weren't, at least not enough for me to justify the price they are charging. A while back, Planters was selling kettle cooked peanuts that were perfect in terms of this aspect but they are no long making them or at least my store no longer has them. Its a shame because they were the best.

review/summary: Best Genmai Cha!
review/text: I would have to agree with other reviewers - this is the best Genmai Cha tea I tried so far. I would definitely stick with this one. Sometimes the addition of macha can make the tea bitter. Not this one - it's very well balanced and the aroma... mmmm... what can I say - it's the best!

review/summary: I am not a tea snob BUT...
review/text: Yes this is spendy for Genmai Cha. The thing is that is IS REAL GOURMET Gen Mai! This is not cheap stuff. I have had my share of green tea. I am SO sick and tired of the dry English style 'supposedly' Japanese Green Tea you find usually. I had Gen Mai before but finding it outside of a specialty shop is likewise hard. I liked the taste of Gen Mai a lot and usually you find it in a Chinese or Japanese restaurant. Chinese Gen Mai tends to have a smoky after taste which is really good to me. I was expecting that of this tea. Not so. Instead it has a mild popcorn like note of Japanese Gen Mai which I was not sure what the difference was until now. Now steeping this like a tea bag is not the way to do this tea. I bob a tea ball by hand in a cup of hot water for about a minuet and get a emerald green tea with a remarkably smooth character utterly lacking in any kind of bitterness. Steeping it in the "Normal" sense only leaves you with brown bitter tea. The water should not be hotter than 180 degrees so bobbing it in a tea ball deals with the excessive temperatures without "burning" the tea. Proper preparation means everything for good tea! I really was blown away by the quality of this blend. I went through one can and had to get another pair becasue the second can is feeling my love of this tea.<br /><br />Like I said I cannot call myself a tea connoisseur. But I know real high Quality tea. This is real high quality and the BEST I have had so far hands down. I could see this being used in a Japanese Tea Ceremony it is that good. The flavor is distinct but lacks bitterness. The subtlety in its taste hides a strange complexity. This tea just has character. It is not overpowering but it is not "light" either. Now I need to find a quality glass or ceramic tea pot with a tea strainer in it!<br /><br />This is loose leaf tea so you will need to either bag it yourself, or use a tea ball. DO NOT LET THIS STEEP IN BOILING WATER! You will waste it that way and ruin the tea. The way it is packaged is a pair of tins with a mylar foil bag inside each. The tea is vacuum sealed so it should be able to stand prolonged storage and be just like it was freshly blended when you do decide to open it! Again this may not be the best but it is one of the best! Period! I can't have Sushi without it now!

review/summary: Good tea, but kind of waste
review/text: This is probably the most expensive Genmai Cha that I have had. Genmai Cha is considered normally as low-end daily tea. However, this one adds some expensive macha which adds more flavor of "tea". I cannot say it is not good but it is a waste, because fried rice spoils the subtle flavor of macha.<br />I would rather buy much cheaper genmaicha with still good taste from Koyamaen or Ipodo.

review/summary: The cats loved it
review/text: OK, at $9.99, this is a little pricey, however I'm not reviewing the price.  Technically, you can buy several cans of tuna for that price.  HOWEVER, the cats really seemed to like this.  We have 13 (yes, too many, I know) and 11 of them were delighted.  This comes as a thin slab that's cut into 3 slices.  It's an actual grilled filet of tuna, and it flaked up nicely.  I guess you don't have to flake them into little pieces, but my kitties tend to lick things instead of bite bits off, and I didn't want dry tuna slices left on the plates.<br /><br />This is a good portion size for 11 cats - it replaced a whole meal.  I think it's a little awkward as a "treat" - it's more like a meal, but it's too pricey for everyday meals.

review/summary: My Cat Loved It
review/text: My cat usually eats dry food. Moist food doesn't always interest him. He won't eat pate. He usually doesn't eat flaked chunks. If given slices in a sauce, he'll lick-up all the sauce, and only eat the slices because they still taste like the sauce.<br /><br />Given that, I expected lots of sniffing, some licking, and not much more, but after an initial hesitance, he started scarfing it down like a dog attacks a late dinner.<br /><br />What makes this stuff so special? I don't know. But he doesn't attack canned tuna like that. So even though this is far more expensive than canned tuna, at least it didn't get snubbed.<br /><br />I'd give it 5-stars for appeal to my cat, and 3-stars for cost, averaging to a solid 4-stars. I'll probably buy some in the future, but I'm not going to keep a supply on hand.

review/summary: Grilled Tuna Treats by Petite Cuisine
review/text: Ok, so my cats aren't really "petite", well except for the one, but I think they still enjoyed these snacks.  In fact, 4 out of 5 cats in my household enjoyed these treats.  There are some really great things about this brand, and some not so great things though.<br /><br />We'll start with the good.  This tuna smelled so fantastic that I was half tempted to take a nibble myself.  You could tell they used quality fish and judging by their packaging, they were smart in their harvesting of the fish too.  Its got the dolphin safe logo and the eco-safe sustainable fishing stamp as well.  They go on to say that they take a break four months out of the year so that the fishing population remains intact.  I'd say that's a pretty good way of doing things.  Its also advertised as a natural product.  So that's pretty cool in a earth safe kind of way.  The only ingredients are tuna (wild caught) and water so that's impressive as well with all the additives even being added to pet food anymore.<br /><br />Since I gave all the cats in the household (and that is again 5 between my mother and I) I was able to see the reaction of many different types of "personalities" to this food.  The one that doesn't think she's allowed to eat in front of us, went straight for it and started nibbling, but then snubbed her nose.  The old senile cat immediately ate it and then started eating the blanket she was laying on thinking there was more.  The bully cat ate one piece and then looked broken hearted when the smallest cat (who bullies the "bully" cat) hoarded the rest of the food.  That just left the one other cat who gobbled it up while meowing her pleasure and then started looking for more.  Overall it was pretty successful.<br /><br />Now on to the not so good things.  My first complaint with this product would be the packaging.  Upon opening I immediately got squirted with tuna water and had to go change my shirt as I didn't want the cats trying to eat me (and you know the old senile one would try).  The plastic was tough to rip at the seals and that could have accounted for some of the problems, but it also didn't have much of a lip for pulling apart either.  Next problem was the size of these things.  It came in three large slabs and I used one slab and broke it apart for all five cats to share as a treat.  And they still got plenty that way.  I'm not sure what they're thinking when they call this food a "treat."  And since there's only three slabs, I'm going to get honest here and say that for the price, you could buy quite a few cans of tuna packed in water and have essentially the same thing as what came in this package.  Even if you bought them at whole foods you could probably get three cans for the same price.  So I'm not sure if this is quite a deal even if it is a eco-friendly product.<br /><br />The cats liked it though and if I were feeling in a generous mood I might get it for them again. It just wouldn't be a regularly scheduled treat.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011

review/summary: "Gimme gimme more, gimme more"
review/text: A review from Crystal Starr Light's cat, Emma Starr Light:<br /><br />My pet has gotten into the habit of giving me dry food in the morning when she is gone for work and, if I look really pathetic (humans are really susceptible to this in general, but my pet is even worse than most), a 5.5oz can of wet food at night (I typically eat shreds or flakes or, if my pet forgets what I like, pate).  Of course, I would prefer to have canned food twice a day and skip the whole dry food all together, but alas, I haven't been able to knead that out of her yet.<br /><br />One day my pet came home with a package of Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats she got in the mail through her "Vine" program, or something like that (I don't bother with those boring human things usually).  She opened the package and placed a small chunk on a plate for me.  I took one sniff and said, "Yeah, see ya laters."<br /><br />But when she wasn't looking, I decided to have a better sniff.  It smelled pretty good--very authentic tuna (by the way my pet was reacting, it was as if it were super strong and potent or something--humans!).  So I nibbled it all, and it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />A couple of nights later, my pet gave me a whole third.  WHOA!  Talk about a lot of tuna there!  It must have taken half a day to eat the whole thing--not to mention, I had to get my paws dirty in order to move it around on the plate so I could eat it (NOTE TO PET: it's not a bad thing to split my food up into smaller chunks!).<br /><br />I like it, and it hasn't done anything nasty to my digestion (hey, a cat's got to be worried about her digestion!).  My pet likes the ziplock bag it comes with, as she can put it in her fridge, and it doesn't smell up the rest of her spoiled food (Crystal: HEY!!!!  Not everything in my fridge is spoiled!).  She doesn't, however, like how much splatter can result from trying to get out tuna from the bag.  Not that I blame her; I hate getting things on my paws (means more washing).  I can't actually believe this is a "treat", unless by "treat" you mean "dinner".  Three slices would more than last me at least two meals.<br /><br />I don't know if my pet will buy this again.  A can of cat food is like 50 cents and this is almost 10 bucks--do you know how many cans of cat food you could buy for 10 bucks?!  20!  20 delicious cans of delectable deliciousness.  Enough for breakfast and dinner for 10 days!  Or just dinner for 20 days!  One package of this stuff would last three days, most likely.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br /><br />Emma Starr Light, C.S. Light's cat

review/summary: Great taste! But... packaging needs rework?
review/text: Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats / B004867T24<br /><br />My cats don't like treats, so I'm always on this constant search to find treats that maybe they *will* like. And then I'll teach them to do the tango, or something -- I'm hazy on that part. But, anyway, I was thrilled when this packet came in the mail; the cats had their noses in the air and were meowing at me before I had the mail packet open. This tuna smells *good* and it must taste good, too, since they were nose-deep in it immediately and chowed down. So I can vouch that my kitties loved the taste of this "treat".<br /><br />Everything else about the "treat" seems odd to me, though. For starters, these aren't "treats" in the "here's a little nibble" sense. There are three slabs of tuna in here, and while I guess you could pick them into tiny pieces and give slivers to the cats, they look like they're meant to be eaten as a whole meal. And they're really big: one of my cats skipped dinner later after having this snack, and the chubby "always hungry" one looked askance at the treat halfway through, like she was getting full and wasn't sure what to do about it.<br /><br />So I'd recommend not serving a whole stick to the cats, but breaking it into pieces. The problem here is that it's not really easy to get the packet open. The resealable part of the packet wouldn't open for me at all, so I had to cut the packet open, and tuna juice got everywhere. Then the first stick broke in half when I was sliding it out, and I couldn't easily reach in and get the rest without breaking the other sticks. Eventually I just crumbled everything up and served it in handfuls, and that seemed to work, but was pretty messy -- you probably can't use these for training.<br /><br />In the end, my cats liked the treat, but I wonder if they wouldn't have liked just as much a small can of tuna from the store since this was basically a tuna meal. I think if you wanted to replace their meals with the occasional "treat" like this, this would be a great buy, but if you're wanting little nibblers for the cats to train with, pass this by.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Maybe if I'd won the lottery, or money were no object.  But even then???
review/text: I could have let 'em eat it all up in an instant.  But the package arrived at dinnertime and calls itself a  "treat" so I decided to treat it like I treat treats and parcel it out in small portions.  This night it would be dessert. After running into the same messy difficulty getting the package open as another customer describes here, I broke off one half  of one of the three slices and crumbled it into their three now-empty dinner bowls where it was devoured in a flash...as tuna, in ANY form,  always is at our house.  Think I'll try it next as a topper for their Fancy Feast turkey Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />Maybe if my cats could speak English they could explain why this water-packed tuna in a pouch is worth five or six times more than what comes out of the water-packed StarKist pouches that I buy for myself and share with them (not that I have much choice in the matter.) Currently the StarKist pouches are selling in 12 packs on Amazon for a per-ounce price of 43 cents, whereas this single-pack Petite Cuisine pouch is selling here at per-ounce price of $2.44.<br /><br />I was delighted to have been offered this goodie for my guys through the Amazon Vine program. And so are they. But I doubt it will become a regular addition to their cuisine. Five stars for taste from them, 1 star for price from me. Thus 3.

review/summary: Pricey but cats did love them
review/text: The price for these tuna treats seems pretty ridiculous and I worried I wouuldn't be able to get a good feel on the quality of the product for my cats can't talk!  Well, they did indeed give me a very strong message and it was one of pure happiness.  I have two very finicky cats and honestly I always have to give them dry cat food.  If I give them fresh they either won't eat it or if they do they end up throwing it up.  Not with these Petite Cuisine Treats.  Just the smell of the tuna had my lazy cats curious and hovering around me.  When I fed them the product they gobbled it up quickly and stayed around wanting more.  They ate this tuna faster than any other food and did not throw it up unlike other fresh food.<br /><br />Therefore I think the high quality of the tuna speaks for itself.  It is obviously a delicacy compared to your average fresh tuna.  I love making my cats happy and will get more of this product to give them occasional treats but at this price it will truly be a rare treat and not something I can stock up on to give it to my lovely cats more often.  Very sad.  I do highly recommend this product.  It is of a very high quality but the price makes it very questionable.

NICE tuna. TASTY tuna. I usually get Fancy Feast, which is OK, but this is much MUCH better. Good to the last flake. No sauce with this stuff. Just plain, rather dry tuna. But the taste is marvelous.

Well, let's investigate....awfully dry, but let's take a nibble...not bad really. Hummm. Well, ate a bit of it...now where's my cream?"<br /><br />Frankie (4): "What's this? I never eat breakfast! I ate my crummy buttons at 4 AM. Let me sleep. Not interested thank you."  Human friend: Frankie only likes the dry kibble type of food. Not even fresh grilled salmon will tempt her. She's a rare cat.<br /><br />Obviously, this Petit Cuisine Grilled Tuna will be kept in its re-sealable pouch (and in an added container...it does smell a little fishy!) refrigerated for Liddy. It's a lovely treat for her, and I'm sure quite healthy for the old girl.

review/text: I've owned cats for all of my life, and I've tried pretty much any cat treat I find in stores over the years. I'm always game to try something new, to see if my cats will enjoy it. When Amazon Vine had a sample pack of the Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats on offer, I promptly grabbed up a set to test out.<br /><br />You get strips of, in essence, real grilled tuna. They come in a resealable pouch. They are fairly expensive.<br /><br />My cat loves fresh fish and eats a variety of it. However, she just was not interested in this. Maybe because it's one solid chunk of fish. I tried to break it up for her into more easily digestible chunks, but she just wasn't that interested.<br /><br />I then put the rest in the fridge to try again later. But the resealable pouch didn't do a great job, and she just wasn't interested in eating any more of it.<br /><br />I have to wonder just why this is better - if you're going to go to the expense of feeding your cat real human-grade tuna - than simply buying tuna for far less at your grocery store and feeding your cat that. It seems extreme to buy this special kitty-version of it.<br /><br />Certainly I can see that some cats would enjoy fresh tuna. But for a variety of reasons, I don't recommend buying this specialized expensive cat-specific version if that is your aim in life.

review/text: When I saw this I knew my cats would like it, what I didnt know was they would LOVE it. I was impressed by how fresh and "tasty" looking this treat was. Didnt smell too "fishy" and looked good enough to eat myself, but of course, I saved it for my girls. It came in 3 nice sized strips and that was perfect because we have 3 cats. I decided to save it for a midday treat and couldn't wait to see if they liked it.<br /><br />Well, the girls  enjoy tuna, but I never expected them to like it this much.<br />I broke off a little piece for each of them and they gobbled it up! I actually ended up feeding them the whole pouch for lunch instead of opening a can of cat food.<br />I have never seen them eat so fast and leave not a speck of food in their dishes. Next time, I will save it for treats because you do get a good amount, which can be resealed and refrigerated. This is definitely a treat worth getting to "indulge" your cats every now and again!

review/summary: Nice but messy treat....
review/text: These "treats" are like small bricks of tuna. The cats love it, but once you open it, wow, tuna juice etc all over you.... What a mess! Not pleasantly packaged at... I give it 3 stars - the cats love it - but why not just buy a can of albacore (this is skijack/chunk light) tuna? Easier package to deal with, far FAR cheaper, and better quality fish (likely).

review/summary: Packaging and treat size could use some work
review/text: This is clearly a super fancy, super healthy cat treat (it seems almost human level - though the package does expressly remind you that this is only for animal consumption). I have two fat cats who are used to eating dry food and treats with an occasional wet food snack (which they aren't usually that crazy about). One of my cats loved these things and one of them was indifferent, though he did eat it eventually.<br /><br />The phrase "treats" might seem a bit misleading considering what the average cat owner thinks of as a "treat" but I wasn't thrown off by that. The main issue I had with this item is the packaging. The product consists of three rather large chunks of tuna in a plastic zip lock bag which also has a good deal of liquid in it. Though the package was easy to open, there was a good deal of liquid above the zip lock which means it is easy to get it on your hands or on the counter (and tuna water is not a pleasant smell). Also, the act of getting the treats out of the bag is a little tricky as well (at least for the first one). Again, you just have to plan to get tuna water on your hands and deal with it (not really a big deal).<br /><br />Also, these are pretty big treats (and my cats are 20 pounds each). I ended up giving them one a day (breaking one piece into two) and it was plenty. I found that they liked it more if I mixed it with their usual dry food. Other reviewers have mentioned breaking the tuna apart, which might make it easier to pour a lot out but I kind of liked giving it to them in chunks and they seemed to like it that way too.<br /><br />Overall, the cats ate it up, but I don't think I'd want to spend this much in order to deal with the packaging and liquid issue. Normal treats are fine for my cats, though I commend this company for their environmental policies.

review/summary: My pets loved it, I didn't
review/text: I have 2 cats and a near-adult puppy.  My female cat is 15 years old, very overweight, and pretty much eats whatever food I put in front of her.  The male cat is 6 years old, very active, insane, and LOVES tuna (he will trip you for it).  My pup is almost 9 months old and will eat basically anything (just like most dogs).<br /><br />Before I even had this pack open both the tuna cat and the dog were waiting, the dog patiently, the cat pacing the kitchen, weaving around my legs, and prancing under the dog's nose.  The package has a tear away section that easily tore the whole way...unlike many other tear strips.  First thing I noticed: tuna juice spattered on my hands and a little on the counter after I tore the strip off.  Then trying to get the pieces out without making more of a mess was ridiculously hard.  I know they want the product to be sealed to maintain freshness, but this seems to have been a very poor decision in packaging, especially for cat treats.  After I finally removed the tuna strips I put them in a container with a sealing lid rather than fight with the bag again.<br /><br />The tuna flakes very easily and I broke one strip apart with a knife.  Of course the easiest way to give it to my pets was to grab bits with my fingers, which was not something I really wanted to do.  After that I just broke up the other two strips with my fingers.  All 3 pets loved it very much, but with the hassle and the high price (currently $9.99) I would be hesitant to go through it again.  It would make a lot more sense to package them in some type of flat container with a peel off top, similar to certain brands of wet cat food.  I'm very finicky about getting food on my hands so maybe it wouldn't bother other people as much (ironic since I used to work in food - but I hated it).  The treats themselves must have been great because my pets were able to group up without hissing, slapping each other, or fighting while waiting for a little bit, but the packaging is just awful and the price seems very high for cat treats.  I love my pets very much, but I rarely let them eat better than me (pricewise).

review/summary: more wetfood than treats, but the cats love it
review/text: My 3 cats loved these long tuna filets.<br /><br />"Treat" is a bit of a misnomer since the three long pieces are each the equivalent of a wet-food serving.  The solid pieces are packed in a resealable bag with a little bit of liquid, although I served it all at once.  The tuna smells as good as tuna I would eat.<br /><br />The cats don't normally like seafood-based catfood, but it's been a long time since I've seen them so excited by food that wasn't on my plate, as when I crumbled up the tuna for them-- they ate every last scrap in one sitting, although with normal wetfood, they leave "some for later".<br /><br />Highly recommended as a treat, despite the high price.  They just don't serve like a treat.

review/summary: Cats Love It
review/text: The cats love it.  Three of four do; the other thinks that it is ok.<br /><br />When I first opened the tuna, I was tempted to try it myself; it looked really good.  I resisted the temptation and gave it to my traditional striped tabby cat.  She is a big fan of salmon, so I thought she would really like it.  She ate some of it, but not all.  On a second try the next day, she ate some more but was not enthusiastic.<br /><br />It seemed to me that one cat was not a significant cat population sample.  Since, I was feeding a group of three cats for friends who were away, I decided to use them as a taste-test focus group.  These cats, two callicos and one orange tabby, like only dry cat food. They loved the tuna. I left the remainder of the package in the refrigerator for my friends.  They report that the cats continue to like the tuna.<br /><br />I conclude that three cat enthusiastic reviews out of four is enough to give the treat five stars.

review/summary: Messy Tuna
review/text: While five cats mewed insanely around my legs, I struggled to open this super sealed packet of Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna.  Although there are little notches in the thick plastic it is sealed in, they ripped off part way as I pulled on them and sprayed my face and front of my shirt with tuna juices that made my cats go even more insane.  I was finally able to get the tuna out with<br />a pair of scissors.  There was a nice size chunk of  tuna  inside that I broke up in a large bowl and it fed all six of my cats who gobbled it up  and they are fairly fussy.  I would definitely buy this for my cats since the amount was generous and  of high quality but I will use the scissors next time and avoid the facial spray of tuna juices.

review/summary: Two paws (or four) up!
review/text: I must admit, although the Petite Cuisine tuna snacks I received looked like they wouldn't be too unpleasant for human consumption, I only tried them on my cats.  They are both former strays, and over 10, so I suppose they qualify as senior citizens.  I feed them a limited amount of canned food, as well as available dry throughout the day, and almost never give them "people food."  Neither has any special health condition of which I am aware.<br /><br />The snacks come in strips, so I divided one in two and gave it to them along with their usual canned.  Both ate every bite. The overall odor is mild, compared to some canned cat foods containing fish products.  Both cats will be enjoying the rest soon.

review/summary: These did not last long with my cats
review/text: It's not every day that I can write a review based on an extensive survey. This time, I can. I offered these to six different cats. Five of them devoured the treats. That includes one cat that almost never eats cat treats (by her choice, not because they're not offered).<br /><br />The product itself comes well sealed inside a bag that can be resealed (and needs to be refrigerated after opening). Once I opened the pack, a process that is a little bit messy and should be done over a sink since some of the juices escaped, I found three moderately moist bars of tuna. They broke apart easily enough but were not so crumbly that they made a mess. The consistency is like a cross between that of canned tuna and that of regular cat food. If you, as I was, are worried about treats the consistency of jerky, worry not. And, as I said, five out of six cats loved them. The price is steep, at least as I write this, but I'm reviewing the quality, not the value. The value is for you to decide.

review/summary: a Preferred Treat for Feline Americans
review/text: This does not work well as a 'cat treat' where you toss one and the cat runs after it.  Those are much smaller, moist or dry, and they have greater cohesion.<br />If those treats are like 'cat candy,' then these are more like 'cat cobbler.'  It's messy, but tasty.<br /><br />It comes in a plastic re-sealable envelope and it contains three 'bars' of grilled tuna and a fair amount of sauce.  The bars are flaky and tender.  The cats tore them apart readily.  They were immediately aware when I put it in the bowl and they were all over it when it put it down for them.  They licked the sauce for a minute and then tore the bars apart, picked up the pieces and ate them.  I served it to three cats; all of them liked it a lot.  They ate most of it and licked up all the sauce in the first two-three minutes, and this was after they had their normal food in the morning.<br /><br />I have multiple cats, so I gave it all to them at once.  The resealable pouch makes it so people with fewer cats (or only one cat) can make it last longer.  The price is pretty steep, but they really enjoyed it. I'm not sure if this is a good everyday thing, but I think that this might be a really nice thing for 'special occaisions.'

review/summary: I Give This Product Four Paws and A Tail Up
review/text: My girlfriend and I recently rescued four homeless kittens and their mother and have been really having a memorable time getting the kittens acclimated to people. Sadly we weren't able to work with the mother who was completely feral, but we were able to get her spade and then we released her as all of our local shelters were full. Really a tough decision for us, but we did the best we could and by rescuing the kittens, which were ALL female, we figured we probably saved quite a few unwanted kittens from being born and continuing the vicious cycle. Anyhow, when the opportunity to try these kitty treats came along you can imagine our excitement as having four additional mouths to feed can be quite problematic at times and we were excited to get any type of additional food or treats for the little hooligans. Well to put it mildly the kittens absolutely loved the treats and couldn't get enough of them. The only complaint I have is that these treats should either come with a warning sticker or a box of band-aids as the kittens literally tried to eat my fingers when I attempted to give it to them. I guess I should have been a bit smarter and put it on a plate first instead of trying to feed them by hand. I will have to remember that if I ever decide to feed a hungry bear!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover

review/summary: Good but expensive
review/text: These are actual slices of tuna that can be either a treat or a meal for your cat or dog. As others have mentioned, I too had trouble getting the package open. You are supposed to tear off the top and then open a resealable zip closure. But by the time I got to the tuna, the zip was ruined, so it became a meal for my cats. The tuna was easy to handle and broke up into smaller bite-sized bit without any effort. It also was not as "fishy" in smell as you might expect.<br /><br />Did my cats like it? Of Yeah! But the problem is price. $9.99 for a 4 ounce package? You can get 12 Chicken of the Sea 2.5 ounce tuna packages here on Amazon.com for $15.54 and this is tuna you can eat too!<br /><br />If it had a better price point and was easier to open, I would give it a better score. But at this price, you are better off buying tuna from the grocery section of the store.

review/summary: Portions are too large, price too high
review/text: All four ounces of this tuna is stored in a single pouch. Once you open it, the entire four ounces are exposed. My two cats will only eat about one-sixth of this between them. I would rather have smaller, individually wrapped portions so I don't need to refrigerate the most of it to save it for later.<br /><br />The heavy plastic, recloseable bag is hard to open and hard to seal. I used another ziploc instead.<br /><br />I don't see the point in the product though. I'd rather buy a can of tuna for much less and feed my cats that when they need a treat while I eat the rest. I suppose I could eat the rest of these treats, but it's not that appealing.<br /><br />My cats liked it just fine though, but they like the regular tuna just as much.

review/summary: What cat wouldn't like tuna?
review/text: I've got cats.  I gave them tuna.  They ate it.<br /><br />Of course, they ate this tuna, Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats, with exactly the same gusto that they have with canned dolphin safe tuna, at a fraction - a fraction! - of the price.<br /><br />This product claims "eco-safe fishing practices are used that promote sustainable fishing stocks."  How do we know?  The Marine Stewardship Council seal doesn't have its label on this package.  "Dolphin safe" doesn't give the buyer any insight into seabird safe, sea turtle safe, shark safe (or at least not tied to the shark finning industry), or excessive by-catch.  In other words, I really don't have confidence in any unique "eco-safe" claims.  Heck, the claim that "Our factory does not fish for 4 months of the year in order to maintain fishing stocks in the local waters" doesn't tell me anything.  First, factories don't fish.  Second, fisheries rarely focus on the same species for an entire year; they may switch between swordfish and tuna, or whatever.  As far as I can tell, most Ecuadorian tuna boats use purse seines set over fish aggregation devices.  I don't know how this affects by-catch.<br /><br />As you can tell, I want to be an aware consumer.  This product doesn't give me enough information to determine whether the product comes from a sustainable fishery.  See Seafood Watch for more information.

Of course, they are piggy kinds of cats so that might not be too much of an endorsement. HOwever, they really seemed to like it and they were quite forceful in their desire to eat it so I am going to give this a good review and say that you should buy it. It made them a little gassy and you might not like the smell but just light a candle and everything should be fine.

review/text: I have to admit I was a little surprised by the product.  Normally "treats" are of the dry variety while this was more strips of something closer to canned food - although quite solid.  The packaging was a bit of a pain to open but once done I placed some down for my two cats.  One thought it was the greatest idea ever while the other ignored it completely.  The same thing happened with the same cats in repeated tries.  This should not be a surprise to most cat owners:  they are notoriously finicky eaters.  The problem is the price point is rather steep for something they might not even like.  I would give it a shot if you have multiple felines as at least one will problably go for it.  But then, there may be treats far less expensive they will eat with equal zeal.

review/text: One of our cats thinks this tuna is the best thing ever and tries to guard it, which is something I've never seen her do with food before.  Our other cat wasn't initially very interested in the treats and then threw up after she had some of one, but she'd been throwing up her regular food too, so I can't really blame the treats.  The tuna falls apart easily and is pretty messy--these aren't a dehydrated stick type of thing, which makes them seem more like a meal than a treat to me.  Maybe, though, they don't contain enough nutrients to be the main part of a healthy cat's diet.<br />So one of our cats would give the treats five stars, and the other would probably give them two.

Well, she has her likes & dislikes like all felines.<br /><br />But she did like this tuna. Petite Cuisine makes nice products, but they can be pricey. Certainly this is priced at the special treat/splurge rate.<br /><br />It's a good thing perhaps that feral cats do not read labels and she can just happily gulp  down this treat with nary a care.

review/text: These are a different kind of treat and I'm giving the treat itself 5 stars.  The treats are vacuum packed, 4 strips in a row in a sauce/liquid.  One strip is easily sufficient for two typical cats, too much for one (in my opinion). They look like long, thin grilled tuna steaks. You can crumble them or leave them as is. It never seemed to matter, as the begging meows started once the package was opened.<br /><br />These were very well received and I'd get them again. However, here are some things that I wish they would change.  If there were a way to re-seal the package, that would be helpful, as the only option is to open the treats and store them in a Ziplock or Tupperware. They are more costly than typical hard treats, but these are soft tuna. Still, at this price, they will be an occasional special treat only.

review/text: My cats go nuts over kitty treats -- the cheap kind you can get at PetsMart or PETCO. So I thought it might be nice to let them try some fancy treats for the holidays... but I needn't have bothered. My 4 cats (Siamese) enjoyed the treats, but not as much as the dry treats or regular wet food. The strips of tuna were too big for just a snack, so I fed them the entire package for dinner. They seemed to have trouble eating it, they just kept licking the top, though they did manage to eat all of it.<br />If you really want to feed your cat tuna or real food instead of the processed dry food, then this treat seems fine. But for $10 I don't think it is really worth it.

Cat lovers understand this.<br />I was concerned that I might have given them too much as it is packed in oil, but no problems.<br /><br />The product at $9.99 is higher than a can of tuna, but it is specifically made for cats which is a plus for me.<br /><br />The packaging was rather skimpy with regards to directions of any sort.<br />Two issues with the packaging: it did not state whether the ziplock bag, after opening, needed to be refrigerated, and it did not specify any amount to give the cats.<br /><br />Overall though my cats gave this a thumbs up or paws up!

review/text: I expected cat treats would be bite-sized morsels I could hand out a nibble at a time. Instead this package has three oblong slabs sealed in liquid that has to be refrigerated after opening. Yummy, but messy!<br /><br />The price is very high for four ounces of tuna. As treats aren't meant to be a cat's primary food source, just as a treat, it would be more economical to give the kitty a bit of your own people-tuna.<br /><br />The package is labeled "Product of Ecuador." Take that for what you will. Doing a search on "tuna from Ecuador" gave some moderately disturbing results as regards mercury and fishing practices. The package does say it is from eco-safe, sustainable, dolphin-friendly fisherman, however.

review/summary: Cat loves it, but I could buy sashimi grade tuna for this price!
review/text: Five stars if I was going on taste alone. My girl loves it. It's kitty crack.<br /><br />But at the price per ounce, I could be feeding her high-quality sushi! For that, I'm deducting a couple starts.<br /><br />Glad I got to review this and give her a nice treat. But Petite Cuisine is too expensive to make it into her regular rotation.

review/text: The product was really enjoyed by my cats. It was not too oily or fishy, and once they tried it they started to beg for it. :-)<br /><br />The only drawback was the inner plastic packaging. It was fairly thick, and just a little hard to get into.

review/summary: MAY BE BETTER FOR SOME THAN OTHERS!
review/text: I got this for my two Chows because they absolutely love anything "fishy". The package says it's for cats and dogs. When I initially ordered it I thought it would be strictly for cats, but since my Chow babies will devour anything cat related(including cat turds... GROSS!) I decided to get this for them as a treat. Mistake. Maybe other dogs(and cats) can handle this Tuna treat, but mine could not. Both of my Chows weigh in the upper 50lb. region and figured from the get go this stuff would be kind of rich, so I figured I would give them each a very small portion. They each got about half of an ounce of it. About 6 hours later they seemed to be having a squirting contest to see who could fill the yard the quickest :)<br /><br />This stuff really messed their stomachs up! Unless you keep Chows trimmed(I do not) then they will generally have very hairy rears and, oh boy, was that a mess to clean(gag!). Normally, they both can eat half a can of cat food(it's fairly rich) each and their stomachs are fine. This stuff must be really rich. So, if your dog or cat has a sensitive stomach I would avoid these. On the bright side, I suppose this Tuna Treats stuff tastes very good. My pups gobbled them... then payed for it. Again, this will be dependent upon the type of animal and how strong their stomach is. Probably would be better for cats... but since I don't have any cats I can't test that theory. I thought about giving another small serving of this stuff to my dogs just to make 100% sure this was the root of their stomach problems, but the wife and I weren't too thrilled by the possibility of going through another roll of paper towels, or making our Chow babies blow their rears off anymore :) The bottom line: Use with caution.

review/summary: Cat & Dog both like it
review/text: This seems to be a very good product but no different from any regular can of tuna.  I could pay a lot less and buy a can of tuna that will last me just as long for much less.  There are basically 4 strips of tuna in the zip lock bag. Which for me was very difficult to open after ripping the top off as directed.  I thought I could pull an entire strip of tuna out but as soon as I went to pull it out of the bag, the tuna strip fell apart and on to the floor.  That is how I found out that my dog loves tuna.  : )  The quality of the meat was good and the pets liked it so that is why I gave it 4 stars.  The fact that I can buy a can of tuna for much less made me take one star away.

review/summary: My cats enjoyed these, but are they worth the price?
review/text: My two cats adored the Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna treats, and I can't say I'm surprised (they're tuna addicts).  I liked the product because they didn't get sick afterward, which seems to happen occasionally with kitty treats. These "treats" are basically three slices of grilled tuna in water sealed in a pouch.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you want to pamper your tuna-loving cats, I think these are great.  But if your cats love plain ol' tuna, you might as well stick with that because it's much cheaper!<br /><br />Five star product with one star deducted for price.<br /><br />In the interests of full disclosure, my cats were fortunate enough to receive these treats through the Amazon Vine program. :)

review/summary: My Cat LOVED these
review/text: So to be honest, one of these strips pretty much equals one meal, at least for my cat, and not so much a quick snack. There are 3 strips in the package and it costs $10. Completely overpriced, hence only 4 stars out of 5. Otherwise, my cat simply loved this, cleaning her bowl quicker than I've ever seen. It looks like real tuna, smells very appetizing, but I just can't stomach the price tag. If I hadn't picked this up free of charge, I would never have spent the money on it.

review/summary: I really don't see the need for this.
review/text: First let me say my cats ate this and loved it. Taste and quality are not an issue.<br />I only gave it 3 stars due to price and packaging.<br />When I opened it the tuna ooze/juice was already past the ziplock type seal.<br />I wasn't going to try to reseal it and clean the juice around the seal. I imagined that this was going to turn into a smelly mess and<br />decided to give it all to my beasts. They ate it all. The packaging really need to have the kinks worked out.<br />The price is unbelievable. The package contains 3 slices of tuna for a total of 4.1 ounces. That's $2-$3 a slice. $24-$40 a pound? Really?<br />I can't imagine why anyone would be willing to pay that price for this item.

review/summary: Pricier than regular tuna, and cats can't tell the difference
review/text: My three cats thought this product was delicious! But it seems so expensive. Is it really better-tasting than a regular can of tuna? I put the cats through several taste tests, and all them seemed to feel that tuna is tuna. They had no clear preference. So save your money and skip this fancy stuff. Besides, it comes in 3 long strips and it's hard to get it out of the bag, making it more of a mealtime food than an anytime treat.

review/summary: My four cats give it two paws up!
review/text: I feed my four cats Iams dry cat food on a regular basis, but every now and then I serve them soft food as a special treat. I usually give them a can of Fancy Feast split four ways. My cats prefer the seafood flavors. When I saw Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats, I had a feeling these would be a hit at my house.<br /><br />Sure enough, I barely had the package open, when my cats went bonkers! The scent of it drove them wild - to the point that three of them earned squirts with the water bottle for jumping up on the dining room table to see what I was opening. Two of these cats normally don't get on that table - at least not when I'm watching, so for them to knowingly do something they weren't supposed to is big.<br /><br />I am sure they thought I was dragging the suspense out quite unnecessarily. You see, the Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats come in long strips and I had to cut them up in order to dish them up for my kitties. The task isn't hard at all, but is guaranteed to stir up cats as impatient as mine.<br /><br />Once I finished divvying up the tuna treats, I set them down and watched as my cats devoured every last morsel. It's a good thing I was watching, too, because my boy Logan tried to push two of the more submissive cats away from their bowls until I grabbed him and held him until they were done. Any other time he would have loved being held and petted, but he really wanted their servings of the Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats.<br /><br />Judging by the empty bowls and eager kitties, the flavor was a hit!<br /><br />The treats come in a vacuum sealed pouch and look as appetizing as cat food can - definitely much more appetizing than the regular canned stuff. The package was a bit much for one cat, but was a healthy serving when split between four cats.<br /><br />I'll definitely be purchasing some of these to serve my kitties again.

review/summary: Fresh tuna in a convenient sealable bag
review/text: These treats are long tuna strips (you get 3) that you have to break up to feed your cat.  There is a strong tuna smell, and they seem very fresh.  You can reseal the bag and refrigerate them.<br /><br />My cat wouldn't eat them, and neither would the neighbor cat, however, the 6 month old neighbor kittens loved them, and so did her dog (she had to keep him away from them).<br /><br />My cat doesn't like tuna, but I thought I would give these a try anyway.  So, if your cat is picky and doesn't like tuna, I would suggest passing on these.  I gave them 3 stars because 2 out of 4 cats liked them, and the quality seems nice.  But, I didn't like how you had to break up the tuna with your hands, it was messy and the tuna smell lingered in my hands even after several washings.

review/text: My cats loved this treat!  I didn't like the packaging, because it's really just a one-time portion unless you vacuum seal the rest.  Plus, the fish is in huge pieces, not really ready for feeding cats.<br /><br />It's best for cats who refuse to eat due to illness, medication, etc.  I found this tuna dissolved off the dishes in a blink of a cat's eye.

review/summary: Cats Devoured It, Quite Messy For Us Humans Though
review/text: When I saw this PETITE CUISINE GRILLED TUNA TREATS product for cats, I KNEW I had to let me Muffin, Ginger and Peaches try it for themselves. I'm all about feeding them healthy and the omega-3/omega-6 fats in this were a huge plus in my book. When I opened up the package, I was impressed to see the tuna actually looked like tuna and not some fake tuna-like substance. And there was a little zip lock on it so you could portion out the amount of treats for your feline friends and then reseal it. Cool. But what was not-so-cool was just how messy it was to take out of the bag, dripping wet and splashing all over the front of my shirt, big long chunks that has to be broken up by hand before sharing with my cats. While they devoured this special treat as soon as it hit the floor, their owner was busy washing his soiled shirt and trying to get that awful "fishy" smell off of his hands. There's got to be a better way to get the treat chunks into smaller pieces and not so messy...maybe individually wrapping each bite-sized portion would be better. It's not a bad product, but it could be better.

review/summary: The cat loves it, but it would be cheaper to buy tuna steaks and grill them for him
review/text: Sushi has been getting a bit picky about his canned cat food lately.  But tonight the food vanished in minutes.<br /><br />Usually I feed him a third of a can of cat food, then some dry.  This package is about an ounce less than a can, so even though this is a "cat treat" I gave him one of the three strips in place of the canned food for tonight.  Normally he turns his nose up at the wet food and pesters me for the dry, but he absolutely loved this.  Sometimes he has trouble keeping food down if he's not used to eating it, but that's been no problem so far tonight.<br /><br />The tuna smell was quite strong, which of course got Sushi's attention quickly.  If this had been a tuna steak on my plate, I'd have been a little annoyed.  It was tough, like it had been overcooked, and I was unable to break it up with a fork.  I finally picked it up and pulled it apart.  This was obviously no problem for the cat, but given the cost I'd hope for better quality control.<br /><br />There were no serious problems with the package here, although the plastic bag didn't want to be extracted from the cardboard sleeve at first.  It was full of liquid, which the cat loved (and which he needs,) so I opened it over the sink.  Of course a few drops escaped.<br /><br />Current nutritional information:<br />Protein minimum 28%<br />Crude fat minimum 2%<br />Crude fiber maximum 1%<br />Moisture maximum 75%<br />Sodium maximum 3%<br />Omega 3 fatty acid 200mg minimum<br />Omega 6 fatty acid 17mg minimum<br /><br />The tuna is "dolphin safe" and obtained by "eco-safe sustainable fishing."  Ingredients are wild caught tuna and water for processing.  Tonight Sushi is eating better than me!

review/text: When I first opened the package of Petite Cruisine Grilled Tuna the cat was no where in sight.  But I swear I wasn't done opening it and she came running.  And begged and begged and begged.<br /><br />The removal of the treat from the bag was not an enjoyable experience.  You will get the juice and the stink all over your hand and they don't stay together as one piece, they flake apart (as fish is supposed to I guess).  Next time I will use a fork to remove them from the package.  But the cats LOVED these treats.  Would I buy them?  Yes, as a special treat for the kitty's I would.  As an everyday treat?  No - too messy and hard to handle.

review/text: We've currently got three cats, ranging in age from 6 months to three years old. All enjoyed this very realistic looking (and smelling) tuna filet treat. This is more like soft/wet cat food (moist and messy) than a traditional cat "treat" and I served it in a bowl. The three polished off an entire bag quickly and licked their bowls clean. Despite the fact they enjoyed it, the price point means I'm unlikely to buy this one regularly.

review/summary: Great quality, but price too high
review/text: My cats loved this tuna.  No complaints at all about the quality and taste from them.  But two issues I have with it is it's not really a treat and it's not convenient to give to your cat for a little snack.  It's three rather large slabs of tuna that need to go in a bowl. The slabs are pretty densely packed and could probably be formed into smaller pieces, so I'm not sure why they aren't.  When you open it you are inevitably going to get tuna juice on your hands and it's a bit messy all around.  It's really more of a meal.<br /><br />Another thing is the price is too high.  It's higher than even good canned tuna you can buy in the grocery store.  I'm not sure why I would buy this over just buying my cats a can of tuna from time to time.  If I had tons of money I guess I would buy this?  I'm not sure.  It just seems like a waste of money.

review/summary: All my pets loved it.
review/text: Pros: All three of my cats love the Grilled Tuna Treats. I have one cat that only eats dry cat food, he doesn't eat people food and rarely eats can cat food when I give it to them. He is just satisfied with dry cat food. But, when I gave him this he was instantly hooked and when he was done eating his share he was following me around wanting more.<br /><br />The back of the package says it is good for dogs too, so I gave my dog some as well so he didn't feel left out and he also liked it. So all pets loved it.<br /><br />Cons: The package is poorly designed. As soon as you rip open the top juice starts to leak out. I was trying to open the resealable part and I had to get through juice to get to it.<br /><br />This treats comes in three long tuna sticks. While it might be okay to toss a stick to my dog, the sticks were too big for my cats. So I had to tear apart the sticks with my hands and it was not appealing.<br /><br />It does easily reseal, but I wish it was packaged in a better way so I didn't have to dip my hands in the juicy bag and pull out a stick. But, all my pets loved it so I gave it four stars.

review/text: I was a little worried about trying this with my cat because he's only ever had regular cat food or traditional treats before and I didn't know how he'd react to something like this.  I needn't have worried.  He inhaled these tuna "treats" like they were candy.  I hesitate to call them treats though because one "stick" of the tuna is about the amount of a regular single meal for my cat.  Anyway, I was going to come on here and write a review saying how I'd continue to buy these for my cat.  Except that's when I saw the price.  My poor cat is going to have to stick with his Whisker Lickins tarter control treats.  I can afford those and he likes them almost as well anyway.  Sorry, Buddy.  You're not a rich cat.

review/text: So ... if a feline were reviewing this product, it would certainly merit five stars.  Our cat pronounced it plate cleaning to the very last lick good. There is a substantial amount of tuna in the package which, when served as a "treat", provided 5-6 sizable snacks for our large orange boy.  (And he sometimes turns up his whiskers at human seafood)!  Our one critique is that the packaging is a bit of a bother.  It doesn't re-seal easily nor allow you to easily divide the contents into portions. But that's a human problem that our cat expects us to solve for him.

review/summary: massive, massive kitty attacks over this
review/text: Having two cats in the house, both with various health issues (UTI, overly-processed food allergies) means that I have to be careful what types of snacks they receive.  Anything with too much filler is a no-no, so seeing something that's basically just tuna is wonderful, especially when it's essentially guilt-free tuna because of the harvesting methods.  That it looks a heck of a lot better than anything that comes in a can may raise a few eyebrows (yes, there were comments about the cats eating better than the humans), but it did put any fears to rest about giving them anything 'bad'.<br /><br />The only 'negative' I have to say about Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna is that the package was a wee bit difficult to open (basically ended up cutting it open in the end).  Other than that, the girls went *nuts* over the tuna.  Both were in various parts of the house during the fight with the package and were quickly in the kitchen by the time it was open!  The more energetic of the two was very frantic in making sure that she got her share of the treat!  Even the more laid back (older) of the cats was certain to get some of the tuna, and she's not always receptive to treats.  They loved the tuna and kept hovering around after it was put away.  As soon as it comes out of the fridge, they're back for more!<br /><br />You can definitely tell it's good quality tuna and nothing but tuna once you look at it.  For the price, there's a decent amount to parcel out.  If anything, I worry a bit about giving them a cold treat since you do need to refrigerate it once it's open, but they don't seem to mind! And you can always warm it up a bit if that's a concern.

review/text: My cats went crazy for the taste of these grilled tuna Petite Cuisine treats. The product is packaged in a sealed plastic bag inside the paper wrapper, and it looks and smells like the "people" tuna I eat from a can. The package states that the tuna is responsibly harvested with dolphin safe techniques. This makes a very nice treat for your furry friends. The one drawback I see is that it is a little messy getting the product out of the plastic it is sealed in, and it might be easier if the treats were compartmentalized so that one serving at a time could be taken out more readily.

My cat that doesn't eat a lot of her food scarfed this down and immediately started eating the other cats serving.<br /><br />This is a treat.  It doesn't have all the nutrition cats need (it is like feeding your cat human tuna, you can't feed only that).  I would buy this again as a treat.

review/summary: cat loved it, so of course it costs a lot
review/text: My cat is a fairly finicky eater, but this tuna looks a lot like "people food" which she always tries to steal, so I figured she'd like it.  I didn't expect her to get on the counter and try to take the resealable pouch from me before I could get one of the tuna strips out.  It's probably an understatement to say that she loved this tuna.  Because I didn't think she'd do well with a whole strip, I broke about 1/3 of one strip into pieces which she ate promptly leaving nothing to spoil.  Each feeding had the same result.  The cat would clearly give a 5 star rating; I'm tempted to as well considering her response and that only two ingredients are listed (tuna and water for packing), but the price is a sticking point.

review/summary: Delicious messy treat.
review/text: This is tuna, plain and simple. I think I could put it in my sandwich. It comes in flat, pressed slices in juice in a plastic bag with a zip lock seal. I can't imagine many cats would turn up their noses at fresh tuna; ours didn't. You picture a treat as as something you could take along in the car with your cat or keep by your bedside. This is not as convenient as dry treats. The strips are packed tight in the bag and unless you decant the whole slab, you will have to dig out a juicy bit a little at a time with a fork. You WILL spill some juice. Every time I dig some out and reseal the packet, I have to rinse the exterior and pat it dry. Refrigeration is a must once it is open. I can see it lasting a week or more, especially since you will spoil your cat if he/she gets too much.

review/summary: Pricey, but very high quality
review/text: I ordered these because my aging cat is getting thin and we were hoping to tempt her with this.  Sadly, she wouldn't eat it, but most cats probably would.  Yes, it's quite expensive for a cat "treat."  ($9.99 as of this writing).  However, this is a very high quality product that would easily provide three servings to a single cat.  In fact, when I opened the package it looked and smelled just like Starkist Tuna for people!  And like the people version, it must be refrigerated after opening.  The package included three grilled strips, in a little water, just like the Starkist puches.  The meat was firm and smelled fresh.  At the price, I wouldn't buy this regularly but as an actual "treat" I would definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Ecstatic Cats?  You Know It!
review/text: Within seconds after I received this treat package, it was empty.  My cats were ecstatic -- tuna, tuna, and nothing but tuna.<br /><br />When I ordered this treat, I expected tuna-flavored treats.  Nothing of the sort arrived.  It was grilled tuna in a small amount of juice.  And on opening the package, I immediately was surrounded by three demanding cats.  They all got a share, and there was even enough for my dog to enjoy a bite.<br /><br />Honestly, this tuna looked good enough for any human to enjoy.  Of course, it's too pricey for their every day consumption, but for a once-in-a-while treat -- it couldn't be better.  At least that's what the cats said as they licked their mouth clean. And it's a product of Ecuador, not China.<br /><br />Five Stars!

review/summary: Tasty snack for cats that like tuna
review/text: I let my two cats try this today and their opinions were mixed. One absolutely loved it and was looking at me like "More! More!" The other wasn't thrilled until I sprinkled some of his regular dry food on top. (He happens to have never cared for tuna or any type of seafood, so I wasn't surprised by his reaction.) As long as your cat likes tuna, he/she is probably going to really enjoy this treat. I like that it's pure, dolphin safe tuna with no added ingredients, preservatives, colors or flavors. It comes in a ziplock top bag. (Zip bag tightly and refrigerate after opening) It's a nice size bag for several good size servings. Although it's a bit on the pricey side, I'll definitely get this again for an occasional special treat for my tuna loving cat.

review/summary: The cats really really loved it
review/text: I have two cats, one of whom is older and on a carb restricted diet because of diabetes, so it is really hard to find treats for her.  I've actually been feeding her canned human tuna, which she seems to like quite a bit.  This product is something else altogether.  She is wild about it.<br /><br />The package contained 3 filets of substantial size, to be honest it looked better than my dinner on many a night, the cats were almost fighting over it, they basically wolfed it down.  One filet was split between two of them, it flaked just like an actual filet of tuna, which is actually what it was.  It was pretty large, practically their dinner.<br /><br />The filets come in a pretty sturdy ziplock pouch, that has a tear notch that is basically impossible to open, I just used a scissors, so it was hardly a problem.<br /><br />The economics of this item are probably debatable, but it is about as good a cat treat as I have seen, though it might just be easier to go buy fish from the local market and give it to them.  If I was a cat I would be very enthusiastic about the item, so keep in mind the five star rating I give it comes from the cat's perspective.

review/summary: cat loved them!
review/text: My cat loved these tuna treats. I had the package in front of her and she kept meowing until I had the treats out and had given it to her. She kept licking the treats until it started to break/flake apart and then finally gobbled the treat up.<br /><br />The bag comes with 3 rather large sticks of tuna. I broke apart one of them into 3 pieces and gave her 1/3rd of the stick each time, in case she would get sick and throw it up, which she didn't. The treats smell exactly like canned tuna that we would eat and it flakes like it as well. Some people complained about the packaging but I didn't really have a problem with it. I just used a pair of scissors and cut the top part off and then the resealable bag opened up. I was able to reseal it just fine as well for storage in my fridge.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars from the cat. I just knocked one star off because of the price. $10 is kinda insane for cat treats so this wouldn't be something I would normally buy for her.

review/summary: Happy Cat!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package to find what looks like actual chunks of meat rather than the fake, fish shaped fare that normally comes in cat treat packages.  My cat was a happy camper as well.  He immediately started licking the juice off of the strip (he always laps up the gravy first when we feed him) and then devoured an entire strip right away.  Needless to say, we didn't have to feed him for awhile after that treat.<br /><br />I could see these treats being something we would buy him often if they cost a little less.  The price seems a little high for three strips of meat, but I guess you get what you pay for and he certainly approved.  I can see me buying them for him as a special treat every once in awhile, but not every trip to the grocery store because of the price.

review/summary: Fantastic indulgence
review/text: Go ahead and get your Crazy Cat Lady jokes out of the way now. I have six cats.  What this means to you, is that I have a range of finickiness and palates here. And I can say absolutely that all six of mine *loved* these treats.  Beyond even the Drs Foster and Smith freeze-dried salmon (why yes, they are a little spoiled, why do you ask?!?!).<br /><br />You get a nice amount of meat, in three fish-stick shaped things, with grill marks (you can see that on the package).  The package has a tear off top with a zip seal.<br /><br />I'll admit, I struggled with that zip seal, getting it open the first time, so if you have hand issues, that may be a problem for you.  The stuff smells like tuna, but not junk or cheap tuna.  It has a little bit of liquid in the package.  You take the fishstick and crumble it up a bit. The rest of the packet has to be refrigerated after opening.  The plastic of the packet is thick and sturdy.<br /><br />Right now, one of them is in the sink licking the drips from the bag (I was fighting with the zip seal but was smart enough to do it over a sink!).<br /><br />I would highly recommend these treats and will definitely buy more.

review/summary: Five paws up, but messy to serve as a treat
review/text: First off, as other reviewers have noted, the form of these "treats" is not like most other cat treats in that there are not small "nuggets" you can easily give to your cat individually.  You get three strips of nice, firm tuna that can be sliced into chunks, but I found they tended to fall apart easily.  Not that my cats cared....<br /><br />All five of my "pride" went crazy for the Petite Cuisine tuna.  One, a feral who is usually very shy, was going around trying to steal pieces from the others. I tried feeding the chunks from my hand, and that sometimes worked, but mostly the chunks fell apart into flakes. No matter, the cats didn't mind. I think they're going to be disappointed when I finish the package.<br /><br />You'd probably have better luck crumbling a piece over the cat's regular food, or perhaps putting it on a separate dish (I may try that tomorrow.)<br /><br />I did find myself wondering about the "Pet food only" marking on the inner pouch, though I am aware that we're allowed to feed our pets food "not fit for human consumption".  I was able to cut the pouch open at the tear notch (I generally have bad luck with those notches), but once I did so, the pouch opened nicely and was easily resealable. Note that once opened you are supposed to refrigerate the rest.<br /><br />In preparation for this review I decided to do some web searching about the product.  I didn't find much but did find the company's press release when this product line was introduced in 2010.  I noted that the "suggested retail price" was $6.99-$8.99.  Even at the low end of that price range, it's well beyond what I would pay for cat treats on a regular basis, but as a special occasion I could see it.

review/summary: My Cats Went Crazy for These
review/text: My cats tend to be very picky eaters esp. when it comes to treats. However, they absolutely loved these, and they were gone less than a minute after I placed them in the dish.<br /><br />I was very impressed by the quality of the tuna. This is not some sub-par grade of tuna. It is of the highest quality, and smelled so good I was even tempted for a second to take a bite.<br /><br />Overall, great gourmet treat for the special kitty or kitties in your life. The resealable package was a further bonus, too.

review/summary: The cat liked it!
review/text: I contemplated doing a video review with a video of the cat eating this stuff... but, actually it went too fast.  The package was pretty much next to impossible to open, but after I managed it I was going to put a bar in my dog's bowl and a bar on a plate for the cat.  (The package said good for dogs too)  I was cleaning up the juice that got all over the counter when I opened the package and then planned to go find the cat to show him his treat.  I should have known better... I turned around and he was eating the tuna out of the dog's bowl.  I picked him up and he made short work of his plate.  The jury is still out on the dog, but I anticipate that she'll be just as happy as the cat.  It claims to be a great treat for your cat and my cat seems to agree.  I can't ask any more than that.  I hope your cat enjoys it as well and thanks for taking the time to read my review.

review/summary: My cats loved it.
review/text: As soon as I got this my cats sensed something was up, as they usually ignore me when I bring the mail in.  It was difficult getting the package open, so I ended up just cutting it open.  Both cats loved it, even the little finicky one, so on taste this product hit a home run.  There's plenty here to give the cats on multiple occasions, hence the resealable package (which I wish worked a little better).<br /><br />All in all a great product for those occasional spoil the kitties extra rotten times.

review/summary: Scrumptious.  Lots of meows and barks.
review/text: These are what I would call Tuna Bars.  They were cause for quite a bit of excitement as I opened the package to provide my cats' with a treat.  Even the dogs gathered round, and would not budge until they too partook of the goodie (the package says it's okay and good for dogs too).<br /><br />This tuna is moist and the bars measure 4-1/4" x 1-1/8" and a little over 1/4" wide.  I broke it down somewhat for the cats, and served larger pieces to the dogs.  Inside the outer package, the tuna is packed in a thick plastic bag with a secure sealer which is good for spoilage reasons and for maintaining the moisture in the tuna.<br /><br />The package informs one that the tuna is grilled, all natural (wild caught), hand cut, high in Omega 3 fatty acids, a product of Ecuador and dolphin-safe (we want to protect those dolphins!).  It should be refrigerated after opening.<br /><br />The nutritional information is:  protein min. 28%; crude fat min. 2%; crude fat min. 2%; sodium max. 3% Omega 3 fatty acid min. 200mg.; Omega 6 fatty acid min. 17mg.<br /><br />And isn't this nice--It is stated on the package:  "We do not fish for 4 months of the year so that the fish populations can remain in balance with nature and our needs."  Would that were true for the rest of the world's fishermen.<br /><br />What's not to like about this product?  I can't think of a thing.  And neither can my pets!
