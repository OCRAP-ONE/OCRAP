review/summary: Mild breakfast type coffee/tea
review/text: I had never used these coffee pods before and used them in my coffee maker without a filter.  I was really expecting the coffee to smell great when it was brewing, but maybe it is to mild.  If you like milder breakfast type coffee or chai tea you will love this coffee.  I added a little light cream and it was very good, be careful with the cream it needs very little.  My first cup I put to much light cream and it overpowered the drink.  I would buy this again, it is something nice to give as a gift or serve to company.

review/summary: I am a coffee lover . . .
review/text: . . .A little fussy about my coffee, and this coffee did not disappoint me.  It has a rich flavor, I can control the strength by adding or substracting the amount of water I use (which you can do wih all coffees, I know).  The flavor - although I cannot pinpoint the difference, is very nice.  I'll definitely be buying more of this brand and I think that's probably the best review I can give it - I want more.

review/summary: Marley Coffee, One Love Organic
review/text: I made my coffee the usual way but it was not strong enough. I don't like my coffee overly strong, but I do like it to taste like coffee. I made another cup, but used 2 packets, perfect! It tastes exactly like coffee, nothing over the top, just coffee. I gave it 4 stars though because it is organic, and I prefer everything organic!

review/text: I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure.

review/summary: Roast is too dark for  a Yirgacheffe
review/text: While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.

review/summary: A tasty treat
review/text: We saw that some of the coffee reviews said that the coffee was weak when "teabagged."  We put a few pods of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOLXM">Marley Coffee One Love, One Heart</a> into our old-fashioned stovetop percolator and let the steam do its magic.<br /><br />Yum. Great flavor, and strong enough. Even though I prefer my coffee whitened and sweetened, I was surprised that I enjoyed the Marley Coffee black. This coffee was great alone, and would probably do well as a mixer for cooking or alcohol recipes.<br /><br />Next time, we may experimentally open the pods and try the in the Keurig; however, we *were* satisfied with the percolator.

review/summary: Bold flavor
review/text: First of, I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this coffee.  Come to find out the "single serve pods" are flat, round cushions that require a special coffee maker.  I own a Keurig and Eco-Brew refillable cups that I really like, so I decided to open the pod and dump the grounds into the Eco-Brew cup instead.  It worked like a charm, and on the 6cc setting I got to enjoy a very bold brew with no aidic aftertaste.

review/text: One Love is a good, robust coffee - if you like a strong coffee in the morning, you should like the flavor. Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: Well, I wasn't bright when I ordered this coffee and for some reason I thought it came in both single servings and pods. I had to tear the pods open and use just the coffee and that way, it is EXCELLENT coffee. Rich and dark, I really like the flavor. My only complaint is, no, they're not easy to open packets, I have to use scissors and really, does it need all that wasteful packaging? But the coffee itself is very good, though I don't know all the fancy words for describing coffee, I like strong flavor with caffeine, usually choosing medium roasts and this fits the bill.

review/summary: This Coffee is Not Bad
review/text: This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of "pods" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices. I do not have one so my first try was with my French press - the purest way of making coffee. I put one pod into it and poured in a large cupful of almost boiling water. After poking it around for a while and leaving it to sit, I got a blackish coffee which tasted a bit weak.<br /><br />For my second attempt I cut open two pods and emptied the ground coffee into the press. The resulting coffee was quite strong, but as a quasi-European (English) that's the way I like it.<br /><br />What to say about the flavor? It was mild (no harshness) and fairly pleasant. The coffee in Denny's restaurants is better though.

review/summary: Weak but okay
review/text: Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.  Wrong, very weak when brewed that way.<br /><br />Second, tried to brew two servings at once, but two pods were much too large to fit in the two serving Senseo pod holder.  So, I used the single pod holder and brewed one cup at a time.  What a hassle.<br /><br />Taste wise, the coffee is okay, it tases sort of weak for my tastes and doesn't have a lot of flavor, and the price per pod you might as well buy Star Bucks (or favorite coffee house coffee).  I will keep using my Senseo dark roast pods which I think have better flavor and are much cheaper.

review/summary: Needs more instruction but we figured it out
review/text: Marley Coffee is an interesting product which comes in a tasteful display box/dispenser, and proves that one can have fresh rich coffee just about anywhere without dedicated coffeemakers or pod machines.<br /><br />Maybe the "One Love" variety is meant for two cups per "single serve" bag, or perhaps one is supposed to do something more than to "Stir It Up" little darlin', as recommended on the box (in homage to the song.)<br /><br />There wasn't instruction on the packaging on how to get the brew right with these large "tea bags" of coffee. The only thing clearly marked was which side of the bag should be faced down in the cup.<br /><br />The coffee has a good taste, but the first bag I tried brewed up so strong it gave me the jitters. Good thing there are 15 individual plastic-sealed bags in the dispenser. My husband fiddled around with them because he likes an occasional cup of joe in the afternoon but doesn't want to brew up a whole pot.<br /><br />I credit him with coming up with the "spoon test" to figure out when the coffee was at the perfect strength. We use a 16 oz. cup because the circumference of the bag is rather wide for our 12 oz, and we pour boiling water over the bag which rises to the top as the cup fills. Then we wait for it to steep. After a couple of minutes, he takes a spoon and starts lowering it into the cup just until the bowl of the spoon is completely immersed. When the brew gets dark enough, the bowl of the spoon disappears except for the edges, and then it's done.<br /><br />It's a quality product, convenient, and can save on electricity, as well as not wasting coffee and good water, or adding pods to the landfill. And it's a really nice way to remember Bob Marley, a man of nature from Jamaica.

review/text: We are still on our first box of this, but so far we love this coffee at home. We have a Senseo coffee machine, and we were unsure if it would work for us, but it fits perfectly. The coffee is organic, no artificial ingredients like some of the other ones have (including the ones recommended by Philips!) Size wise, each coffee pod is quite thick, I would equate it to 1.5 times the Senseo ones. Smells and tastes great. I am not the biggest coffee drinker, but the ladies in the house love it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I am a coffee lover and usually enjoy a strong cappuccino in the morning.  I tried this coffee and was impressed by the aroma and flavor.  It is not too strong but has a good not-too bitter flavor.  I really like the pods - so much less mess but these are all individually wrapped!  I know a lot of coffee pods/packets are to keep in the freshness but maybe organic and fair-trade coffee manufacturers could care a little more about the waste produced from individually wrapped items.  Needless to say, I did enjoy my cup of coffee and would buy this product again.

review/summary: Not the best Ethiopian coffee I've had, but pretty darn good for a coffee pod
review/text: Executive summary: not as good as a traditional cup of Ethiopian coffee, but definitely the best coffee pod coffee I've ever had.<br /><br />Several years ago I walked into an Ethiopian restaurant for the first time.  The food was good, but the coffee was the best coffee I had ever tasted.  It was rich and dark and so incredibly flavorful.  It didn't pack a killer caffeine punch, which is good, because I drank a whole pot by myself.  I love coffee and drink it daily, and I've never found another coffee that came close, except at another Ethiopian restaurant.  It's my understanding that coffee originated in that region, which may have something to do with it.  (If I'm wrong, sorry--I'm not a historian.)<br /><br />While I looked forward to this coffee, I was pretty sure it wouldn't be as good as the coffee in the restaurants, made in the traditional way.  I was right.  Still, this is the best coffee I've had from a coffee pod.<br /><br />It was rich and dark, as I expected.  The scent that was released when I opened the packet was wonderfully deep and complex.  The first cup, made from the pod, was very good, if a little bland.  The smell while it brewed turned a little unpleasant near the end, for some reason, but it faded quickly and wasn't present in the brewed coffee at all.<br /><br />I took out the coffee press for the second cup, and cut open one of the pods.  (I don't recommend this, since the grind is far too fine for a coffee press.)  The coffee made this way was much richer and more complex, and the scent while it brewed was sweet and tempting.  Two cups of this coffee didn't give me caffeine shakes, so caffeine levels seem about average.<br /><br />If it matters to you, this is Fair Trade Certified coffee and some profits are donated to Kicks For Cause Foundation, which supports youth soccer programs.

review/summary: Wonderful aroma, delicious taste
review/text: This conveniently-sized pod fight perfectly into my Senseo machine, and brewed up a first-rate cup of coffee.<br /><br />From the moment I opened the recyclable packaging, the wonderful coffee aroma assured me I was in for a treat. The flavor didn't disappoint. Smooth, complex, and rich, with a subtly floral note, this coffee was head and shoulders about my usual Senseo pods, and in my opinion, far superior to the burnt and bitter notes of a certain overpriced but popular coffee chain.<br /><br />A fair trade product that donates funds to a children's soccer charity (rather than turning a blind eye to child labor), Marley Coffee is a morning cup you can enjoy with a clear conscience.<br /><br />Normally, I drink more tea than coffee, so I don't consider myself an expert, but I know what I like, and for me, Marley Coffee was definitely a treat. I received a free sample for review, but I'll definitely be purchasing my next box.

review/text: This coffee comes packaged in individual filter pods, as shown in the product image. I don't have an individual pod coffee maker, so I put this in the filter area and set the pot to make a single cup, and it worked fine. Unlike other pod coffees I've tasted, which are weak and watery, this has a good coffee flavor. A nice medium blend, it has a unique flavor, and isn't bitter/acidic. However, those looking for a dark or super strong jolt should try one of the other roasts. Overall, a good, easy to make, cup of coffee.<br /><br />According to the box, the Marley Coffee company's products are organic, USDA certified, Fair Trade, and child labor free. In addition, some percentage of the profits are donated to children's soccer programs.

review/summary: Marley One Love Organic Coffee
review/text: I have not always been a coffee drinker but have recently begun to enjoy a cup or two per day. Since my son is the only other person her that drinks coffee and he usually drinks the entire pot by himself, I tend to use the store brand or Maxwell House single serve coffee that is used in the same manner as a tea bag. I am not certain that is the intended use for the Marley single serve coffee pods. I don't have a single serve coffee machine although at times I vacillate about buying one, so I'm not sure what the pods for the machines that use them look like. The Marley coffee pods may be intended for use in one of these machines; however the package and the item page do not specify how they are to be used other than single serve. I brewed them in the same way I brew my usual coffee by heating the water in an electric kettle and letting it steep in the cup until I think it has brewed long enough. It seemed to work just fine.<br /><br />As far as the taste, I enjoyed my coffee. It had a somewhat bitter smell but I was happy to find that it did not have a bitter taste. In fact it was fairly smooth tasting. My son also tried a cup and said it was okay. He likes his coffee so strong that most other people can't drink it so I wouldn't go by his opinion. He did mention that he thought it was too expensive. I guess it would be expensive for someone who drinks as much coffee as he drinks. He could finish a box in a couple of days.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />1. This coffee is very tasty and perfect for those who only want one cup at a time.<br />2. This coffee is a good choice for those who prefer organically grown, fair trade coffee.<br />3. This coffee also supports the Kicks for Cause Foundation with partial proceeds going toward youth soccer programs.<br />4. I doubt that I will purchase any of this coffee but that is because I am not a coffee purist and tend to be satisfied with less expensive blends.

review/summary: Organic Medium Roast One Love
review/text: Delicious medium roast coffee made of 100% Arabica beans, grown in Ethiopia by a very conscious company.  This company exists in an area where child labor is prevalent; they however, insist the children of laborers go to school.  That says a lot!<br /><br />The coffee itself is not a blend that will give you a morning jolt, it is a medium blend with berry and floral overtones, which we had a difficult time tasting, but it does have a nice flavor and would be great to serve to guests or for a special occasion.<br /><br />I find it rather difficult to review an item such as this, as taste is so subjective.  However, both my wife and myself find this to be a premium coffee that has a slightly different taste than that which we are familiar. I am not saying that in a negative way, just to let you know that it will be something a bit different.  It is enjoyable and believe it can be well recommended for most coffee drinkers.<br /><br />The company itself must be commended for its treatment of workers, sustainable crops and its contributions to kids organizations in that area.<br /><br />Stir It Up!<br /><br />Ed

review/summary: Excellent coffee, upscale packaging but lacking in description
review/text: Most attractive and functional packaging (individually foil-sealed pods) but while it wasn't hard to figure out the usage once I had them, it certainly was a mystery what exactly they were going to be prior to their arrival. Please note I would have expected the product description to give me some idea of whether this is produced for a single serve maker and if so, for which one(s).<br /><br />I am using single pods in my Senseo brewer, to make small cups (4 oz.) and am finding this most satisfactory. But in order to brew these larger-than-standard pods, I do have to use the 8 oz (two-pod) holder. No problem (as Marley would say). I do my usual routine of wetting the pod prior to brewing. Figure I deliberately make a strong cuppa; that would be my preference. It tastes great. I agree with the description of floral and berry, a very smooth, non-acidic cup of coffee.

review/text: I'm by no means a a coffee expert, but I do drink a ton of it every day.  I do have sensitive tastebuds, and can tell the differences and nuances between a Starbucks Sumatra and a Dunkin Donuts dark roast.  My taste ranges mostly for medium to strong flavored coffees.  This coffee is on the medium side of the flavor spectrum, and it's free of the sourness found in some store brands.  I would call it a mild medium, and I like the portable package as a way to break up the monotony of what's offered at the office.  I can keep a pack or 2 in my desk drawer whenever, as the individual wrapping for each pod is quite handy.  There's nothing terribly distinctive about it- just a clean tasting coffee.  I will say this- I prefer it over the Starbucks Sumatra offered at work.  Recommended.

There are quotes, inspiration, attitude, very nice rendering of a lion, and the man himself holding his impressive locks.  But machine compatibility? Light/med/dark roast? Recommended cup size.  Ah, no.<br /><br />I found that one pod fit the 2-pod holder of my Senseo. Two Marley pods were too large for the 2-pod holder of the Senseo.  I brewed two separate cups, using two pods this morning, but there was no caffeine jolt in this coffee.  A single pod gives a delicious, but slightly weak cup.  Two pods give a very "Starbucks-y" cup of coffee with strong flavor, but without their jolt of caffeine. In fact, I needed a third cup of Marley coffee to accomplish what a perfectly ordinary spoonful of Maxwell House Instant Coffee can do any morning of the week when I am in a hurry (but at a cost of around two dollars).<br /><br />If these folks are serious about coffee, they need to take a look at their competition; more flavor and data, less music.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: This is an astoundingly good cup of coffee!<br /><br />From the scent to the cup this is a great medium bodied coffee with NO burnt beans & NO bitter taste - during or after. The Ethiopia Yiragacheffe is the "exotic floral and berry" blend, yet all I could savor was a brilliant smooth cup of coffee that had absolutely NO need for sugar, honey or cream - it is quite frankly perfect as is. Also easy on the stomach.<br /><br />No instructions, but they are single serve pods made for single serve brewers. As for a standard brewer, compile pods for brewing according to taste. Experiment & enjoy.<br /><br />I shared this with my family, we have a new morning favorite.

review/summary: Very smooth flavor in a convenient form.
review/text: I find this coffee to be very pleasant with very little bitterness or acidity. Since it comes in individual pouches, much like a tea bag, the result is perfectly filtered. There are brewing machines that take such pouches, but I just put it on the bottom of a cup and pour boiling water over it. By adjusting the amount of time that you let it steep, you can regulate the flavor. Most experts suggest only a few minutes, similar to the amount of time a drip method would take. More than that is considered over-extraction that may result in more bitterness and other changes, but it is a matter of personal preference. The foil packs also keep each pod very fresh. It is also very convenient to take to work with you since it is so simple to brew.

review/summary: Very good coffee
review/text: I tried the Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee the day it arrived. I really love the individual coffee "pod" that is so handy and easy to dispose of. The directions suggest using one coffee pod to make an eight ounce cup of coffee. This makes a good cup of coffee with no messy coffee grounds.

review/summary: Smells good, but tastes like coffee-flavored water
review/text: These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help.<br /><br />I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee.<br /><br />I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars.<br /><br />Coffee maker: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a><br /><br />Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking). The resulting coffee was about three stars good - not very strong, but a fair cup of coffee.

review/summary: A Good company, but the coffee is a disappointment
review/text: I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization "kicks for a cause," a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).<br />It is too bad.  I would like to see companies like this one become successful, as they are doing a lot of good things in the world and their community.  but, in all honesty, this particular coffee is not very good.

review/summary: Five Star Coffee but a One Star Pod
review/text: I nevr tasted 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But this really surprised me. There was none. No taste. Just tan water.  When I put the packet into the pod brewer, what came out was not coffee. I couldn't believe it. Not from Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. No way, mon.  I didn't name my dog Stanley Marley for nothing.  I'm a believer.  I took another pod, cut it open and poured the contents into a K-cup and gave the Keurig Brewer a try. What a difference.  The fragrance was enough to bring me to my knees.  The taste?  You know how coffee is supposed to taste but mostly doesn't?  That's how it tastes.  Rich, deep coffee notes, almost a smokiness, but not heavy...this is a lively brew.  There is a definite that makes you want to gulp the whole cup. But sip it...it's too good to gulp.<br /><br />After that first experiment, I opened 3 more pods and poured the contents into the Boodum.  Not the right grind, so I ended up with tons of grounds in the cup but the flavor? Even better.  That rich coffee taste with absolutely no bitterness, no sour aftertaste. I had the Keurig version black, and tasted the Boodum mug first with nothing, then with regular milk, and then poured a cup and added one scant tablespoon of condensed milk.  All of them were wonderful.  Of course I did not sleep for 3 days, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of science.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend the coffee, but not the carrier. Don't order the pods, order the whole bean or ground, loose coffee.  This is an excellent brew when it is released from Pod Prison. It has that beautiful deep, almost turkish coffee flavor going for it.  Black it revs you up, but with milk, cream or condensed milk, it is pure sipping pleasure.  This is Sunday morning, sit back, read the newspaper, put your feet up, life is wonderful coffee.  No fooling.<br /><br />And just for the record, one of the reviewers who gave this product a single star felt that it was bitter and too strong.  I don't know what sort of weak-kneed coffee set that standard, but if you are using the pod, there is no way this could be too strong.  The same reviewer also added "flavored coffee creamer" to the cup.  That stuff is just awful. The 'flavors' are crude and artificial and probably made from petroleum byproducts, recycled plastic bags and zoo waste.  Add real cream, no problem. Add flavors...real cinnamon, cardamom, a little red pepper even.  Nutmeg brings out the inner soul of most coffee, it's lovely. If it's a spice and smells like dessert, it will work.  You can melt a cube of dark chocolate in the microwave and stir it in. Even better, smoosh up a Peppermint Patty and pour the coffee over that. Chocolaty, pepperminty goodness that is like Christmas in a cup.  Flavor your coffee any way you like, but not the fake stuff.  But with this coffee, you don't need to monkey around.  It's that good. Just nix the pod.

review/summary: For people who Like Weak Coffee
review/text: I like my coffee strong so to me this tastes like strong tea that smells vaguely of coffee.  I prepared it the way you would tea--just put it in the cup and poured.  Maybe I should have done something differently but that's all we have (except a conventional coffee machine).  I tried squeezing it with my fingers and that helped a bit.  The only problem was that afterwards my fingers smelled like bitter coffee.  Squeezing the coffee bag with a spoon didn't produce quite the same result.<br /><br />So bottom line: if you like weak coffee, this is worth a try I think.  Otherwise, not so much.

review/summary: Pod Brewing - Bleh;  LOOSE Brewing FANTASTIC
review/text: I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.

review/summary: Amazing smell, good flavor
review/text: It should be noted, since it isn't in the product description, that these are pods for a pod-type coffee maker.  They are not to be used without one.  That being said, I thought the flavor was good, nothing that blew me out of the water, but it was pleasant.  My first 2 cups weren't really strong enough for my liking.  I think I will try using a bit less water next time.  Overall, I love the aroma.  This product is organic and fair trade certified.  They also claim to be grown on a biodiverse farm, with workers who are treated ethically, and through sustainable cultivation...all good points for me.  Each pod is individually packaged which seals in freshness.

review/summary: Flavorful but weak
review/text: This coffee comes in individually foil-sealed pods. If you don't use a machine that uses pods, you could brew it like a tea bag but you might get a more bitter brew with more residue. The pod machines are like espresso machines in that they pump very hot water, or steam, through the coffee.<br /><br />I don't know what it means that this coffee is 'organic.' I thought all foods were organic. If 'organic' means the coffee bushes were not treated with pesticides or fertilizers, that might affect the yield (and therefore the price) but how might that affect the flavor?<br /><br />The flavor is nice -- a little fruity. It has none of the bitter bite that's typical of espresso or dark roasted coffee. If you like strong coffee with chocolaty, full-body flavor that stands up to sugar and half-and-half, and can dissolve silver spoons, this is not for you.

review/text: I've been brewing this in a proper pod brewing machine the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EBUWHM">BUNN MC MyCafe Single Serve Pod Brewer</a>. Even in a 15 oz. mug these pods produce a good, not great, slightly bitter, strong cup of coffee. I don't know about 'exotic floral and berry notes' as the description states. Perhaps my palate isn't refined enough. I just like a strong cup of black coffee and that's what I got. There wasn't anything really special or exciting about the One Love Organic Coffee but there also wasn't anything really bad about it either... I doubt I would get this again, there's better coffee out there.

review/summary: Strong Branding, Weak Flavor
review/text: I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager. Back then, drinking coffee saved my job. In the 30 years since then, I've come to appreciate the multiple nuances about the classic brew. While I don't consider myself a coffee snob, I know what I like.<br />One Love, according to the package, is Organic coffee and Fair Trade Certified, and a piece of the family dream,  which I don't mind standing up for. I still harbor a fondness for the music of the Marley men, and it was with great anticipation that I tossed a pod of One Love into my coffee maker.  For me the coffee was more on the light side of medium. Actually, it tasted on the light side of light.  I prefer a dark bold flavor but don't mind a good medium roast. The package also said Exotic Floral and Berry. Try as I might, I just couldn't pick the Floral and Berry notes or much of a coffee flavor and strangely, no real fragrance. Honestly, I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend this.

I used them in a Senseo pod coffee maker as well as in the generic Mr. Coffee.  The coffee brewed up nicely and was a pretty dark color.  Unfortunately, the coffee itself was insipid.  It had weak flavor for a medium roast despite the deceptive darkness.  It was not the worst coffe I've ever had kbut not the best.  In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold.

Just to be fair I am a regular Dunkin donuts whole bean user so that is what I am comparing this coffee.<br /><br />Sadly I won't be ordering more of this particular version but will see what other flavors they may be selling at this company But if you like your coffee LIGHT this might be a version you would enjoy, it just didn't do it for me.

review/summary: Dark Color, Watery Flavor
review/text: Upon opening the single packet, I smelled something that did not smell like coffee. Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled. Let's just say that it would be an odor one might come in contact with near a water treatment plant or a paper mill.<br /><br />After reading several reviews here before making coffee with the product, I decided to use a microwave to brew it. I put a cup of water in a large cup, put in the pod, put the microwave on high for 5 minutes (which usually boils water at 4) and pushed the start button. This means that I actually brewed the coffee for longer than recommended at higher water temperatures than a single-pod machine would use.<br /><br />The result after this method was STILL a weak cup of coffee. When I added soy and stevia, it actually tasted more like warm soy milk than anything.<br /><br />I will use the rest of the box, but only as back-up when I run out of my regular single-cup bags. Sorry, not really a coffee product I would buy.

I ended up using it all in this manner.<br />I like the idea of this coffee, it is grown in an ethical manner in Jamaica and also in Africa and Central America)by the Marley family (of Reggae fame)<br /><br />A quick look on their web-site reveals they have several other offerings plus a neat (if pricey) coffee-maker)<br />If you like a great tasting coffee, this is worth a try even though it is a bit pricey!

We used a French Press which worked really well.<br /><br />- Flavors may not be for everyone.<br /><br />Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee is a great concept but really fails to deliver on taste.  The first issue arises with the product being in pods.  Many people don't use pod machines.  We used a French Press which worked amazingly well but the pods won't work well in a standard coffee maker.  Our second issue was the lack of overall flavor.  As I mentioned earlier, the coffee taste was more like coffee flavored water than an actual brewed cup of coffee.  Despite the lack of taste, these pods are really handy if you travel or have a French Press at work.  If you're feeling adventurous or just want to support Organic and Fair Trade coffee growers then you may want to give Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee a try.

I categorize myself as a coffee drinker as opposed to a connoisseur since I'm amenable to buying whatever happens to be on sale at the market and spending my money on boutique blends happens about as often as the pope personally dispenses contraceptives.<br /><br />Now, my palate is sufficiently sophisticated to distinguish between premium and plebian but the miserly gene invariably kicks into overdrive and inhibits forking over the cash for the former and definitely precludes an outlay for what my taste buds inform is a decent product yet well short of remarkable.<br /><br />The Marley organic medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a step above valued oriented Arabica but I was reminded of an ground variety with a bitter, burned aftertaste from the most notable of those upscale caf&eacute; house coffee providers (hey, I'm cheap and a hypocrite. If someone else is paying, I'm drinking).<br /><br />I tried the pods in a variety of ways (single cup brewing; steeped like tea for five minutes; open grind percolation; microwaved to the cusp of boiling) but regardless of method with eight ounces of water I found myself less than overwhelmed, and definitely unmotivated to order more.  Drinking it with cream and sugar was less offensive than black; the additives tended to mask the burnt aftertaste I detected.<br /><br />For some this group's commitment to social responsibility may influence a purchasing decision. Unfortunately, in my case that altruistic gene is in dormant state so it's all about the taste and price rather than ethical considerations.

review/summary: Makes a Nice, Rich Cup of Coffee
review/text: Some reviewers say you can't teabag these pods, because the coffee will be week. However, if you put the pod in a cup, pour boiling water over it, then set a spoon on top of the pod, so it doesn't float to the top, leave it in the cup for about twenty seconds or so, then use two spoons and gently squeeze the pod over the coffee cup, voila, you get a nice, rich cup of coffee.

review/summary: Good coffee, but minus a point for lack of instructions.
review/text: I ordered this coffee not knowing it was for a Senseo coffee maker.  I brewed it like tea with the written side down in cup.  The pod floated to the top of a coffee mug with hot water in it.  I waited for about 5 minutes, then I used a spoon to purge the pod against the inside of the cup.  I like strong coffee.  I left the pod in.  I sipped it and it tasted very fresh.  Not bitter. I am enjoying these pods, even though I am using them "wrong".  I would buy these again, since I love coffee, but hate the mess with the grounds.  Plus it is mellow coffee. I think the price is right.

review/summary: mild but rich
review/text: Not much of a description on the box and no instructions, but it's pretty much a tea bag that says this side down.  Let it brew in really hot water for 5 minutes and squeeze it out real good and presto you have easy to make single serve coffee.  I can't see any reason to put it in a coffee maker...total waste of electricity.  It is mild but strong enough in my humble opinion, but I hate starbucks coffee because it tastes too strong and burnt to me.  If you like your coffee dark and strong enough to stand a horse shoe in it straight up this may be too boring for you.

review/summary: I Love The Message!
review/text: I had never heard for Marley's Coffee before, so as the was reading all of the information on the box, the last thing I looked at was the top of the box, to find out that the Marley is as in Bob Marley!<br /><br />Upon first looking at the box, the first thing I noticed was how the perimeter of the box reminded me of Christmas, with the red, green and gold colors.<br /><br />I especially loved what I saw written on the back of the box.  It really seems to come from the heart.<br /><br />It says "That pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial.  They know where their beans come from, and how they are grown.  The coffee is 100% arabica beans.  This coffee is made in small batches, roasted and bagged on demand to ensure freshness".<br /><br />This coffee is organic and fair trade, which are two issues very close to my heart, and I wholeheartedly believe in supporting both of those issues.<br /><br />This coffee is called One Love.  It's supposed to be exotic floral and berry.  I did not taste either of those notes, but to be fair, I really do prefer flavored coffees over non- flavored, so it's not that this coffee tastes bad, because it doesn't, it's just not the kind of coffee in flavor that I prefer, because it really is not flavored, at least not to me. Maybe your taste buds may be different than mine.<br /><br />Maybe you are one of those people who prefer unflavored coffees who really would enjoy purchasing this coffee.<br /><br />If I were just going to buy this coffee because I like it's message and what it stands for, without a second thought I would definitely purchase this coffee, but if I were only going to buy it based on flavor alone, I probably would not purchase it.  It's really just a personal preference.<br /><br />I wish I loved the coffee as much as the message.<br /><br />I hope you will!<br /><br />What really touched my heart was the last paragraph on the back of the box. "We believe that the proper place for children is on the playground, not the workplace".  I wish every country felt that way, but unfortunately doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs.  The program is called Kicks For Cause Foundation.<br /><br />On the top of the box where you can see a small photo of Bob Marley, the coffee was founded to honor his father.<br /><br />That he came from farmland in Nine Mile?  There he learned to have deep respect for nature and humanity that helped guide his life.  I second that thought!  To me they are one in the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I enjoyed reading what I read on the box more than I did actually drinking the enclosed coffee, which the box inside the box there are 15 individually wrapped coffee pods.  I had alittle hard time opening the first pod from the the packaging.<br /><br />There is also a Best Before sticker on the back of the box.<br /><br />If you prefer unflavored coffee, and want to support a good cause with an excellent message behind it, this coffee may just be the kind of coffee that you are looking for.

review/summary: Darn good coffee, but don't "teabag" it!
review/text: I've seen some reviews for these coffee "pods" where people say they used the pod like a teabag, just throwing it into a cup, pouring boiling water over it and letting it steep for a while. Those reviews usually also complain that their coffee is too weak.<br /><br />The coffee is weak because "teabagging" with these pods just doesn't work, in my experience. You need to use a pod coffee brewer, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XYLAA">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup Stay or Go POD Brewer</a>, or, if you feel like spending a lot of money, maybe the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00580QKVK">SunCafe Coffee Pod Brewer</a>. Personally, since I don't own one of these brewers and I didn't know that "teabagging" doesn't work until I tried it, I ended up tearing open the pods and emptying them into my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z48XZ0">Frieling Coffee-for-One Filter</a>. (Putting an unopened pod into the coffee-for-one filter didn't work either.) The packaging of this product really ought to include some instructions about how to (and how not to) use it.<br /><br />Once I started brewing it correctly, I really liked the flavor of this coffee. I like yirgacheffe coffees in general, and this is a good one. It's a rich, fairly dark roast, with some nice earthy and berry flavors to it.

review/text: I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say. The coffee inside was good, as well.<br /><br />However, to break it down -- it was one of the smoothest coffees I've ever had, like drinking silk. The flavor was mild, pleasant, but for me, the taste was too bland, did not stand out. Perhaps another way of putting it is to say the coffee was thin and therefore, not ultimately satisfying. I do feel there are others, though, who would appreciate a coffee lite.

review/text: I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though.

review/text: As in, I think I need to double the amount of coffee I use per cup, then the next cup is pretty darn good.<br /><br />I like a coffee that has a bold but not burnt flavor.  Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.  But for a lifelong coffee drinker, it lacks the kind of body you can stand a spoon up in, the flavor that leaves you knowing you've just drank parts cleaner, and caffeine that has your molars humming.  But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.  Not bad, not exceptional, but would make for a good, routine morning coffee.<br /><br />I'll keep experimenting with my remaining stock of Marley.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court

review/text: It's about time that coffee takes the road of tea and become more user friendly. The battle between pods/bags/filters has been firmly for filters in the past few years. Can this product sway the battle?<br /><br />Sadly, it only produces a mediocre cup of coffee. The 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, produced under free trade and in an organic environment, should have a bold robust flavor. Maybe it is the bags themselves or the beans but the flavor was thin enough to be overpowered by minimal amounts of sugar or milk.<br /><br />That being said, on the road, it's not a bad cup of joe. 4 stars for portability and ease of use.

I think that, at best, this is an average cup of coffee. P-)

In fact, I've had cheap instant coffee that taste better.<br /><br />I use my pod  for a quick cup or take them with me when I'm traveling, so I don't expect the product to taste like my fresh ground brewed coffee. But I do expect flavor. The flavor of this coffee was similar to re-used grounds.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality about this  Marley product is that it is a free-trade, organic product.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the left-over packages because I don't want to insult guests by serving it. It seems a waste to just throw it away.  Maybe I can use it in the garden.

review/summary: Not quite strong enough
review/text: I gave this product only three stars simply because the coffee was not quite strong enough for my taste.  My usual morning coffee consists of a stronger brew, and this particular product did not give me a strong enough coffee.  The coffee has a couple of redeeming qualities, first it is a fair trade coffee, which I really appreciate.  Secondly, the coffee comes in very convenient single serve packs, which make brewing coffee very simple and fast in the morning.  The single serve packs were also a disadvantage for the coffee because you could not adjust the brew strength of the coffee.  I found that when I made my coffee in the morning, using my normal proceedures that the coffee was not strong enough once I added the cream and sugar to the coffee.<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee was palatable, if you are a person that likes a light roast, or a light brew.  If that is the type of brew that you are after, this is an excellent coffee for you, personally however I found the coffee a bit too light for my taste.

I use one scoop of coffee with my Bodum French press every morning.<br /><br />So how did this coffee fare? Very well. I didn't find it too weak nor two strong. Very robust, not harsh. I don't think I'd recommend buying it if you have to cut open the pods and pour out the coffee the way I did, but you can buy the One Love Whole Bean Organic coffee from their website and grind it yourself. However, if you do have a pod brewer, then I'd recommend the pod version here without any reservation, because this is very good coffee.

If you happen to be a fan of this particular Ethiopian bean and you want to support the cause, then Marley Coffee is the coffee for you. Incidentally, the package design is gorgeous.

It tasted fine, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say, I did not find myself shaking from a caffeine let-down later after drinking it, so thankfully it's not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees I've tried.<br /><br />I realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine, but I wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug - I simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water.  I had rich, dark coffee with very little fuss.

review/text: Love, love, love!  The smell of the coffee packs!  When I got this and opened it, honestly, the aroma was just so amazing, it is one of the best smelling coffees I have ever smelled!<br /><br />  If only that taste transferred over....  Unfortunately, when I actually made the coffee, it wasn't extremely flavorful, not was it as dark and rich as I would have hoped.  In fact, it taste a little more like nutty coffee flavored tea, which isn't bad, I love tea!  But if I was coffee, I usually want something that taste strong.  I have had plenty of non-expresso coffees that are rich and almost thick, but this is not one of them.<br /><br />  It is a good light coffee, I suppose if you don't want something too strong, maybe to have with some cookies or muffins at tea time (not a lot of Americans have tea time, but if you do...), it is a nice coffee for that, since it is not too overpowering, it works well in that way.<br /><br />  As long as, when you get this, you know its not a super rich, strong coffee, I think you will enjoy it, its just all about expectations.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

I was quite excited to give Marley Coffee a try but found that a name can't make up for a yucky cup.<br /><br />As lovely as the idea behind this particular line of coffees is I found it lacked the body I look for in a cup of coffee. That said the taste was so pleasant and delicate I actually tossed a couple of the pods into my tea pot and used them like tea bags. The result was actually delicious but far more tea-like than I would pay for in a coffee pod.<br /><br />If you enjoy lighter roasts or prefer tea I would definitely recommend the One Love Organic Coffee pods. Otherwise I would suggest a pass.

Unfortunately, that was not apparent at the time of my selection, and I just thought they were tea bag type coffee-bags. I have also learned that my taste in coffee is WILDLY different than most others, or at least it would seem. I have since tried to brew it in my Keurig (anothers recommendation that I read on a message string) and found it came out pretty good still. I still give it 4 stars, and I still think it wasn't bad at all, in spite of using it the wrong ways. :-)<br /><br />This is so strong that I could almost make an entire pot of coffee with one bag. I love it. A little goes a long way for me. I also like the tea bag type of brewing. Keeps everything clean and good tasting. This is great for those lazy days when you just want to boil water and have a coffee. If you like your coffee really strong, put one in a mug and you will have one VERY strong cup of coffee. If not, make a small pot and you will also be very pleased. I really didn't know what to expect. I remember trying something similar a long time ago with an instant type of coffee and it was terrible. This is much better than I expected. I also think this offers a good value. Try it, you'll probably like it.

I expected this to be a medium roast, good for variety, but it's really a very light roast. There are some nice berry notes in the bean, but the coffee flavor is just too weak.<br /><br />It also brews up too weak.

review/text: Coffee for me is a necesity now. Because of that, combining with availability at different moments, I have developed a broad palette.<br />I also pretend to be hip sometimes and opt for LOFT("local", "organic", "fair trade") and eclectic. So this one - organic artisan roasted Ethiopian yirgacheffe - seems to fit the profile quite nicely.<br />After figetting with the pod and the holder for quite a few minutes and finding that this pod is about twice the weight of Senseo pods, yet it would not fit snuggly into the double holder, I tentatively plugged it down with the single pod holder into the Senseo machine and made a 8oz cup.<br />The taste was bold but not bitter (maybe slightly bitter, but quite enjoyable). However the nose or the smell made me hesitate - it was too earthy, almost herbal medicine like.<br />I left the half drink cup there.<br />As I went about my day, I remembered one of the best cup of joe that I've ever had was boiled under open fire in a copper pot, not even a percolator, just a regular old copper pot, where you have to drain the dregs.<br />So I went back and heated up the now cold cup and drank it up. It was fine - I guess the nose was no longer strong.<br />So I decided to make a new cup and try again. The taste is still very good, and now I think I am getting used to the nose.<br />Now I have used up 9 pods and I am liking it more.

review/summary: I don't have a taste for it but maybe you will
review/text: I don't have a Keurig coffeemaker which I think this product is made for.  However I was able to simply cut the bags open and put them in my normal coffeemaker filter and make coffee that way.  I found that this coffee tastes slightly bitter to me, and not as hearty as the Java Delight coffee I have been used to.  I can't speak for other coffee drinkers though - I am not an aficionado of coffee.  All I know is what I like and perhaps you may have a different opinion.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: Aroma was awesome. As far as the taste goes, I definitely got the berry note. I was not as taken by the strength of the blend.  Mild to bland would be my comment there. All in all, it was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. From two to three stars based on the aromatherapy of the experience. Mild to non-existent aftertaste.<br /><br />That said, if you LIKE milder, blander coffees, this might fill the bill. I just expected a heartier coffee.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

review/text: This coffee smelled great, but the taste was less impressive.  It wasn't that the coffee was too bitter or strong, it was that the taste was sort of blah.  There was nothing remarkable about the flavor, it really was quite boring, if one can call a coffee boring.  This coffee would do the job in the morning if I didn't have any better stuff to drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.  It's just not very flavorful.  If it tasted like it smelled it would have been so much better.

review/summary: A bit acidic, but great flavor!
review/text: This coffee is a great way to start your day! I read a few other reviews that said it was weak.  Perhaps some of that is machine? We use a Keurig and empty each packet into our re-usable filter.  My husband says it's about as strong as his other "medium/bold" roasts, but with a better flavor.  I would agree with that - the flavor is better than most coffees, and I can drink it with my regular 2 creams, which I can't do with "bold" coffees.  I only knocked off one star because of the price.  I can get 15 of these for ten bucks, or 50 of the Donut Shop Brand for thirty bucks.  If it were a little more comparable, I'd probably be willing to spend a little more for something both my husband and I really enjoy.  As it is, we will stick with a slightly more economical brand and this might be a "treat".  :-)

review/summary: You Can't Hammer with a Nail with a Screwdriver ...
review/text: ... well, actually you can but the results will be something less than stellar.  Well, imagine someone did that and then complained about the quality of the nails they received.  That is what is happening with some (but not all) of the bad reviews here.<br /><br />Coffee pods are made for coffee pod machines.  They are not made for use as "teabags with coffee" and they are not meant for Keuring machines.  If you put Keurig cup inside a regualar drip coffee maker, would you expect coffee to come out the other end?<br /><br />Now for those who have a Keurig machine and bought these, there is a solution.  If you have one of the cartridges that allow you to use loose coffee, for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>, then you can cut off one end of the pod and use the coffee.  This will give the product as intended.<br /><br />With that out of the way, let's turn to the product if you use it as intened or the "Keurig workaround" I illustrated above.<br /><br />Each pod comes individually foil wrapped for freshness.  When you open it, you are hit by the smell of strong coffee - perhaps even to the point of being pungent.  When brewed, however, it is strong but not overpowering and actually has a surprising sweetness to it one would not have expected from the aroma.  This is not a coffee that would appeal to those used to the mass produced variety or those who prefer a mild brew.  It is fairly strong and best savored rather than guzzled.  Overall, a solid coffee experience.

review/text: I like good coffee and when I find it I stick with it.  Nonetheless, when a chance comes along to try something different, I'm willing to give it a try.  When I got the samples from Marley Coffee, my first reaction was the socially responsible credos listed on the box.  Nothing wrong with that but if the coffee isn't good, the good deeds don't matter to me.  After tasting it, I found that the coffee IS good.  The blend I received was "Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe" and it is very enjoyable.  The coffee is packaged in individually sealed coffee in their own filter packets.  Having an ample supply at home of other good coffee (and after enjoying a weekend of Marley Coffee) I decided that this was the coffee to take on the road.  I have been using motel coffee makers for years with the ground coffee I took with my wife and I.  We even bring our own measuring spoons and filters.  Alas, the motel coffee-makers have shrunk in size and I can't make a good job of making my own coffee.  These packets are just the right size for those dinky coffee-makers so I'm taking Marley Coffee on the road.  In fact, I did just that last weekend.  I even threw an extra packet in my coat pocket.  Good thing too because I had put the other packets in a different bag which left me with the local mediocrity.  Why the long story?  Well, the quality of coffee was the difference of night and day and I made sure I now have ample packets in all my travel bags.  It's that good.

review/summary: GREAT coffee in a self-contain package
review/text: I love a good cup of coffee but hate to brew a pot or even brew one cup in a pot.  Marley Coffee gives me the option I have been looking for.  Coffee in a bag - you know, like a tea bag!  The coffee comes in a 15 single serve pods.<br /><br />While the box doesn't state that it is to be used in a one cup brewer or as a "tea bag", I tried it both ways.  It brews a great cup of coffee either way.  In fact, I brewed the bag in a one cup brewer first and then saved it for the next day.  I then tried it as a "tea bag" and even having been used previously, it brewed a great cup of coffee, dark and rich.<br /><br />I normally put milk/cream in my coffee but I found I liked it black.  WOW!  Even my picky husband liked the taste.<br /><br />I did note the box mentioned KICKS FOR CAUSE FOUNDATION.  It is nice to see a company care about our children.  They believe children should be able to be children so they started this soccer program.  Good for them.<br /><br />Good coffee and a children's program sponsor all in one product!  Go for it!

review/summary: I am picky about my coffee but this is good stuff
review/text: This was the first time that I had tried any Marley Coffee but I really like it. It is certainly a high quality coffee and has an excellent flavor. I am a little picky about my coffee and usually stick to Starbucks Sumatra or Caff&eacute; Verona because I enjoy bolder and more flavorful coffee. Marley Coffee One Love blend is every bit as good as my favorite coffee and I really enjoy it. There are 15 single serve pods in this package and each pod is packed with plenty of coffee so it makes a great tasting cup of coffee. The pods and individually wrapped in foil so they stay very fresh and it makes them easy to store and carry with you.<br /><br />These pods are for a pod brewer not to be mistaken for a Keurig, Tassimo, CBTL or any other type of single serve coffee maker. I have noticed that some people are saying that these pods make week coffee and that just shouldn't be the case at all. They might be using them incorrectly or in the wrong type of machine if that is the case. The pods also tell you which side is up so maybe if you brew it backwards then it might make a difference but I honestly haven't tried it that way.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I must have somehow "missed" that this was designed for a pod brewing system.  I thought that these were just individual brew bags.  I am not sure exactly what pod brewer these were designed for, but I was pretty sure that these were not going to work in my Keurig, so I decided to go ahead and try to use it as a brewing bag anyway.<br /><br />I filled a microwave safe cup with water, and put the packet in the water.  At this point it is important to note that there are no directions on either the box or each packet.  So, I was pretty much winging it.  I put the cup (with the coffee packet in it) in the microwave for about 3 minutes.  I knew this would make it very hot, so that it could continue to steep/brew as it cooled down.<br /><br />After about five minutes, I took the packed and squeezed the excess water out.  The cup of coffee looked robust, with a dark brown color and a nice smooth scent.  This was my first experience with Yirgacheffe, and while it tasted good, I did not taste any of the berry or floral notes that the description mentions.<br /><br />So all in all, a decent cup of coffee, but there are much better brews out there.

review/text: I love coffee and I start my day with it and I drink half a pot in the evenings too.  So I was excited to try this blend but it was not as exciting as the description on their website. The scent was fragrant and inviting but the taste fell flat. After drinking 3 cups I think it is a bit bitter and it has an aftertaste with no hint of the "floral notes and reveals hints of blueberry, cocoa and spice. This well-rounded coffee features a bright acidity. One Love tantalizes your palate, and leaves a profound cherry finish" as described by their enthusiastic marketing department.  Try Komodo Dragon by Starbucks instead. Bob Marley needs to stick with his day job.

The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with "exotic floral and berry beans" I can't really recommend it too much.

review/text: I have a Gevalia pod coffee maker with 6, 8 and 12oz. cup choices. Most of the pods I try need two pods for any size larger than 6oz. This makes a robust but not better 12 oz cup. And to boot it's cheaper than the other pod coffee brands. The senseo pods  are useless if you want a man sized mug. At the price of most pod coffees {$12.99 to $19.99) using two pods per cup is not cost efficient. I only wish Marley Coffee had more blends to choose from.

review/summary: Coffee  ***UPDATE*** added
review/text: I love coffee, and a particular fantasy of mine would be to go to all these exotic places, make friends with the natives, tour their coffee plantations, sample their wares, and pack my bags with a supply of their goods.  (Of course, I would pay them dearly for their goods and services.)<br /><br />Since I can't go to any of these places, I have to settle for imported coffee.  This box of coffee is "Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe", "ethically farmed-artisan roasted", and is also fair trade certified and USDA approved.<br /><br />This particular coffee that I am reviewing is "exotic floral and berry".  This particular box has 15 individual, individually-wrapped (that's the part I like!) servings.<br /><br />I made this coffee this morning, and I love it.  It isn't very strong, so it might not be for everyone.  (Sometimes coffee is just too strong.)  I plan on making more of this coffee later today.<br /><br />I currently don't have an Espresso machine in my kitchen, but I hope to one day have one.  Whenever that time comes, I look forward to the day that I can make cappuccinos and other exotic coffee drinks with all these exotic coffees.<br /><br />UDDATE Sunday, April 15, 2012:  I did make more coffee last night (the coffee was so good - who could resist?); however, that was a big mistake.  I did not go to bed until early this morning; consequently, I slept late, missed church, and the day was ruined.  (I will go to church tonight.)  The caffiene must have been strong.  From now on, I will only drink this coffee in the morning.  I sure wish I had of had this coffee back when I was in the Army and had to pull all-night duty.

review/text: I am convinced that fair trade, organic food is best for us, the planet and our neighbors. So when I saw this option for coffee I was eager to give it a go as good organic coffee is rare. This is a good, but not great, option.<br /><br />I found that most of the time I would get either too weak or too strong coffee. If I went with one package it was too weak. Two packages was too much. I couldn't find the sweet spot. With the packets being pre-packaged you would think the amount would be just right.<br /><br />Incidentally, the packets are hard to open. I don't know if I got a pack of glitched packets but mine did not have notches in them. This didn't affect my score.<br /><br />Overall, if you can get the right mix it is still organic, free trade coffee and I'll take it any day over the stuff from the big manufacturers. But I was hoping for an easier just-strong-enough experience.

So when I saw this coffee came in pods, I decided to try it since I haven't found any other competitors for Senseo.  Unfortunately, this was just bad.  When I opened the pouch, it smelled bitter.  When he brewed a cup, it smelled and tasted burnt.  It wasn't weak, as some other reviewers have stated, but it tasted so bad he poured the rest of thecup down the drain.<br /><br />Obviously, any food item is a matter of individual taste.  However, this smelled bad to me (a non-coffee drinker who loves the smell of brewing coffee), and even flavored creamer couldn't make it palatable for my husband. The price is reasonable, but I just can't recommend it.

review/summary: Weak, tho tasty
review/text: I read some of the other reviews here and decided to try putting a pod in my espresso machine. Worked fine, except the coffee was not very dark. Then I took the pod and dropped it into the coffee to make it darker. Still weak. This is the same problem I have with all the pod/cup/premeasured coffees. While I do know people who drink coffee brewed like this, it's not strong enough for my taste, and I think most people's. The flavor is good, would be delicious if strong, so maybe next time I will use two pods. However, the price is kind of high if you have to use two pods per cup.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today, I tried using two pods and boiling them in a cup of water, thinking it might work for camping. Still weak. I think you'd need two pods and half a cup, 4oz or so. I noticed that the coffee does not taste full-bodied. It could be dried out from all the processing -- ground coffee should probably be stored in a packed brick, not individual, non-vacuum-packed packets. Oh well.

Then I tried squeezing each of the pods into my coffee cup which made it a tad better but still weak. I drank this coffee black which I rarely do but any creamer would have just ruined it.<br /><br />I also tried brewing it like a tea which just didn't work at all. Eventually I found a pod machine and it was weak just using one pod. After using about 7 pods to try out this coffee and get a desired result, I just gave up. I couldn't get the desired quality and as for taste, it's equivalent to something you'll find in McDonalds. I didn't get a hint of anything else.

One Love is smooth and mild with a nutty coffee flavor.  I keep a box of it at work since each pod is individually sealed in a foil pouch.  That way, when I just can't stand another cup of "work" coffee, I brew up a cup of One Love and become the envy of all my friends.

I heat water in a mug and then add one of these coffee pods and brew it like a tea bag. I also take a spoon and squeeze water through the pod while it brews in my cup to get a strong coffee out of it.<br /><br />Of all the different coffees I have had, like Dunkin Donuts, Green Mountain, Folgers, and so forth, the coffee this most reminds me of is Starbucks. It is not exactly the same, but I would think someone who likes Starbucks roasts would probably enjoy this.<br /><br />I like the nice box and especially that each coffee pod is individually wrapped to keep them fresh.

review/summary: LOVE IT
review/text: The Marley coffee is the best aroma and taste. It provides a true coffee experience that lets you know this is special. Myself and family work long hours, so this is our reward every morning and evening. I provide my co-workers and clients the same Marley coffee with its 5 star experience.

review/summary: rich and fresh
review/text: I usually like to grind my own beans but tried this because I had it once before and because it's organic. I tried it a few months ago and only had one cup and was pretty sure I liked it and wanted to confirm.<br /><br />I got this to use in my Cuisinart that is made for keurig k cups - I cut open the pods and poured the coffee into my set reusable kcup. Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.<br /><br />I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot. I find it a challenge to find a bold coffee that I like that isn't bitter/acidic, so was pleasantly surprised with this. I would probably buy again if I could use pods directly or if I could get whole beans.

review/summary: Dark and Rich and Very Good
review/text: I drink two cups of coffee each morning and I make them with a pod brewer. I used to drink more. I'd make a pot of coffee in the morning and drink it all day. Sometimes I'd do two pots. It seemed that just the thought of that coffee waiting for me was all it took to get me out into the kitchen and pour another cup. The pod brewer was the answer. Now I make a cup when I get up and have my second cup with breakfast.<br /><br />I do have several different kinds of coffee, but after having tried this, I've been mostly sticking with it, because it's dark and rich and very good with kind of an earth taste that I really like.<br /><br />In fact this coffee is so good that sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes, I'll take a third cup upstairs with me to my home office. If you haven't tried this, I think you should. I think you'll like it.

review/summary: Great Coffee but please stop smoking and put some instructions on the box!
review/text: Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee makes a tasty cup of coffee.  However, I have to say that nowhere on the box, or the individual packets, are instructions for actually making the coffee.  Also it doesn't tell you what type of coffee maker to use or even how much water to use for each packet.  I use K-cups and my daughter uses T-cups.  I had to make this product in my old automatic drip coffee maker, and I had to guess on how much water to use.  Once I was able to make a cup, it was very good.

review/summary: Convenient, portable, good flavor
review/text: Since these packs are individually sealed, you can carry it with you wherever you are, and it stays fresh. And all you need is hot water. No filters, no apparatus required. It is great for traveling.<br /><br />And because it's in a bag, you can regulate the strength. Just pull the bag out when it's as strong as you like.<br /><br />The only thing I can think of to improve it would be a string, like they do with tea bags, so you could remove the bag from the cup without a spoon.

review/summary: Great Organic Coffee with a Rich, Bold Taste
review/text: Marley Coffee's Exotic Floral and Berry "One Love" organic medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a great organic coffee with a rich, bold taste. I haven't tried anything remotely like it; it is definitely addictive. I tend to drink coffee that's heavily diluted with water and have found that the one serving coffee brewing bag can yield two full cups of coffee. However, please note that this is my particular take on drinking it; others may wish instead, a much stronger brew.

review/summary: Much Love for it
review/text: I am using a Senseo machine so this was a nice product to use it with.<br />The box is large and has a slot you can open at the bottom to get one bag at a time, like a dispenser.<br />The bags are individually wrapped in sealed envelops which can be a pain in a neck to tear open.<br />Taste wise, this coffee is the best testing I have ever tried with my Senseo machine.<br />On a side note, the coffee beans are not Jamaicans but Ethiopians. It is 100% Arabica.<br /><br />Every bag is thicker than the norm so it is large enough for a double coffee.

review/summary: Really nice flavor!
review/text: First of all, these are 1 cup pods.  It does not make a full pot.<br /><br />That being said, I made a pot at work to share with my co-workers.  I had to open about 5 of the pods to make the pot, but it did work well.<br /><br />The reactions of the 8 people who tried it were as follows:<br /><br />2 of us gave it a 10<br />1 woman gave it a 9<br />1 woman gave it a 8-8 1/2<br />1 woman gave it a 7 as it had a good beat & was easy to dance to.<br />1 woman gave it a 4<br />1 woman gave it a 2 as she didn't like the aroma<br />1 woman gave it a 1, not liking the aroma & thought it had an aftertaste.<br /><br />And I might add that we did play a Bob Marley cd while drinking.<br /><br />I will continue to drink this coffee as I enjoy the smooth, bright taste.<br /><br />Thank you.<br />MEF

review/summary: Pricey, But Delicious
review/text: These are pods, designed to be used in a single-cup brewing system made for pods.  I don't have one of those expensive, pod-using, coffeemakers.  I do have a single mug coffeemaker, which I normally fill with water using the provided fourteen ounce mug.  For the purposes of this product, I tried just putting in a cup (8 oz) of water, and placing the pod in the basket.  This produced a weak, undrinkable liquid.  The second time, I filled the pot with 8 oz. again.  I cut open two of the pods and put the coffee in the usual No. 2 filter.  This produced a very strong, but very delicious cup of coffee.  I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.  Filling the one-cup coffeemaker with the usual full mug of water and the contents of two opened pods makes a slightly weaker but still very full-bodied, rich coffee.

review/summary: Brew seems a bit weak for my tastes
review/text: I evaluated this coffee blend while travelling.  Most hotel rooms come equipped with single-brew coffee makers, do this product received a thorough testing.<br /><br />My first impression is that this blend is a bit weak; in fact, a good coffee bite was obtained with about a 50% reuction in water used.<br /><br />Flavor was merely OK.  I wouldn't go out of the way to purchase more examples of Marley.

review/summary: Love It. Smooth, Not Bitter, Wonderful Taste!
review/text: I have been using a Tassimo brewer like this one made by Bosch for several years now. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W3V88W">Bosch TAS1000UC Tassimo Single-Serve Coffee Brewer, Anthracite</a> . I purchased mine from Tassimo Direct online. Gevalia, Starbucks, HAG,  and several other brands were my main brews. I love the convenience of the Tassimo system and easy cleanup. However, after drinking this Marley Coffee, I am now rethinking how I brew coffee. The Tassimo takes up a fair amount of counter space. You have to use the Tassimo disc coffee packs and they are limited in choices. I wish this Marley coffee came in Tassimo discs. I love it.<br /><br />I am now thinking that I will simplify my coffee station by getting rid of the Tassimo and using a french press or this Aerobie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>. Not only can I get everything off the counter and store it in my cabinets, but I can also use any kind of coffee I want. I have an instant hot water unit that is supplied filtered water from a sediment and carbon block filter. I also already have a spinning blade coffee grinder. So I think I am going to purchase the Aerobie brewer and open up one of the Marley pods and give it a try.

review/summary: Great Full Body Taste
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee and tea everyday, my normal brand is Gevalia Limited Edition but I like trying different brands when the mood strikes me, as it did here.<br /><br />I don't have one of these machines that uses the pods but my normal use machine is the Keurig and I personally fill the K-Cups with which ever coffee I'm in the mood for, and it was simple to empty one of these pods into my re-usable K-Cups and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I'd read the different reviews and the opinions were all over the place and I think it had to do with the preparation that each person used. I decided on the Keurig because I just wanted a single cup this afternoon but in the future I will brew several cups using the French Press (LOVE! the Richness with the press)<br /><br />But enough about the style of the maker and back to the matter at hand, the coffee!<br /><br />It's a delightful, full and rich tasting coffee and I will be enjoying it and I'll be ordering more because it's great stuff.<br /><br />It's a joy to find a coffee this good because most leave a lot to be desired.

review/summary: tasty coffee, with additional novelty value
review/text: These coffee pods are probably intended for use in one of the  single serve  coffee machines. There were no instructions anywhere, they do have "This side down" on the pod but there was nothing on the box, outer pouch  or in the product description that indicated that the pods were not  the (identically appearing) coffee pods that are directly immersed in water.<br /><br /> You cannot  use them successfully just by putting them in a drip filter and pouring water through because the water flows through too swiftly. I was able to get  very nice coffee with these pods  by putting them in the cup of hot water and bobbing the pod up and down to keep the water flowing through the pod and the natural oils from settling on the grounds. It did not take long to brew.<br /> The coffee made this way was good tasting, reasonably strong but not overwhelming and somewhat sweet. The coffee was  does not have much caffeine. This would not be  the cup to have when you really need a stiff jolt  to wake you up. This is definitely a coffee I could drink at night without having any problems getting to sleep.<br /><br />Marley One Love Coffee pods are elegantly packaged in cream colored mylar pouches with red green and gold accents. There are images of Bob Marley and the Ethiopian Lion on the package and pouches. These would almost be  worth it for the conversational value of the package alone. Everyone who came into the kitchen and saw the box was enthralled. Everyone who tried the coffee enjoyed it.<br />I do not have a single serve  coffee maker so I cannot tell you  how well the pods work in a coffee maker.<br /><br />.

review/summary: Fresh Great Taste
review/text: I am a tea lover and am not really a coffee drinker.  However, the new single serve pods of Marley Coffee caught my attention.  I really enjoyed this coffee.  It had a fresh great taste that was not over powering or too strong like some coffee can be.  It can be consumed black or with sweetners...it was great both ways.  As I drank my cups and read the box...I was pleased to learn that farm workers are treated ethically and that partial proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org).  If you enjoy coffee, then you must try this 100% Arabica coffee bean/Artisan Roasted. Uhm Uhm Good!

review/summary: Great Aroma; Mild Taste
review/text: Marley Coffee comes with no directions on the package, only the statement that it's single serving. It doesn't state what system of coffee brewing this was manufactured for.  The aroma is wonderful, however, I'd describe the coffee as mild not medium roast.  I was, therefore, disappointed in the flavor. Perhaps if it was brewed in a cone system or similar, I might have had a stronger result.
