review/summary: not really a dark roast
review/text: I don't really understand why this coffee is so popular.  I like dark, extra bold roasts such as Black Tiger, Emeril's, and GM Double Black Diamond.  However, this coffee tastes to me much more like a medium roast, has a bitter aftertaste and is not very flavorful. If you like dark roasts, I don't think this will be one of your favorites.  However, it has a lot of positive reviews all over the place.  I ordered it twice from two different sites (Keurig and Amazon) to be really sure that I did not just receive a bad batch, but I will not be ordering it again.

review/text: I ordered this solely on the reviews but found this very muddy and bitter. I do, however, question the freshness of the cups. Both boxes cups were "puffed up" They looked like they were about to explode?? Have never seen that before. I like Coffee People's Doughnut Shop, if that gives you an idea of my taste.

review/summary: Very Disappointed in the Flavor
review/text: Totally do not like the flavor of this coffee on it's own. It smells great when you first puncture the k-cup, but then it's all down hill from there.  It's fruity, no nuttiness at all, with a strange aftertaste, and kind of weak on a 6oz brew.  It works fine with a cocoa for a mocha, but not good at all by itself.  This is coming from someone who likes the "Dark Magic" and "Double Black Diamond" k-cups.

review/summary: Too Weak!!!!!!!!
review/text: My wife is the coffee drinker in the house and we have tried many BOLD blends over the last couple of years. She found the Tullys Italian Roast to be far too weak even on the lowest Kureg setting. The only one we have found that meets her standards is Timothy's Parisian Nights. If you like a nice bold cup of Joe then she would recomend the Timothy's hands down. Amazon no longer sells the Timothy's by auto shipment so we had to go to the Green Mountain website and get the auto shipment there. Good luck

review/summary: Italian roast - just how i like it
review/text: After years of drink the same old Folgers drip coffee a group of us decided to purchase a Keurig unit for our office.  When any one of us purchase a pack of K-Cups we often share with other so that we can find our favorite, and not spend on those that just are not up to par.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Italian roast, and the people that I shared it with said they did too.  So far, out of the ten or so K-Cup "flavors" that I have tried this is my favorite.  Being that it is a "bold" coffee - I can change the cup volume setting of my Keurig unit to alter the boldness...a larger setting yields a slightly less bold cup, and the smaller cup setting will increase the boldness of the taste.  Of course you can do this with any coffee, this coffee seems to fit the boldness range that i desire.

review/summary: This is "the one"
review/text: I have been taste-testing so many brands and roasts of k-cups to determine our favorites that I feel like a 'lab rat.'  The Tully's Italian Roast immediately stood out from the rest--love at first sip! The other reviews are accurate by describing it as aromatic, smooth and flavorful, not bitter nor weak. I make my first cup of the morning by using one k-cup on the large cup setting, then I make my add'l cups of coffee using one k-cup and a combination of both the middle and smallest cup; that way I get more coffee using one K-cup. It still holds a robust flavor but just not as heavily as the first, which is what I like to do after drinking sev'l cups.  I use cream & sugar, so this routine works for me.  You may or may not tend to tweak your ritual the same way, but it just goes to show you that you can "think out of the k-cup."

review/text: My first "pod" coffeemaker was a Senseo, now relegated to the garage. Limited coffee options. Weak tasting coffee. Bought the Keurig based on Amazon reviews and liked it from the first. Now I love it, because I found a dark, deeply satisfying roast that makes my day. Full on coffeehouse flavor with no bitter aftertaste. It's one of three featured varieties in our office-- Timothy's Breakfast Blend, Coffee People Black Tiger, and Tully's Italian Roast. We have all three on subscription and they're a hit with both staff and client partners. BTW, my personal choice is almost always this one.

review/summary: Tully's DEFECTIVE K-cups
review/text: You should stop selling these DEFECTIVE Tully's products!<br /><br />I bought 2 packages of Tully's Italian Roast K-cups (48 cups) on July 20, 2011. I quickly discovered that all were defective. The airtight seal on each and every K-cup was broken and, when put into the Keurig coffeemaker, it spilled coffee grounds into both the coffee and the machine.<br /><br />I contacted Tully's customer service line, explained what'd happened and they couldn't have been more rude, condescending and unhelpful. They refused to send a refund or coupon through Amazon (to eventually credit my account) unless I sent these two boxes back and they inspected them. By the time these were opened a month later, the Amazon packing was long gone and these crappy K-cups were despoiling our pantry. My wife tossed them in disgust.<br /><br />Our first and last purchase from Tully's. Shame on them for such lousy customer service and for failing to stand by their products!.

review/summary: A little weak....
review/text: I'm an avid drinker of bold coffees...Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Timothy's Midnight Magic are my two favorites.  I love to sample new flavors.  I tried Tully's Sampler which included Italian Roast, French Roast, Kona and House.  In the sampler package I found the Italian to be the strongest and most flavorful with French Roast a close second. I could get a nice bold flavor with the largest cup setting on my Kuerig.  Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.  I could still get a bold cup but only using the medium setting on my Keurig.  If you like a bold coffee and have family members who prefer medium roast I'd suggest the sampler rather than 2x24 count Italian Roast.  You'll get House and Kona which are both very medium along with two good strong/bold flavorful brews in the French and Italian.

I counted the k-cups (only due to the way they were packaged) and the order is short 3 pieces.  The contents were only 47 pieces.  I contacted the seller but got no response.  I will update as this evolves.

review/summary: Almost my favorite K Cup
review/text: I still think that the Keurig idea is the best thing for coffee since the grinder. I have had my problems mechanically with the machines but I put up with them because of the good coffee I can get and Keurig does a great job with customer service in my experience. I've been buying Tully's Itailian Roast for quite a while now and love it's full flaver and aroma. In fact I pretty much only buy Tully brand coffee now. I love the Kona blend and that is my favorite right now although I still haven't tried all the ones I'd like to try. It is of course especially good when Amazon puts the Italian Roast on sale because then I really stock up. Try it, you'll like it!!

review/text: Do Not purchase these! 90% of the cups burst spilling grounds into the mug. I called the Company directly they really had no cares. They told me to contact Amazon to send them back. Amazon does not accept food product returns. Amazon was great enough to refund this portion of my order. I will not buy these ever again. I sent Tully's an email expressing my displeasure and I have not heard back from them.

review/summary: Excellent coffee, bad k-cups
review/text: The coffee tastes great.  It's bold enough flavor wise without any bitterness.  However, we have an explosion with about every other k-cup.  The foil seal on the top breaks and coffee and grounds spew out the top.  Wouldn't be surprised if shipping in the summer heat weakened the adhesive that seals the foil.  I'd buy it again because I like the coffee so much, but be prepared to clean up messes if you get a batch of k-cups like we did.

review/summary: Good Morning Cup
review/text: Love my Keurig Coffee Maker for convenience, but hard pressed to find a K-Cup that is strong enough for my first morning cup without a bitter taste.  Tully's Italian does the job.  I drink my coffee black and like a rich coffee taste, Tully's Italian does the job. Shipment arrived promptly in good condition, although the packing box was damaged, torn and crushed.  A book was packed on the bottom without padding and was badly bruised and rumpled, but the coffee came through okay.  I complained to Amazon but never heard back from them with a sorry or offer to replace the book even though I explained it had been purchased for a gift and was now unfit to use as such.  I explained it was a poor job of packaging a soft cover book, since there was no padding or buffer under or around the book and it was jammed into the bottom of the box -- Amazon never responds to complaints about damaged goods.

review/summary: WOW! I can taste the difference
review/text: First of all- I am not a sophisticated coffee connoisseur.<br /><br />I actually think that McDonald's coffee is far more drinkable than Starbuck's burnt rubbish.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as K-Cups, I used to buy "Timothys" and it met my needs.<br /><br />But when I tried Tully's Italian blend for first time today, wow!!- this is very appealing and is so easy to drink. Just the right strength and kick.<br /><br />I noticed that the lids on the k-cups I received today (May 7th) from Tully bulged out quite a bit - clearly they have packed a lot of N2 in these cups. Expiry date is Dec 2010.<br /><br />I recall Timothy's cups do not bulge out as much - but I did not check how far those were from expiry dates.<br /><br />I do not know if the "bulge" out factor impacts coffee taste or freshness but perhaps it helps if you plan to store the K-cups for a long time.

review/text: I love Italian roast coffee.  While this is not the "best" cup of coffee I've ever had it is very good for a Keurig cup.  The roast is nice and dark, but no bitter aftertaste, and does not have the almost burnt taste of some dark roast K-cups I've had.  It still has a robust flavor when you use it to brew the largest size.  This is a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Tully's.....the best!
review/text: I have been drinking tully's for a while now and I have finally taken the time to type a review. If you are looking for a strong, yet smooth and refined coffee this is it! It is not bitter nor does it leave an after-taste. I have turned so many of my friends and family on to it, that they only drink this brand themselves; many of them switching over to a Keurig just for it. I am an extreme coffee drinker and have experienced the bitter and waterty varieties of coffee, so I know bad coffee when I taste it. Tully's is my favorite coffee and is absolutely the best I have tried and the only kind I will buy.

I've tried a huge variety of them, and many of them taste harsh, acidic, and straight out of 7-11 (I'm looking at you, Green Mountain). This coffee has a rich flavor with a hint of sweetness and none of the bitterness going down. I could not recommend it more. This morning I felt compelled to write a review on these simply because I woke up actually looking forward to drinking Tully's Italian Roast vs sleeping in. Italian Roast got me out of bed, folks, and that's hard to do on a Thursday at 6AM.

There is just something great about the aroma and taste of this Italian Roast. As mush as I didn't want to give any of mine away, I wanted others to try it and hear if they agree and THEY DID. I had everyone asking where I bought it so they could get their own.  Now I am out and need to buy more.  I thought it would be no big deal b/c I have more of another brand to drink, but it's just not the same, coffee in the morning can make your day and if it's not the right one....well, you know. I will continue to buy Tully's Italian Roast and so will my friends and family whom have tried it.

review/text: The arrival of a K-cup coffee maker in our home has been somewhat controversial because we didn't brew a truly great cup of coffee for several weeks after we got it. We kept working through samples of different flavors, and finally found this.  To be honest, I still don't think it's truly great -- not as good as what we were able to make before w/a conventional drip coffee maker or French Press -- but it's pretty darn good.  But measured against the rest of the field, it's the best we've tried, thus the high rating.

review/summary: Great coffee BAD containers!
review/text: We loved this coffee. The "K" containers they come in are AWFUL! Out of 14 boxes we have used 21 cups have leaked and spoiled the brewed coffee. Tullys did send us a  box to replace the cups from our 1st order of 4 boxes from Amazon. 3 of those containers leaked. We tried 2 local food stores for 6 boxes at various times and the cups in those leaked also.We have stopped using Tullys, we are sad. :(<br /><br />(the foil lids become detached from the container causing coffee grinds and water to leak out and into the coffee cup)

review/summary: Best Italian in K-Cups
review/text: I have tried all of the Italian K-Cups and this is by far the best. Great rich flavor. My only complaint is this brands K-Cups don't always deliver a full 8 or 10 ounces, it seems to either be how Tully prepares their cups or that the tops of some are flattened when they arrive via the mail.

review/text: I actually came to this coffee because Amazon took all my coffees off Subscribe and Save.  I actually like this coffee.  It's a good coffee for morning time.  I find the Breakfast blends to light for me and this one is a bit stronger.  Not a favorite of mine but is good enough to keep since it's still on Subscribe.

review/summary: My All-Time Favorite Tully's K-Cup Flavor!
review/text: I usually drink Tully's French or Kona, but decided to get this since I had seen some really good reviews on it. It seemed like a lot of people were buying it, so I wanted to find out why.<br /><br />It's great! Of course we all have different tastes and taste buds that we're dealing with, so my "Great" coffee may not be someone else's choice. However, it's GREAT!<br /><br />1) I love the taste!<br />2) I love the aroma!<br />3) I love the combination of the taste and aroma!<br /><br />I know that I'll be getting this one again and again.<br /><br />UPDATED 3-4-12 to say that this is my absolute favorite coffee. This is the one I always want to drink when given a choice. I try not to run out of it.

review/summary: Gluten-free Gnocchi
review/text: I mainly purchased this product because of its gluten-free qualities. I'm not an expert on Gnocchi, so I may not be giving it a fair shake. However, the consistency was mushy and a little grainy. I felt as though mashed potatoes would have been a far preferable choice for my dinner's gluten-free side dish.<br /><br />Also, beware that the product ships frozen and was half-thawed by the time it arrived at my house. This may have affected the quality of the final product.

review/summary: Really good gnocchi
review/text: Arrived frozen and as advertised. It is quite tasty. I can honestly say that the difference between gnocchi with wheat flour and without is almost negligible.<br /><br />Gluten-free gnocchi is surprisingly hard to find. Why does a pasta made from potato need to have wheat flour in it? The answer is simple: It DOESN'T!<br /><br />As a person with celiac, I am always looking for meal options and this is a definite regular in my household.

We also bought blue curly Kale from this company and they are also VERY fast germinating and healthy seedlings. All my other little plants are struggling to catch up... even those planted weeks before are sad by comparison. The neighbors are already lining up for their Brussels sprout plants. Great seeds!

review/text: This is hulled barley; the hull is left on and must cook longer than pearl barley, but the end result is better nutrition.  There are cooking directions on the package.<br /><br />However, for ten bucks... way too expensive.  The volume of 1 lb of hulled barley can fit into about one sandwich baggie.<br /><br />Though I have no complaints with the product, and a little bit of barley goes a long way.... at this price point, it is too expensive for me to order again.  There is better value elsewhere on amazon.com
