review/summary: hard to find made easy
review/text: Necta Sweet are easy to use artificial sweetener pills that taste like sweet n low, but without all the messy packaging.  I don't know why they are no longer in the grocery stores in California and I have been buying them when I visit my grandkids in Oregon and Florida.  I was out with no trips planned and on a whim thought I'd try Amazon.  I found just what I wanted and three days later the mail man delivered about a year's supply.  I am very happy with the service and will look here first next time.

review/summary: Great for coffee!
review/text: This is a wonderful product.  Have been diabetic for over 45 years now and have used this since it was first marketed.  I think it is better to use in coffee than any other diabetic sweetener.  Dissolves quickly, which was my pet peeve with other brand substitutes in pill form.  Try this for any drink requiring sweetener, it's great.

review/summary: Delicious but NOT organic
review/text: This is really tasty stuff, and I sure wish it were organic as stated in the product description above, but let's not confuse "natural" with organic. Organic means grown without chemical pesticides and grown without using genetically modified seeds. There is no guarantee that this is the case with "natural" products such as this and likely they could be GMO and sprayed with pesticides. If it were truly an organic product I would have given it 5 stars, and it certainly is priced like an organic product. Still, quality of ingredients aside, it is very yummy. But so is junk food.

review/summary: BEST SOUP EVER!
review/text: I used to buy Health Valley soups at Stop & Shop, when I had a car, but now I shop at the local market, where they sell the usual commercial garbage like Campbell and Progresso.  Health Valley is the closest I've come to truly fresh, homemade soup and it is worth every penny.  The Vegetable soup is my favorite.<br /><br />Because Stop & Shop doesn't provide Peapod service in my area, I've had the soup delivered to my door directly from Health Valley, Vitacost, or through Amazon.  Vitacost is the only store that lists all ingredients on their site and is willing to sell you as little as one can per order, and they used to take great care to deliver the product undented - unfortunately, that's no longer the case; cans arrive dented.  Being able to purchase a single can is good because you can sample different varieties in one shipment; and Vitacost sells at a discount.  At Health Valley, you have to purchase two cases of the same product at the list price, and at Amazon you need to purchase one case (12 cans/case) at a discount, and you get free shipping.  However, the Amazon cans arrive badly dented; some are in such bad shape that the electric can opener cannot handle them.

review/text: This dry cracker, which is something like a Jacob's cream cracker only with just that little bit better texture and flavor, is the best biscuit in the world for a snack or a mini meal. It's great with butter and vegemite; tomato and swiss cheese; mature cheddar and piccalilli; peanut paste; honey and jarlsberg. It's also a great substitute for toast with soup, or as an accompaniment to risotto. My favorite at work for morning tea.

Still not sure if the organic nuts vs. non-organic nuts will really make a big difference or not to our health?  The only real dissapointment was that you get much more "pieces" than you get "halves".  This is the key thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I by and large agree with the previous reviewer (A.M.). Personally I don't mind whether they're pieces or halves or fulls or whatever -- they're walnuts. You can use Amazon's "Subscribe & Save" to buy these at a slightly cheaper rate. You can always cancel the subscription at any time in the future *after* your first issue has been shipped. Given a subscription rate of $24.77 as of the date of this review, each ounce costs $1.03.<br /><br />While walnuts are excellent for health in moderation, do not overeat these! I suggest reading the Wikipedia article and the references listed there for more info. It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss this.<br /><br />Given the higher costs of organic walnuts, I wish someone could tell me definitively whether it is worthwhile to buy them over non-organic. For instance, a statement such as "Organic walnuts were measured to have xx% the pesticides of non-organic walnuts, and non-organic walnuts are naturally low/med/high in pesticides" would help greatly. Because walnuts have a hard shell, I suspect that organic really doesn't make that much of a difference, though I could be wrong.

review/summary: Confessions Of A Die-Hard Coffee Drinker
review/text: Good Earth Green Tea - Lemongrass 25 tea bags--<br /><br />No way, no how, was I ever going to be a tea drinker. Coffee was my perker-upper of choice, and loved every jittery cup of it. I still like my morning cup and the aroma of good coffee brewing in the morning. Whenever offered tea by friends I'd always decline - "coffee if you've got it please". I would settle for the last of a pot that had been heating for hours rather then try tea. So to say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant, or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. So when I say I Love This Tea - you can be sure that's the truth as well.<br /><br />It started with a coupon. It was a bargain to pick some up at my local market, and thought well, maybe I should have some on hand for all those tea lovers I know. Hearing so much about the benefits of green tea, I picked out a box of it and put it up on a shelf. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on this Good Earth Lemongrass. This one I loved.It was the best I tried. So naturally my next stop was here at Amazon. And naturally I found this great deal.<br /><br />The taste is wonderful and so is the aroma. Light and citrusy, but slightly sweet - not what I thought "lemongrass" would be.I didn't need to add anything at all. It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffe per serving. It gives me a renewed and refreshed energy in the afternoons without any jitteryness.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating - as coffee can be.Not to mention the other health benefits. According to the box, this blend is rich in antioxidants. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />Ingredients: Green Tea,Lemongrass,Natural Flavors,Rose petals and Peppermint.<br /><br />As I said, Amazon has the best deal. I bought the six pack of 25 bag boxes. One box comes out to be less then the 20 bag box sold at my market.It is also sold in multi packs of the 20 bag boxes here as well:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6SNQM">Good Earth Green Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count, Boxes (Pack of 6)  [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>].<br /><br />Oh and on the tag of each bag(which are slit to sit on the edge of the cup) are some delightful and inspiring quotations or proverbs that may start you out with a smile. Here are a couple of them I'll leave this review with:<br /><br />"You will never be alone with a poet in your pocket"...John Adams<br /><br />"Flowers leave some of their fragrance in the hand that bestows them"...Chinese Proverb<br /><br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie

If I had known about it long before, I might have avoided five years of a fight against the cancer that grew inside me.  However, once I started al the various treatments, I know that the drinking of the lemongrass tea was a major help in the battle. I am now free of cancer cells. I intend to keep on drinking the tea at least once a day if not more often as insurance so to speak...<br />I was very pleased to see this tea on amazon as it was getting difficult to find it.  I also notice that it is almost impossible to find Ginseng tea.  Amazon??help here please??

review/summary: the product HAS changed, not just the packaging
review/text: The new box says "NEW LOOK! same great taste!" and that is a patent lie.<br /><br />I have been drinking this tea for over 10 years.  The previous reviewer is right - the tea is different now.  I had some of the original/previous tea and then I got a big order of the new tea, and I tried them side by side.  They are similar, but the new stuff (in the dark purple box) is more overpowering and I actually disliked whatever new ingredient they added.  It was so terrible to smell and it also affected the taste of the tea.  I drank one glass and it was truly awful; I won't be drinking another.  So sad.<br /><br />This really ticks me off because the product has been perfect and consistent for the last 10+ years.  I noticed that there are fewer tea leaves in the individual bags as well (this was obvious to the naked eye, comparing with the previous tea bags), so it's not as potent as the original.  The old tea bags used to be generous in terms of how much tea was in each bag, and it made a perfect cup of tea.  The new ones are skimpy and one tea bag will not be enough.  That being said, the new flavor is so bad (to me) that I am going to have to give away the 6 boxes.

review/text: The lemongrass gives a natural sweetness so you barely need to add sweetner, if any at all. The flavor is hands down the best. Green teas don't usually have this kind of robust flavor without being overwhelming.

review/summary: stop complaining, it is what it is - COTTON CANDY
review/text: I understand that people are disappointed in the product, but there is no reason to give this a one star review.  I carry this in my store and it is a hit with the customers - even Hot Tamales fans like myself.  I agree that it isn't initially what you would expect from something titled "Hot Tamales cotton candy", it isn't spicy and has only a faint cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />However, I love it for that reason.  We carry the Mike & Ike cotton candy as well as the traditional circus colors and the stars and stripes kind.  The Hot Tamales cotton candy is great because it is a break from the fruity flavors.  I can taste the cinnamon, though very faint, but I love it!  And so do our customers, we sell a lot of it.<br /><br />The one star reviews are ridiculous.  As long as you know that it isn't a strong cinnamon flavor, what is there to complain about?  The cotton candy is fresh, super fluffy and tastes great.  Perhaps there is a flaw in the advertising, they should state that the flavor is not overpowering, but if you strip away the Hot Tamales brand and don't give anyone preconceived notions of what the exact taste is, this cotton candy is a hit.<br /><br />I would give it 4 out of 5 stars because a little more cinnamon would definitely be a plus, but I chose to gave it 5 to counter the other 2 overly negative reviews, because it is definitely not as terrible as the others are claiming.  Again, all of my video store customers love it and keep coming back for more.  Take a chance like I did and try it for yourself, after reading this review and choosing to buy it I doubt you will be disappointed.

review/summary: Does not taste like Hot Tamales Candy
review/text: This cotton candy tastes like plain sugar, like eating a spoonful straight from the sugar bowl. It does have that nice, melt-in-your-mouth texture that characterizes cotton candy. It is pink colored and has a very slight "warm" aftertaste. There is no cinnamon flavor or smell. It is quite disappointing when expecting the spicy taste of the chewy, oblong Hot Tamales candy. There is not even the traditional vanilla flavor that makes carnival and fairground cotton candy so tasty.<br /><br /> In contrast, Spun City Cotton Candy, sold on Amazon, is a delicious treat. Spun City Cotton Candy costs more, but it's made with superior ingredients and has very good flavor. Kid's will probably eat the Hot Tamale Cotton Candy and be happy, (it is almost pure sugar, after all) but to someone who wants a bit of taste in the mix, this one is likely to be a letdown.

review/text: I was actually introduced to this by a cook where I work, and yes it has a very distinct flavor. Hawaiian style Teriyaki is much sweeter, less salty, and thicker than your average grocery store stuff, which is more like Japanese style. I used it to marinade chicken, and it was the deepest marinade that my friends and my mother had ever seen. I personally liked the flavor and like to pair it with ginger and pineapple. Perhaps it is because I was given a heads up that it would be different than what I was used to, but I thought it was pretty amazing and I plan to order some and give them to my family and friends who also like it.

review/text: This is different than the traditional teriyaki sauce but delicious. It's an absolutely great marinade. (It's better as a marinade; it can be used in the skillet but doesn't pair as well with vegetables in a stir-fry.<br /><br />Try it for pork tenderloin -- either whole, or cut into cubes for kabobs, or boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I cut them like chicken tenders, marinate, put on skewers, and grill. I've done this for camping, picnics, and parties on the deck. The adults and the kids loved it.<br /><br />Shop, put your meat(s)in zip lock bags, add some World Harbor Maui Mountain Teriyaki, then freeze. When you are looking for a quick and delicious dinner, thaw and grill. I serve it with rice (or yellow rice), a vegetable or salad, and fresh fruit for dessert (melon, pineapple, grapes or berries). (Nice with Pinot Grigio or a cocktail with an umbrella!) It's a summer winner. I've gotten many compliments and many requests for the recipe! The pineapple in the teriyaki sauce also helps to tenderize the meat.

review/summary: J1 Aloe Pulp Juice
review/text: I have always been interested in Aloe Vera, as it is so great on burns, and widely known for its digestive tract healing. I recently read an article about how aloe vera also removes inflamation in the body. I became more curious, BUT I never wanted to drink that thick gel I found in health food stores.<br />I found this product at Trader Joe's and tried it. Loved it so I went back to buy more, but they only had 3 bottles and decided to make it seasonal (according to a store employee). This meant I could not buy it until/if they brought it back.<br />I really wanted to continue with this product as I really liked the flavor and benefits.<br />It has such a clean and mild flavor, and helped with my inflamation (surgical area 3 years ago never quit being swollen- with in 2 days swelling was very much reduced. Is totally gone after several weeks).<br />I was really excited to find this product available at Amazon, since my Trader Joe's does not carry it anymore.The price is very comparable to Trader Joes, and I take advantage of shipping specials,to keep it with in my budget.<br />I think anyone that like a clean mild juice would like this product.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RN8H1S">J1 Aloe Pulp Juice, Original, With Vitamin C, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>

review/text: Jay One makes the best Aloe juice I have ever tasted. The pomegranate isn't the best, but the Mango is very nice just a little bit sweeter than the Aloe flavor. Best Flavor they make is the Aloe then the Mango and last the Pomegranate. It is questionable of how much aloe you should consume in a day. I used to drink 6 a day when I first found the product but I believe you should try to consume around 2-3 max daily because there is a good amount of sugar and just to make sure that there won't be any health concerns with the aloe consumption.

review/summary: Why this is the best drink ever.
review/text: Here's the best thing you can drink that's still unknown to the masses. It tastes phenomenal and is healthy at the same time. Aloe is great for digestion and can calm some serious problems. But you'll forget about that when you taste it. It's so light and healthy and crisp and natural and refreshing and perfect. No other drink lives up to those adjectives. The flavor is like a smooth white grape juice with some honey and aloe magic thrown in. I especially love it on a hot day. Yes, Aloe can be nasty by itself but with the right tweaks it's heavenly. I gave up soda decades ago, and this is the only thing I've ever wanted to drink like soda, for pleasure alone. It has some sweetness to it, but I disagree with a few others saying it's too sweet. I think it's spot on, and I'm sugar sensitive enough to not enjoy much candy or rich desserts. The aloe content is not chunky, but smooth. It comes from powdered aloe rather than actual aloe chunks in other drinks. But the benefits are still there. I would love to see this product be available everywhere as an alternative to sodas, especially if that means the price would become lower. I'm a foodie and consider this my greatest drink find of all time. Actually maybe it's better not to tell too many people. : ) Do a subscription to save, as you can cancel anytime. Cheers!

I opened a bottle of ice  cold juice and too a swig. It was much too sweet! Some people might like it, I would hasten to add, but not me. I prefer drinks to be light, refreshing and almost sweet free. This stuff is like drinking concentrated sugar water. Well, I looked at the ingredients and it contains sugar cane syrup and honey. No wonder! If sugars and calories (this bottle contains 220) are not a problem, then you might enjoy this drink.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Not What I Ordered
review/text: I have been drinking J1 Aloe Pulp Juice for months now.  In October Amazon ran short so I ordered from JVS ($79.04 vs $60.00 from Amazon).<br />I did not receive 24 bottles of J1, I received 24 bottles of JayOne Aloe Juice.<br />They do not taste the same.<br />J1 has the Superior Taste Award on its label, JayOne doesn't.<br />J1 is sweetened with Honey and Organic Cane Juice, JayOne isn't.<br />I am disappointed that JVS is misrepresenting their product.  These are not the only discrepancies, the vitamin contents are different as well as some other ingredients.<br />Believe me, they do not taste the same.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: Flavorful, mild curry. Rice is a little chewy, so I usually let it stew in it's cup an extra minute or two, or even shove it in a bowl and nuke it in the microwave for a minute at the end...and I often add extra vegetables, too. (Can you tell I eat this stuff at home, not at work?)

review/summary: Good combination of flavors and textures
review/text: This product is easy to prepare and did not create any surprises in the microwave when I followed the very precise directions.  Unlike a lot of instant products that are just zap and eat, this takes about 10 minutes to prepare.  The resulting combination of textures - brown rice, wild rice, crunchy nuts, soft cooked raisins - is very satisfying and interesting.  The flavors are good and the dish is filling.  The curry flavor was not pronounced and was obscured by the several other flavors in the dish competing for attention.  As others have noted, if you are thinking of this as a meal for one, think twice, since one serving is half the package and there's no easy way to make half.  If you consume the whole thing, it's 60 grams of carbohydrates and 300 pretty empty calories - filling but not necessarily nutritious.  Still, if you can fit 300 calories of mostly starch into your menu, the taste and texture won't disappoint.

review/summary: i love love love love this curry
review/text: I have purchased many of Dr. McDougalls microwavable ramen type cups. This has jumped up to my favorite. The texture of this pilaf is lovely. The raisins and nuts add such a wonderful feel with the rice. I add some extra curry to mine but I do not think there is anything wrong with the way it comes. You can not go wrong with only 3 grams of fat for the entired thing. I usually bring some extra veggies or two pieces of fruit with me to make this a more complete meal but you could cook this then put it in a real bowel with tofu(im a vegan) or meat if you choose, bring a salad or it might be enough for you all by itself. I just love the flavor of this. It can get a little messy if you do not watch it in the microwave because all microwaves are not made the same so times will be off. I will be getting this again for sure. I would recommend this to anyone.

review/text: I've bought this soup multiple times, as well as Nile brand soup and other McDougal soups.  The trick is to cook it for 60 seconds, let it rest, cook another 60 seconds after that.  I do find these soups boil over if cooking straight through.<br /><br />When I go on trips, I take the soup out of the container and put in a ziplock bag, then toss in my suitcase with one microwaveable bowl.  The packaging is mostly air inside.  So I can get a lot of soup in a small space doing it this way, control my calories, and know I'm getting something mostly healthy, other than the salt.

review/summary: Great instant for the office
review/text: A mild curry rice with some nice sweetness from raisins and some crunch from almonds.  Several green peas and dried carrots also visible.  Rice has a nice chewy texture, love the chewy bits of wild rice.  Perfect amount of sodium for me - 26% of your daily recommended in one cup.  But if this is a meal, that seems perfectly acceptable.<br /><br />Nice portion size too: about two cups' worth.<br /><br />VERY happy to have a easy meal/snack like this that doesn't rely on beans but rather a starch.  I wish there were more instant rice/grain pilafs like this around!<br /><br />Will order again.

review/text: The Black Bean soup is very good and even better the next day. The Split Pea was also quite good. The Vegan Curry is not really a soup but a nice rice dish. They are very easy to make but I recomend heating them longer than the directions recomend and instead of the suggested 8 minutes steeping time you wait a bit longer for the beans to soften.<br />It is a good instant soup but if you reheat it the next day it's a great instant soup that is actually quite filling. The price is fair and delivery was quick. I would recomend this product to lazy people who like good soup, like me.<br /><br />I will buy this product again.<br />Dean

review/text: I'm not vegan but I thought I'd try this because it's all-natural, I love curry and I love ramen-style products for snacks. The fruit in it actually goes quite well with the rest of the ingredients, but the rice does tend to need a bit longer than the recommended 8 mins, otherwise it's chewy. Also - make sure you stir well or the you'll get a big ol' glob of salty seasoning. I do agree with another review that the salt could be toned down a bit.

review/text: This meal is tasty, filling and quite healthy. The berries really compliment the crunchy spice of the rice. HOWEVER, it is not as easy to take this "on-the-go" as you might think. The water needs to be boiling BEFORE it's added to the pilaf, so you need another container to heat the water in. Not always easy to find when you're taking this meal to go. I have found it works well to use hot water from a water cooler or coffee pot.

Our natural coconut milk now has guar gum in it, plus unspecified emulsifiers and stabilizers. We did not order it like that, and unfortunately, the canner not only changed the formula and the ingredients, they took the word "Natural" out of the "Natural Coconut Milk" description. They made some other changes to the ingredients and nutritional information as well - all without telling us in advance they were doing that. The Light Coconut Milk has been changed as well. If they had told us in advance, we would have said "No Thanks" and found a different canner. So we are back to producing our original formula natural coconut milk, with no guar gum and no emulsifiers and no stabilizers...but it will be about 60 days before the "same old" product is back on store shelves.<br /><br />Also, I have emailed Cohen at the Natural Value site and he answered as follows:<br /><br />Amazon pulled the coconut milk at my request and told me they may not bring it back...it's going to be "up to you" to ask for it. We're looking at about 45 days.<br /><br />So, if you want Amazon to carry it (the original formula) again, please email them and tell them!!<br /><br />Doreen
