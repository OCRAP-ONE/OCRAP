review/summary: Great Rootbeer, but watch the shipping amount....
review/text: My husband is a HUGE Root beer fan. So, I got him this for Christmas. The Root beer was good. But, with shipping it comes to A LOT of money. After I ordered I found out you can actually get all of these brands at Cost Plus for much cheaper. Since you don't have to pay for shipping.

review/text: Not something you want to do often, due to the price of shipping heavy glass bottles, but the root beer was all very good and it was nice trying some other brands. None that were so outstanding I would seek them out again, but all of them better than the everyday crap like A&W / Barqs, etc. Sadly, not all of the root beers in this set were using pure sugar, but your mileage may vary as it appears to be a random selection.

review/summary: For what it's worth -- more chocolate than macadamia
review/text: My brother once gave me a box of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts which he picked up on a trip to Hawaii and I became an instant fan.  Two things that I love mixed together -- how great is that?  I don't really need all the sugar in chocolate, however, so when I saw this Mauna Loa (excellent macadamias) sugar-free variety, I had to try them.<br /><br />At 15g of sugar-alcohols in only 6 pieces, if you are sensitive to them, you might want to pass.<br /><br />The chocolate is quite good -- smooth, sweet and doesn't taste artificially sweetened.  And the macadamias -- well, it's hard to say.  They are either using very small macadamias or only pieces of macadamias because the pieces are small.  That means, unlike the ones I have had in the past, the chocolate coating is a much higher percentage of the whole and, in fact, there isn't much macadamia flavor there at all, just the crunch.  I struggled hard with how to rate them.  On the one hand, it is hard to find fault with something for tasting like good chocolate but, besides the fact that there should be more, the price is a lot higher than it would be for just chocolate.  I did find that if one allows the chocolate to melt in one's mouth until the nut is pretty much bare, one can enjoy both flavors but it really needs a much higher nut-to-chocolate ratio.  In the end I only dropped one star and noted the problem in the title but I came very close to dropping two stars.

review/text: This is very similar in flavor to a Japanese gum that tried on a trip 7 years ago.  I have been looking for this flavor in the US ever since.  It is a mint flavor and a bit on the sweet side - but not overly sweet.  The gum stays soft and chewy for a very long time.  The color choice is a bit odd - it is a dark grey, almost black, but doesn't leave any color in your mouth.

review/summary: Purchase already crumbled cereal for less $
review/text: The original thought was nice - a high tea at home with friends and an impressive tin of French Tea biscuits; now imagine the thought of watching from your airline seat while the luggage handlers drive over your luggage with the baggage cart and tow motor- several times!  The latter image is reality when you buy these tins for $35 per tin, plus FedEx shipping.  It was unrealistic to expect thin dry cookies to travel the world, across the US, stored in countless warehouses, handled by brutes of all persuasion, and literally dropped at my front door, and arrive fresh, whole, intact, and delicious just in time for high tea.

review/summary: I love Almonds and chocolate
review/text: So this was a great purchase. I like the fact that instead of one solid bar it now comes in two pieces [inside the same wrapper] which makes it easier to share if you wish to do so.<br />The candy wrapper has also changed. The new wrapper will keep moisture from getting in and help the candy to stay fresher longer. You can tell when chocolate isn't fresh because it will have a white film on it. This means that certain ingredients in the chocolate have separated thus giving it that unappetizing appearance, and the candy will taste chalky. Yuck.<br />Now if you're thinking about eating this instead of the regular Snickers with peanuts because you are allergic to peanuts....DON'T....since both are made in the same factory there is a good chance that it might have come in contact with peanuts.<br />The candy is also a great price when compared to what they sell for here in Michigan; plus you can't beat the free shipping.

I opened one more box, and it did have all 24.<br /><br />I guess the machine packing it malfunctioned, but it should have been weighed and the discrepancy caught before being shipped from the company, IMHO.

review/summary: I Love Love Love These
review/text: I Love Love Love these. I have been ordering and eating them since Thanksgiving, or whenever it was that I first discovered them...it was about that time. Somewhere between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Anyway, they kept being available, so I kept ordering them. They got a stale in March, but until then had been just fine. In May they were pretty crumbly. Now it is the end of June. Sadly, they no longer have any taste and when I open one of the little bags they are packaged in, the crumbs fly everywhere. So they were a wonderful treat for 6 or more months. I look forward to next season when I shall start ordering them again. But for this year, this is my final batch.<br /><br />You may have guessed. I LOVE PUMPKIN POT TARTS! I purely love everything PUMPKIN. I think, next to strawberry ice cream, it is my favorite thing in the whole world--at at least when it comes to dessert type things. I can't imagine how many preservatives they must put in these to make them edible from November until July! But, preservatives or not, I shall eat them.<br /><br />On the whole, I totally reccommend these, but not after July of any given year. After that, no taste and a bag of crumbs. But, if you are like I am, and are a Pumpkin Pot Tart addict, then these are great. Go for them!

I would reccomend not getting this type of matcha at all, that's not to say I don't like this tea, I love it, that's why I ordered the medium size one. If I had to rate this tea from one to ten, this would be in the three to four range.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical forking out so much money for this type of tea since I was well aware of the quality it could be and as well as 'fake' or lower grades being sold for good quality matcha. I downright would prefer the lose leaf tea over this.

review/text: Nostalgia ruled and from far away I ordered a selection of all my childhood memories; Bakewell Tarts, Crunchies, Aeros, Maltesers, Cadbury Flakes,Fray Bentos Steak & Kidney Pies, Kendal Mint Cake....and Mr Kipling Lemon Slices.<br /><br />All went well to start with; the order was confirmed and the goods delivered on schedule to the courier service in the USA that was to relay them on to me in Latin America and then, within days, they arrived to my impatient arms. So far so good, but not for too long.<br /><br />The chocolate goods provided the first signs of trouble. You know the problem, the chocolate colour had changed to a milky white and the chocolate flavour insipid to say the least. Was this a sign the chocolate products were old, or was it the result of delivery problems (bad packaging)? Difficult to say, but examination of the other products suggested an answer to this question.<br /><br />On looking more closely I noticed the expiry date for the Lemon Slices had already expired 10 days ago by the time I received them. Much the same for the Bakewell Tarts which had also expired 4 days later. Opting for the most urgent priority I quickly gobbled the Lemon Slices and, to my surprise, found them highly acceptable, my childhood memories reassured. I may suffer tomorrow from an overdose of Lemon Slices, we shall see, and then afterwards an attack on the Bakewell Tarts.<br /><br />But I really do think more attention should be given to the "expiry dates", especially in the case of long distance deliveries.

review/text: We've found so many ways to enjoy these Sun-Dried Tomato sausages - for us they've proved to be the most versatile of all the Aidells sausages we've tried.<br /><br />  They're a nice complemnt to breakfast eggs or pancakes because while the flavor is tasty it is still mild enough  not to do battle with eggs.  The bits of  tomato add a freshness that is very nice in  the a.m.<br /><br />  Many of  our pasta dishes have been topped with this sausage, which again blends so well with whatever other additions to the sauce whether  it be anchovies or zesty seasonings.  It's  lovely with  our favorite bean soup as well as a favorite chicken soup.<br /><br />  We especially appreciate Aidells including the recipe for Pasta with Sun-Dried Tomato with  Mozzarella Cheese Sausage on the inside of the package wrap.  One more  way to enjoy!<br /><br />  - Gail Cooke

review/summary: Amazing grace...errr... taste!
review/text: Fast delivery and I have to say, even if it took awhile to receive then these sausages would be well worth the wait!<br /><br />Easily cooked in microwave (cover first!) or in the oven. We like ours fried up in the pan.<br /><br />The juices just ooze out and the smell is heavenly - hence "amazing grace" - my whole house filled up with the rich aroma of the sausage and my neighbors commented on it later in the week.<br /><br />They're a little on the pricey side but well worth it.

review/summary: Highly addictive, but sugar alcohol side effects
review/text: This is one of the best tasting protein bars in existence, I kid you not.<br /><br />The interior is fluffy, practically like the inside of one of those peanut butter easter eggs.  The chocolate coating is just ok, and tends to melt in anything other than cool temperatures.<br /><br />The downer is that the main sweetener is malitol, which causes seriously stinky gas if you are sensitive to it.  It IS a natural sweetener, but that doesn't mean it's all good....

review/summary: Great Bar!
review/text: Though it's now out of vogue, I'm still a fan of a healthy version of the low carb Atkins style diet.  This is the perfect meal bar for that diet (probably great for South Beach, too).  It is delicious, the peanut butter is creamy, and the chocolate on the outside is superb.  I've used the Atkins bars for years, and they taste of chemicals and artificial sweetners.  These Think Think bars, though, are practically candy bars.  They have low net carbs (2 for this version, I think).  Even when I'm not dieting, I still love this bar.  It isn't a large, filling bar, and I can't really eat one to replace a meal, but if you're looking for a snack to cut between meals, or just a desert to eat with a nice cup of coffee at night, this is the bar for you.<br /><br />This price on Amazon can't be beat, either.  I pay about $1.7 per bar at Trader Joes, 2.20 a bar at the local megamart (when they have them in stock), and only about a buck fifty here on Amazon.  Great deal.  I was kind of sketchy ordering food online (though I order everything eles online), but Amazon grocery proved me wrong.  Give 'em a try.

review/summary: I normally love these but...WHAT did Amazon do to them???
review/text: I often buy these singly from my grocery store, and I really love them as a meal replacement, so I was excited to see that I could order them for such a good price per bar on Amazon.  After I opened the first one, however, I wasn't quite so happy.  The chocolate coating was white and waxy looking, and the bar itself tasted dried out (definately not fresh-tasting).  They are within the sell-by date, so something must have happened to them in storage.  I had 2 day shipping and the days during that time were very cool -- not warm enough to melt anything. :(  I would have ordered these on a regular basis if they had been like the ones in the grocery store.  I guess you get what you pay for!

review/summary: Sadly, Amazon is not the place to buy this bar
review/text: I went against the poor reviews when I ordered this product for two reasons: 1)These bars have always been good when I purchased them from local grocery stores and 2)I believed Amazon would have gotten any issues resolved since the time the poor reviews were written. While I don't know what the reason for the problem is, I can indeed report on my own observation. On all of the bars, the chocolate coating looks like it disolved away, leaving behind a grainy and off putting exterior. The taste of the peanut butter bar is nothing like the bars I've purchased elsewhere...these tasted medicinal, stale, and just plain bad. Other Think Thin Bars I've purchased from Amazon are perfect but this one missed the mark by a galaxy.

review/text: I absolutely love these bars BUT...the last few shipments from Amazon had very poor quality bars.  The first couple boxes I ordered were fresh and the chocolate coating was delicious.  The last couple shipments tasted awful!!! I think there may be some sort of storage or shipping problem.(Amazon did attempt to fix the problem by sending out a new box at no charge but the second box was the same as the first!)  But when delivered fresh, they are yummy!!  Creamy and chocolaty...very very tasty!!

review/text: I could not believe it when i tasted a think thin bar for the first time. These are delicious, high in protein and NO sugar! They taste fantastic, although I have read a few reviews that say the amazon ones came grey and taste gross. SO if you have never tried these, maybe you should buy ONE first. (they have them at Fred Meyer). And if you do order them off amazon, they should not be grey. It should look like chocolate!

review/text: I love these bars and eat them every morning before the gym. I ordered them on the internet to try and save some money and I either got 2 packages of old bars or they were melted previously and then got hard again. The chocolate on the outside of the bar did not taste the same nor did the peanut butter on the inside. I am still giving it 5 stars because the normal taste of these bars is excellent but I am extremely disappointed by the 2 boxes I received by mail. I learned my lesson and will continue to buy them at Wegmans where I have found they are actually the same price but they are always fresh.

review/summary: My favorite thinkThin bar
review/text: I love these best of all the thinkThin Protein Bar flavors that I've tried (Chunky Peanut Butter, White Chocolate, Tangerine Cremesicle, Chocolate Brownie Crunch, and Chocolate Espresso). I like all of them a lot, with the exception of the Chocolate Espresso, which seemed kind of dry, crumbly and not that flavorful to me. The Creamy Peanut Butter has a nice, smooth and creamy texture, and a sweet, but not too sweet, flavor. I like better than the Chunky Peanut Butter (which isn't bad) because of the smooth and creamy texture---a bit like comparing smooth and chunky peanut butter, but not exactly. Somehow it just works better in creamy form.<br /><br />I order these bars quite often via subscription and would say about 1 in every 5 or 6 boxes has the same issue that others have complained about with storage/overheating. It's not ideal, of course, but they are still edible and cheaper than buying as singles in a grocery store, so I continue to get them. It would be nice if Amazon could resolve the issue though.<br /><br />I first tried these bars as part of a low carb diet I was doing. They are SOOO much better than the Atkins Protein Bars that I found in a drugstore, which tasted so chemical and unwholesome. No comparison. They are so good, in fact, that I have to be careful not to eat too many because then, they don't really help for dieting purposes!

review/text: I find this a very convenient way to get protein when I'm out and about and unsure where I could get a healthy gluten free snack. Not the best tasting, but it's not terrible. I've tried the creamy peanut and the white chocolate chip. I would order them again because it's good to have a healthy go-to food when you have Celiac and don't want to get accidentally glutened. They keep well in the bottom of my purse.

review/summary: Ok if you need gluten free, otherwise I would pass
review/text: I bought a couple boxes of these (Creamy Peanut Butter) when Amazon had them on their gold box deals.  I was looking for a protein bar to use after strength training workouts and thought I would give these a try after seeing some reviews.  Wow, I am surprised these get as high of reviews as they do.  Don't get me wrong, these bars have a place for those who need gluten-free or for those looking for a meal replacement and don't want to feel hungry, but if you are looking for a protein bar, there are much better choices out there that taste 20 times better.  I'm guessing there are also better tasting bars out there for meal replacement, but I haven't been in search of that so don't know.<br /><br />These bars are somewhat waxy on the outside (faux chocolate seems like), but I was willing to overlook this as a lot of protein bars on the market suffer from a similar fate.  It didn't help that these had overheated at some point in Amazon's hands and the outside was chalky but other than looks, this didn't matter so much.  The inside of this bar, well.....it just leaves a funky after taste (distinctly whey protein).  It wasn't different than the protein bars I had tried five years ago, but it's nowhere near some of the other protein bars on the market.  I didn't find the bar disgusting although I've seen reviews on the Internet where many people couldn't eat them.  I could eat it without thinking it was horrible, but I found at times that I just keep eating and eating and the bar never disappeared...seemed a chore to keep eating.  It is an extremely filling bar thus why I recommend possibly for meal replacement.  Since it has 230 calories, it was a little too much for me to eat as a post workout snack.  I have found that I can buy Pure Protein bars that have the same amount of protein and range from 180 to 200 calories however they are slightly smaller bars (1.76oz).  The taste of the Pure Protein peanut bars is the closest thing I've tasted to an actual candy bar without a lot of sugar (they have 2g).  I find it hard to believe people say the ThinkThin Creamy Peanut Butter bars are like a candy bar....wow, I think perhaps people need to try some other bars for comparison because you don't really know what to expect until you've tried a few others.<br /><br />If you need gluten-free or are looking for a meal replacement, these are ok, but I think you can do better with other products.  I'm looking forward to finishing up my last box of these so I can start eating my Pure Protein Revolution Chocolate Peanut Caramel bars and actual enjoy eating them and get less calories with the same amount of protein.

review/summary: Terrible taste...
review/text: I'm not sure if I got one of the bad ones people have been talking about or not, but this bar tasted terrible. (Note: I didn't get it from Amazon, so this review has nothing to do with Amazon's distribution process, just the taste of this product.) I picked one up at the grocery store mostly because I was extremely curious how they have "milk chocolate" and "peanut butter" while also having "0g sugar." Peanuts have naturally occurring sugar in them (generally a few grams per serving), and milk chocolate usually contains large amounts of sugar as well (although it is not necessary by definition). Well, when I opened it there was a small amount of white powdery buildup on the outside of the bar, mostly on the vertical side of one end of the bar. I broke off a piece and the inside seemed a bit moist, which was reassuring. The bar is essentially a full solid (fairly thin) chocolate shell around a homogeneous filling of orange-colored peanut-smelling material. However, the bar tastes terrible. I got some cocoa flavors (_not_ chocolate) on the tongue to start, immediately followed by a very strange nutty flavor from the inside filling - I suppose it was peanuts, but wasn't clearly recognizable as such. What was recognizable, however, was the lack of sugar - it didn't taste even the slightest bit sweet. The aftertaste was extremely long (I had to get a drink to wash the taste out of my mouth after a while), and tasted bitter, sour, and a tiny bit salty. Not enjoyable at all.<br /><br />Again, others have been complaining that some bars taste significantly worse than others due to possible mis-handling during the shipping process, so your mileage may vary.

review/text: I've bought these bars at Whole Foods and they taste great (for protein bars).  I ordered one package from Amazon and they were dry and the chocolate was all light in certain areas.  Some of the bars were ok, but there were definitely dried out nasty ones too.  No thanks Amazon, I'll stick to buying these at places that can store them properly.

review/summary: old waxy chocolate & stale from amazon
review/text: Yes- others have said it.  You can't buy these from Amazon.  I've gotten two shipments of 3 in which the chocolate was old and waxy.  Inedible.  Yuck!<br /><br />Much better if fresh from the grocery store!

review/summary: The One I Like
review/text: I've tried about a half dozen different ThinkThin Protein Bar flavors. But, this is the only one I consistently re-order. Some of their flavors are virtually inedible, either artificial-tasting or too sweet like a candy bar. This one is just right.<br /><br />It makes a great on-the-go breakfast for those early mornings when I don't have a chance to eat a real breakfast. One bar in the car plus a low-fat yogurt after I get to work, and I'm set until lunch.<br /><br />BTW, I've never had an issue with freshness, unlike a few other unlucky reviewers. But, I do notice that Amazon now shrink wraps the boxes in a thick green plastic. Perhaps this is as a response to complaints about stale product? It's been working, in my case.

review/summary: Ideal Protein Bar
review/text: This review is for any ThinkThin Protein Bar, but particularly for my favorite flavor, Creamy Peanut Butter, which is simply the best protein bar I have yet encountered. Its taste/texture, nutritional value, the amount of protein, and the size makes it an ideal snack and protein supplement. First and foremost, it is soft and delicious like a candy bar and does not taste rubbery or artificial like some of the other bars. It contains no sugar and has fairly little unnatural ingredients. I especially like the 20g protein in its small yet sufficient size as a supplemental bar in-between meals.<br /><br />I have ordered this product for a long time, and the only drawback I see for ThinkThin Protein Bar-Creamy Peanut Butter is that it goes out of stock often, and as a result the price fluctuates. I hope Amazon can stock up because on top of my regular subscription, I will be asking for extra, extra shipments!<br /><br />In summary, I would highly recommend this bar to anyone on the go who needs some extra boost to get through the day, without the help of traditional fast/junk food.

review/text: Really a bad tasting bar.  True, it has a lot less sugar than a ProMax bar, but it really tastes awful.  You have to wash this down with a lot of water just to finish it.  I prefer Pure Protein chocolate bars to these, and I think most people would too.  Truly an awful tasting bar.

review/summary: It's not the same
review/text: Think Thin has changed their packaging (no big deal) and unfortunately their bars (big deal). I don't believe the quality problem was due to shipping as I have ordered through Amazon before and been very pleased with the product. On this occasion, the bars were chalky and dry and maybe it's my imagination but I didn't feel they tasted like that last year (old packaging). I will not order Think Thin Creamy Peanut Butter again... but I may give Chunky Peanut Butter another shot.

review/summary: Wish I had not ignored the reviews of this product!
review/text: Before purchasing these bars through Amazon, I read through nearly every review and took note of the many complaints about the weird appearance and texture.  I have always been so impressed with Amazon Grocery and the quality of all the products I receive and, despite the "bad press", I just took a chance that maybe my shipment would be different.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I should not have ignored the reviews! I usually purchase my bars in the grocery store and they are always moist and creamy (and delicious) but these bars are literally disgusting. They have the appearance of being melted or frozen and thawed, maybe?  There is a white film on them and the paper is actually hard to peel off.  Not only that but the corners are hard and the texture is just disturbing.  I am so glad I got these on sale and I will definitely not be purchasing these through Amazon again.  I really hope Amazon will take a look at these reviews and work to remedy the problem.  Guess it's back to the grocery store for me!  Potential purchasers of these through Amazon - take heed of the warnings from buyers!  These bars are normally delicious but Amazon managed to ruin them!

review/summary: Think Thin Peanut Butter
review/text: I like that Think Thin makes many flavors for their gluten free high protein bars. This bar tastes okay. I was hoping for a peanut butter cup taste as other people had described. I didn't get that taste. The one thing I do not like is the chemical aftertaste I get. But, I know this is what all bars of this type taste like. The bars are also really sweet. It takes me about 45 minutes to finish eating one. I have to wash it down with coffee or water. But all the bars are really sweet. I wish they were more natural in ingredients.  I probably won't buy them again unless they are on sale. I will stick to more natural protein snacks (nuts, meat, etc.) even if they are not as convenient.

review/summary: Love these bars, but NOT from this seller
review/text: I love love love these bars, but was VERY DISAPPOINTED when they arrived. The bars were NOT expired but had the appearance that they were. They are normally a nice smooth chocolately outside, but these looked charky and old. They did NOT taste the same at all! I ordered 2 boxes of the Creamy Peanut Butter because it is my favorite, but I will NOT order again from this seller. I asked some other people that eat these bars if that has every happened to theirs. I friend told me she had froze hers once and it looked like I described above. So I can assume they froze the bars hoping to preserve the freshness, but all it did was jepordize the great taste and appearance. My BIGGEST issue is I ordered 2 boxes about $30 and can't even return them because it is a food item. Lesson learned on my part, hope you will consider this next time you order. I also hope the seller will realize they CANNOT FREEZE this product!

I wasn't expecting a peanut butter cup, nor was this my first protein bar, but with all the good reviews? sometimes i think its just minions from the inside. don't be fooled i have a very broad palette and know a good product when i taste it, this isn't it.

Not great, but not terrible considering the nutrition breakdown of these bars is harder to find.<br /><br />Overall, these are tolerable if you are desperate for a decent snack. If you are tired of thick, chewy bars, by all means try these but they are definitely not "delicious" unless you're really hungry.

The first time I ate one I thought it was ok for a protein bar, but I haven't been able to eat another one. I hate wasting money so I'm trying to eat another one now, and it is taking me over 30 minutes!!  I will never buy this bar again.  It is disgusting!!  I have tried many protein bars in the past and this is by far one of the most disgusting even down to the texture.  Please don't waste your $$$ on this one.<br /><br />However, the mixed nut and white chocolate one is awesome!! I'm ordering more of those next week.

I get the gitters and feel awful after I eat one.  I have tried Atkin's products which also have the sugar alcohol and 3 net carbs.  I never get the gitters and it curbs my hunger.  In my opinion the Atkins taste 100 times better then the think thin bars.<br /><br />The Think Thin bars have 10 extra carbs then an Atkins bar.  They claim to be only 3 net carbs online but I think this is a lie.

If any one knows of a quality US, Canadian, or Western European hard candy with clean flavors which include Lime, Cherry, and Orange, please leave a comment letting me know about it, and where it might be available.  And, if you, like me, are seeking a source for same, Saf-T-Pops is not the answer.

review/summary: it's not salt - it's seasoning!
review/text: First off, this is not a salt substitute.  There is no burning flavor of potassium chloride here(which by the way, Doctors tell you not to consume).  This is a blend of light chiles and other spices which work best when cooked for longer intervals at slow heat.  Works fabulous on rotisserie meat and oven roasted vegetables.  I have been using this for years and my family very much enjoys the flavor. It has a southern blend of spices but not much in the way of heat.  If you need heat, add some cayenne.  If you really want to bring out the flavor put some vinegar in your dishes. Add to meats before cooking, add to vegetables and soup just before serving.

review/summary: Fills special need!
review/text: So happy to have found this product. I need to seriously eliminate salt and sodium from my diet and unlike all the other "no salt" seasonings on the market, this one adds good flavor and exceptional taste to everything WITHOUT the potassium that the others use in place of sodium.  The potassium is just as dangerous for my fragile kidney as the sodium.  Thanks Chef Prudomme!
