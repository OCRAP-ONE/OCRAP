review/summary: Best Deal for Tea Drinkers
review/text: Anyone that drinks tea a lot needs to look into subscription-based ordering.  You get the tea you love at a drastically reduced price.  This is the quality of Twinings at a price not even matched at stores like Sam's Club.  I'm on my 4th box of 300+ tea bags and look forward to my next 4 boxes.

review/text: I consume few cups of tea on daily basis. I consumed black tea for years but the taste is bitter.  Now I consume green tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WB1YSE">Kirkland Signature Ito En Matcha Blend (Green Tea), 100% Japanese Green Tea Leaves, 100 Tea Bags</a> with Twinings Earl Grey Tea for the additional taste which I enjoy very much. Both green and black teas contain fluoride, although green tea contains twice the amount found in black. If I have any cold or just do not feel well, I add some Cognac or Brandy to the mix and wolla, it is the best medicine out there for revitalization... Bravo.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: Early Grey tea has replaced coffee as my beverage of choice not only for breakfast, but throughout the day.  Twinings makes the best tea on the market and buying boxes in bulk at a discounted price is an awesome deal.  I make a large pot of tea first thing in the morning with one Earl Grey tea bag and one Irish Breakfast tea bag and generally have one or two cups with milk and stevia sweetener.  What I don't drink in the morning is poured into one of two glass containers and placed in the refrigerator, giving me cold tea every day for lunch or dinner.  I still on occasion buy bottled black tea but the tea I make is FAR superior.  Taken on its own Earl Grey can be quite a strong flavor, but mixed with Irish Breakfast tea and a bit of milk, it is ambrosia.  Try it, you might like it!

review/summary: Earl Grey on a budget
review/text: If you are on a tight budget, as I am, then I think this Earl Grey is fine. For the same price, I prefer Bigelow.  For Pete's sake, stay away from Lipton's black tea.  (I can't speak as to their green tea.) I used to drink Lipton tea as we get the bags free at work.  Once I tried Twinings and then Bigelow, there was no going back. The Lipton teas are bitter tasting in comparison.<br /><br />If you are able to splurge once in a while, try Mountain Rose Herbs brand of Earl Grey. The difference will blow you away.  The bergamot really stands out in this tea, I mean REALLY.  I haven't seen it offered online here at Amazon.  I had to order it directly from Mountain Rose and it was $11 for one pound plus shipping. The tea is organic, kosher and fair trade certified! Their website is here:[...]<br /><br />So, if you like Twinings, try Bigelow, which is the same price, but a tad better.  If you are able to splurge, try Mountain Rose...but be warned, it will spoil you for other teas forever.

review/text: I really like Eary Grey tea, and I've had some very good brands. However I have not found a better deal than this from Amazon.  Twenty-nine bucks for 6 big boxes includes shipping is better than anywhere online or locally.  The tea is good (but not the best I've ever had) and had a medium bergamot flavor.  I've only found stronger bergamot flavor in teas that cost many times more.  I'll save those for special occasions, and drink this for my daily "Earl Grey: Hot!"

review/summary: As good as I expected
review/text: Reading several reviews about this tea, complaining about the extremely mild taste almost made me not to buy this product. However, I did and I am not dissapointed. I used to drink this tea when I lived in Great Britain and the taste is almost the same. Each tea bag is enough for one cup of tea but certainly not enough for a mug, but you can always use two tea bags. This tea is supposed to have a mild flavour but I did not feel it extremely mild as other reviewers. The aroma is is quite refreshing and overall is a really nice tea for the price. If you want a much stronger Earl Grey, try Whittard, much more expensive tough.

review/text: I enjoy this tea, but it is not my favorite Earl Grey: the flavor is just too delicate.  If you prefer a stronger flavor like I do, and want tea bags instead of loose tea, I recommend the Bigelow brand: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG1O6M">Bigelow Earl Grey Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.<br /><br />By the way, the "Twinings Aromatics" Earl Grey tea is fantastic--probably the best bagged Earl Grey I've tasted--but I have only seen it in England. Try that one out if you can find it.

review/summary: Twinings Earl Grey Tea
review/text: The first time I tried Twinings tea was during a business trip to Durham England. The hotel I stayed at had several varieties of Twinings and I brought home some sample packs for my wife to try. Her favorite (and mine) was the Twinings Earl Grey tea. It is truly a wonderfully aromatic tea with just the right flavor. A truly unique tea for people who love tea. I'll have to admit, my tea experience was limited to the black tea/orange pekoe variety found anywhere here in the states prior to that trip. After drinking the Twinings Earl Grey for a few months, my wife and I tried a small amount of our old black tea/orange pekoe variety, and found it intolerably nasty. Be forewarned, very good tea will spoil you to other run of the mill varieties. I've since tried other brands of Earl Grey and none have compared to Twinings. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Among the best Earl Grey Tea available
review/text: I enjoy a good cup of tea and my absolute favorite is Earl Grey. Twinings Early Grey is among the best on the market, alongside Rishi loose leaf. A traditional English tea, Earl Grey is a black tea whose principle flavor is from the rind of bergamot oranges. Although there are various accounts of its origin, it is most likely was an Indian recipe (China is also a commonly attributed with creating the recipe) which made its way to England in the early 1800s. Named after Lord Grey, the tea is a flavorful black tea that is best served nearly boiling hot with or without lemon. It is NOT served with cream.<br /><br />Twinings is one of the oldest conveyors of Earl Grey and still use the same recipe as they have for well over a hundred years (soon to be two-hundred). Their tea is also endorsed by the 6th Earl Grey and his signature appears on their packaging. Not that this means the tea is superior because of any endorsement; in this case the tea speaks for itself.<br /><br />While I do prefer loose leaf teas, these tea bags provide nearly the same flavor profile as the loose variety and will not disappoint the Earl Grey enthusiast. If you've never tried Twinings, you owe it to yourself to do so. Enjoy!

review/summary: Twinings is the best Earl Grey
review/text: I have tried three varieties of Earl Grey now and I am amazed and somewhat pleased by how different they all are as it allows for different tastes.  Twinings has a light, bright slightly citrus flavor that I love. Bigelow Earl Grey, to me, is comparitively flat. Drinkable, but not the delight that Twinings is.<br />You actually can tell the difference on opening the box, from the smell. I smell very little on opening Bigelow.  I also tried Stash Earl Grey and was nearly choked to death by a strong perfume stench that spoke neither of tea or of citrus. I did try it, a couple of times, and threw the balance of it away.<br /><br />I usually drink the tea iced, no sugar and sometimes with a squeeze of lime.  I cannot imagine using sugar, not needed.  My feeling on hot drinking is that perhaps a small spoon of sugar would be nice, but certainly not milk, partly because of the light flavor of the tea, but mostly because the milk does not compliment the citrus note.<br /><br />** update. Sorry Twinings I have been wooed away by Ahmad Tea. Their Earl Grey is stronger with a richer flavor.

review/summary: The taste of Bergamot
review/text: Earl Grey is an unusual type of tea because it is flavored with the herb Bergamot which has a distinctive flavor.  If you haven't tasted it before, I'd recommend you order a cup or try a smaller sized package because you might not like it.  It can, however, grow on you.  I like it very much; it's one of my very favorite teas.  It's quite popular in England both at breakfast and at tea time.  It is almost always available if you are out having high or afternoon tea.  It's made with black tea, so it, of course, has caffeine--though now it is available in decaf as well through Amazon etc.  This box has a large quantity of tea bags of high quality tea.  There are other brands, but Twinings is a good one (though not my very favorite, it's right up there).  Using bags is, of course, more convenient, but frankly, I prefer loose tea with which you can vary the strength as you wish.  I have friends who make it by the pot.  Those wanting weaker tea just pour it off earlier.  I like it stronger.  On the other hand, you can put a bag in a mug, stick in the microwave, and have tea in a few minutes.  Enjoy!  Hope you like the Bergamot!

I had a double serving of Green Tea Achiva and ate the Achiva beans throughout.  The Friday was a trail half 14ish miles.  It was tough, but it was nice that I didn't have to worry about my nutrition.  I felt great.<br /><br />The next day was the full marathon.  Again I had a double serving of Green Tea Achiva and then ate 4 packages of Achiva Beans through out the race.  Even with stiff legs I felt great and ran my fastest marathon in 20 years.  Nutrition is one of the hardest things to figure out during a race or even an early morning spin class.

review/summary: Great tasting healthier ketchup!
review/text: So glad to see more sugar free foods using natural stevia sweetner instead of artificial chemical based sweetners. This ketchup is great tasting. It is a little sweeter then normal ketchup but I don't mind that. Especially since there are so many bland things out there that are natural, gluten free, sugar free etc. This ketchup actually has flavor!! I hope one day they make a to go packaging version so people like me with food intolerance can bring it with them to parties or places they will be eating and cant use regular ketchup etc. The bottle is just too big to bring with you anywhere but its packaged really nicely in a great thick bottle.

review/summary: Really unique and delicious
review/text: I bought the Raisin Brown Bread today on a whim at the grocery store (Publix in Florida) and I really liked it. Of special interest to me was the fact that no refined white sugar is used to sweeten it (only molasses) and no white flour is used (only whole wheat and rye flours). This bread is therefore quite closer to a South Beach Diet-acceptable &quot;dessert&quot; versus something you'd get in a typical bakery (with the possible exception of the molasses...didn't read that far).<p>The raisins were sweet and delicious and the bread is rich and hearty. I paid $1.99 locally and found it to be a very good value. It was flavorful and delicious enough by itself that butter actually was a negative when I tried it! That doesn't happen often.<p>I would recommend you try this product at least once to see what you think. I think it would be great to keep on hand as a snack, as one can could easily last you a few days of snacking.

review/summary: Yummy nostalgic brown bread
review/text: B&M Brown bread totally took us back to our childhood.  Slice it into rounds about 3/8 inch thick.  The trick is steaming it so that it is hot and moist and serve with butter, which melts into the bread.  Looks like chocolate, but it is dark with molasses.  They still make the same stuff of our memories. Patience!  First can didn't get hot enough or moist enough, but the second and third were perfect.

review/summary: Mr. Yoshida is a yummy man.
review/text: Here in Gainesville Florida we have a place that serves grilled meats and vegetables basted in a sweet teriyaki sauce over rice. I'm addicted to the sauce, if I could I would go out and get a giant plastic container, fill it up with it, and pour it over everything there is. I would even consider teriyaki baths. I always want to take a million "to go" containers of the sauce when I visit but that would be really rude.  Since I cannot do that, I have found a substitute in Mr. Yoshida.  It's not as thick, and its not exactly the same flavor, it is a delicious marinade/sauce in its own right. If you love teriyaki flavor it's definitely worth trying. I put mine in stir fry, marinate meats, and use it as a dipping sauce for dumplings. I'm sure there is a million other different uses. Mr. Yoshida always does me right!

review/text: Even though I bought this to bake biscuits for my dogs (baking powder is safe for dogs in the amounts used for baking... just don't let them eat the entire can at once, that'd be bad for anyone), I also use this in cookies I bake for my family, since it's sitting there in my cupboard, might as well use it for us too. My sugar cookies come out rising and tasting just like they do with regular baking powder. The sodium isn't missed at all. I use the same amount of it as I would regular baking powder. Very pleased with its performance.<br /><br />This sodium-free baking powder isn't cheap, but it's worth it and works like regular baking powder, and I couldn't find it in town at the stores I went to. I've been using it for over 2 months and I use it a lot, but these 3 cans are going to last a good while.

review/summary: Fantastic Crisps; Use for Everything
review/text: We love these crisps.  They are akin to a cracker as opposed to a potato chip.  As such, we use them in soup now all of the time and they are so much better than soup crackers.  We also use them with cheese and as the legend on the package tells you, the sellers developed them for their then cheese store.  However, these crisps became so popular that they left the cheese business for this instead. These are actual New York bagels, sliced and put back into their ovens to become crisps.  I buy a big bag of these at Sam's Club locally. I've also tried Stacy's chips but like these better.

review/summary: Great Price, Great Packaging, Great Taste!
review/text: If you've never had these Bagel Crisps before they are about the size of a large potato chip but much thicker and made from bagels.  They are crunchy and taste like garlic and salt.  Compared to the Ranch Wheat thins (15 crackers a serving) I usually snack on, the serving of Bagel Crisps (6 crisps) has 10 less calories but fills me up the same.  However, there is a lot more sodium in the crisps, 320mg vs.190mg in the Wheat Thins.<br /><br />The package of 12 arrived quickly, well packaged, and fresh.  My particular order which was placed in mid July has an expiration date of May 2011.  Plenty of time to eat all 12 packages without feeling rushed!<br /><br />All in all... for a moderately healthy crunchy snack you can't go wrong.

review/text: After ignoring these in the supermarket for some time, I was introduced to them at my new job where everyone kept scarfing them down. Being a garlic lover, I just had to try one. I'm hooked. They are light, airy, and so full of flavor. They do get your hands a bit greasy reminding you that they aren't a fat free light food. I'm not into potato chips, so I searched my supermarket for the garlic flavor to no avail. How delightful I can order them from Amazon!<br /><br />I gave the review 4 stars because sometimes the bag is full of broken pieces instead of full bagel chips. As another reviewer said, a resealable bag would add to the product. However, maybe the creators know how quickly they will be devoured... :)

review/text: Having just returned from a vacation in Mexico our family had developed a real taste for these Mexican style "Japones" style nuts. We tried numerous brands while on vacation and all of the brands were pretty close in taste and texture. These however have a highly artificial taste to them with the tiniest peanuts within a lot of the batter. Unfortunately even after a couple of beers the other evening and thinking they may taste better with beer, I can say that was wishful thinking. They may work as sustenance but little else.

review/summary: Very nice soup
review/text: I don't normally care for soup mixes, but thought a single serving mix was worth trying, especially for 150 calories per serving.  I was pleasantly surprised by the full flavor of these soups. They are a little thin, but still flavorful, and they don't have that 'processed' taste a lot of mixes have. They are high in sodium, but that's nothing new for a soup. Just be careful with the rest of the daily menu so it all balances out.  The red chili and the green chili soup mixes are perfect with a cup or two of chopped broccoli thrown in.  I tried broccoli in the tortilla soup but it wasn't a good mix. I may try adding chopped squash or some other veggie instead.<br /><br />My package was leaking powder when it arrived. Several of the packets were not sealed properly and had leaked out. Comida Loca customer service was genuinely concerned and very attentive and sent a replacement. I've also ordered another box from Amazon.

review/summary: Very expensive spice mix
review/text: The reviews were good; variety sounded good, but by the time you add the chicken and the tomatoes and the milk, you've paid several dollars for about 1/2 cup of dried potatoes and spices.  Was not surprised to see that potato is the primary ingredient.<br /><br />Yes, as reviewers said, nice blend of spices but unless you add quite a lot of your own ingredients to the pot, there is no substance - just nicely flavored milk/water.  Will not buy again.

review/summary: Very tasty with the right amount of zing
review/text: This soup takes a little bit of time to make - it's not a mix with water and boil soup.  I followed the directions exactly the first time I made it and the second time, I added frozen corn and only used milk (instead of milk and water) for a heartier richer soup.  But the spices are just right!  I really like this product.  It is a quality product!  I live in Europe where I can't get any Mexican food, so this satisfies my cravings for something spicey.  And it's easy to pack or ship.

review/summary: What makes this taste good...
review/text: Salt makes this taste good. I hate to say it but this stuff has been sitting on my pantry shelf for months and months. After making my first cup of hot soup (very easy, by the way, just add water and microwave....), I thought it tasted bitter and a bit flat. So, out of desperation, lately, I had nothing for snacking, so I made myself a cup of this soup. I added some soy sauce (don't know why). That made it absolutely delicious - salt was what it needed. Salt has that ability to 'fix' what is lacking. And it certainly fixed this for me. It has a very good taste, once adjusted with just a little bit of salt.

review/summary: This soup is super.....good
review/text: I had Turtle Island tortilla soup before, it was very good but I can't find that in the local markets, that's why I checked into Amazon and looked for it. Instead I came across the comida loca soup mix reviews, people seem really like it, so I ordered some and tried it out myself. I really enjoy the soup, it is very tasty and easy to make. I won't say it tastes better than Turtle Island brand, but it's definitely a lot cheaper. It cost about half the price of the other brand, but it taste just as good as the other brand. I'll definitely buy it again. Thank you for the reviews.

review/text: Actually, I couldn't make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients, and a fully-stocked kitchen.  The flavors are crisp and balanced, not too veggie-heavy nor too sharp, just the right balance and thickness.  And they are almost complete -- you just add milk, or water, and more ingredients if you happen to have them -- bell peppers, for instance -- and you have a full-fledged soup.  The Comida Loca soups are not "open and serve soups" nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients -- they are ALMOST complete from the container, and you add a little bit (milk, corn chips, etc) at the end.  So they are a terrific mix of easy but not over-preocessed.  As you can tell, I am a big fan and always have a variety of them on hand -- perfect for a northeast winter's day!

review/text: The soups that I ordered were delicious. Let me begin with that. However, it took me awhile to receive them. The first order I received was only an empty box. Apparently it was damaged during shipping and was torn open. I emailed Amazon and they replaced the shipment immediately with no questions asked. THANK YOU.<br /><br />The second (same) shipment that I received was also damaged. This time, the outside of the packaging was fine, but the soups were leaking. Of the 32 total soup packets, 8 of them work broken open.<br /><br />The failing, I believe, is not in the shipping but rather the packaging of these. They need to be shipped in a tight box rather than the large box they were delivered.<br /><br />I operate a small shop inside an office building, and really would like to continue ordering these soups, however, they are too expensive to lose 25% upon delivery.<br /><br />Thanks, I look forward to improvements...at least in shipping.<br /><br />Regards,<br />John Jean<br />[...].

Well, the front label says "NO SUGAR"; however, the ingredients include sugar and corn syrup.  Well, it's simply delish, but it HAS SUGAR! I'd still buy it again though.  Actually, I bought all five flavors.  Just disappointed that the label is misleading.

review/summary: Excellent drink for the price
review/text: I switched to this drink as this is one of the few no sugar drinks that doesn't contain aspartame.  Splenda is the primary sweetener for this.  For me it's got the right blend of flavor, sweetness and caffeine.  Being in packets it's easy to carry with you and compared to the cost of pre-mixed energy drinks (monster, amp, etc) it's a great value*.  I love all three flavors, citrus is what you'd expect tastes similar to original Gatorade.  I was most surprised by the orange flavor, I'm not a big fan of orange flavored drinks, but this one is really good.  Berry however remains my favorite, but I enjoy the others just as much.<br /><br />*Please note, it looks like this isn't sold by Amazon LLC anymore and the new seller's price is way more.  I was paying anywhere between $14 and $18 for a 3 pack.  It's now cheaper to get this from the manufacture's website.

review/text: I drink Monster Blues, the 10 calorie, zero carb energy drink.  Depending on where I buy it I can spend upwards to $2 a can!<br /><br />At just shy of $12 for 72 servings, that is a substantial savings for someone looking for an energy buzz ;)  The taste is not bad in particular if you water it down a bit.  I also mixed the orange with my no carb vanilla protein powder to get a real homemade creamsicle muscle building kick in the pants!  Okay, it does not totally rock, but I can stomach it when I need to.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with this as a substitute for high priced energy drinks.  I keep a couple of servings in my EDC bag along with a few protein bars.  I have a stainless steel container of H2o with me too.  Pour, shake, drink....<br /><br />4 stars

review/text: I got these as a sample from the 5 boro bike tour in NYC.  AMAZING product.  These taste pretty good and don't have the sugar that you would get from a Mountain Dew.<br /><br />Since it's effervescent, the kick is pretty instantaneous, but be careful, you might get hooked.  For some people, it might be too much caffeine.  I wouldn't take these if I wasn't already a coffee addict.  I think Energy Rush has more of a caffeine kick than coffee or a soda.  Also since you control how much water you put in, you can easily overdose this stuff.<br /><br />In the past I've taken Ripped Fuel, Hydroxycut, and all sorts of other stimulants you name it.  Energy rush gives you a great boost.

One packet of this gets me going in the morning, if I'm in a rush it's all into one 16.9 ounce water bottle, if I can be lazy I use a bigger bottle.  I wasn't a fan of the flavor at first, but eventually I came to adore them.  Definitely an energy drink type of flavor (Orange and Citrus), I don't know what to compare the berry to, but it's always an extra good morning when I get my favorite flavor.  Great Value on Amazon and in stock unlike my super market.

The best part of it is that it is only 5 calories per serving (vs the 140 calories in each can of cola soda pop that I used to drink). They say it is tough to lose weight during the holiday season and I say that it is true, but, even though I have been eating everything else I would eat during the holidays, I cut out all the soda pop and substituted with these. I have lost about 9 pounds in a month, without working out, so I know that once I start working out, I will lose more weight.
