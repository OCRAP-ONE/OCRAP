review/summary: Far exceeded my expectations
review/text: I can only give this a 5-star review. Sure it's expensive, but the aroma and taste of this salt is amazing, and happily stronger than I expected. I recently bought a truffle oil that had hardly any aroma at all and was very disappointed. Just a pinch of this salt fills your dish with complexity and depth. It's amazing what just a little pinch will do in an omelet, or on top of saut&eacute;ed vegetables. Right after I submit this review i'm going to buy a 2nd one as a gift for a friend.

Not sure the strong aroma directly translates into truffle flavor though.  The jury is still out on this one for me.

review/text: I like Hazelnut so I especially like the Hazelnut Teeccino. I cannot handle caffeine anymore.  Sometimes I use half Teeccino and half Decaf coffee for my morning coffee. The Teeccino gives it a richer, more full-bodied taste, which I like. If I want coffee mid-day I use only the Teeccino and make just the amount I want for a cup in a French Press pot - it is a special treat. I do wish Amazon would let you mix up the Teeccino flavors in their three packs.

review/summary: Wowsers!!
review/text: What a delight is this beverage!  I've been caffeine-free for one year, having given up coffee because of increasing physical effects of caffeine.  When I discovered Teeccino, I was skeptical at first.  The company claims that it tastes like coffee.  I tried it and I really, really like it.  Hazelnut coffee was my favorite flavor when I was drinking coffee, and to my tastebuds, the Teeccino Mediterranean Hazelnut Herbal Coffee tastes even better!  Of course, there are no side effects from caffeine because there is none, and the flavor is smooth and mellow and, well, hazelnutty.  I would recommend this beverage to anyone who is sensitive to caffeine.  The flavor is remarkable.  I would recommend brewing it in a coffee press to allow the coffee to be in contact with the hot water for at least 10 minutes to bring out the full flavor.  It is good by itself or with some organic half & half.  M-m-m-m!!!

The resulting drink is difficult to describe -- other than to say it's not for me. I could taste tones of hazelnut and other spices, but the drink has no real appeal--for me.

review/text: I love Teeccino. I began drinking it when I gave up coffee as part of a food detox last fall. I drink this as if it were coffee. The hazelnut is sweet enough that if I use soy hazelnut creamer, I don't need any additional sweetener. I think this stuff is way better than regular coffee. I can feel the difference of less acidity in the body, which is important for alkalizing the blood. At first, I cut this with regular coffee. It took two weeks then I was done with caffeine. I wake up more refreshed now. Love this stuff.

My husband and I are thankful we finally found something healthy with no caffeine that actually tastes as good as coffee. There are digestive benefits too. We put our fresh goat's milk and raw honey in this and in the morning it's heaven. You don't need as much as recommended, which is good because you can make the bag last longer. I highly recommend buying this online at amazon instead of health food store. My store was priced at $9.50 a bag. I am buying msany at at time from amazon and the shipping is free!  Enjoy!

review/text: After developing new health problems recently, I decided to experiment and put an end to my sudden influx in coffee consumption. I read about this in a book about raw diets and decided to give it a try. SO glad I did! This is the first flavor I've tried and I love it. I usually put a little bit of coconut milk creamer in it. While I may still enjoy an occasional latte, this is a great daily alternative and I plan to always keep it in my pantry! Even my husband was very skeptical about my newest health venture, but he is happy to drink it with me. Can't wait to try more flavors!

review/summary: Teeccino Coffee - the Smoothest, Mellowest, & BEST tasting I've ever had!
review/text: My husband and I have found a New Love in Teeccino Naturally Caffeine Free, Organic Herbal Coffees!  It's full, smooth, mellow flavor is just delicious (more so than General Foods International Coffees).  Keep in mind that everyone has different taste buds, and some will love the taste of Teeccino coffees while others won't.  For them it may be an acquired taste (or not).  As all caffineated and de-cafe coffees contain caffine as well as some teas, even in trace amounts, Teeccino coffees are different in that there is NO Caffine to begin with - so, no caffine to remove!  My diet has dictated that I remove caffine for the benefit of better health, and unfavorable affects to the system has ruled that caffine be removed from my husband's diet.  But now we can have coffee in our diets and in our lives again with Teeccino Coffees!  I bought 3 different flavored sample packets of the coffee first.  Now, I know that I will buy this coffee in boxes and bags, and we can't wait to taste all of the different flavors.  Get the sample packs and try it yourself.  If you try it - you may like it!

review/text: I like quite a few of the Teeccino flavors, and although I like hazelnut, I don't care for this Teeccino flavor much on its own.  Not a fan straight and unsweetened, or sweetened.  However, I've gotten accustomed to adding 250 mg of vitamin C (1/2 a 500 mg tablet) to this flavor as almost a bitter-sweetener.  It changes the flavor profile to something I quite like, but I'm not sure it is what anyone else would like, and not what you would expect of a hazelnut flavored coffee substitute.<br /><br />I'll strongly recommend Teeccino's Chocolate Mint flavor, however.

Our local grocery store stopped stocking it, so we tried this. Although a serving of pancakes prepared with this mix is slightly fewer calories than the whole wheat mix (probably because it just adds water to powdered mix, where the whole wheat mix adds milk) these pancakes deliver less fiber and overall fail the nutrition comparison.<br /><br />We also thought that the taste and consistency were rather flat compared to the whole wheat mix. It was just overall a disappointing experience. We had bought two boxes, and I took the very unusual (for me) step of returning the unopened one to the grocery store. Since they don't carry the whole wheat mix anymore, we ordered a case of it from Amazon.

We had it at home every time we had baked beans for dinner.  They just go together.  I had kind of forgotten about the bread until my sisters and I began reminiscing recently about our favorite childhood meals. We all remembered how much we liked the brown bread and hadn't bought any in awhile. Then we went shopping for this brown bread and nobody carried it in the stores around here. How disappointing! A whole new generation will never know about this bread or how good it is...and how well it goes with baked beans.  I ordered several cans and shared them with family.  I will have to order more pretty soon. It still tastes as good as I remembered.  They almost need to reintroduce it to the public...the younger generations don't know anything about it. I hope they keep making it and I sure wish they still had it in our local grocery stores. (Portland, OR)

I opened the can and took the bread out and microwaved it just for a minute or two to heat it up. It was absolutely delicious and I ate every bit of it. To me it tasted like a cake. It is very rich tasting. It is great to keep around for when you want something rich and delicious with no cooking and it is 99% fat free.

review/summary: Wonderful~Childhood Revisited~Just like I remembered it!
review/text: I thought this product was no longer available. Then by chance I found it here. It is so good I cannot find the words to describe it. It just arrived and I had a can opened and a slice warmed up with butter on it within 5 min. I sat and savored it for 20 min, taking tiny bites. It is 100% the same as when I was a child. So moist. It is 130 calories for a 1/2 inch slice which is plenty as it is so rich in flavor. It is almost like cake. In the 1960's we ate slices of it with the B and M Boston Baked beans. My mother also sliced it thin and put creamcheese or marshmellow cream between 2 slices and sent it as a treat for my grade school lunches.<br /><br />It you want a healthy yummy taste of the past try this bread. The value is fantastic also. I checked a few other websites and it was sky high in price. Highly Recommend.

review/summary: B&M Brown Bread
review/text: Slightly disappointed in this bread. It just isn't as moist and tasty as we remembered from our childhood when we had it frequently. That could be because of many passing years or it could be that we bought the 99% fat free one (very likely) instead of the regular. I gave these to several friends and we all felt the same. If I buy this again, it will be the regular and not the fat free one.

review/text: Some reviews said the bread was dry.  It will be if it is not steamed.  Open both ends of the can and push loaf out.  Slice into 1 inch slices and wrap in foil adding a little water and place in oven for 10/15 mins.  Serve with beans, B&M traditional, Bushes  homestyle better, and old fashion skin-on franks.  Score a few times on both sides of dog and grill in butter until lightly browned.<br />Butter the bread just to keep your wight up!

review/summary: yucky!
review/text: I ordered these because they reminded me of canned brown bread I had as a kid.  My wife frequently reminds me that my memories of things are more pleasant than the actual reality.  That is the case here.  The ones with raisins are fat free.  They taste very artificial.  Not even as good as an MRE (army food).  The flavor is bland.  The consistency is artificial.  I felt nauseous afterwards.  If you just want to experience canned bread, try a different one.

review/summary: Good camping provision
review/text: I first encountered this product years ago in Boston, where it was something of a staple, findable even in those small places eastern Massachusetts people called (do they still?) "spas". Bread in a can? It must be terrible! And I wouldn't touch it. Now, I realize that the stuff is actually pretty good, good enough that you would tend to eat more of it than you should, calorie-wise I mean, as the ingredients are remarkably unjunkfoodlike and there is no nutritional problem. However, calories are not a problem in my case, as I buy this bread principally for camping trips, and usually eat it with a liberal application of peanut butter. The caloric load is exactly appropriate for the heavy day-hiking I practice, and I find that the bread stays pretty fresh, still in the can, when kept in a sealed plastic bag, for the three days or so that it takes me to finish it.

review/text: My son wanted to try it and I wanted to see how good it was because of the shelf life.  Very long shelf life.  Regardless, it was pretty good.  Not to sweet and the raisins weren't overpowering.  It weighs a lot and is heavy bread but it is good.  I liked it and the only issue I had was pushing it out of the can.  Took a little more force then I expected.  Other then that it is good stuff.

I am not sure what people are doing to cook this that have it with bad reviews (perhaps they are NOT cooking it at all?)  but I always just slip it out of the can cut off what I need for the meal (In this case half a can) wrap in foil and bake the last 20 minutes in the oven along side of a can of beans in a casserole dish topped w/ scored hotdogs. Taste as good as ever... steaming it in the foil makes it moist! I freeze the unused half and will thaw and cook the next time around.

Well, our local store no longer stocks ANY B&M products. Amazon has it and now we receive our bread on a regular basis. Convenience and a cost savings besides. In the store, the cost was much higher. Thank you Amazon for helping me continue family traditions.

review/text: My 2 year old adores these crackers.  I recently was very ill and could not get to the store to buy them for her so I purchased them from a My Favorite Things through amazon.  Since the price was $8 and because the picture looks like a big box of crackers I assumed I was in fact buying a big box of crackers.  Wrong!  They were selling a little bag for $8 + $5 shipping.  When I contacted the seller to complain they were unwilling to do anything for me.  Thankfully Amazon stepped in but really I think they should ban this seller from their site.  Talk about price gouging!

review/summary: EXCELLENT Quality & Taste; Very, Very Versatile Too
review/text: ~ I ordered Farie's Finest Coconut powder, Maple Flavored Powder, Peppermint Flavored Powder and Powdered Vanilla to send to my daughter in the Czech Republic because some foods like coconut and maple syrup can be hard to find or insanely expensive there.  I tasted this and it was delicious; I was especially pleased at how pure it tasted with absolutely no unpleasant residual flavors or tastes whatsoever.  To try it out I put a heaping tsp. of it into a cake mix to turn a pineapple upside down cake into an even better pina collada cake and it turned out absolutely scrumptious.  My greatest coconut secret is that I add some coconut to the chicken broth and herbs when 'infusion roasting' my turkey (it's an improvement on the beer can chicken method) because coconut really compliments and enhances the turkey flavor.  I love to cook and bake things more uniquely than everyone else does and powders are especially easy to mix into almost any dish; so I'm sure that I'll be thinking up many more creative ways to use this coconut powder.<br />~ In summary, I'm very impressed with the wide variety of products that Farie's Finest offers but I'm even more impressed with the quality and purity of flavor. I'm working on a large order for my own use and I can hardly wait to come up with new recipe idea's using Farie's Finest products.  So I gladly, very confidently and very, very highly recommend this company and their excellent products.

review/summary: 8oz steeped for 10-15min and taken before bed work like a charm
review/text: If you are feeling backed up and need to get things moving, an 8oz cup of this tea taken before going to bed, steeped for a maximum of 15 minutes, will give you the expected results the following morning. One tea bag is enough to do the trick, and works every time, so follow the instructions properly and resist the temptation to use more than one.<br /><br />The taste may not be great but is not unpleasant and will grow on you with time. The tea loses a star because you may get some stomach cramps as it starts to work (some people reportedly don't), but then the tea will live up to its gentle name when you get your easy and painless bowel movement. As reported by other reviewers, steeping for less than 15 minutes may reduce the cramping. Some people have got it to work after seeping the tea bag for only 10 minutes so experiment and see what works best for you.<br /><br />I see that for some reason, when taken during the day, it is not as efficient and often doesn not work as expected. This tea alone works very well, but if you drink plenty of water throughout the day (even when you don't have the tea) and add more fiber to your diet, besides working like a charm it will even help you become more regular on your own.<br /><br />Take this tea if you are backed up and feel bloated, ou will feel reliefed and sleep much better after being cleansed by Smooth Move. It is a natural product but I recommend it for occasional use only as ingestion of senna over extended periods of time may be prejudicial.

review/text: I begin my day with one cup of smooth move tea-- everyday.  If I forget I make sure that I take it before I go to bed at night. It taste good. My teenaged grandsons like it.<br /><br />It depends on how blocked you are which will determine how it works.  You may have to have two cups before it begins to work. However, make sure you do not have any place to go when you are trying it out for the first time.  Believe me it will work. Some people it takes time others it works right away. I use it once a day and it keeps me regular. It dosn't run because I know how to use it. I have been doing this for some time--for four years. I steep it for one minute if I kept it in for more than 1-5 minutes I would not be able to go out because it would run. My friend steeps it for 1/2 a minute that way she is able to go out. Give it five days before you give up on it. So good luck to you all.

It tastes so-so, but if I want taste I'll buy other teas.  If you need to go, this stuff works.  Beware, mild cramping, bloating is probably going to happen.

review/summary: holy crap
review/text: I was a little skeptical about trying this tea thinking that it probably wouldnt work but after eating some really junky food (the fiance is on prednisone and we have been eating absolute junk) amd seeing the scale soar up seven lbs fully knowing that i was really backed up and enemas not taking care of much i figured why not. I steeped for 10 minutes and was suprised that the taste wasnt too bad. Well... I havr issues going in the morning and i will not poo at work so nearly 19 hrs after drinking this.. I came home and sat down and in about 2 seconds something slid. Now i thought it would be not much because of the duration so when i checked... "holy ****" was what i said.i had gone More than ive ever gone in my life.even with the stomache flu! That being said the scale is showing im down at least 4 lbs... So this tea really worked for me

It didn't keep me up at night or give me cramps.<br /><br />The taste, however, is awful.  Another reviewer mentioned that it's too sweet... not even close.  To me it tastes like bitter cloves.  Next time I will try the peppermint flavor.

review/text: This tea does exactly what it is intended for. I steeped it for about 15 minutes like the directions states. I was pleasantly surprised that it taste good so it was easy to drink. About 8 hours later, my stomach was cramping, it felt like it was going to explode. This lasted about an hour of going to the bathroom. I highly recommend this tea if you have problems going to the bathroom or if you are bloated or just uncomfortable. When your stomach starts hurting because you are about "to go", don't get scared. It's just the tea going through your system. I highly recommend you drink this about 5pm or so, and during the night it will take affect. Do not drink this in the morning before going to work, you will regret it.

review/text: Good product, but works best if you drink it at the first indication of a need for it, doesn't work as well if you're way overdue for a remedy. I usually drink it in the morning, and it works for the next morning--few or no cramps, and don't have to worry about bad timing. Perhaps for you it would be better in the evening for the next morning. Otherwise I just follow the directions. Tastes good, especially with a spoon of honey.

review/text: I take poop all day with this stuff using two teabags (one for less cramps) and I steam it extra long, but it does make me a bit nauseas. I have used this for about a year and it always works. When I feel nauseas I feel like I'm about to pass out and it creates too intensive cramps for me. Its like menstrual cramps in your stomach (maybe closest for guys to experience, now what to make feel like ball kick). The value of waking up eager for taking a BM is slightly tainted when it is filled with nausea, cramps and feelings of passing out.

review/summary: For Dried cup-o-soup: FIVE STARS
review/text: We all know no packaged soup--canned or cuppa--is gonna be as delicious as the fresh, home-made stuff. Still, convenience is worth a bit of sacrifice, for those rushed or lazy days. I ordered this because 1. I like split pea, it's like a filling, comfort soup and 2 I wanted to try a vegan soup (no ham or the other stuff that they usually put in pea soup).<br /><br />I didn't expect much. I expected ADEQUATE, no more.<br /><br />Well, surprise me. This was TASTY. I am very pleased with this dried/cup soup. If you follow instructions precisely, it should come out with a terrific texture (not too runny, not too thick) and a nice pea flavor. My only quibble is that it's on the salty side (though not eye-crossingly so).<br /><br />I would definitely get more of this. I'm gonna go through this case pretty fast, I can tell you.<br /><br />I'm ready to try more of McDougall's vegan soups. If others are as good or better than the Vegan Split Pea with Barley, then I'm in for some nice convenience lunches.<br /><br />Each container has 240 calories (that's considered two servings, but please, who eats just half?), 10 grams of fiber, 16 grams of protein, 1 gram of fat (no trans fats), and 42 carbs. The sodium count is 600mg. 24% of Vitamin A requirement.<br /><br />Yum.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: good soup
review/text: this soup is delicious, but i have a couple complaints with the packaging:<br /><br />1. the soup is not a 'one-step' preparation thing as most instant soups are. when you peel back the lid, there's a packet of spices inside that you must remove and open, and pour into the cup, before you add hot water. i always seem to spill this powder onto my countertops, as the 'tear line' isnt clean either. i don't understand why this additional spice packet is not just in the cup of soup to begin with, as it is dry powder just like the soup mix. weird.<br /><br />2. there are two servings per container! this makes no sense to me, as i can't possibly imagine someone eating half the soup cup and saving the rest for later. it looks to me like a marketing gimmick to make the soup appear to have fewer calories, sodium and carbohydrates than it actually does. (one soup package gives you 240 cal, 600mg sodium and 42g carbohydrates)<br /><br />other than that, pretty tasty.

review/text: This review applies to most, but not all of Dr. MacDougalls' Instant soup mixes that come in a cup, to which you just add the enclosed packet and hot water. The problem is that these containers hold 2 servings. How is that supposed to work? How do you keep the second half of the prepared soup? Especially when at work - no kitchen here. Also when you look at the nutrition label, it is for only 1/2 the contents of the cup. There is a line hidden away, if you look hard enough that says the nutrition info is for ".50% " of container. This should be much more prominently displayed. However,some of the varieties do only hold 1 serving, but the pictures all look the same.

Still, I've repurchased this. It's one of the better McDouggall's soups.

It will clump so stirring is highly recommended. Then just cover the container with the lid, put something kind of heavy to hold the lid down and in place and give it a good 5 minutes before eating.

review/text: Out of the many varieties of McDougall's that I've tried, I think I like this one the most for everyday eating. It has a ton of substance to it (16g of protein, 40% DV of dietary fiber) while keeping the calories low, and it tastes great. The Black Bean and Lime (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFIEL2">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Black Bean & Lime Soup, 3.4-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a>) is also great, but I lose my taste for that flavor if I have it too often, so the split pea is my go-to soup.<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed a hint of the flavor of bacon in this soup? I don't know what ingredient(s) give that illusion, but it's pretty awesome in a vegan product.

To me is a great solution for my lunch  time on weekdays, where I had daily look for a place to eat where I could get something vegetarian safe, under $10 and healthy. You will see how much money you save do NOT eating at a restaurant, bringing you own snaks and lunch from home.

review/summary: Good soup, bad instructions
review/text: These are the instructions on the cup: "Remove fresh flavor packet. Add water to fill line. Stir. Microwave 1 min 40 seconds. Stir. Cover. Let stand 5 minutes. Stir & Enjoy." Until I saw this site, I had no idea when to dump the flavor packet in. I ended up sticking it in at the end. I don't cook often. I think the instructions should be clearer about when the packet gets dumped in, just in case it effects stir-ability or taste. Unless it doesn't matter, and then they should at least say that. It did not seem to make a difference in flavor, but it was clumpy and hard to stir when I put it in at that point. It did taste good, though.
