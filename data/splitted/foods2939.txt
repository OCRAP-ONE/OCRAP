review/summary: Not my "cup of tea"
review/text: This has a fragrance and a taste that is offputting to me, I've tried it several times - hot, iced, sweetened, not, additions of cream, lemon - and I just can't get past that "whang" it has.  I'm sure others probably love it but I won't be buying it again.

review/summary: Different - in a good way
review/text: Be prepared with the right equipment to make this tea, it can be as simple as a low cost french press or a suitable coffee maker. Suitable meaning something like a espresso machine or pod system where you won't cross contamination with coffee flavors.<br /><br />Once made the curiously strong tea has a nice aroma and flavor. Suitable for milk, cream, spice, or other additions.<br /><br />If you are not looking for a caffeine drink, I highly recommend giving this unique beverage a try.

review/summary: Good strong flavor, OK brew
review/text: I brewed it in the coffee maker as instructed and drank it with sweetened milk as the Thai do. It gives a strong, deeper flavor and dark red color which is good. However, it didn't impress me given the extra trouble of having to brew. I'm a green tea lover, so not sure how often I'd be drinking this version despite the health benefits.

review/summary: Red Espresso
review/text: This was delicious. I used a regular tea maker to make this, and followed the instructions on the bag. It was delicious. I drank it on ice. I also tried it mixed with coconut water, sweetened with agave nectar. I did try to make this like a regular pot of tea and it clogged up my tea maker, even though it has the capability of making loose teas. So don't try it even if tempted.

review/summary: Reminds me of cherry tobacco
review/text: This espresso tea is wonderfully aromatic, reminds me of cherry tobacco, but does not transfer well to the palate, or at least mine.  The scent is very strong as you are sipping the tea, and it overwhelms me, but I have a keen sense of smell so that may not be a problem for others.  It is hard to differentiate the actual taste from the scent.  I don't think I will try it again.

review/summary: overwhelming
review/text: The description of the tea on the package made me think there would be something espresso-like in the tea, when there really wasn't.  It's a strong red (black) tea in what is allegedly an espresso grind, but tea doesn't really grind the way coffee beans do and so it just makes a lot of very small, hard to filter bits.<br /><br />This grind of tea needs to be in an espresso machine or else you will get floaties.  I tried this tea three ways: espresso, regular drip coffee, and loose in boiling water and strained later.  It had to be strained 3 times to get most of the floaters out of it, and while I'm okay with some actual tea leaves in other brands occasionally making it into the cup, this fine grain floaty stuff really put me off for some reason.  When you make it as you do espresso coffee, however, you really concentrate the taste and it becomes nearly undrinkable.<br /><br />The taste was the same every time, very strong, bitter to the point of smelling a bit dirty, with an acidic sweetness that lingered on the tongue for ages.  My husband grabbed the grounds the first time and literally ran them outside, and immediately cleaned the coffee pot to make sure the taste did not affect the machine later.  He adamantly refused to even be in the house when I attempted the tea twice more.<br /><br />For people like us who like nothing in our tea except maybe a little lemon, a tea like this that must be doctored heavily isn't really our thing anyway.  But one of the reviews here recommended the tea for Thai Iced Teas, which I tried.  That was the best result of the 3 attempts at using the tea, but I still like the kinds of teas you can get in restaurants or international food stores much better than this tea.<br /><br />We're big tea drinkers in this house, and at any given time have at least 7 types of tea in the house.  I really don't believe our dislike of the tea was a case of unfamiliarity.  The price is also quite a lot, considering we often buy our tea online at gourmet shops for $7-$10 per 4 oz.

review/summary: Good Rooibos (but I'm not diggin' the espresso strength thing)
review/text: I am a Rooibos junkie. I have been drinking it for a few years and adore it. I can only tolerate limited caffeine, early in my day or I'll be up and cranky and not ready to face the world the following day.  Rooibos, in a regular tea strength, with milk is a caffeine free and still tasty (tastes like black tea, when brewed properly, with a little less of the note of bitterness)...<br /><br />I also love espresso drinks and worked for a long time as a barista in a cafe. So I figured this would be the perfect blend for me...<br /><br />I followed the bag directions but as I am sans espresso machine I prepared an entire pot in my trusty Bodum french press.<br /><br />I guess a person who enjoys a straight espresso might enjoy this, but without sweetener and milk it really did taste like superconcentrated, over-brewed regular tea.  I added milk and that dry, bitterness was still clear as a bell and not enjoyable.<br /><br />So I dumped the RedEspresso and started fresh. I prepared my usual cup of afternoon Rooibos, using my usual amounts (much less than that suggested for espresso prep on the package) and yum. Perfection.<br /><br />So would I buy this tea again?<br />Sure. It is packaged well and secure, it seems to be high quality rooibos, and I can get it from Amazon.com so I probably will order this again, for use as a regular rooibos.

review/summary: Needed an added taste boost...
review/text: I made the Red Espresso Rooiboos Tea Espresso in a slow drip coffee maker.  I was not fond of the stand-alone flavor.  I am use to drinking white teas and green teas without adding any flavors.  This tea had a pleasant taste when we added raw honey or flavored creamer.  It left a rust colored powder residue in my coffee maker - which did not disappear after several pots of coffee preparation.  The filter holder had to be removed and washed to remove the residue.  If you are interested in the anti-oxidant benefits - go for it.  It does not suit my taste buds.

review/summary: Tastes like tea, not espresso
review/text: Let me first start off by saying it doesn't, NOT ONE OUNCE, taste like espresso, coffee, or anything similar. It tastes like tea, PERIOD.<br /><br />Now with that out of the way on to the rest of the review.<br /><br />When you first open the package you are hit with this odd, earthy smell... not something that most people would find pleasant. I've had a lot of teas, but this one takes the prize for the oddest smelling.<br /><br />After trying to figure out whether or not I wanted to drink something that smelled that odd I went ahead and added a fair amount (three tablespoons) to my four cup Mr. Coffee. The last thing I wanted to do was make a large pot of the stuff and end up throwing it out. A few minutes (about eight) pass and I hear the distinct "slurping" noise indicating that the coffee maker was at the end of its cycle and go to get me a cup of Red Espresso. Odd thing was the coffee carafe was only half filled up... odd, right? So I carefully pull out the coffee basket and to my surprise it still had two cups of water/tea in it literally 1/8" away from spilling out everywhere. So be VERY careful when using this in an drip coffee machine as the tea seems to clog the filters more then coffee ever would.<br /><br />As for taste, it's not great, but it isn't awful. The taste I get out of it is very similar to a good black tea without the bitterness. And that is one thing this tea has over some of the others, doesn't matter how strong you make it, it doesn't get bitter.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't buy it. The taste is nowhere near espresso, thus you are left with nothing more then expensive loose tea that smells odd.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Comes in a resealable pouch.<br />Doesn't get bitter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't taste like espresso.<br />Very odd smell, before, during, and after the steeping process.<br />Kinda spendy, I would hope that it would at least taste like mediocre coffee for this price.<br />Seems to backup drip coffee makers really easily, so be careful!

review/summary: Tastes like Tea
review/text: This is fine. It's just not all that.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had special equipment that would make it without getting little floaties in my cup, I would have given it more stars. (I used a fine mesh strainer and poured the boiling water through twice). And perhaps if I didn't get an unimaginable headache a half hour or so after drinking it...I might have gone for three stars. (Unsure whether this caused the headache--I have to try it one more time). But, the end result tasted like tea...nothing special and at 11.70 per bag--uh, I'd rather go for Celestial Seasonings if I want some caffeine-free tea-beverage-drink.<br /><br />SO if you have an espresso machine and want to branch out into tea, this might be for you--otherwise go for some loose-leaf and steep the hell out of it.

review/summary: Not a fan
review/text: As one of the previous reviewer, I'm a tea drinker, always straight without anything else. At first I thought this was coffee mixed with tea and not being a coffee fan that did not resonate well.<br />But then realized that this is just ground tea. However it's not even tea. I had not heard about this South African plant before, but it's not tea even though the smell and taste remind me of a very dark, steeped for too long and too bitter black tea.<br />I did try with the recommended serving size, 4 spoons, and then reduced as this is really dark. They only show it on the packaging drunk with milk or cream or fruit juice. I only tried it like I like tea, so without anything and it's too strong/bold/powerful... it's not a complex taste, just quite ... raw.<br /><br />I find the idea attractive for people who want to quit drinking coffee (hence the not just 1 star) but this is not for me :)

review/summary: Not A Good Espresso Substitute but OK for Rooibos Chai
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this "espresso".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.

review/summary: Love Teas, Just Not This One
review/text: To give you a bit of background, I drink tea every single day, several times a day.  Not your typical American bag tea, but loose tea.  I like the variety of flavors available in loose teas.  I enjoy Rooibos and other herbal teas, White teas, Green teas, and Black teas.  Basically, I should own stock in Teavana since I drink so much of their tea.  I also found a phenomenal tea from Stockholm.  These teas are much better than your standard Orange Pekoe and Black or bagged teas in Starbucks or my local grocer.  That said, this product intrigued me and I figured I would give it a chance.  We only brewed it straight in our drip coffee maker.  No foam and such that was shown on the package...Here are the pros and cons we found:<br /><br />Pros:<br />*health benefits - but I get that with the teas I already drink<br />*seems easier to get more concentrated flavor (if you want that)<br />*Cappuccino or other methods could be good if you're trying to replace coffee with healthier alternative (I still would just opt for loose tea since the deep, rich flavor of coffee isn't "there" with this product.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />*flavor was ok, a bit heavy, not spectacular (on the other hand, the teas I drink each day are complex, varied in taste, and refreshing)<br />*texture was off - usually I don't think of teas as having much of a texture but there was a definite difference due to the ground nature of this product - felt "off"<br />*It reminded me of how creamed corn is the leftovers.  I wonder if the leaves used to make this were so small they were ground up in hopes of still making a profit.  I could be wrong or pessimistic...

review/text: This review comes from drinking it out of a coffee maker.<br /><br />- Earthy (red/dark brown) color<br />- Distinct smell (a bit like hay)<br />- the doubleshot suggestion seems to be quite strong. I would say stronger than most teas I've had.<br /><br />A friend who drinks a lot of tea said it reminds him of Postum tea.<br /><br />Most people who tried it (I shared it in the office) said something along the lines of: "Hmmm... Interesting". It wasn't the most positive response, but nobody seemed to dislike it. I felt similarly. It is interesting, but didn't sweep me off my feet. Co-workers did go for seconds when I made another pot.<br /><br />Obviously, this is tea, so don't expect it to taste like regular coffee espresso.<br /><br />note: I may edit this later if I try it prepared in a different way.

review/text: I used a real espresso machine (not a steam toy) and it made an excellent rooibos espresso.  A very good substitute for coffee espresso if you are trying to cut caffeine.  No need to tamp (pack) the rooibos.  I use a 1/8 cup measure, run the machine until drips come out, turn the machine off for 30 seconds, and then fill to 3 ounces in the brew cup.  At a little agave, and 5 ounce of steamed soy milk ( or milk).  An excellent cup better than Starbucks.

It has one of the biggest amounts of healthful antioxidants , minerals and other  just plain good stuff known to man.It is mostly seen in tea bag form.<br /><br />This tea does wonders for your overall well being and gives you a helping hand to health. There is nothing  else like it--not green nor white nor black. Its special...very special.<br /><br />Now with this large sized  bag---you DO NOT have to fool around with the small and hard to find tea bags anymore. This loose tea can be brewed  in a machine ,put into any loose tea holder be it  ball or spoon style or used in the pots that have that special  filter compartment for loose tea built for it.<br /><br />Add honey or other sweetners if you want or milk I suppose...but I only drink my "au naturale " . I am thinking HEALTH when I drink this tea not Coffee light and sweet.<br /><br />I am filled with wonder over what I ultimately found inside this awfully designed bag.<br /><br />I cannot believe that people use cream and sugar with this.........as the pictures show on the designs of this bag.But again its from South Africa and maybe thats how the English , Dutch people there take their Tea.<br /><br />But let me tell you again..that it is the finest , fine cut Rooboos tea you can find in a wonderfully made pouch........that has a  horrible design job and bad serving suggestions.<br /><br />This ones a WINNER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/text: I really want to share what an amazing food product this is, in my opinion. It tastes absolutely delicious, can be prepared and drunk like coffee, and has tonnes of health benefits! (See their website.)<br /><br />I should note that I was already a fan of rooibos tea and drink it regularly. The preparation method I am having most success with is using a stovetop espresso maker. These little coffee makers are super easy (and kind of fun) to use and very easy to clean up. The extraction is deep red and quite strong, which makes it feel to me a lot like coffee.<br /><br />I decided to try this out because I am not drinking coffee right now for health reasons, but love my morning ritual of making coffee and drinking a hot, strong, energizing brew. This has fit the bill perfectly, and my body has adjusted well to being caffeine-free for the most part.<br /><br />I drink mine with a fair amount of vanilla almond milk and a bit of sweetener - I'm sure milk and honey would be delicious too!<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended!

review/text: I was initially unsure what to make of this ..  I have always equated decaffeinated coffee with non-alcoholic beer.  what's the point?  However while this particular item may not appeal to me in some ways, I was drawn in by the taste and texture.  While it is a bit difficult to make, it has a very unusual but likeable taste, and the texture is almost creamy.  It tastes nothing like "real" coffee.  The actual product inside the bag looks like sawdust, and is so finely ground that pieces will inevitably make their way into your final brew.  Beyond this minor annoyance, I would have no qualms with drinking this again.  The taste takes some getting used to, but if you happen to be pregnant, or caffeine sensitive, this coffee is for you.  I like mine with a bit of milk.  Recommended if you're into this sort of thing, or just want to try something new.

review/text: I gave up caffeine 6 months ago and it was only possible because of traditional rooibos;  however, I really missed the luxury of a good espresso or cappuccino.  Red Espresso is almost that product.<br /><br />You really can use a Bialletti to get a good strong base; but the thick, red liquid with its lovely creme is no espresso.  It has a very strong tea taste, almost over brewed and a lot of the tannin flavours that are normally so delicate in rooibos are suddenly the most prevalent aspect of the beverage.<br /><br />It is not without merit:  red con leche; red latte, and red cappuccino are all wonderfully comforting and tasty drinks that are in many ways superior to their decaffeinated coffee alternatives, but without milk the flavour was not as enjoyable as a nice cup of brewed rooibos.

review/summary: Tea in the automatic espresso maker
review/text: I'll start this by stating that I've never been much of a tea drinker.  When I do have tea, I find myself consciously criticizing it as being too weak.  I've always left tea bags or loose tea to steep far longer than most, and for tea bags, I've always used a spoon to squeeze any remaining "concentrate" from the bag in my attempt to make it as strong as possible.  Seeing the Red Espresso peaked my interest, particularly because I recently splurged on a semi-automatic espresso maker, which does everything automatically except for steaming the milk.<br /><br />I was certainly surprised by the smell upon opening the bag; it was a strong smell, not pleasant, but was similar to an odor of laundry that's been forgotten for days in the washer.  Fortunately, this isn't highly apparent in the finished product.  My automatic espresso maker requires the use of an override function when using pre-ground coffee, or in this case, tea.  One limitation to using the override feature is the somewhat limited quantity of powder that can be used - about 2 tablespoons full.  I've found my machine doesn't make good espresso with this little coffee, so was curious how the tea would come out.<br /><br />Following the instructions, I brewed several shots, using the water quantity as the variable.  The first shots were weak and tepid, similar to the few coffee shots I've tried to product from pre-ground coffee.  When pulling back on the water to about half, I was able to get quite strong and flavorful shots of tea, which has a nice rich taste to it.  Everyone's preference varies, and I'm sure my taste in tea would probably be too strong for a usual tea drinker, but the ability to vary the water is the key to success for not brewing weak tea.  I tried Red Espresso without milk, with milk, without Equal, and with Equal.  I think my favorite was one of the shots pulled with minimal water (strong), with a little milk and about 1/2 of an equal packet.<br /><br />After trying this tea I can't say I'm one of the new consumers, and I believe the limitations of my espresso maker may have caused some of the poor results I experienced.  The machine I have is designed with the principle of fresh grinding beans, a good tamp, and plenty of extraction.  Despite my efforts, I wasn't able to get full extraction from this tea, and being my first experience with espresso tea, I'm not sure if there is something I could have done to extract more.  I give it 3 stars.

review/text: Red Espresso Rooibos Tea is marketed as a coffee substitute, and it isn't.  The flavor is a passable tea flavor, but lacks the body to make it coffee-ish.<br /><br />Taken on its own merits, it isn't bad.  The flavor is very similar to a black tea, but the color is a deep red.  Prepared like a brewed coffee (drip or french press) the flavor was mild compared to coffee, but strong compared to tea.  Prepared in an espresso maker, the flavor gained so character, but was very thin compared to espresso.<br /><br />Meh.  If you're trying to get caffine out of your life, it might have something to offer you.  It was interesting to try, but I won't order it again.<br /><br />E. M. Van Court

review/summary: Works with the Keurig machine too!
review/text: Red Espresso� Rooibos Tea Espresso, 8.8-Ounce Pouches:<br /><br />When I ordered this tea, I hadn't realized it required an actual espresso machine. So it sat going unused. I wanted to bring it over to my friend who has a really fancy (read expen$ive) espresso machine, but as is normal, it needs repairs. So the tea sat.<br /><br />Today I was in the mood for a cup of tea, so was going to do what I usually do. Take a teabag and use my Keurig coffee machine to pump hot water in to the cup and brew it.  A lightning bolt hit! I have an unused "My K-Cup" cartridge for the Keurig that has sat unused. I gave up grinding when I got it and the My K-Cup came in the Costco kit. What if I put the redespresso tea in the My K-Cup. Worst that would happen is I get out my teabag and do it the old way. I measured in about 1 1/8 tablespoons in to the basket. Sealed it and popped it into the machine.  I chose the 8oz. size and pumped a mug of tea. By gosh it worked! I got a really beautiful dark red mug of tea. The filter held the leaves perfectly and it tasted GREAT! Really rich and bold. I'm not a tea efficianato so I can't give all the flowery details BUT I can say it was tasty and it worked. So I can recommend this if you have a Keurig and want to try this with your My K-Cup cartridge. Thumbs up!

review/summary: Tastes good but definitely not like espresso
review/text: My husband and I tried this red espresso tea and have had mixed reviews.  Initially he thought it was great and I thought it was not-so-great, and now we he would give it a three while I would give it a five, so I split the difference for the four stars.<br /><br />Initially I expected this drink to have a taste in the vicinity of espresso.  It does not taste like espresso at all and it did not taste like tea either.  We prepared the tea per the package directions of using a cappucino machine and adding steamed, frothed milk and some honey.  All subsequent times we flavored by using plain sugar instead of honey and I thought that was better.  The taste of this drink grew on me over time.<br /><br />While it was a nice drink, the product is pricey and I probably wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: Different and Pleasant Tasting Tea Beverage
review/text: I have been a tea connoisseur for a number of years so I was pretty excited about trying this Red espresso Rooibos tea.  It is definitely pleasant tasting and can easily become a substitute for coffee and tea drinkers who wish to cut down their caffeine intake.  Personally I think that caffeine is part of the magic of tea and coffee and drinking these beverages without the stimulant effect of caffeine is like eating chocolate that is not sweet.<br /><br />Though this tea definitely has a unique appearance and taste, it would be great to have a regular caffeinated version that can be consumed for its taste and stimulant effect.<br /><br />*** Positive Points: ***<br /><br />+ Unique taste for a tea<br />+ claims to have the same antioxidants as normal tea<br /><br />*** Negative Points: ***<br /><br />- No caffeinated version for people who like the stimulant effects of tea and coffee<br />- Somewhat pricey<br />- A bit difficult to prepare for the uninitated<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />A unique and different type of tea that most coffee and tea lovers should try at least once.

review/summary: Neither tea, nor espresso, and meh in flavor
review/text: Let me start by saying I love tea, and have cupboards full of it, which I drink regularly.  I also love my coffee, and drink espresso regularly (though mostly for the caffeine, rather than the flavor) -- all of which may of course leave something to be said for my neurons.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the premise of this new sounding substance, so I tried it happily.  I was unimpressed by the flavor, however -- it wasn't quite bitter, but it was everything approaching bitter that I could think of.  I just didn't want to finish it.  It was thin, like water, but felt thick on my tongue (weird to type, weird to read, but even weirder to feel, I assure you).  And I love rooibos teas, normally.<br /><br />I made this in a French press style pot, but I doubt it would be much better in an espresso machine.<br /><br />While only a semantic distinction, note that this is neither a true "tea" nor an espresso.  And the flavor, well, the flavor left me unimpressed.  I hate throwing things away, but I honestly can't imagine going back to this when I have so many other delicious teas to turn to, and real coffee with the reward of caffeine if I dare to have something slightly bitter-like on my tongue.

review/summary: This drink doesn't fit in either category.
review/text: I am both an avid tea drinker and sort of a manic coffee person.  I have definite likes and dislikes when it comes to both tea and coffee.  This beverage sort of fits into a "no man's land" when it comes to either.  I tried it as espresso (as the name suggests) and ended up with a murky,thick, sludge like drink that was anything "but" espresso.  Next, I tried it as a tea in the finest mesh strainer that I have, same results... terrible.  I tried it hot, I tried it cold.  It was like trying to make a beverage with the fine grit left at the bottom of my vacuum cleaner bag and had about the same appeal.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because rooibos is chocked full of health benefits and it is 'supposed' to be good for you.  That presupposes that you can stand to drink it.  I can't.  Rooibos tea is available in blends from major tea outlets such as TEVANA and I have tried it from other sources with no difficulty in preparation or loss of flavor.  It is not the rooibos that I object to, it is the way this manufacturer chooses to process it and way you will have to scramble to find a way to fix it that you can at least drink it.<br /><br />There are too many enjoyable flavors of tea and coffee for me to sample without all the irritation and drama that this product causes me to go through.<br /><br />I was not in any way happy that they chose to call it "espresso" as it is far from it.  It is as a matter of fact far from anything that I want to experience again.  Go buy some rooibos tea or espresso and enjoy them.  This is a failed experiment and a terribly misleading product in my opinion.

review/summary: convenient rooibos with a rich flavor
review/text: I like rooibos tea but don't drink it often because it is a little troublesome to prepare. You have to steep it for a few minutes, and since Rooibos tea leaves are small (even a fine mesh tea ball can't always strain them) you often get leaves in your drink and a mess in your teapot.<br /><br />I used a manual coffee maker to prepare the Red Espresso. It was great!<br /><br />The special espresso grind gives you rich, strong rooibos flavor in a very short time, without risk of over-steeping or the mess of leaves.<br /><br />Making a latte out of the resulting liquid yields a rich, luxurious drink. It also makes a delicious iced tea.<br /><br />The packaging says caffeine-free, but for me, the tea seemed a little stimulating anyhow. I felt pretty energized after drinking it. So for me it's a good choice for caffeine-free energy.<br /><br />Only one thing to note: once or twice, I noticed that the ground rooibos clogged my coffee filter.

review/summary: Healthful and tasty!
review/text: Red Espresso is a great idea for health minded persons who love brewed drinks such as lattes. This is high-quality rooibos ground fine to be used in an espresso machine.<br /><br />Rooibos is an herb traditionally used for tea in Africa. It has many health benefits, is very mild and non-acidic. It is also completely caffeine free! Rooibos is good for the stomach and there are promising studies showing it helps with insomnia and headaches.<br /><br />Rooibos has a mild, earthy flavor that is very pleasant with milk or cream. The flavor is not to be compared with espresso or tea. It has no bitterness or bite, tannins or acidity.

review/summary: Sorry, no cafe revolution for us.  Marketing letdown.
review/text: My husband was thrilled when this arrived-- he'd been intending to buy some to try.  However, we were both less than impressed.<br /><br />My husband's an obsessive master of the espresso machine, and despite several attempts, his shots of Red Espresso included almost none of the rich crema pictured in its advertising.<br /><br />We're both espresso and tea drinkers, but this hybrid of the two left us pretty cold.  It's novel to make tea with the espresso machine, I guess, but grassy strong muddy tea isn't my idea of a good drink.  Adding milk and sweetener helps, but it's still not ringing my bells-- or my husband's.  The taste lingers in your mouth, and since we didn't much care for the taste, that's pretty unpleasant.<br /><br />It's pretty expensive, too, at over twenty dollars a pound and about a dollar a serving.  The claims on antioxidants are interesting (5x more than green tea?  really?  according to who?), but there are plenty of foods we actually like with antioxidants in them-- I think we'll pass on this one.  I'd rather drink five glasses of the Republic of Tea's orange spice green tea than choke down a shot (or sweetened latte) of this stuff.<br /><br />Bleugh.

review/summary: just don't drink it straight; as a mix it's quite refreshing
review/text: The idea for making tea in a coffeepot doesn't occur to an average person, and for that Red Espresso is to be commended. However, for a tea drinker like myself, finding a coffeepot to make tea isn't always the easiest solution.<br /><br />And yet, you can ignore all the reviewers who say that they were unable to try this drink without having a cappuccino machine. Although one needs a coffeemaker to make the tea - any coffeemaker from an expansive espresso to a simple drip machine will do.<br /><br />When I was making this rooibos tea, I had to go to work to make it and coworkers drifted in from their workspace to find out from where the luscious, rich smell of tea was emanating. a few were turned off by the idea of drinking tea from a coffeepot, but most were willing to entertain the idea.<br /><br />For them, just like for myself, the taste seemed interesting. By itself Red Espresso drink is too strong and too demanding. When mixed with apple juice though, the tea absolves all the acidic properties of the juice and the juice highlights the flavor of the tea. The tea becomes subtle and refreshing and spontaneous at the same time.<br /><br />I have yet to try other variations of this drink (the website has quite a few suggestions), but I found that drinking it as an iced tea is sufficient to keep me pleased ad to make me want to buy more of it (and to grab a coffeemaker while I'm at it).

review/summary: Solid product - Maybe not for everyone
review/text: I drink a fair amount of coffee, and have for many years.  I drink some tea (mostly green and Earl Grey or Darjeeling) and have had Roobois tea before.<br /><br />True to its name, this stuff produces a super-concentrated Roobois flavored beverage.  I don't own an espresso maker and brewed it in French presses without much problem. The tea itself is very fine and you need to make sure your press screen has no holes in it and fits snugly or you'll be sipping red sand. I drank it in the evening and had no jitters or caffeine-type sleeplessness.<br /><br />When mixed with honey and milk, it reminds me of Thai tea (which is often black tea colored with tamarind and ends up with a similar color to this tea).  I hit their website and checked out the recipes, but preferred to add a bit of vanilla sugar, half and half, and cinnamon.  When I drank it straight, the flavor was kind of earthy and I found the flavor much better hot than after it sat in the press for about 10 minutes.<br /><br />Notes: this beverage is orange-red and will probably stain clothing. Be careful.

review/summary: Good Flavor but Mediocre Perfomance
review/text: This tea has an excellent rooibos flavor that I really enjoy. I made this tea three ways so here are the three short reviews of each method:<br /><br />Drip Coffee Pot: The package says you can do it, but the tea swells up and backed up my coffee maker something fierce. Taste was full flavored but not too heavy, despite missing a good portion of water that was supposed to drip through and never did. After this incident I decided I would try a different way and just tossed a coffee filter tied with tea in the bottom and tied off at at the top with some cotton thread into the bottom of the pot and ran plain hot water through the maker and it turned out much better. Would achieve the same results from the stove and boiling water, too.<br /><br />French Press: This was the best way of making the tea so far. Since the tea tended to swell up when I added water to it, using the press was the best method because it's pretty difficult to clog a french press.<br /><br />Espresso Machine: I enjoy drinking hot tea for maybe a half hour at a time so there was no real benefit in making a small amount. I still had difficulties with it brewing properly and the whole process just wasn't worth it.

review/summary: Intense flavor
review/text: This product brings rooibos tea out of the boring closet into the bright light of day. When made using enough tea, the flavor is deep and intense, and fabulous when mixed with foaming hot soy milk in a latte. Most rooibos tea is, to my taste, either wimpy or slightly bitter - this is neither. It is full-bodied and delicious, so full-bodied that it belies its status as a caffeine-free beverage. The jolt comes from the intensity of the flavor, not from caffeine. My only  quibble is that the directions on the bag are entirely imprecise -- we really had to experiment to get the correct proportions. But, the effort was worth it for the delicious result.

I probably will not use the remain product I have and wouldn't recommend this to people unless they specifically wanted something that has a high antioxidant content or is caffeine free.

I've noticed some coffee house chains offering Rooibos drinks and the ones that I have tried are quite tasty. I used my regular low end espresso maker to make a pot of Red Espresso� Rooibos Tea Espresso and it turned out great. It has a pleasant smell, I think, and a beautiful color. I just mixed it with milk. It tastes a lot better sweet, but even without adding anything has a slight natural sweetness. This is a convenient way to enjoy "Red Espresso". I'm really enjoying this tea.

review/summary: Complicated Taste
review/text: I made a pot of this up in a percolator, no worries. Good, dense flavor and interesting color. It's actually a very dark walnutty type of red. The taste is somewhere between herbal, gently spicy and dense. Not quite coffee but definitely not weak. I'd say this is about as dense in flavor as a good British Black Tea, like PG tips.<br /><br />I added cream and sugar and found it to be quite lovely. It may do as an alternative for caffeinated coffee because it is so very strong. I went back to the percolator to make up a second batch and discovered that the groans had plugged up the filter basket.<br /><br />It's a bit thicker after it's hydrated than I expected. Definitely something you could get used to, though. I find myself wondering how this would be served up like an ice coffee - twice as strong with loads of ice.

review/text: I really enjoyed drinking this tea. In fact, I'm nearing the end of the pouch and ready to order more. It is very mild and not bitter at all due to the low tannin content. The flavor is mildly sweet and very smooth. Mixed with orange or apple juice, it's great served cold over ice as well.<br /><br />Considering the fact that this tea has very high antioxidant levels, I'll be continuing to drink this a couple of times a day. I did find the tea made me hungry though, so if weight loss is your goal, this tea will probably stimulate your appetite so it would be best to drink it before a meal.

review/summary: good tea - not for coffee drinkers
review/text: I happen to be a coffee and a tea drinker so I liked Red Espresso Rooibus Tea but I was disappointed.  For some reason, I expected this tea to taste more like coffee.  Instead, I had a very tasty cup of tea with steamed milk and sugar.<br /><br />My espresso machine has been loaned to one of my college kids so I chose to use my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B70 Gourmet Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a> with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>.  The tea is a very fine grind, what you would expect for espresso machines, and I carefully measured it into the filter and attempted to tamp it down.  I didn't have much luck as dried tea doesn't compress like finely ground coffee.  I set my Keurig to the smallest cup setting and the temperature to the highest and pressed the brew button.<br /><br />The tea came out with a lovely red color and I added steamed milk and sugar to my taste and took a sip of this red concoction.  Good tea - I was expecting something a little stronger with a little of the bitterness of coffee.  Still, good tea and it's decaf!<br /><br />The bag the tea comes it strongly recommends you use an espresso machine and suggests you log on to their website to see if your machine is compatible with their tea.  Because the tea packs differently than coffee, check out their website.  You wouldn't want to have something go terribly wrong during the brew process.  I knew I'd be able to use my Keurig to at least taste this product because you can buy tea in k-cups but I suspect the tea will be more flavorful brewed for espresso or in a french press.

I even tried it in my Mr.Coffee iced tea maker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYO8AK">Mr. Coffee TM3-2 3-Quart Ice Tea Maker</a> .Minute I saw this  I thought I would simply give it a try as a iced tea, as I am currently in the process of giving up diet soda after reading countless articles on the net and news that is just isn't as good for us as say juices, teas,etc. I find this 'red' tea to be very mild and mellow as compared to say whites and greens which can be a bit bitter. It's also excellent as hot too. I still have one diet soda a day but in between I like drinking iced teas and crystal lite ,diet kool-aids etc. so in the summer I love to dig out my iced tea maker and have it around and found this tea in particular to be very delicious. I will definitly order some more so I can have it around the house during the summer for company for those who don't do coffee or diet sodas that much.

review/text: I though this was a great idea; I love tea and coffee!  I like strong beverages.  This combines all together.  The only thing is it is very pulpy coming from a regular drip coffeemaker, so I am thinking there is a better way to make this?  The taste is not bad, it is just that it is quite dense.  I am not sure I find the smell very enticing, either.  So, I am going to give it another try.  I had it with sweetener and coffeemate powder, so maybe I will try the honey that is suggested.  and the milk.

review/text: I love tea. I drink all kinds, but mostly strong, black teas. I drink my tea plane. No sugar, honey, milk or cream.<br /><br />This tea however was not for me.<br /><br />Upon opening the bag, I lowered my nose in a little to take a sniff and if burned my sinuses. That was a new one for me. I believe it was because it is so finely ground that the first smell went right up my nose. So I don't recommend taking a whiff right after you open the bag.<br />After I go my since of smell back, I carefully smelled it again and found it had a 2 aromas to it. One was a similar smell of a Red Bush/Cranberry/Orange tea from Harney teas called African Autumn. That part was nice. The second smell was a bit of a hay smell to it. It reminded me of the alfalfa we feed our guinea pigs.<br /><br />The resealable bag was nice, since tea has a shelf life when it comes to flavor. No complaints there.<br /><br />The taste was the same as the smell. Half good (the Red Bush flavor like the African Autumn tea), and half not so good (the part that has an flavor/aroma of Alfalfa).<br /><br />If you like a tea with a earthy taste to it, this may be the one for you. However, it wasn't to my liking.

review/text: I'm not quite sure what I expected from this product, and after sampling it I'm not quite sure what it is.<br /><br />This is actually not a "tea" at all, but rather Roobios (Aspalathus Linearis), ground up into what the manufacturer calls "Espresso ground". In actuality, the ground is a bit more course than espresso.<br /><br />First of all, I must describe my espresso setup. I am using a Briel Lido espresso machine, which is a manual machine that makes coffee at about 180 degrees and has a 15 milibar pump.<br /><br />The instructions say to use 4 rounded teaspoons for a shot of espresso. I found that to be about two standard scoops. However, when I tried that, my machine had problems - unlike coffee, the "tea" doesn't provide a seal, and the first time I tried it, I had to hold the handle to keep the "tea" from going all over the place and ejecting the stuff all over. I discovered that using ONE scoop would work OK, although on some cups I still had to hold the handle closed.<br /><br />As to the flavor, well, it has it's own distinctive flavor, that is different from any "natural" tea. I did find out that you need to have boiling water for this tea to extract correctly. My machine allows me to heat the water either to about 180 degrees, or to make it steaming hot (to be diverted to the froth mechanism, but it will go out through the coffee filter is you turn on the pump). When one uses boiling water, the tea tastes good. However, if your coffee maker does not allow you to divert the boiling water to your coffee, this tea will not taste right. Actually, although I abhor them, this tea would make well with a steam powered espresso maker (which boils the water to force water through the coffee). It might also do very well with the traditional stove top Italian espresso maker, where the water is forced up from the bottom, or even an old fashioned perculator. I don't think it would taste good in a standard coffee maker, because in my opinion the water needs to be forced through the "tea".<br /><br />I can't really describe the flavor. It is not very bitter (I drink it straight), and is is somewhat "earthy". OK, some people might say it tastes like what one would think tree bark might taste like, but then it is a natural "Tea"; it isn't going to taste like any normal tea or coffee drink. When prepared with boiling water, I actually liked the flavor - but it isn't my favorite hot drink.<br /><br />The packaging suggests making cappucino and latte, but there is no way that this was strong enough (in my opinion) to be able to make those two drinks. I didn't try it iced.<br /><br />Recommended? Well, I don't know. I gave it four stars for it's unique flavor, the very cool red color, and it's supposed health benefits. I'm not a natural foods person, so I don't know if any product health claims are correct. If you are into these kinds of natural "teas", then this one is worth a shot (pardon the pun).

review/summary: malty if brewed as directed...
review/text: I am a big tea drinker, with only the occasional coffee, but this product was just too malty for me. By "malty", I would also describe the flavor as having a "fermented" flavor to it which could not be made "tasty" by the addition of milk and sugar. The only way I have found to make this product tasty is by disregarding the directions and brewing it much weaker (or by mixing it with other tea blends). I was not able to enjoy this product as an "espresso", but brewing it as normal rooibos tea in my Zarafina tea maker produces a lovely cup of tea.<br /><br />Is this review helpful? Let me know. Please vote. :-)

review/summary: Break your espresso addiction with this healthy alternative
review/text: Let's get this straight up front: Rooibos tea espresso is tea, not coffee. Personally, I'm a coffee drinker by day and a tea drinker by night. Rooibos red tea reminded me of hot, brewed Chinese Oolong tea or Asian varieties other than green tea. It is earthy and slightly sweet without the bitter aftertaste I equate with decaffeinated coffee.<br /><br />Packed with antioxidants (the company claims five times more than green tea) this drink will appeal to the health-conscious; naturally caffeine-free makes this a suitable beverage to enjoy in the late afternoon, evening and just before bedtime.<br /><br />I drank mine straight, as I do my coffee. My wife enjoyed her cup with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E12S">Miller's Honey</a>. We're going to try the fresh red recipe next - a double shot of red espresso Rooibos mixed with chilled fruit juice (they recommend apple juice) and served over the rocks.<br /><br />In summary, while I can't attest to the health claims - relieving insomnia, easing digestive disorders and calming the central nervous system - I can tell you this is an enjoyable beverage for a person who enjoys Asian teas. If you are looking for a coffee-flavored substitute you'll be disappointed. Rating: Five stars.

review/summary: I enjoyed it!
review/text: My cup of tea was delicious and very tasty.  Of course, I did add cream and sugar and it's hard for anything to taste bad with cream and sugar...<br /><br />When I opened the bag, it had a very nice earthy smell.  I used a stove top espresso machine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CF3Q6">Bialetti Moka Express 3-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a>, a spare that we don't use for our coffee, and the tea smelled marvelous while it was 'perking'.  I couldn't wait to try it!<br /><br />The color of the tea was an amazing, deep red.  The aroma as I poured the tea in my cup was wonderful.  The fragrance hinted at the rich flavor of the tea.<br /><br />After I added my cream and sugar and had a sip, I was very pleased.  The tea was delectable and full of flavor.  It had a nice feel in my mouth, with a slightly creamy texture.<br /><br />Some folks have a likened it to chai tea and I would agree there are some similarities.  Although this tea does not have the multitude of spices that a chai tea has.<br /><br />My mom was not interested in this tea AT ALL.  In fact, she thought it was terrible.  But, I enjoyed it!

review/summary: I love most teas.....
review/text: I am not a regular coffee drinker, but I do like a cup now and then. I am a tea drinker, and I enjoy most teas. The ones I don't like get extra sugar and I will finish it off not to waste it. I will not be finishing this bag. This is one of those things that look good on paper. I'm sure some might like it, but I did not, nor did my wife. I was disappointed to find that it does not taste like espresso or any kind of coffee. It's flavor is sharp, and not to my liking. Had it not been marketed as it was, I still do not think I would like the flavor. It's not that I do not like strong teas, it's just that this particular tea had a gritty, dirt-like taste that I could not get past. I wonder how it would be if it were pressed (I do not have one, and I don't know if it will just bring out more of the sharpness). The cost of this tea is another issue. For the price, I think you can create a wonderful blend, and still have money left over for a real espresso...or two. The only thing I can think of is trying to combine this with another tea to try to mask it, however, if you have to do that, something is wrong. I do not see this enhancing the flavor of a blend...though I suspect if you try hard enough you might find a combination that suits you. This certainly was not for us (my wife and I). Top that off with the smell and I was almost ready for another star reduction. It did not bother me as much as it bothered my wife. She had to , "air out," the kitchen. I din't think it was THAT bad, just very different and not very pleasant. I do like the resealable pouch. We resealed it quickly! By no means is this a coffee alternative. It's almost like thinking a vegi-burger (very few of which I actually like) will replace a hamburger. It will not, and neither will this.

review/summary: Polar likes/dislikes in our house
review/text: First, the technical:  It comes in attractive packaging with a good Ziploc seal that actually works.  I really had high hopes for this and give them an A+ for effort.<br /><br />When you open it, however, you clearly realize this has nothing to do with espresso.  There is a super-fine, orange-red dust that comes out almost like smoke and gets all over things.  Next, the texture of the tea is not small flat-like crushed leaves like normal tea, but smallish woody/grassy splinter-shaped material.  It definitely does not tamp like espresso.  Also, being a tea, it does not brew like espresso.  It seems to take about 1-1/2 shots of water to extract the tea.  For a double-shot, this is 3 ounces or more (in 2 passes).  Next, the tea expands into a relatively hard puck more like particle board.  You will have to do some real banging to dislodge it from the portafilter.  I wound up using a fork which furthers the mess.  The fines also got stuck (a bit) in the screen.  Thus, I found the whole "espresso" brewing process a bit of a farce.<br /><br />Next, the taste.  It does create a nice crema which is sort of surprising.  The aroma and taste remind me distinctly of Thai tea.  The taste is about 1/2 Thai tea and half wood/sawdust.  I personally did not like it and could only finish about 2/3 of a mug (with steamed milk).  I personally would rather just buy Thai tea which is available from a local Asian store for $2 or $3 a pound and brew it in a standard drip coffee pot.  I think this tastes better, is less mess, and is vastly cheaper.  If you've every used Thai tea, you'll recognize the orange-red spice/dust that tends to get all over.<br /><br />I would have given it 1 star, but my wife absolutely loved it.  Maybe it was the novelty or maybe it was that it was like Thai tea, but she really liked it.  Given the price, though, it might not be an every-day type of tea.  I would recommend that if you are familiar with Thai tea and like the taste, then stick with it.  If not, give this a try.  It's worth a shot just for the experience.

review/summary: Simialr to Thai Tea
review/text: I brewed this in my coffee maker and mixed it w/ condensed milk.<br /><br />The result was a taste similar to Thai Tea. I absolutely loved it. It was more like tea as opposed to coffee though. There's a hint of the expresso scent, but overall, it tasted and felt more like Thai Tea.<br /><br />The brew was a nice reddish brown concoction.<br /><br />Actually, I'd highly recommend this product, and plan on buying this product myself for personal and party usage. The only thing I would have preferred would for it to have been a caffeeine beverage as opposed to caffeine free.

review/summary: Flavorful TEA beverage
review/text: I think the name and description is a bit misleading. There is really nothing espresso-like about tea. It simply does not have the depth of flavor that coffee does.<br /><br />However, that being said, this is a very good flavored tea. It is very robust. It is also absolutely delicious as an iced tea with a touch of honey. Sugar just does not bring out the flavor like honey will.If you prefer mild or weak teas then this probably isn't for you. Red tea does have a somewhat unusual flavor if you've never had it but it is worth getting used to!<br /><br />I have had a couple of small problems brewing it in the coffeemaker. The tea tends to float and make a mess in the filter area.

review/summary: A fancy name for Chinese Red ( black) tea.
review/text: At first I thought this was more like instant espresso taste made with a something completely new, similar to tea.  When I got it, it is tea.  It's what Chinese call "red" tea aka black tea.  There's nothing wrong with it, it's just instead of something completely new, it's the same red tea I've had every since.<br /><br />Now, this does teach me a new way to brew tea.  Never thought of using a coffee or espresso machine on tea, and it actually came out pretty good.  We made a drink using this tea with coffee machine, added heavy dose of creamer and sugar - came out like Thai Tea, which you can find in most Chinese Cafe's.  It's a fairly popular drink, good taste.<br /><br />Then tried this with espresso machine, added condensed milk, this came out tasting like royal milk tea, which is a real bonus.  This drink is really expensive, in restaurants, it's about $3-$4 each, and if you buy instant mix it's about $0.50 each and it mixes about 4oz, so with this tea, it's a good deal.<br /><br />Although the item itself isn't something new, but it does bring new ways to enjoy the food.  Use some creativity and this product is fun and tasty!

review/summary: A Unique flavor!
review/text: I am drinking this Red Espresso Rooibos Tea as I write this.  It has a unique flavor....strong but not bitter though it does have a bit of an after taste.  I had to stain the tea because, despite the package instructions, I found it to be too gritty and twiggy when just mixed into water.  Even after staining, just looking into the drink shows lots of bits and pieces but NOW I do not taste or feel them as I drink it. It's like drinking a really dark roast or real expresso cup of coffee but it's really tea.  I've never had this type of tea before but I find it rather interesting and tasty.  Since it has no caffeine, I will be able to drink this after dinner without worries of being kept awake.  I love the fact that it is loaded with antioxidants!  I wish I could find the words to describe the flavor but if you like really strong dark tea, you'll like this one.  I recommend this strong flavored tea!

review/summary: Interesting New Approach To Tea
review/text: I was interested in the product as it seemed a good and healthy alternative to my normal choice of decaf expresso. First point to know - this is tea.  From the description and even the packaging it is sometimes easy to confuse with some kind of coffee. According to the packaging, it is quite good for you, with heavy antioxidents, and it also claims to relieve insomnia, help with digestive disorders, and calm your central nervous system.  They offer several recipes for ways to use the product which I did not try.  Unlike most teas, you use coffee preparation techniques to make Redespresso.<br /><br />Per the directions, I did prepare the tea in a french press.  It was a dark red color, and because the tea is finer than coffee, loose tea does get into the liquid.  The flavor was pleasant, but not overly distinctive for a tea.<br /><br />Overall, it was not as tasty as some of my other favorite teas.  It is an interesting idea and preparation, and if the health claims are true it makes for an interesting product when compared to coffee.  However, I suspect I will stick to some of my more flavorful tea alternatives.

review/summary: It isn't coffee and it isn't tea... so, what is it?
review/text: When I first saw this product, I thought that what the company had done was to take tea leaves and market them as a coffee alternative.  I was partially correct: they are marketing this product as a coffee alternative, but it isn't tea.  What we have here are finely-ground rooibos leaves.  Rooibos isn't tea, but when brewed in hot water, it produces a very pleasant tea-like infusion.<br /><br />The directions on the package state that this product can be prepared in an espresso machine (hence the name "red espresso"), as well as in a French press or even an automatic drip coffeemaker.  I don't own an espresso machine and I no longer have a French press, but I do have a very good quality coffeemaker, which I use to make cafe au lait every morning.  (For those not familiar, cafe au lait is similar to a latte, except there's no foam, and you don't necessarily have to use an espresso machine. I use a coffeemaker and I use about 2x or 3x as much ground coffee as one would use for a regular cup of coffee, while using less water; this produces a very concentrated brew that tastes similar to espresso, and I add it to hot milk.)<br /><br />I prepared this product in the same way that I prepare my cafe au lait every day: 4 heaping teaspoons of Red Espresso added to the filter basket, and 8 ounces of water (the "2 cups" mark on the carafe) to the reservoir.<br /><br />Within a few minutes, I had about 4 or 5 ounces of brewed "red espresso" in my carafe.  Where did the other 3 or 4 ounces of water go?  I looked in the filter basket, and that's where it was.  The dust from the finely-ground rooibos must have clogged the filter.  Fortunately it didn't overflow, but beware that it might overflow if you try to make several servings at once.<br /><br />I added the steaming red brew to my cup of hot milk and added some sugar, just like I do with my cafe au lait.  The aroma was pleasant: it smelled similar to Thai iced tea.  (A good sign, since I LOVE Thai iced tea!)  I took a sip, and sure enough, the similarity was still there.  It wasn't quite as strong or flavorful as Thai tea, and it didn't have the wonderful smokey undertones that Thai tea has, but it was enjoyable.  I'm sipping a cup right now as I write this, and I think it's the type of drink that I could see myself enjoying in the evening, when the lack of caffeine would be of particular benefit.<br /><br />In the future, I think I would like to try brewing it in a French press, as that would allow the leaves to steep longer, which would add much more flavor to the infusion.  In a drip coffeemaker, the leaves simply don't have enough time to steep.  An espresso machine, which uses high pressure to force water through the leaves, would probably do a better job as well.<br /><br />There is nothing coffee-like about this product, and including the words "espresso" and "tea" in the name is a bit misleading... but if you take it for what it is -- a tea-like herbal infusion that lends itself nicely to a variety of preparations -- this could be a very unique and satisfying product.  I certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is looking for something new and different to try.  And unlike products which have had the caffeine removed from them, this product is naturally caffeine free.  Enjoy!

review/text: This was a bit of a disappointment, it offered so much promise but the packaging is a bit vague on how to make the best use of it. I tried to make it up in two different ways but it did not seem to have any taste. One serving suggestion on the package suggests making it with Apple Juice, but, to be honest the Apple Juice tasted better on it's own.<br />If anyone can offer a better serving suggestion I will be willing to try it again and update my review.

review/summary: I did not care for this product
review/text: I am a tea drinker but I did not care for this tea.  I found it to have an overwhelming taste, smell and aftertaste.  I do not have an espresso maker so I brewed it in my coffee maker.  My wife's comment was, "I hope that smell doesn't stay in the coffee maker."  I've never had Rooibos tea before so I may not be used to it but I like most teas.  I tend to prefer black teas like Earl Grey (my favorite) and English Breakfast Tea.<br /><br />I gave this 3 stars because I didn't want to downrate a product just because it wasn't to my taste preference.  It may be a very good Rooibos but having never tried one before, I have nothing to compare to.  I just didn't care for it myself.

review/summary: Good tasting product.
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that I don't have an espresso maker. So I didn't really make this the way it's intended, and I didn't know what the water to tea ratio should be. I used the 4 teaspoons tea, put it in my gold mesh coffee filter and brewed it with 2 cups water (as measured by my coffee carafe) in my coffee maker. It turned out a very tasty, very strong reddish colored tea. I added cream the way I would coffee, but would never mistake it for coffee or espresso in any way. It tasted like very strong tea, and although I was quite aware of the tannin, it seemed surprisingly smooth for how strong I made it. An interesting, tasty product and I will enjoy this bag, but I don't think I'd purchase it - it's quite expensive and certainly can't replace my coffee!

review/summary: Something new--and delicious!
review/text: I've had red (Rooibos) tea before and liked the nutty flavor, but I was still dubious about something called Red Espresso.  This is Rooibos tea sourced from the Cedarberg Mountains of South Africa that has been treated to an espresso-grind texture.  You then treat it as you would regular espresso, using it in an espresso maker or French coffee press, for example.<br />The first sign that this is going to be something you've never experienced, is the striking red/orange/brown color.  But it's the unique, rich, pleasing taste that hits it home.  It actually reminded us a bit of Thai iced tea, but served hot--we turned it into a cappuccino, adding steamed milk, a bit of foam and sweetened it with Stevia--it's something completely unique.<br />It also lends itself to lattes, and the package recommends turning it into an ice tea, mixing a double shot with fruit juice.  Haven't tried that one yet, because we're still enjoying the cappuccino.<br />Red Espresso is 100% naturally caffeine free and has more than five times the antioxidants of green tea.<br />We still like our cappuccinos the traditional way, too, but this is a nice way to wind down in the evening--and it smells great, too.

review/text: I've loved rooibos tea since I first tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LQU">Celestial Seasonings Madagascar Vanilla Red</a> not so long ago. This is a loose tea for use in your espresso machine, stovetop espresso maker, French press or coffee maker, so it takes a little more commitment (and time) than a bagged tea, but the results were well worth the effort. For my first batch, I used a French press and the results were strong (literally and figuratively). I added some milk and sugar and enjoyed 8 ounces of red tea bliss. Although it's smooth and creamy, this is not a tea I would drink straight, but then I prefer tea and coffee loaded with milk and sugar. Next time I think I'll try making a Thai tea-type iced beverage.  If I have one complaint, it's that rooibos tea contains no caffeine, because this would be the perfect caffeine delivery system.

I personally tried all three methods and really enjoyed the Red Espresso when made with the Senseo using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007INM5A">Ecopad Refillable Coffee Filter for the Senseo</a>. It produced a beautiful crema and the flavor was mild and indulgent. When I added a little sweetener, it didn't taste too much unlike Thai iced tea, one of my favorite beverages.<br /><br />I also tried it with a bit of fruit juice and/or milk, but really, this tea is wonderful on it's own, especially over ice.<br /><br />I can see espresso fans enjoying this for a change of pace, the richness of this tea makes a nice replacement beverage for coffee. Some people might prefer this beverage in the afternoons and evenings because of the fact it has no caffeine. Rooibos is also touted as aiding in digestion.<br /><br />The anti-oxidant levels per ml in this beverage far exceed most other beverages, according to their ORAC measurement (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity). The ORAC levels are indicated on the back of the package as:<br /><br />59 red espresso<br />11 green tea<br />10 beetroot juice<br />8  black tea<br />3  carrot juice<br /><br />Also, in addition to being high in anti-oxidants, this tea has no caffeine, making it ideal for very health conscious people.

review/text: This is a premium Rooibos herbal tea (with no caffeine) marketed as red espresso. The manufacturer recommends preparing this using an espresso machine but I prepared this as regular tea and it works great. It is good quality herbal tea that is rich in antioxidants that are known to scavenge tissue damaging free radicals. The health benefits of these compounds should persuade a health conscious person to try this product. Priced at $[...] for a pack of 2 (8.8 OZ each), I would say it is pricey for two bags of herbal tea. Other websites marketing herbal tea sell similar product at a much lower price.

review/summary: Rooibos Expresso Tea
review/text: This tea has a tart and woody flavor which is not at all unpleasant. When experimenting in brewing it I found it difficult to adjust the strength by either varying the amount of water or the tea. It is foolproof to brew and a great caffeine free warm drink substitute.

review/summary: healthy alternative to regular espresso
review/text: I received this drink from the Amazon prime program and I decided to try this drink out of sheer curiosity after passing it a couple of times when I was looking for something to review.  I never give much thought to coffee in any of its many forms such as cappuccino, espresso, lattes, half-cafs, and so on.  I would have to say that I drink more Tea than I do coffee so when I saw the tea espresso combo I became curious.<br /><br />So I get the package in my kitchen.  My first thought was what  am I going to do with this.  Do I make it like an espresso or put it in my tea maker.  So I decided to do both at the same time.  The visual aspect of the resulting brew is it appears as a cup of espresso dyed a powerful red.  Too red for my taste but let's see if it tastes good.<br /><br />Here, at the point of tasting the drink, 1st is the espresso;  It carries the red rooibos flavor via the consistency of a thick, punching espresso.  The red rooibos has a very distinctive, sugary flavor that is not exactly the same as coffee. While this is NOT delicious, healthy, robust and bold drink that is a great alternative to coffee but some die-hard coffee drinkers may find the flavor to be different and unusual at first.<br /><br />Up next is the tea.... According to the folks at Red Espresso, Red Espresso may also be brewed as a tea, but due to it's very fine grind it will make a much stronger cup of rooibos than what you would brew with normal rooibos leaves.  It can also be brewed in a regular style coffee maker or even in a french press!  I didn't like the texture of the tea.  Very hot, strong tea, in which the bag's been left for hours.  Not my type of tea.  If you like the taste and having a tea bag in your tea for hours then you should give this a try.<br /><br />My thoughts:  I wasn't expecting it to taste like espresso.  I also wasn't expecting that it would taste like tea. The problem with the arrangement, which I half-feared prior to consuming, is that the two don't blend all that well. It isn't bad, but it doesn't feel proper on either end. The texture for a rooibos drink is key to its amiability, and this just doesn't flow well.  Indeed this would be *an exceptionally healthy* alternative to regular espresso.  If you are a chronic espresso or coffee fiend, and your habit is causing you health related issues such as caffeine jitters, withdrawal symptoms, headache, insomnia, and so on, you switch from coffee to Red Espresso.  It is so much healthier for you than coffee that the health benefits are literally endless.  I think that where this product really shines is as an espresso substitute, and every espresso drinker should give it a try as a healthy alternative to coffee.

review/summary: Hard to compare to tea or coffee.
review/text: First, I prepared this product like you would cappuccino, I ran it through my espresso machine and served it with steamed milk and cinnamon.  It didn't taste like tea or coffee to me, and took a little getting used to, but it wasn't bad.  It's a strong, concentrated taste which reminds me of the smell of sweet, freshly baled hay.<br /><br />Next, I decided to brew it like coffee, which I didn't care for.  I don't like to add milk or sugar to my drinks and I would have preferred to have been able to drink it "black".<br /><br />I'm not going to give up though, I see they have many recipes posted on their website, so I'm going to visit it and see if I can come up with something I like, and then update my review.

review/summary: Red Espresso Rooibos Tea Expresso
review/text: I prepared the Red Espresso Rooibos Tea Espresso in a regular coffee machine. You can prepare it the same way you do coffee. It has a rich dark color that's so dark it barely has a hint of red.<br /><br />Rooibos is OK with me but has never been my favorite, (My favorite is Lipton's Bavarian Wild Berry) but it was a favorite of my husband's. He couldn't finish his and said that this has put him off Rooibos for a bit. I finished mine, but felt that it had a bit of an aftertaste. It also smells slightly burnt. It looks unpleasant and muddy when you have to go back and clean it out of the coffee maker.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars since taste is subjective and I could see how someone else could love this tea.

review/summary: Strong but delicious
review/text: I have been making this tea for the last two days and I have to say yumm overall.  I tried it with milk and sugar and it was okay but wasn't impressed.  I then made it up and decided to try it as Iced Tea and I really like this.  I put a shot of vanilla coffee flavoring in it with sugar and yumm, yumm.  Tomorrow I plan on trying it with the raspberry coffee flavoring and I'm sure it will be a hit.  I have company coming so it will be a nice treat since our main dish is going to be fish.  This is a very strong tea so it is best diluted unless you really like a punch.  I will try it as a latte over this weekend as that looks like it might be yummy.  It is well worth trying if you like red tea which I do.  I also like the fact that it is healthy for you.  Take a chance and be wild.  It's really pretty good.  You do need a french press or espresso machine so don't say I didn't tell yah.

review/text: This is an interesting brew, but I have to admit it tastes a bit different and has that "health" drink tang to it, I love black tea and good coffee so this is something I would drink to have instead of those two but never as a substitute. The flavor and scent is bit grassy, and makes me feel a bit like a farm animal when I drink it lol, for health benefits I prefer my green tea and mesh bags of Rooibos tea with nice flavors such as almond or coconut , I wouldn't buy this again even though its was free from Amazon...<br /><br />Other than the acidic flavor it's hard to make, prepare to have your coffee pot clogged up...not fun and not fast/easy for sure

review/summary: An excellent beverage for a former caf-fiend pregnant lady!
review/text: When I saw this product I was a little skeptical- after all, how can an herbal tea be used as a substitute for coffee or used to make shots like a latte? However, when my husband came home and we found a Vine promotional package of the stuff waiting for us, he made me a latte of the stuff using our Barista espresso machine. The shot of rooibos was a rather eerie red color that initially put me off, and made me wonder if it would turn my teeth red. However, after the initial sip, when I came to grips with the inevitable difference between a rooibos and espresso shot, I found that I actually enjoyed the tea-like flavor. Because I am pregnant, I was a little worried that it might not be healthy for me (even though it is caffeine-free) but after searching online I found that this herbal tea does not interfere with iron absorption like the tea plant, and is actually recommended during pregnancy. It may even have all kinds of health benefits, if you believe the health sites. I probably wouldn't have bought this if it hadn't been a promotional sample- but now that I have it, I'm quite happy about it and might even buy more once I run out....

review/text: As a self confessed coffee-a-holic who is obsessed with a variety of machines and methods for using the bean, I would have to say this is right up there with sliced bread.<br />I tried this using a FrancisFrancis! machine as well as a moka pot. Although the moka pot cup was murky, it was still delicious with a touch of honey and milk. The espresso machine pulled a clean shot that was slightly crisper. Do not expect a coffee knock off, but do expect an earthy and satifying shot of joy.

review/text: This product reminds me a lot of the tea used in Thai restaurants for Thai iced tea.  I enjoy the flavor quite a lot, but this is no way could substitute for coffee (whether espresso or made in a drip coffeemaker) for me.  It's definitely bold and richly flavored, but in no way does it have the intensity that a good, strong cup of coffee has.<br /><br />If you like a dark tea that's slightly sweet, you'll probably like this.

review/summary: Great service by Arizona Vanilla Company
review/text: After I had previously ordered and used up a 2 oz. Mexican Vanilla, I decided to try a Hawaiian Vanilla as I order the 8 oz bottle of Mexican Vanilla since the Mexican Vanilla was such a delicious difference maker in my baking.  I ordered this product with the Mex. Vanilla and Arizona Vanilla shipped them together for one low shipping rate.  They arrived far ahead of schedule.  I was anxious to make the Hawaiian White Chocolate macadamia Cookies with this Vanilla.  Mentioning the use of Hawaiian vanilla impresses the party guests (thanks to the cookies coming out with maximum perfection from chill and oven timing).  Although it impressed the guests, I found it to be no different from Kirkland (Costco brand) vanilla which cost much less per ounce.  The Mexican was enormously better, but not so much the Hawaiian.  It's fun to use it and I'm very happy with the Arizona Vanilla company is the reason why I'm giving it 3 stars, but sadly to say, it's not worth it.

review/summary: Excellent Bedtime Tea
review/text: Yogi Kava tea is an excellent bedtime tea. It has a pleasant aroma and soothing taste. I enjoy a cup of the tea in the evening to help me unwind. The tea has a natural, subtle sweetness, and a small touch of spiciness.  Even the aroma of the tea I find calming. I find it tastes better and works better than Chamomile.<br /><br />Kava has subtle flavors and works best when brewed with purified water. I have an Reverse Osmosis (RO) system, and enjoy making the tea with the RO water. Bottled water from the store also works. I have found it is best to make with water that is not quite boiling, and I let it steep a full five minutes. It is not a strong tea, so I typically leave the bag in the tea as I drink it. In fact, on occasion, I have used two tea bags per cup.

review/summary: Perfect memories, good cookie
review/text: Growing up in Mexico, we would buy a single pack of these cookies close to school very often. Those were happier times in that country, and finding the Barritas in the U.S. is a treat.<br /><br />They may not be the best cookies in the world, but they are pretty good. The dough is creamy and soft, and the jelly is made in  away that it prevents the cookie from completely crumbling when you bit it. But it will crumble regardless, so eat at your own risk.<br /><br />A slice of perfection.

review/summary: Delicious Apple Juice!
review/text: We ordered this after having Tree Top apple juice at Starbucks.  We could not find a place to buy it anywhere at our local stores.  This was exactly the same as Starbucks sells, only in a bottle instead of a juice box.  We were very happy with our purchase!

review/summary: shipping really high - buy at Wegman's
review/text: This product tastes good, but you can buy a container of each type for $9 at Wegman's. If you get it from this place, you pay $26 (TWENTY SIX!) for shipping and handling. Why? All I found was a freezer pack! What a ripoff. When I asked about the high shipping, the response was fairly snotty. When we received the product, we found it labeled "specially selected for Wegman's." Sure enough, next time we went, there it was. In addition, two of the containers had an expiration in two weeks! All in all, the shipping costs make this a big ripoff. Get it at Wegman's.

Finish is the key word here..there is absolutely no waste with Stella and Chewey's..All of the problems associated with canned food ..non-existent..no 1/2 cans of refrigerated leftovers gone to waste..I have tried EVERYTHING to give my animals the best possible diet..including making up raw diets for them myself.  this food is the perfect answer for us.

review/summary: My Very Particular Cat Loves This Food
review/text: I don't know if its the fact that Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Salmon and Chicken Dinner is hot when served to my cat or if its the extremely potent fishy taste that appeals to her.  Whatever it is, she anticipates eating this as soon as she senses that I am putting the kettle on to heat the water that will hydrate this food.<br /><br />Yes, this food does require some preparation, but it is minimal and not really worth mentioning as it takes more time to open up a can of soft cat food without cutting yourself.  I heat some water add it to the portion of food I have already placed aside in a container, swirl it around a bit and then drain the remaining water.  The idea is just to reconstitute the food.<br /><br />My only complaint about this offering is the fact that it needs to be protected by bubble wrap or styrofoam peanuts in order to insure that it arrives in one piece.  I have had it delivered to my home and upon opening the bag found that most of the food had been crushed to powder rather than the nuggets that my cat prefers to eat.<br /><br />Its a little tricky to determine just how much your cat will eat per sitting (standing:)  I find that if my cat does not finish her food, I must clean this out as it does harden and if left too long out will begin to emit a less than pleasant odor.<br /><br />The food is definitely nutritious no matter what else you feed your cat.  My cat eats kibble and I do serve this on top of the kibble so that any moisture emitted will also flavor the dry food.  I have found my cat to be much more alert and healthier since she has been eating this food.  Its expensive, but well worth the price for anyone who loves their pet.  My cat had been ailing for over a year and since I added this to her diet in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LW8VA4">Organix Adult Indoor Feline Dry Cat Food, 5.25 Pounds</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057YHTC6">Wellness Canned Cat Food, Sliced Turkey & Salmon Dinner, 24-Pack of 3 oz. Cans</a> in a variety of flavors, I have seen a marked difference for the better.<br /><br />Bottom line? Buy it, your cat will love you.  Just figure out ahead of time just how much of a portion you want to reconstitute before wasting this very expensive food. Insist on having your bag bubble wrapped to insure safe delivery.  Highly Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"

review/summary: Convenient way to give raw food
review/text: I'm very happy with the quality and palatability of this product.<br /><br />I had been feeding raw food to my two cats when one of them was diagnosed with secondary lung cancer. She became very fussy and would no longer eat much, if any, raw food. I wound up throwing out large amounts of the raw food I had been using. I found this product online and figured I would try it - at least it wouldn't spoil as fast, and maybe I could get some better quality food into both of my kitties. I was apprehensive when I tried it at first, but my sick kitty enjoys small amounts of it once it is rehydrated. She will also eat a little of it if I break up the dry nuggets into smaller pieces. The other kitty also likes it - so it may become part of my regular catfood purchases.<br /><br />The only drawback I can find is that the nuggets tend to break apart when the package is moved around such as in shipping. Not a problem for rehydrating, but a little messy.

review/summary: My cats love it. It's good for them, but it's a bit pricey
review/text: I feed my cats a raw-food diet. I feed this to them like treats. I sprinkle it on their regular food and they love it. You can safely feed this to your cats as their regular food (as long as you add water), but it's too pricey for me to feed it 100%. Apart from the price, I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Fantastic~You can not tell it is sugar free
review/text: Having just had a sugar free snow cone at the fair I decided to get some sugar free syrup for home. You cannot tell the difference between regular and this. There is no after aftertaste. It is made with Splenda and has Zero calories.<br /><br />I called the company and they told me that unopened it has an 18 month shelf life and opened it has a 12 month shelf life at room temp. You do not have to keep in the fridge although I am just so the ice doesn't melt as fast when I put it on.<br /><br />I also got the grape flavor. Both very good.

review/summary: Very Flavorful
review/text: For a Sugar Free Syrup, I found this very flavorful.  The Lemon-Lime is very refreshing.  One of the other things that I like is that it is not a deep green in color - so you don't have to worry about the stains (especially for kids)that the cherry and grape counterparts make!  Another reviewer mentioned it has an 18 month shelflife unopened, and a 12 month life once opened, but does not need refrigeration.  That reviewer mentioned refrigerating it to keep it cold so it wouldn't melt the ice so quickly - I completely agree.

review/summary: Just OK
review/text: I ordered this because it seemed to have the best reviews.  The only upside to me is that it's sugar free.  It's REALLY thick, intensely green, and the flavor is 2 star.  I'll go back to my Torani - I put about 25% regular lime and 75% sugar free lemon.  Sure, a little calories, but so much better!!  If you want to be really aware of how you are consuming something totally toxic for your body, then order this.  I'll stick with my Diet Coke and pretend it's not bad for me.

review/summary: Top Marks from a Tea Snob!
review/text: I had the fortune a couple of years ago to have a coworker bring in some of this tea that she had purchased on a trip to Seattle.  It quickly supplanted every other tea we had at work and threw us into a fit of doldrums when we began to run low.  Fortunately another coworker had relatives living in the area and were coming down for a visit, so a conjoling plea was able to provide us with months more supply of this tea.  Then it too ran out.<p>Fortunately, however, they included ordering information with the last supply, but that didn't stop me from bugging anyone I possibly knew with relatives, friends or even people in town from Seattle to see if I could cajole my way to more of this very excellent tea!<p>It's a nice, flavorful tea that is at once sweet without being sweetening.  It also works as a half-half blend with regular black tea to bring up the flavor and sweetness of black tea and minimizing the natural flavor of this tea.  We enjoy it iced, but it works well hot also.  I am both excited and pleased to see that it is being offered to a wider market and urge anyone that has even the slightest love for tea to order this product now!<p>(I, of course, use nothing but the loose leaf variety)

review/summary: Cinnamon Citrus Tea
review/text: As a classic Seattle tea, this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea. When I drink this tea, I am home again. This tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of Seattle in one cup.<br /><br />This is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors. You can sweeten this more if you like with Stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness. It is good with a touch of Muscovado Sugar from India Tree or the RIEME French vanilla syrup.<br /><br />When I'm writing reviews and I get sleepy, this tea<br />wakes me up.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
