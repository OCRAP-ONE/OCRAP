review/summary: A major disappointment.
review/text: I drank Tortuga's Rum Liquor Coffee at my girlfriend's apartment. We both claimed it was the best tasting coffee we ever had. She got it out of the country and after we finished the bag, I started to research whether I could buy it in the States. I thought I was doing good by buying the same coffee when I ordered these bags. It is the same company name and the same flavor, but I quickly learned the coffee is very different. The first couple times my girlfriend made it, I questioned whether she put too much water in the coffee machine. I knew she was not at fault when I made it myself. This coffee has barely any flavor, only a hint of what I originally tasted. It seems diluted or something. THe only difference I see in labeling/packaging is the original bag she had was goldish and the bag I ordered was red. I would love to learn what the deal is and where I could get the good stuff.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Brian

review/summary: Save Your Money, Don't Buy
review/text: This expensive rum flavored coffee is not worth your dollars.  I brewed it extra-strong after reading another reviewer's comments on its weakness.  I wished I'd paid more attention to their comments.  It had only the slightest hint possibly (and I'm being kind) of rum flavor.  I honestly couldn't tell the difference between its taste and a Walmart purchased regular ground coffee.  I'm not going to demand my money back or anything so radical as that but I do advise you to to heed my warning.  I've certainly made poor purchase decisions in the past and will surely make them in the future, but this is one I absolutely won't repeat.

review/text: This is the best Adobo I've ever tried. I use this on everything, meat dishes, salads, chili, seriously, everything. If you use Adobo, try this one. You'll never go back to your old brand, if that old brand isn't Frontier. Frontier really does have the freshest herbs I've ever had.

review/text: This is such a great spice mix (Adobo). Like the other reviewer said, it can be used on anything and everything. I've used it on everything from eggs to pasta salads to chicken to rice and it makes each one taste like something from a professional chef. I highly recommend this spice to everyone......try it! This does have salt in it (sea salt is the first ingredient) so don't get heavy handed with it (which I tend to do sometimes because I LOVE the flavor so much) or it can make the dish too salty. It's all ORGANIC too!

review/summary: Useful for variety and travel.
review/text: First, the bad parts: the canister is awkward. If you want some sprinkles of any item, sure this is fine, but if you are trying to get a teaspoonful of any one item offered for a recipe, expect to spend five minutes getting the proper amount.<br /><br />But this Six-Shaker does what it does very well, which is offer a lot of differing heat levels and flavors (raw to smokey) in one easy to transport canister. I take mine with me everywhere.<br /><br />Value? Well, it is a little steep for the couple spoonfuls of peppers in each chamber, but what you are paying for here is the round-robin with lots of selection in one device, not totting six different jars.<br /><br />Dave's Gourmet products are always high quality on the ingredients/flavor side of things, and this product is no exception. These are high-quality peppers (hint: want to know how to tell bad quality dried peppers? Well, they taste increasingly gritty and/or dusty because guess what? The sellers are extending the product with dust!).<br /><br />If you have one favorite dried powdered pepper though (say, chipolte flakes), then this isn't for you. You will use up your favorite long before the others are used and be stuck with orphan peppers for a long time. Me, I like variety.<br /><br />So if you like variety, hot peppers, and easy to transport this is a great assortment.

review/text: I've had this for about two weeks now and the habanero pepper flakes are almost empty. I've sampled all six spices and they all have great flavor. I've made beef jerky with the habanero flakes and it turned out great. Made turkey jerky with the New Mexico chili powder and that was great as well. I've been very pleased with this little spice set and I think it's a great addition to any spice cupboard as you can chose what heat level you are in the mood for.

review/text: These candies are great if they are NOT expired.  I have ordered these candies from several different sellers on multiple occasions and I have consistently received expired products.  Additionally, some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you can't tell when the product expires.  Beware of the following sellers as I have had trouble with each of them:  Toys Samurai, ABCTOY4me and ToysDiva.  I have reported each of them to Amazon (4 different complaints in the past 4 months) and Amazon has done nothing to stop them from sending out expired products or products with hidden expiration dates.

review/summary: Works for my dog - Even More So Than the Original Beef Flossies!
review/text: I recently tried these out for my dog despite being more expensive than the regular Flossies as she seems to have gotten a little bored of the regular Flossies. (I stopped giving them to her for a while to help increase her interest again) She's VERY picky when it comes to new things and is not very food motivated so often times I will have to give her something several times before she will try it. (then often times once she does she loves it!) I was shocked that she went for this right away and absolutely loves it!<br /><br />I don't buy them that often so every time I do buy them she is so happy she can barely wait for me to get the packaging off! Speaking of, although I like when items are indiviudally wrapped it is kind of annoying having to get the shrink wrap off the product without breaking it, but I'm sure the reason why Merrick does this is because they do have quite a smell to them.<br /><br />Although the smell isn't pleasant it DOES NOT seem to resonate in the dogs mouth, nor does it stain the carpets. My dog has a soft mouth and is not a strong chewer so these types of treats have always been fine for her. She usually will chew for about 20 minutes and then leave it, which I will pick up and save for later.<br /><br />I've actually caught her eating the whole thing in one sitting now that we have tried these, which is a rarity! These seem to be more "chewy" than the original beef Merrick Flossies - lately she will eat through the Flossies rather than chew on them as she used to, but these she seems to love getting into smaller pieces and picking it up in her mouth and just chewing til her hearts content.<br /><br />Of course not all treats work for all dogs but my pup loves them. I haven't been able to find them in stores except when I was on vacation 300 miles away, so for now I will continue to order on Amazon. It seems that the prices have gone down considerably from when they first came out with the product, although I would like to see better bulk savings!

review/text: I realized I was chewing A LOT of gum, and knew that aspartame isn't the best artificial sweetener. Tried Spry and liked it. Flavor last a fairly long time, but not as long as the convenience store selection. Also have to have 2-3 pieces for a good chew. I'll take xylitol over aspartame though. Best price for a sample pack of all 4 flavors. Fast shipping! I like their gum, but the fruit flavor gives me headaches. The same thing happens when I used to chew JuicyFruit. I think it is the artificial fruit flavoring (Spry uses both natural and artificial for fruit gum. The other 3 flavors are naturally flavored). No aspartame, can't complain. I'm happy!

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/text: This is the best white tea for the money. They don't cheat you by under-filling the tea bags like most inexpensive tea makers do. If you want quality tea and reasonable fill in the tea bag, this is the top choice. As for taste, there is none, so either buy a tea with taste, or add taste to this, or enjoy it as tasteless as I do. Also, it suffers from the common 'floating bag' problem so just use a spoon and hold it down.

review/text: Bought this white tea because unable to get it in any store in my area.  Mild tasting but good flavor.  Great price for all that I have seen in many places.  Would I buy this again, YES.  You get alot for your money and worth it especially for the free shipping when at $25.00.  I never had white tea before but I like it better than the green tea.

review/summary: The Best Cookie/Wafer Ever!! Just too expensive.
review/text: I simply adore this wafer/cookie, but I was really dissapointed in the size and price. I have always bought this at Walgreens.  But, at Walgreens I buy it in a 12.3 ounce container at the price of 2 for $5.00. But they only carry it during the holidays.  So, when they ran out of it, that is when I got on line and ordered it from you.  It was my fault that I did not pay attention to the size and price.  When it was delivered I was shocked that the containers were so small.  I didn't even know that they made these in such a small container.  Do you carry the 12.3 ounce size?  If so, how much is it?  I would love to buy them from you again but not in such a small container for such a high price.  I would appreciate some info if you could let me know.<br /><br />Thanks for your help,<br /><br />Laurie Buckley<br /><br />lauriejbuckley@hotmail.com

review/text: Items weren't even shipped until after the projected span of delivery. I was willing to overlook that if these were amazing, but they were dry and seemed burnt. I taste nothing but the smokeyness of the chipotle pepper, like they seasoned it before roasting and burned all the seasoning. I can't really taste any of the salt or any of the other seasoning that is supposed to be there.

review/summary: Spice is great, jar needs some work
review/text: I had never had Chinese 5 Spice before, and boy, was I in for a really nice surprise! I like all the spices in it~ cinnamon, cloves, fennel, anise, and ginger. Putting them together into one "5 Spice" was genius. It's delicious, really. It says on the jar that you can use it on meats and poultry for a Chinese flavor, although I haven't tried that yet. Since I don't use any form of sugar or sugar substitute, I've used it as a sweetener on my plain yogurt or on oatmeal, that type of thing. I use it in place of plain cinnamon many times, for instance, on top of apple sauce or crushed pineapple.<br /><br />The only thing I'd recommend is putting a plastic shaker top onto the jar so you can sprinkle out the 5 Spice. I really don't want to have to either get a measuring spoon out just to use it, or else  have to sprinkle it into my palm and then onto the food. I had to get my own jar with sprinkle top and I don't think I should have had to do that.<br /><br />Other than that packaging detail, this is a great product... HIGHLY recommended!

review/text: versus<br />2.0 out of 5 stars false advertising on cans<br />I purchased two cases of Merricks Wingalings and Smothered Comfort. The label states "whole thighs" and "whole wings" but that is a lie. Once opened, the cans have one - if you're lucky two pieces. The rest (3/4 of each can) is processed cubes of who knows what my dog refuses to eat. Merricks should either fill the can with what they advertise - "WHOLE thighs and wings" - plural - or tell us what they have filled the can with.

review/summary: My Dogs Love This
review/text: I used to spend hours making food for my senior dogs.  They needed wholesome low, protein food that was appealing to them.  What a relief when our vet recommended the Merrick foods.  They particularly like the Smothered Comfort and Wing-A-Ling, but also enjoy Senior Medley and Thanksgiving Dinner.  I have to be careful about feeding one of my dogs too much of their food with beef - for some reason it doesn't agree with her.  But the turkey and chicken formulas have been great and both of my girls have been healthier with thicker, shinier coats. They get so excited at meal time.  The food does have whole fruit and vegetables in it.  If your dog is not used to them, they will probably not react well at first.  But with any new food, it's important to introduce it gradually.

review/summary: Loving it!
review/text: I've used the refrigerated Int. Delight Irish Creme before, and it's easily my favorite flavor. However, being a college student with a rather small fridge, it's hard to make sure I have it when I need it. It's also rather hard to go and pay $6 for a bottle that could easily expire if my power goes out in the dorm (which is often). I paid $.06 per individual package- far less than I would have otherwise.<br /><br />I went and bought this last week for the start of term, and I must say, having the single serve packages is much more convenient than a large bulky bottle. I can put the extras away in my closet, and keep a few out on my desk without worrying about keeping them cold. The taste is exactly the same as what you would find in the cold section of your supermarket. I highly recommend getting this if you love your creamer as much as I do, and are either on a budget or need the extra space in your fridge.

review/text: For the flavor, I will give it 5 stars. No need to explain. The coffee is Irish Creme without alcohol. So nice....<br />However, the packaging is bad. I give it 0 stars.<br />So over all, I rated it 3 stars.<br />192 creamer cups are loose in the big brown box. After long way to our door, some creamers are leaking and made other creamer cups sticky. All 192 creamer cups came in with brown manufacturer box instead of the one showing on the Amazon product page (please refer to the pictures I shared). Besides, the shelf life should be 6 months according to the customer service from International delight, but I ordered on May 29, 2011. The package was received on June 3, 2011. However, the creamer Expired on 08/10/11. I only have 2 months to consume 192 creamers.<br />I guess it is why the price is good. Something needs to be sacrificed!

This creamer survives the trip very well, with only the loss of a few little packets - they sometimes blow up or get crushed.  The great part is by getting it via Amazon's subscription service, I don't have to remember to buy it, I get it cheaper and it just shows up at the house!<br /><br />If you have products that you use regularly, I strongly recommend you look into the Amazon subscription service.

review/summary: Terrible packaging - so much breakage!
review/text: I love International Delight Irish Creme creamer.  If this was just a review of the product, I'd give it 5 stars for convenience and tastiness.  But, as with many other amazon reviews of this product, in all its flavors, and in all the variations of case size, my shipment arrived with only about half of the cups being useable.  ALL of the cups were dented, every single one of them.  At least 40% of them had tears in the tops, or the cups were split, resulting in about 75 cups that had leaked all over the entire contents of the box.  After throwing away the open ones, the remaining 100+ cups had to be washed by hand, one by one.  I thought those were okay/  But, as I used them, I frequently discovered cups that initially appeared to be undamaged, when opened for use revealed about half the liquid was gone and what remained was curdled and smelly.  So about another 50 cups got thrown out.  Due to this poorly thought out packaging, I eventually ended up with about 125 cups that had to be thrown away.  What a waste of money!

review/text: I was never a big coffee drinker.  I only drank it to stay awake.  So finding this creamer when I was leaving an early checkout from a hotel was like my world changing.  LOL!  I couldn't find this in my local supermarket, so I searched amazon, and they had it.  I was hesitant on buying it because I don't drink coffee that often, so why spend money on a creamer.  I went against my instincts and bought.  I drink coffee now three to four times a day.  I will not drink coffee without it and I'm not interested in drinking it without this creamer.  This is the best I've ever tasted!  The best part is that I don't see myself as a coffee addict, but an irish creme addict.  I will survive!

review/summary: Bad packaging - I got a box full of large ugly ants
review/text: I love this product, but I'll never by online again.  As near as I can tell not a single container was broken in my package, so I am guessing some other box broke and dripped into the packages Amazon shipped to me.  My wife has a sort of ant phobia, so when we opened this and about a thousand big nasty ants jumped out, it was not a good day at my home.  I had to take all the product outside in a laundry basket and hose it all off, after having "stomp dance" on all the little buggers that had escaped into the house.  After cleaning it off, I had to pick through every one of the containers to make sure they were sealed and had no ants within.  That's why I'm fairly sure some other package dripped into mine, I found no damage to any of the containers in my shipment.<br />(I see other reviews here where people received damaged packages with empty containers within - hey, I know where your creamer went!)<br />I don't even think they were "my" ants, these were of a type I've never seen before, I think they hitched a ride somewhere in transport, but there are so many species of these things only a bug expert could know for sure where they came from.<br />Since this stuff is fulfilled by Amazon from one of their warehouses, I'm pinning the blame on Amazon for this one.  It was a "no-think" to ship a product that had insect attractant (the product itself) dripped into it in storage.  At the minimum they should have sealed the box all the way around before shipping, which had not been done.  I'm not sure any packaging other then some foil sealed container would have helped keep ants out, they should have discarded the soiled product and only shipped clean packages.<br />If I ever order this stuff online again, I'm likely to be divorced.  No more consumables from Amazon that might attract bugs in shipping.  Your loss Amazon.

review/text: I've ordered the 192-pack of Irish Creme coffee creamer twice. The first time, it was great. The second time, which was delivered today, was a mess. Two of the creamers had leaked, so all were wet and messy. There was creamer running out of the bottom of the box. And, I think the shipper knew that there was a problem, because the cardboard box containing the bubble-wrapped creamers had been put inside a slightly larger cardboard box in an attempt to contain the leakage. I had to find the ones that had leaked and then wash and dry all the others (all 190 of them). It took a long time.

review/summary: Sticky mess...
review/text: As always, Amazon delivered quickly and as promised -- NO problems with Amazon packaging.  But, like many reviewers before have noted, the little creamer cups are haphazardly scattered in the inside box, which subjects them to crushing, opening and spilling.  Mine is no exception.  Not sure how many are salvagable -- looks like most of them, but those that haven't opened up and spilled are instead crushed.  This was to be a gift to accompany a Keurig coffee maker, and unfortunately, no amount of Christmas wrap will conceal the mess!

review/summary: Tastes as good as the refrigerated type
review/text: I bought this because our Grandkids like to raid the fridge and drink the creamer so there is none when it is time to drink our coffee. Plus, the individual servings are just the right amount. Not too much to overwhelm the taste of the coffee. Not quite the same as having some Bailey's in your coffee but next best thing.<br />Also the cost is so much less than the refrigerated version and frees some space in the fridge.

I was a bit nervous to order based on other reviews, but because of the price I decided to take a chance.  Be warned that these do not come packaged in a pretty manner.  They are bundled in bubble wrap in a large box.  I was lucky enough that none of my packages were broken and I didn't have any leaking containers. Other than that, the price was perfect and it will last me for quite a while.

review/text: I can say that this spice came well packaged and that there wasn't any loose in the box. Pretty impressive in my opinion. It seems strong and has a nice smell once opened. I have to admit though I don't use it for cooking. In my neighborhood there are quite a few inconsiderate pet owners. Cat owners that let their cats loose to pee and poop all over the neighborhood. Dog owners that let their dogs dig and destroy during their daily walk. I got fed up with how rude they were being, so I bought the cayenne pepper. I surround my front yard to my townhouse with it after every rainstorm. It has drastically cut down on the invasive pet species that roam the streets. Even an actual neighbor! Her dog wouldn't get close to my yard and pulled away. She reached down and picked up the pepper and sniffed it! I love this stuff and I will keep buying it as long as it's available!

review/summary: I must admit this stuff actually works...
review/text: Don't want to get into too much detail for my reasons on trying this tea.  I was searching the net looking for some sort of laxative that didn't last long and easy to take.  A pill form wasn't an option.  This tea seemed to be a good alternative for me because I drink tea almost every night.  I made sure to try this over the weekend just in case I needed quick access to a bathroom.  And I'm glad I did.  The next morning, let's just say I went with ease a few times.  I found this on sale at a local store and bought 2 boxes.  I gave it 4 stars only because I did have some painful cramping throughout the day before/during the multiple trips to the bathroom. But overall, it seems to do what it claims.  So if you're looking for a short lasting, easy to take laxative; give this tea a try.

review/text: We've used this product for years, and have loved it's flavor & consistency - always something you can count on!  We used to add the same spices using various recipes, but chili would always seem to come out differently each time.  No 'hit or miss' with this product - individual packets of each spice give you maximum control, should you want to add less.  We love this stuff so much, that we panic when we 'run low' at home (less than 3 kits), in case we can't find the Mix at our local grocery store!  So, we bought a case!

review/summary: Nothing fancy, but a good reliable chili that's on the table in 45 minutes
review/text: I may get serious about cooking... but sometimes we find ourselves standing in the grocery store and wondering what the heck to make tonight. For at least 20 years one of my most reliable standbys has been the Wick Fowler 2-Alarm chili -- largely because it tastes good, is natural (no sugar or other junk -- just spices), is very cheap, and can be thrown together with almost no effort. It also reheats very well the next day, so this is "convenience food" for us busy foodies.<br /><br />One of the reasons I like this mix is that it's very customizable. All the spices are supplied in individual packets, so you can adjust the heat by adding just a little of the "hot" chile (though even at the 2-alarm level it's not *super*spicy), or go light on the salt, etc. The basic mix calls for you to add 2 pounds of ground beef, an 8-oz can of tomato sauce, and two 8-oz cans of water. With the instructions' encouragement we usually add a can of pinto beans, too, and a can of diced tomatoes; we also substitute an amber ale for the water. See: It can be as complex as you want it to be. But cooking is simple: Brown the meat, dump in everything else, and simmer for half an hour. Add the masa packet at the end if you feel like it (and we usually do). Dinner's served.<br /><br />And did I mention this is delicious? Sure, I can spend an afternoon making a pot-o-red from scratch that's better than this. But this is darned tasty stuff that takes almost no time. While it simmers, I can do something else... like write an Amazon review!

review/text: My boyfriend tried this for the first time in the 80s. He's a sports journalist and had heard about it from his newspaper buddies back in the day. We've been making it consistently for 20 years. He likes it with ground buffalo meat, says it's a tiny bit sweet. It's also great with half ground turkey or beef and half pork. Adding a whole sauteed diced onion is a must. We add stewed tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms, olives, chili and kidney beans. Right, we're not from Texas. But it is excellent with some chunks of steak. We leave out the mesa; it's thick enough. Oh, and a tiny bit of Dave's Insanity Sauce pushes it to out of this world delicious.

review/text: We've been using Wick Fowler's mix for years and years. Our usual batch includes a couple small cans of the chopped green chilis, diced tomatoes, and lots of pinto or black beans. We use all the red pepper, and every bit of every spice, plop it in the crock pot, and bask in the aroma until it's done. My husband is a chili fanatic, and he'll add lots more heat in his bowl, like chopped habaneros. I like the recommendations of adding beer, and have also been tempted to add cocoa to give it that Mexican mole taste. A little red wine is also good. Thank God we can get this online, we're always stocked up and ready to go.

I bought some before Christmas (bought during a trip to New Orleans) and my family was in heaven again tasting the awesome flavors of Wick Fowler's 2 alarm chili.  I used up the last of my supply for the Christmas party chili - even my native northwestern neighbors loved it.  I was so happy to find some on Amazon, now we will be enjoying great chili again without traveling all the way back to Texas.

review/text: This is the best.  I love chili and I've tried it all.  Regular chili packs are half chili and half flour as well as other items.  This box comes with enough chili for about 5 pounds of hamburger.  From one box I usually have enough mix for almost two family meals of chili.  And the chili is good.  I've tried several different chili spice types to make it from scratch and what I;ve found is it costs more and no chili powder is as good as Wick's.  Then you have the mix to add cayanne pepper as well as other seasoning also including masa corn flour.  Nothing compares from a price or taste perspective.

review/summary: Best quality and most consistent chili mix ever.
review/text: Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili Kit, 3.625-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) is the best quality and most consistent chili mix ever. And this twelve pack is a bargain.<br /><br />I live in France, and when I want to make "real Texas chili" for my French friends I use Wick's, make it with stew meat, and serve it with plenty of corn tortillas. They always complain about the heat, but invariably eat more, and then want the recipe.<br /><br />I think the secret is keeping each ingredient in its own packet until you cook. The chili is seperate from the oregano is sepeperate from the cumin is separate from the red pepper is separate from the salt, each in their own packet. In the Carol Shelby competing product, it is just one spice packet you dump in. I think all the spices sitting next to each other begin to cancel each others flavors out on the shelf, whereas with Wick's they don't even meet up until your meat and onions have been sauteed.<br /><br />I have been using Wick's for 34 years, and every other chili mix I've tried has always failed to live up to this high quality, consistent product that well deserves its fabulous reputation among those who know their chili. Other than hand roasting your own ingredients from scratch, this is the best ready-made chili mix kit there is.

review/summary: can't find it at stores in my town
review/text: About 20 years ago my husband was installing drapes, and the woman was making chili, he remarked how good it smelled and she gave him a package.  We didn't make it right away but when we did we both liked it allot, until then we only had bland chili.  It was not available in our town so a coworker was going to Texas and my husband gave him money to buy us several packages, we don't eat this chili frequently because it is spicy and we had to get it from Texas.  About 10 or 15 years ago we found it in a Dillons store here in town.  My husband has passed away but my son was making it for me when I could no longer stand to cook it, we have about 4-5 time a year depending on the weather.  Last week my son brought home another brand because 2 Alarm Chili was not available anywhere in town.  We live in Lawrence Kansas and the other chili mix is not as good as 2Alarm.  There is a Walmart & Target stores along with Dillons & HyVe, would like it to be available again but if not we will order on internet.  Thanks for making such a good product..

He suggested I look on Amazon, and sure enough, there is was.  I bought it the same day and as soon as it arrived, I sent him a package with all his chili in it.  He's very pleased as he's always loved the chili!!

review/summary: GREAT CHILI
review/text: THIS PRODUCT PRODUCES THE BEST CHILI I HAVE EVER EATEN. IT'S SEVEN PACKAGES OF SPICES ALLOW TAILORING TO  TASTE OR HEALTH CONCERNS. IT IS SO VIBRANT WITH FLAVOR THAT EVEN BLAND GROUND TURKEY (USUALLY FLAVORLESS), TASTES RICH AND FULL-BODIED. IN ADDITION, I OFTEN ELIMINATE BEANS AND SUBSTITUTE MIXED VEGGIES, MAKING IT MORE A DIET FOOD. UNLIKE OTHER MIXES, ALL SPICES ARE IN SEPARATE PACKAGES ALLOWING ADJUSTMENTS TO TASTE. NO "ALL OR NONE" ATTITUDE HERE. THIS ADJUSTABILITY ALLOWS YOU TO CHOSE ALONG A SPECTRUM FROM "CHILD MILD" TO "MACHO HEAT".

review/summary: Very good for a quick bowl of red
review/text: I did a head-to-head comparison between this product and the competing Carroll Shelby kit; Wick Fowler came out ahead by a significant margin. WF had a deeper red color and more "three dimensional" flavor, whereas the CS was more brown and tasted mostly of cumin (smoky) instead of the full flavor of WF. I'd definitely recommend using beer instead of some of the water; I also add a can of tomatoes when I make it. The only downside to this particular deal is that Amazon's price is higher than my local store, but if it's not available locally to you, this would be a good buy.

review/summary: The Very Best
review/text: I discovered this while looking for a salt free option to chili powder (which is a mix of spices and includes salt).  Put the salt on the table for the guests.<br /><br />The best use is for shrimp fajitas; mix everything except the masa and in my case salt.  Sprinkle over raw, washed, divined shrimp and then saut&eacute; with onions and peppers.  Wraps, sour cream and maybe some cheese and you are in heaven.

review/summary: Wick Fowler Chili Kit
review/text: good stuff; makes great chili; can be tailored to your taste.  Good price, quick shipment. Have tried many "kits" and home recipes; when this lot runs out, I'll buy more Wick Fowlers until the local (very rural) stores wise up.

review/summary: I've been using this brand for more than 30 years
review/text: This stuff is great for making any kind of chili. I've used with beef as well and lentils and either way you get a unique Texas chili flavor. The quality is excellent and unchanged over the years.<br /><br />I have modified recipes over time to include saut&eacute;ed onions, garlic,  diced tomatos and roasted red peppers to keep things interesting.
