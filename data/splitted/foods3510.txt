review/text: Since tasting this orange blossom honey, can't go back to other cheapo brand at the shopper market. This is a high quality honey that you can now taste the difference when using other cheap honey's. Therefore, I'm a complete fan of this brand. Taste great in my teas. Will continue to buy. I'm gonna try the other flavors from Tropic Bee.

review/summary: It doesn't have any orange flavor
review/text: the color of the honey I received turns out much deaper than the color of the picture on Amazon.<br />I can't taste any orange flavor. The honey doesn't taste as good as other types of honey I tried. I was so looking forward to receiving this product After I ordered it. But now I am really disppointed.<br />It's a huge bottle. I don't like it. I don't think customers can return food products after they open and try, can they? well, I don't know what to do with this bottle of honey.

It is certainly pricer than clover honey in the store, but when adding calories, I want to get the most pleasure per calorie as I can.  If you're willing to pay more than the average honey price, then this stuff is a good choice.

review/summary: Quite bland
review/text: I picked up a jar of this recently at the store to make green curry chicken at home, and was very disappointed in the level of spiciness. I used a full 3/4 of the container along with a can of coconut milk and the other ingredients listed on the recipe on the jar (fish sauce, a little brown sugar etc). Even with that amount, the dish was barely flavorful, let alone spicy. My husband who really doesn't much care for spicy food said it was underwhelming, so overall it was really disappointing. The sauce did turn out smooth and creamy, but if it's a good, spicy green curry you are after, I'd try another brand!

review/summary: Don't bother, you'd get more flavor from pureed lettuce
review/text: Some few years ago, I'd use Thai Kitchen sauces and pastes and they tasted pretty good. It's a bit hard here to get lemongrass and other Thai ingredients other than fish sauce. We like Thai food--having traveled extensively in that country and sampled cuisine from north to south.<br /><br />Lately, the pastes and sauces have become absolutely bland, flavorless and nasty. The green curry is no exception. You can pile in the entire contents of this little jar and it will add absolutely no more flavor to a green curry in coconut milk than if you took all the stale lettuce from your vegetable crisper, pureed it into a green mush in your food processor and tried to use it as a curry paste. The result would be about the same.<br /><br />The saddest part of all this is that these products have taken a premier spot on many grocery store shelves and there is no competing brand. I love curry, and even "good" cooks will use curry pastes for convenience. (For example, there are Indian curry pastes by Patak that are relatively good, though of course not to the level that a superb cook can create. But they are acceptable.)<br /><br />These are NOT acceptable. If you try to make a green curry out of this, you are wasting time and money.

review/summary: Beware, Not the same anymore
review/text: I agree with all the other reviewers who say that this product is bland and used to be better.  I've used the red curry for years and had to only add a small amout to get the spiciness and flavor I wanted.  I don't like super spicy food so a half of a teapoon would be more than enough to set my mouth on fire.  Now, I can stick my finger in the jar and taste it without even so much as a tingle.  The flavor is not nearly the same as it used to be.  I had to add a lot more salt and add a different pepper to get my curry spicy.  I thought my tastebuds were off but when I saw all the reviews telling the same problem, I knew it wasn't me anymore.  I wouldn't waste my money on this again (nor would I recommend it to anyone else) and hopefully they revert back to their old recipe because I miss it.

review/text: Wow, what a disappointment.  I bought this because my grocery store doesn't have the ingredients available to make my own green curry paste, which is fine, because it looked like a great excuse to simplify making green curry chicken.  But this was some subpar stuff!  It didn't even have most of the ingredients my Thai cookbook listed for making green curry paste!  Absolutely no heat at all.  When I was done making my green curry chicken, it tasted nothing like any I've had at any Thai restaurant.  It reminded me of eating spanakopita - although it listed no dill in the ingredients, it had a dill-like taste.<br /><br />If anyone has any suggestions for adding something to this paste to make it decent, please do tell!  I hate to waste it if I don't have to.  I guess I could always make "Thai" inspired spanakopitas!

review/text: Since this product's launch my cat has been hooked.  He gets the best of the best and the Fancy Feast Medleys line is most assuredly that (I purchase all but the soufle varieties, which my cat seems to not care for as much).  In my local stores, a 12-pack of this would run me anywhere from $10 - $13.  It was worth that expense, but finding them on Amazon definitely has been a huge savings to me!  the subscribe and save option is perfect - I pay just a few dollars more for 24 cans than I would have for half that!  I won't even consider purchasing these in a store again - so long as Amazon has this phenomenal price and program, they have my business.<br /><br />On a side note - if you haven't ever seen these in person, the food actually looks quasi-edible for humans!  I take pride in serving my cat these, knowing he's getting a tasty and nutrious snack.  Also, though my cat doesn't care for the soufle variety, I know plenty that do.  Try them all and find Your cat's favorites!

review/text: Our vet suggested Fancy Feast when we found out our cat had diabetes a few months ago. We had always purchased good quality food before, but the cost of this stuff was still pretty shocking when I went comparison shopping in stores. Regardless, this particular combo has the highest amount of protein in each variety and that was our main concern for our little guy's health. The bulk ship and 15% saved with the monthly Subscribe and Save deal makes it a lot easier on the wallet and saves time. Our kitty has lost the weight he needed to and his coat has never been more beautiful. And he loves the stuff - although I admit that is probably mostly due to the fact that he used to subsist solely on dry food. ;)

review/summary: Kato and Dexter approved
review/text: I tried expensive wet cat foods to include EVO which is the dry cat food we use, but my cats gave me dirty looks and refused to eat it.  We tried at least 15 kids of wet cat food over the past couple of years and even tried feeding the cats straight fish, but when we'd set anything new down in front of them, they would look at it and band together in a hunger strike.  I would have fed them something more expensive if they would have eatten it, but this is what they want to eat.  I give up.  This is my cats' food forever.

review/summary: This should be a ten, but for certain ingredients
review/text: There is protein and then there is protein.  More than that, you should read and evaluate the "guaranteed analysis" of any of these cat foods, which comply with the only organization to evaluate same (and whose name I have forgotten.)<br />In addition these Elegant Medley foods, which should be unqualified treasures, seem to have the following ingredients that may be troublesome: wheat gluten; modified-corn starch; soy protein concentrate and/or soy flour.<br />I am not a scientist, (so this is rightfully subject to challenge) but someone familiar with the effects of celiac sprue in humans.  No one says this is sprue, (back in the day we used to call celiac-sprue "gluten intolerance") which is a fatal allergy if not caught, but the similarities between species' reactions are astounding.  Anything with gluten is a no-no.  Oats are generally acceptable in people, and so is corn, but corn will result in fat cats.<br />Assume that this info may apply to cat foods.  My cat walked away from the grilled variety pack (ASIN: B0010B6IFY) and refused to eat any of its three flavors.  In a real heartbreaker, he also dissed the "Delights," which also have wheat gluten, and may have corn starch-modified,soy protein concentrate, and/or soybean oil.  I  bought them because they contained cheddar cheese.  The vote is still out on his acceptance of the Elegant Medleys Collections.<br />The presentation of these foods is good enough for the Pump Room; they are gorgeous.  I have contacted Fancy Foods but nothing definitive has come back to me.  So unless or until it does, trial and error is best.  If the cats throw up, throw out the food or better yet, if you purchased them one at a time in a pet store, freeze what is left and then take them all back.  Nothing will get Fancy Feast's ear quicker than a bunch of us sending a bunch of food back.<br />In the meantime, here's a terrific source for you.  Her name is Franny Syufy, and she may be reached at cats.guide@about.com.  Or you can sign up for her series' on cats; there are several.

review/text: Our pair cannot ever seem to agree on the same food, be it canned or dry! This is the first one they both like! One likes only foods with sauce/gravy...the other likes only shredded texture....this satisfies both tastes at last! It is a bit pricey, so this isn't an everyday food though. The rest of the time they have to settle for dry and one of the less-fancy Fancy Feast flavors!

review/text: Hi all... this is my cat's favorite wet food... turns her nose up to most others.. however, I only give her a third of a can a day as a treat because it isn't very nutrient dense... it's best for cats to get the majority of their calories from a QUALITY dry food (we use Evo), this diet is much better on a cat's teeth as well as providing them with adequate vitamins and so forth... Please, do NOT only serve your cat wet food! (I'd compare that to only serving your child Koolade to drink)

review/summary: Smell of the Year!
review/text: I've been using this deodorant for 2 years now. I am a person that shops by smell when buying deodorant, so other features don't matter much to me. I first got a small sample of this deodorant and brought it along on my vacation. I came back associating my vacation with the smell of this deodorant. It smells amazing and reading the other reviews here, I felt compelled to write my bit in agreement. When I put this deodorant on, I feel like it would last until the end of the day. I would never have to worry about re-application ("24 hour protection"). It gives you confidence and makes you feel good knowing that you smell great, not to mention that it is composed of 1/4 translucent moisturizer ("smoother underarms in 5 days. go sleeveless!").

review/text: Most of the wetter deodorants sting after shaving...not this one. I've always been a fan of DOVE products but this latest deodorant is by far the BEST I've used across the board. Its not too sticky and not too dry and crumbly. And lasts all day. Plus the scent it to DIE for. This is a bargain, I bought 2 6 packs, should last a year! And the price is amazing. Just wish Amazon ships personal care items direct to Australia. It would be well worht the shipping costs!

review/summary: Excellent deodorant, great smell
review/text: I bought this based on the good reviews from other users and because I love the smell of the other Dove products in the cucumber scent. I figured it would smell nice and work like any other deodorant or anti-perspirant on the market, no big deal. It works BETTER than any other product I've used before and it smells fantastic! No greasy feeling when you apply it, no marks at all on your clothes after you apply it, it goes on dry and stays that way. Even in the high humidity and heat of east Texas combined with a day full of chasing dogs and horses around I did not find I had to reapply three or fours into my day. By the end of my day, I still felt and smelled fresh and clean. The Dove does cost more than other brands which at first glance is a negative, but then again in the long run I'm using less of it so it's a wash. (pun intended.)

review/summary: Better than Secret
review/text: I had been a Secret gal for years and years, but decided to give Dove Ultimate Clear a try when I was shopping at Sams Club and they were out of Secret. I didn't realize how effective it truly was until I switched back to Secret after running out of Dove. I suppose I never noticed it before, but Secret stops working after 8 hours or so and I can smell my armpit funk a little at the end of the day. I never had this problem with Dove. The cucumber and green tea scent is my favorite since the scent is pleasant without being too strong (I'm sensitive to most scents). It does go on clear and I haven't noticed any marks on my clothes when using it. I'm a Dove gal now!

review/text: I am a male with VERY sensitive skin! I was originally using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB5OAO">Tom's of Maine Natural Deodorant Stick, Apricot, 2.25-Ounce Stick (Pack of 6)</a> but it was irritating my skin and wasn't really helping control the body odor smell. I also tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB5HJC">Mitchum Anti-Perspirant & Deodorant, Power Gel, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 2.25 oz (Pack of 6)</a> but the odor protection just wasn't that great and it left my armpits feeling dry. I finally just decided to try this deodorant and it surprisingly has worked wonderfully. It smells good but not overpowering, controls any odor, and doesn't irritate my skin or leave marks on my clothes. I'm very satisfied and don't mind using a women's deodorant.

review/summary: COOL AS A CUCUMBER
review/text: I am a foo foo type of gal and usually go for the floral in deodorant or perfume. I tried the rose scented Dove and was not as happy with it as I am with the Fresh and Cool Essential. It is the only deodorant that I will use now as it makes me feel fresh all day long. The scent does not interfere with my perfume as you might think it would as it is not strong in odor. It keeps me fresh and dry even when I am sweating in 112 degree temps in the south this summer. I apply it after a shower at night and again in the morning. I even have it in the travel size to put in my purse when I am traveling overseas and not able to shower as often as when I am home.

review/text: First of all, this deodorant smells so good! I was so tired so having to choose between smelling like fake flowers or baby powder every time I chose a new one...this is just perfect. The scent isn't overwhelming but it is noticeable and pleasant - I've been asked what fragrance I was wearing, and I don't wear perfume!<br /><br />This stuff also feels great. I have rather sensitive skin and some deodorants make my underarms burn if I put them on after shaving. Not this one! It really does have a sort of "cooling", soothing effect. Every once in a while, I get a white mark on a black shirt, but it's nothing that I haven't experienced with every single other product out there. I've got several of these stocked up in case they stop making them - I don't plan on ever using a different deodorant! Definitely give it a try.

review/summary: Smellin Dove Fresh :)
review/text: I love, love, love smelling Dove products. They all smell simple: fresh and clean, and don't compete with my perfume. I had used the normal Dove Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant, Invisible Solid, Original Clean for years before I finally made the switch to this product.. and I am certainly glad that I did.<br /><br />I just love the fresh, crisp smell of this deodorant. I have sensitive armpits (especially after shaving, which I do every 2-3 days) and this product always helps with my irritation. After all, nothing is more embarrassing than having to scratch your armpits in public :) haha. And being that I do not "apply sparingly" (I have a ritual of putting it on each armpit for 10 seconds, and then repeating) this stick can normally last me 2-3 weeks... which is pretty dang good considering how much I put on. Not to mention the price is pretty dang good for a reliable product. Most of the times I buy as many as I can when I find it on sale at the grocery store.<br /><br />I also love the solid, although I have to be honest it still shows up on clothing. I apply my deodorant with my shirt on, normally just pulling down my collar and reaching in, so of course I never get it on the sides of my clothing... but it still shows up in the armpit of the shirt when I take it off. Maybe its just because I put so much on, but I'd rather have the stain than be smelly :)<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product.

But the best thing about it is it really moisturizes, does NOT irritate at all, and I even think it helps with hair growth (I know that Dove has another line for this). I liked it so much that I got it again here at amazon. I really love how smooth and irritation free it leaves my skin, even RIGHT after shaving.

review/summary: Instead of Mucinex
review/text: I first discovered this tea when looking for a natural substitute for Mucinex and its generic equivilants.  I had read that the herb thyme is helpful in ridding the body of excess mucus and was looking for a tea with thyme in it.  I disagree strongly that thyme is an "inactive ingredient" as listed under "Important Information: ingredients" above.  Thyme at least indirectly controls/eliminates a cough due to the elimination of excess mucus. Licorice root helps to "harmonize" the action of other herbs as well as add nice flavor; platain relieves inflamation;  echinacea in an excellant infection fighter and natural antibiotic and elder is known for immune system boosting.  None of these are "inactive ingredients" they are all very helpful and far more gentle on the body than a drug.  This tea is far more than a cough suppressent, it's ingredients deal with the  cause of the cough as well as the cough itself and as other have said, it tastes good!

review/summary: Davidson's Caramel Peach with Coconut Tea
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker.  In fact up until the last week I would have said that I hated tea, in all its forms, hot, cold, sweetened, iced, etc.  But I'm bound and determined to make myself like tea because it's good for you and better than the soda I continually chug for the caffeine source.  So when I found Davidson's tea at a local market I decided to give it a try because the flavors sounded interesting and I didn't really have anything to lose.  And I'm so glad I did.  While I'd still rather be drinking a pepsi, this tea has made me realize that I may be able to convert myself.<br /><br />This particular flavor, Caramel Peach with Coconut, is considered a dessert tea and I figured that was the best place to start.  Something sweet to replace the cloying taste of a soda.  And this actually was pretty sweet.  I decided not to add any sweetener to the cup of tea as I figured that might be a bad habit to get into, so I just steeped this tea in boiling water for about five minutes, removed the tea bag, and started drinking.  And I was actually ok with the flavor and enjoyed sipping on it.  The most noticeable taste was the caramel.  It's what I really could taste aside from the bitterness of the tea itself.  I didn't so much taste the coconut, and only got a fair hint of the peach, but that was ok.  The taste was smooth and while there was that faint aftertaste of bitter tea that I don't really enjoy, it wasn't as bad as in some other teas I've tried.<br /><br />The ingredients were also very good in this tea.  Most of it was organic and used barley, chicory, chamomile, carob and rooibos and some natural flavors.  I was very pleased with the blend and it made me feel pretty healthy drinking it.  And it's not often you can find an organic tea at the reasonable price this is offered at either.  It was caffeine free, but that's just as well considering I used it at night while reading a book and getting ready for bed.  It made it all the more relaxing.<br /><br />As a beginner tea drinker I'd say this is very good.  It's the second of the brand that I've tried and both have been very palatable to me.  I look forward to drinking more of this flavor and branching out and trying others.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Cesar Canine Cusine (all flavors) 3.5 oz pkg
review/text: I started feeding this food (all flavors) to my senior Italian Grey when she stopped eating her dry food. I add 2oz of cooked rice to each feeding. She can't eat it fast enough.  I took a pkg to my vet and he looked up the analysis of it. He was surprised at the quality. He said it was excellent for a dog her age and that it was all right for me to continue feeding it to her. He had just completed a physical on her (fecal and blood work). Every area of the blood test was in the normal range. She's a happy, healthy dog. Before this I had to coax her to eat; Today, she demands to be fed and NOW!

review/summary: Only food my little dog will eat!!
review/text: Our little guy, who looks just like the one on the package!! loves this food.  He particularly likes these in the 'sauce'.  I have tried to switch him to less expensive canned foods over the past 3 years, and he just does not like them nearly as much and in many cases prefers to go hungry then eat Alpo or Purina cans.  I put this down on his little plate and it's gone in 2 minutes.<br />I don't know what the other lady is talking about-- I think she has this food mixed up with the Dog Whisperer's line -- mistake.  This is not his line at all.  Just a similar name.<br /><br />Get a subscription for this product and save some money.

review/summary: Whatever's In Them, My Dogs Love 'Em!
review/text: Cesar Canine Cuisine Varety Pack Food Review<br /><br />Grade: A<br /><br />I was questionable about buying these at first, seeing that I'd be paying a dollar for an incredibly small meal my miniture dobermans would surely eat up in a minute. So I took a chance and bought the 12 pack-which includes Filet Mignon and Porterhouse Steak flavors-and my dogs ate them up! Yes, they did eat them fairly quickly, but I found that mixing two of the dinners and a big bowl full of dry food will still be tasty enough for them. Do that, and you'll get more use out of these-dogs seem to like their flavor. So although they aren't that healthy for dogs everyday (I made sure to read the inredients on the back), they're perfect for a snack or to mix with dinner.

Yes, it's that new & most stores never even heard that Kangaroo was an option.  So I'm thrilled to see it here on Amazon.  It's easy to order & is delivered fast! Kangaroo works for allergy-prone dogs because nearly all US-based dogs have never eaten kangaroo meat.  It's that simple.  If they haven't eaten it...they probably aren't allergic to it.  Yes, they can be allergic to the other ingredients but it's worth the try.  My dogs would break out in hives/rashes, etc. with everything from chicken to fish based foods...dry, wet, prescription, home cooked... it's been so difficult but we are quite happy now.  I hope California Natural finally makes a wet Kangaroo version too but this is an excellent start.
