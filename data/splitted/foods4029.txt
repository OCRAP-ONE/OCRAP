review/summary: product review is different for the two different types they carry
review/text: If you are looking for traditional jerky, you will want to order the slab style, which I would give 4 stars. High marks for hormone free and vegetarian fed. Their regular jerky is nothing like you would expect and I would only give it two stars, because the product description does not accurately reflect what you are getting. It is not thin, dried strips of buffalo. It is chopped up, extruded, and sliced into "O" shapes. If you look at the product packaging for their regular jerky, look at the letter "O" in buffalo. The name itself indicates that you have "O" shapes inside, but nowhere in the name or description is that mentioned. I'm sure many people will like this, but it's definitely not the "jerky experience" that most are looking for when they buy jerky.

review/summary: Surprised
review/text: When my regular buffalo jerky was discontinued from the subscribe & save program I chose this item.  I have had & enjoyed other Golden Valley products in the past so I chose this one without reading the reviews.  I was very disappointed.  I have never been one for reconstructed meat.  I never read the fine print-this purchase was my fault for not reading everything-I saw buffalo & peppered & got excited.  The pepper flavor is very weak and unexciting.  If you like reconstructed meat with very little pepper flavor then this is the item for you!

review/summary: Good Buffalo Jerkey but wierd shape...
review/text: Although I've had better buffalo jerkey this stuff is pretty good.  My only issue is that the jerkey is processed into a flat disc of meat.  The shape makes the jerkey feel more processed.  It takes away from the experience of eating jerkey.  Next time I'll get the slab style.

They take whole pieces of thinly sliced buffalo steak and have sweet or spicy flavors. Great stuff!

review/summary: Delicious, no-nonsense taste
review/text: This is the second time I've ordered Golden Valley Buffalo Jerky--I've had the 'original' flavor, which was great; and decided on ordering the 'sweet N' spicy' flavor this time. I was not disappointed. For those who seek serious burn, this is not a particularly 'spicy' jerky, but I think it is exactly the right touch--not too hot, but spicy enough to give your taste buds a bit of a reaction. The jerky pieces vary in size--as would be expected when one slices an actual piece of meat--and texture (ditto), but there are no pieces of grisle and I've only come across one piece that was too hard to chew...<br />Basically--great snack.<br />I require a fair amount of protein in my diet to maintain my metabolism, and this is an excellent resource. Not to  salty. A little sweet. Nutritious, no MSG junk. And knowing (or hoping, rather) that the buffalo gets to live a reasonable life (i.e. not stuck inside one big brick house with flurescent lights and questionable food, but actually eating what buffalo are meant to eat and hopefully roaming about a bit), helps to.<br />Works for me!<br /><br />Awesome if you need to add something quick to a soup or stew: just dump a few pieces per serving in the pot and watch it move up a notch or two (or ten).

review/summary: 2.5 stars really - too sweet
review/text: I have just gotten the turkey, beef and buffalo from this company. The beef jerky had a highly processed feel and was way way too sweet and was not the best quality meet. The turkey was decent, and for the price pretty good with thicker pieces and not as much over-sweetening. This buffalo is in the middle of the two. This jerky is still way too sweet, but the pieces and meat quality are much better than the beef jerky. I  probably will re-order the turkey, will never re-order the beef, and am on the fence for this one. Worth a try, but be prepared to find it too sweet!

review/summary: Sweet Buffalo Jerky
review/text: in an effort to shed a few pounds, i decided to restrict my diet to high protein foods, vegetables, and nuts. When I learned that jerky was a great snack for dieters who wanted protein on-the-go, while avoiding the added carbs in meal replacement bars, I searched for a brand of jerky that was right for me.<br /><br />Knowing very little about jerky (save for the junk in convenience stores), I learned that most brands are full of hormones, nitrites, antibiotics, MSG, and erythorbate. Supposedly, none of these ingredients are harmful in moderation, but I was looking for a snack that I could rely on whenever I had food cravings, and I couldn't afford to compromise my health in the long run by regularly consuming any of these items. So, I was pleased to find out about Golden Valley's line of all natural jerky.<br /><br />Aside from the benefit of finding a vendor that produced a jerky free of preservatives and added MSG, there was the added bonus of learning that federal law actually prohibits the use of growth hormone in buffalo. My mind at ease, I ordered the peppered buffalo jerky and received it in record time using the super saver shipping option.<br /><br />As a meat snack, I found the product to be too sweet for my liking, but nevertheless adequate for my purposes. The texture is milder than the low quality jerky that I'm familiar with, but the pepper flavor could easily go unnoticed as it's way too understated. Every bag that I received was moist and easy to chew and the product was free of flaw or defect.<br /><br />At $1.49/oz., I get 11 grams of protein for the cost of 90 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 7 grams of sugar. Compare this to the leading meal replacement bar on Amazon that costs $2.07/bar for 27 grams of protein, 2.5 grams of fat, 26 grams of sugar (51 grams of total carbs), and a litany of unwanted ingredients in each 3.5-oz. bar. Ounce-for-ounce, we're looking at 11 grams of protein in the jerky versus roughly 8 grams of protein in the bar. Even considering the disappointing sweetness of the jerky, I still manage to avoid all the unwanted carbs and confections of replacement bars. Of course, jerky loses out in terms of cholesterol content.<br /><br />Jerky connoisseurs will likely find the sweetness of this product to be unappealing and off-putting. On the other hand, it's been a great diet aid and a reliable, additive-free defense against mid-meal cravings, and that's really all I wanted out of Golden Valley's Buffalo Jerky.

review/summary: Great Taste & Great Value
review/text: I love buffalo jerky but don't eat it too often because of the cost.  One company in Jacksonhole, WY charges nearly half the cost of the product for shipping and handling.  And at $45 a pound plus $21 for shipping, it's just way too pricy no matter the taste. Another company out of Texas has jerky that is so hard that you need to soak it in water to soften it up for eating - yuck!  So when I decided to try Golden Valley, I did so without much anticipation that it would be pliable to eat due to the cost.  Instead I love it!  The jerky is delicious with the perfect amount of pepper and just enough sweetness to give it a pleasant under taste.  I don't have to tussle with the jerky trying to eat it as it is pliable yet gives that chewy pleasure that good jerky properly prepared has.  I will be ordering over and over again now that I've found a brand that is good value and delicious!  Thank you Golden Valley!

review/summary: This is the best jerky available
review/text: I've tried scores of jerkys and this one is the best of the best.  I used to prefer Snackmaster's hot & spicy jerky but I got too many packages that were spoiled with fungus.  Eventually I found Golden Valley Natural Buffalo Jerky.  It has no added hormones, no antibiotics, no preservatives, no MSG, no nitrite.  I've been buying this product from various sources, directly from the company (Jerky Direct) as well as through Amazon (which has the best price.)  I noticed Whole Foods Market sells this product.  It isn't as hot as the Snackmasters but I have never had a package that was spoiled.  This is wonderful jerky!  I highly recommend a book called "The Omnivore's Dilemma".  If you read that, you'll appreciate grass fed meat a whole lot more than feed lot meat that most other brands of jerky are made from.

review/summary: Too Hot
review/text: I like the other jerky products I have tried from Golden Valley very much, but the Sweet N' Spicy Buffalo Jerky is a bit too hot for my taste.  I thought "sweet and spicy" meant medium hot since it wasn't called "Sweet and hot".  This jerky is hot.  It is hard to appreciate the jerky or the sweetness of it if your mouth is burning.  Actually, it is not burning red hot, but is a little too hot for someone who likes spicy to be a little less than medium on the hotness scale.  The jerky itself is wonderful - just the right amount of tenderness and chewiness.  If you like a little less than medium hotness, then try a different flavor of their jerky - they're great!

review/text: Two stars because I've had this product before from the store and it is fantastic and very healthy.  However when I thought I was getting a great deal from Amazon, it turns out that when it arrived, half of the bags were moldy! However, Amazon was great about it and refunded my money.  Perhaps the lack of preservatives give them a very low shelf life, so if it's low in sodium, consider buying from a local store when you can check the package and dates before buying.

review/text: As someone milk allergic it's insanely difficult to find ramen that has no milk-based ingredients and that is not made on equipment shared with dairy. Tradition's products are not made to cater to the allergic but being Kosher parve means they're suitable. Since they're parve they should also be fine for vegans although I haven't looked into it.<br /><br />They have a taste almost identical to your standard beef cup noodle. The vegetables rehydrate nicely and the noodles don't swell up hideously if you let it sit for longer than directed. I was quite pleased since these were the first ramen I've been able to eat in about three years.

Here the taste is more herbal, and while I have no idea what lime blossom extract is, I certainly think it must be what gives this bar it's bright, citrusy note.  The citrus cuts the floral taste of the lavender and makes this an especially pleasant bar.

review/summary: tasty and so easy, great with seafood
review/text: While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice. For those of you scared of something spicy, you might use a little less, but for most, it's just right, and for those that like it spicier, you can add a little crushed red pepper. Since the coconut milk has to be added separately, you can also control the fat content--you can go light or go with the much yummier, creamy stuff. For the price, you can't do better--it's affordable, easy, and fun to make!<br /><br />The panang curry has a nice mellow flavor with some spice and goes quite well with seafood. Some great compliments to this sauce: scallops, shrimp, squid, and fish; if you add all of these, you get an insanely tasy, luxurious meal. Another thing you can do is add a hint of thai basil to cook with all this--it gives it an extra authentic feel and works well with the overall dish!

It either has too much salt and sugar or too little of the special ingredients that makes panang panang. Do not buy this junk.

We're entirely happy with our purchase, and plan to buy it through Amazon in the future (we've never seen it on local store shelves - they usually only carry Bragg's if they carry higher quality, organic vinegars).<br /><br />Taste is fine (we find it very equivalent to Bragg's, which we love except for the price), it's organic, bottles are dark amber glass (much better than plastic and keeps light out better than the Bragg bottles), it was safely packaged so no breakage was likely, and the price is much better than what we've ever been able to find for Bragg products.  Since it qualifies for free shipping with just a few dollars more in purchases on Amazon, the price is as low as we could find it anywhere - superb deal on a top-notch product!<br /><br />The only question we had was about the expiration date.  There is a 5-digit code on top of the cap.  In our case, it's 12931, which clearly isn't a date, since there is not a "September 31st" on the calendar.  On calling the company, I learned that Eden is moving to expiration dates on their products, but oils and vinegars still have date codes for a while longer.  The first digit (in this case "1") is code for the last digit of the year manufactured (2011), and the "293" means the 293rd day of 2011.  There is a 4-year shelf life according to Eden, so we got an in-date product with more than three years of shelf life remaining.<br /><br />Note: Very few of our product reviews get a 5-star rating.  A really good product gets four stars, but to warrant five stars requires it to be "the best of the best" in our opinion.  So take this rating with that in mind.

review/text: Tropic Bee offers various honeys that are mixed with a bit of different citrus oils; this one is blended with Key Lime oil to add a nice tart flavor. We picked up a few bottles in Florida where they had samples out for tasting. This variety proved the most popular with our group and every person ultimately purchased the Key Lime version; the others were good but this one stood out. We've been spreading it on bread or mixing it in tea.<br />FWIW, the kosher agency is OU.

review/summary: Delicious, delightful, and a great deal too
review/text: Love these beans! The chocolate coating is creamy and smooth, and a little more generous than most. It has a sweeter taste than the coating on some other varieties (sweet, but not cloying). That balances well with the sharp flavor of the espresso bean. The appearance of these is pleasing also. There is an even distribution of dark chocolate, white chocolate, and a pretty speckled milk-on-white that conceals a milk chocolate underlayer.<br /><br />I like the presentation of Dilettante Chocolates; on the label there are two short paragraphs about the history and practices of the company that incorporate that information charmingly and with a concise flair that is very modern.<br /><br />And the price for this somewhat decadent purchase, three pounds of chocolate covered espresso beans, is terrific even with shipping. Service was very good too. I received my order within three business days of placing it.

review/summary: Gourmet Expresso Beans
review/text: Seattle Gourmet Foods is a company I found through Amazon.com The past few years I have found myself ordering more and more on the internet.I always skipped the reviews because I just thought they were probably written by people who benefited from my purchase. However, I have become very dependent on what my fellow shoppers have to say,and really surprised when I realized Amazon allow customers comments good and bad to be printed.<br />Anyway that being said I will tell you this product came and was delivered as promised.There are so many in this barrel shaped container it almost seems bottomless.The chocolate covered gems are so rich and creamy with just the right amount of chocolate covering the crunchy fresh expresso bean in the middle.Just a few will do you packing a delicious caffein buzz! I thought they were a bit expensive when I first placed my order, hoping the saying "you get what you pay for" was true I orderd anyway and am very pleased with the value. Getting what I paid for and a whole lot more.<br /><br />Thanks from one very satisfied customer on Morgantown Pa.<br />Karen

review/summary: Best Choco covered espresso beans!!!
review/text: I purchased 2 of the 5lb bags (hoping for the best of course - better deal on shipping if you buy more then 1 bag.  This was a blind purchase as I have never tried this brand before.<br /><br />I was and am very impressed with the quality of this product, I have tried several different brands from amazon as well as from local coffee shops of choco covered espresso beans, I got all the ladies addicted to these things with my last purchse from a different seller/chocolatier so I was buying for 4 for us to split.  To say the very least everyone is very satisfied and they can't comment as they have their mouths full of chocolate/caffein goodness at the moment while running up and down the aisles at work;)<br /><br />One review did say these had espresso bits which is false, as soon as I read that review I took half the chocolate off and yes.. there is in fact 1 intact bean deep inside the chocolate.  The chocolate to bean ratio is a little much but since the quality of the chocolate is so good it is no problem what so ever! The quality is there, great buy and trust me buy multiple of the 5lb bags and share/split with friends (or keep them all I know you'll love them)<br /><br />Thank you.. Love them buying again!!!!

review/summary: Really tasty bar
review/text: I love this bar and that is probably because I love any treat that combines peanuts and chocolate.  I don't consider this a health bar.  This has a good amount of sugar and a good amount of fat.  I eat them because they are a great cheat treat.  When I eat well all day, I look forward to this soft but chewy bar that has real peanuts and what seems to be real chocolate (I detest bars that proclaim to have real chocolate but instead incorporate a fake chocolaty substance).<br /><br />What I like about this bar:<br />1) The taste - Wow! For a granola bar the taste is phenomenal. The picture on the box does not lie.  You can see peanuts and oats and the chocolate topping tastes awesome.  The texture of the oats/nuts melds well with the oats and nuts.<br /><br />2) Portable and easy to pack - If you try to stay aware of your daily calorie intake, it is always great to have easy to carry snacks with their calories clearly labeled. Who has time to count out the exact number of pretzels that comprise 150 calories? That is part of the appeal of a granola bar. You've got a 150 calorie food item that can be placed in a purse or coat pocket and you are out the door.<br /><br />3) The company has made a conscious effort to reduce packaging in order to reduce impact on the environment.  The box is made of 100% recycled materials.<br /><br />What is questionable about this bar:<br />1) This is a snack/treat bar and nothing else - This is not a healthful nutrition bar. The product packaging does not necessarily say this is healthful. It does use the words "organic goodness" and boasts "9 grams of whole grains". These notations may make some think this is a really healthy treat. But it's not. The bar has low fiber (2g) and pretty high sugar for a 150 calorie bar (11 grams).<br /><br />2)If you use snacks to hold you over, you probably should find a snack with at least 4 grams of fiber. The 2 gram bar is not going to tide you over very long.<br /><br />If you feed these to your kids, there is a good likelihood they will like them. They are pretty sweet.  But again with the sugar, what else are you giving your kids during the day? Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 3/4 teaspoons in this bar. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this bar may not be worth it to you. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Nature's Path has created a very tasty granola bar with quality ingredients. Props to the company for not saying this was a health or nutrition bar on the box. I am reviewing this as a treat bar and as a treat, it is a delicious option. If it were being reviewed for health, I would not be able to give it four stars as it has high sugar, high fat and low fiber.  Don't expect it to hold you over for hours but do expect it to satisfy your sweet tooth.<br /><br />These granola bars are made in the United States.

review/text: Was so excited to get these bars since the price was a definite savings vs. Whole Foods Market.  Apparently you get what you pay for!  Ordered a case of 6 boxes.  Opened the first box and tried a couple bars but they were VERY stale and hard. Threw those away thinking it was just a bad box and opened a second.  Same thing--stale, hard, and completely inedible!  Interesting thing is that the expiration date on these boxes was still 6 months out, so might be a little "funny business" going on with date stamp on the packaging, if you know what I mean.  Will NOT order these again and probably hesitant to order another food item since Amazon does not allow returns on food.  Order at your own risk!

review/summary: I Eat Three Every Day to Help Keep Me Strong
review/text: Great product off the shelf - healthy and tasty.<br /><br />Bad product when shipped through amazon, so far.<br /><br />Both times i've ordered this, the bars come melty and deformed.  Normally i could care less, but the the melted syrup sinks to the bottom of the wrapper and makes the whole thing a sticky mess. So a snack-on-the-go turns into where-is-the-nearest-sink so i can wash my hands.<br /><br />I can only guess why the product ships like this. This has happened twice now, so it's not a fluke, but both times it's been 100+ degree weather.  UPS or whatever company that is shipping this stuff apparently doesn't use refrigerated cabins (not criticizing, just a likely reality), so even if you refrigerate them after they show up at your door, it's too late, as they are already deformed with the melty syrup already pooled at the bottom of the wrapper.<br /><br />Even so, I'm going to order it again in the Fall/Winter months to see if the product holds up better.  If it does, i have a feeling we can chalk it up to weather, and i would just avoid ordering this through Amazon during summer months.  Either way, I'll update this review.

review/summary: Great Organic Snack That Cures Sweet Urge
review/text: Bars are extra chewy and provide the crunch and sweet flavor to curb snack urges. Gluten-free not on the box, but company says no gluten ingredients added with only a minute chance of cross-contamination.  We have not had any problems.  Our teenagers love these. Try Chococonut bars too as this another favorite. Hope they reconsider adding GF logo.

review/summary: I won't go till I get some
review/text: My son in law was joking around one day when he heard a Christmas song saying: " O bring out the figgy pudding...and I won't go till I get some." My wife and I had this idea about getting some figgy pudding for him (not that we wanted him to leave), but when I placed the order, there was a possibility that the order wouldn't arrive until after Christmas. My wife also placed an order for the same item with express shipping with an additional cost. I received my order one day after her. Both arrived in time for Christmas. Great job! Great service! Oh yes I almost forgot to mention the pudding was excellent. Keep up the good work

review/summary: Very Tasty Blend
review/text: I was offered the Italian version of this product via the Amazon Vine program and I liked that so much I decided to try the other two flavors, the French (this one) and the Napa.  This one is also very good.  The herbs used blend very well to make a very flavorful combination that has a subtle mustard bent to it. I put some on salmon filets and it was wonderful.  Unlike many other seasonings, while this one does contain salt, the salt does not overwhelm. Instead, everything works together to make a very nice blend. This is a very versatile product - you can use it on pretty much anything.

review/summary: Russian?  Well...sort of...
review/text: I ordered this tea along with several other Roland tinned teas.  This was the best of the lot, though that's not saying much.  From what I've experienced and what I've seen in some other reviews of Roland teas, the flavoring is really weak on all of their flavored teas.  Well, OK, faint is perhaps being to kind.  Non existent is really more correct.  Russian tea is supposed to have a smokey taste that some people are put off by.  The flavor of this tea is very faint, fainter than I was expecting and fainter than I would have liked.  The other Roland teas I got were disappointingly weakly flavored and weren't worth getting.  This one at least has some flavor.

review/summary: Hint of smoke
review/text: Roland teas from China or Hong Kong are good teas for the price when Amazon offers them for a few bucks. Russian tea is the fourth Roland black tea I've purchased and my friends love me for it. At a couple dollars or less for each tin,  I gift them and keep others in brown liquid.  This variety is a little different because it's a tad smoky and more robust.  I make teabags for pots of tea and often brew them twice within a day. The second pot has less caffeine but full flavor. Like this tea.

review/text: I wonder if the other reviewer has gotten old tea; that would cause it to lose flavor. While this is certainly not what anyone would consider a "quality" tea, and it doesn't have, as the other reviewer mentions, a traditional Russian tea flavor, if you want a strong black loose tea at a really good price this is worth it. I usually drink it when I need that caffeine pick-me-up, not when I want a flavorful tea experience. For that go green.

review/summary: Best Cheese Puffs
review/text: I love cheese and things made with cheese, so I've had many cheese puffs.  These have a little blue cheese added which gives them a sharper flavor than just cheddar.  I've noticed a bit of inconsistency in the flavor from bag to bag.  Sometimes there will be a great flavor with a good bite and sometimes a more mild flavor like normal cheese puffs.  If you want to be assured of a milder flavor try the white cheddar.  I don't like those - too mild.  Be aware that the oil tends to settle in the puffs on the bottom half of the bag - so the puffs on top of the bag are lighter than the ones on the bottom.  Personally, I think the bottom of the bag is a little better!

I have eaten several bags of Barbara's Bakery Gaked White Cheddar Cheese Puffs and was disappointed at not being able to detect white cheddar but the puffs are very light with a pleasant flavor. They have a light crispy crunch to them and can be eaten without a beverage as they do not seem dry to my mouth. It would be difficult to eat just a small quantity of them, but I found them to be a delicious, non-filling snack as well as being healthier than the fried kind. I will certainly order them again in the future.

review/summary: The best quick oatmeal available in the U.S.A.
review/text: Do not confuse this product with the Irish steel cut oatmeal that must be cooked for 30 minutes. That is the best. This oatmeal is not as good, but for a quick cooking product, it is pretty amazing. You can have oatmeal ready in 5 minutes. This oatmeal is best with a little milk, some brown sugar, and some berries or dried fruit. I like dried dates and dried black figs combined in mine, but it is fun to experiment. It's hard to believe that something this good is also good for you.

review/summary: Leaving My Long and Beautiful Relationship With The Quaker Guy For McCann's
review/text: I just finished off my first box of "McCann's Imported Quick Cooking Irish Oatmeal". And boy did it go fast! Not because I didn't get my money's worth, but because it was so good. I usually have Oatmeal about 3 times a week, and have always been real loyal to Quaker Oats(not the instant), but I gave these a try and it is now my new favorite, and I have them almost every day now..<br /><br />Following the cooking directions(this was my first time with a quick cook oatmeal),and cooking just a few minutes(add the oats and cold water together, boil and stir for 3-5 minutes), the oatmeal came out perfect for me the first time, and does every time. With the suggested 1/2 cup Irish Oatmeal to 1 Cup Water, the consistency, for me was perfect. Just a little creamy, and not too soggy. The taste was the big test though, and I loved it. I am cutting out sugar whenever I can, but my Quaker was still one place I used just a little, so I just tried a little non-fat soy milk on the McCann's, and occasionally a spritz of a butter flavored cooking spray(just to have a little variety everyday), and I didn't even miss the sugar at all. Of course, you can experiment by adding a little more oats if you like it a little thicker, or more water for a thinner consistency. Honey, raisins or other fruit go great with it too.There are also instructions for micro-wave use.<br /><br />If you are a die-hard Quaker fan, and don't want to just dive right in and buy a 6 pack, you can find this brand at the Trader Joe's stores. I also saw the "McCann's Steel Cut Oats" there as well, which I haven't tried yet.<br /><br />There is no sodium, sugars, or cholesterol. It's low fat and calorie(2gm/150 per 1/2 cup dry serving). A good source of fiber and is pure and natural. Ingredients..100% Irish wholegrain oats. There are several different kinds of these oats available. Click on "McCann's" at top to see the other selections.This one is the "quick cook"(not instant), has a gold trimmed box, with a creamy colored background and "Irish Oatmeal" on a green banner.<br /><br />A satisfying meal that will keep you going until lunch.<br /><br />Okay, so, remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy!.....Laurie

review/summary: The best Oatmeal!
review/text: Sure, there are tons of oatmeal options out there and I've tried quite a few. McCanns is the best.  For starters I don't like mystery ingredients.  McCanns has only one ingredient--  oats, and they only use the highest quality.  Because of the way the oats are cut they cook very quick.  I micro mine with soy milk in 2:20.  After cooking I add cinnamon, ground flax seeds, and some frozen blueberries for a breakfast of champions.  After switching to this from eating cereal I've become very lean.  I've recommended this combination to many others who have experienced similar results.

review/summary: Tasty, gluten-free oatmeal
review/text: This oatmeal is the only kind that I have found to be gluten-free.  It is tasty and cooks quicker and has better texture than rolled oat varieties of oatmeal.  The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter in 2004 with lab analysis showing that McCann's had significantly less gluten on median than two other brands; unfortunately, the analysis also showed that one of the four samples of McCann's had high gluten, so it's possible that there may occasionally be bad batches, or it's possible that they mixed up their sample of McCann's with the other brands since the other three samples were so different.  The World Health Organization's definition of gluten free is less than 200 parts per million (ppm), and the more conservative definition is less than 20 ppm.  The four samples of McCann's had gluten contents of:  &lt;3 ppm, 12 ppm, 23 ppm, 760 ppm.  The second brand was around 100-200 ppm.  The third brand was around 300-800 ppm.  McCann's is clearly better.  I have personally had no problems with it, but I have had problems with the second and third brands that they tried.

review/summary: I'm hooked
review/text: After a lifetime of using Quaker oatmeal, I thought I'd give this a try.  Not to knock the old American standby, but this is SO much better.  Great taste and texture...it seems more restaurant quality.  Although I always eat breakfast, my appetite isn't that big in the morning so I use 1/3 cup of the oatmeal and 1/3 cup of water combined with 1/3 cup of milk.  Using a little milk instead of all water adds to the flavor and texture.  I cook mine on the stove top and it's just as fast as the microwave...it starts boiling within a minute then I stir it until it thickens--usually just another minute.  I usually add some sliced strawberries and a tiny bit of brown sugar and some stevia (if you haven't tried stevia in place of sugar, you should!).  I often add some ground flaxseed too.<br /><br />I bought the steel cut oats (in the metal tin) that cook for half an hour.  That's just not realistic for me to use in the morning.  Sure, they taste great, but it's really a totally different taste and texture and I don't have that time in the morning.

Best of all, it still has a lower glycemic index and won't make your insulin spike like the awful instant oatmeal stuff you can get at the supermarket. This brand stands up to being reheated too -- I make about six servings at a time and then we microwave the leftovers with a little milk and maple syrup during the week to save time. Yum!

review/summary: best taste
review/text: I first tasted McCanns in Ireland, my buddy lives in Nass. I had never liked oats before but this product is different. It has a very pleasant texture and really fills you up. My young son would actually ask for it for breakfast. That was something. My family has been eating it ever since, and I have turned my friends onto it also. Thanks for carrying this product as I now live in West Virginia and no one here carries it.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: McCann's Irish Quick cooking is the best tasting oatmeal in my lifetime of experience.  Also very convenient purchasing it at Amazon.  Stores either don't carry it, or are out of it or have high prices.  I am very pleased with this product.

review/summary: The Only Oatmeal
review/text: McCann's Steel Cut (Cooks in 3 Minutes) oatmeal is great when you want real Irish oatmeal on the fly - two 1 minute cycles in the microwave usually does the trick.

review/summary: Excellent pantry staple
review/text: I love this product for baking and in pancakes, etc, and it has become a pantry staple for me.  It softens up readily when used in batters and breads and mostly disintegrates into the baked good, with no hard oat pieces (use regular thicker oats if more texture is desired).  Can substitute for oat flour as-is, without grinding in the blender or food processor.  Can also substitute for white flour to make recipes healthier (I would start by substituting up to 25% in a recipe with these oats and also use some whole wheat flour up to 50% of the white flour content), but use slightly more cup-for-cup if you are substituting these oats for white flour, or weigh out - flour weighs 4.5 to 5 oz per cup.  I have not tried these quick rolled oats in oatmeal cookies - I suspect that it might not hold up to cookie dough mixing or have enough texture in the resultant cookies.<br /><br />I do prefer thick-cut old-fashioned oats for breakfast oatmeal, but this product is very good if you have limited time to make oatmeal.  It has a great flavor, just not as much texture since the flakes are very thin.  It is not really gummy as are some other quick oat brands.<br /><br />I have used up 6 boxes and will be purchasing more to restock the pantry (but store in freezer if close to expiration date).  Overall, a high quality product.
