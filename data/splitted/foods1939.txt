review/summary: Good food!
review/text: My dog is quite finicky on the food she will eat.  She won't really eat dry food but seems to like her wet food.  This was a very good deal for 24 cans of Pedigree.  Love the fact that I could choose the kind I wanted to buy for her. Would recommended ordering this item and from this company. Item came well packaged for shipping and for storage. Item arrived on time as well.

review/summary: Tempted my 14 year 8 mo old dog to eat!
review/text: I tried some of this on my old guy, an American Staffordshire Terrier that is 14 years, 8 months old. He had just gone through a phase of refusing to eat his normal food, which is good stuff, but is a dry kibble mini disc type ( Bench & Field Holistic - Very good food! )<br />So I got some canned foods to try on him.  Got the Newman's, and 2 other organic kinds.  Buster just loves the canned foods, but the consistency of some of the others is sloppier and harder for him to eat, as they just seem to mash into the bowl, and he has to lick them instead of being able to eat them in soft chunks.  This food smells almost good enough to make me hungry...... and is easy to spoon into his dish, where it takes him less than a nano-second to select a nice chunk and eat it.  I just stand there, and spoon a few chunks at a time into his bowl and he looks for more.<br />So I am really happy with this food and even if he DOES get spoiled on it, he's so worth spoiling at his advanced age that I don't consider it a problem!<br />Before this, I was cooking human food to tempt him just to eat, so this is better balanced and seems to give him more energy.<br />( Before this, he was feed on free schedule, with a bowl of dry food out at all times, and he would eat every 3 days when he felt like it. That worked very well for 14 plus years!  I did the same with my first AmStaff, and he made it to 15. ) Also, Buster has NEVER had to make a vet visit for illness or medical problem his entire life until 2 weeks ago, so that eating arrangement obviously worked great for a very long time!  ; )

review/summary: HONEST REVIEW!
review/text: I live in Manhattan and i have a beagle (5yr old) n i ordered this food because the economy is bad and i need cheap afforable dog food. People talk about this food as if its garbage so i did my research by a co worker who used to work for pedigree and online. The food is proccess is nasty! but if has all the vitamins and protien needed for all dogs. I checked cans at a pet store and pediagree had more vitamins and more crude protien then science diet n others. I know the food is made bad but it isnt effecting your dog. I recieved the cans unharmed just 1 was a lil bent but it wasnt a biggy n i recieved it fairly quick and my dog loves the food. I recommend this food for low income pet owners.  N pedigree may be bad but feeding your dog people food is even worse. Think about that!. Also Pedigree was the #1 dog food back in the 80S n 90s but since all these new dog food came out and research was done on the food was declared garbage. It still used in shelters.

review/summary: Delicious Meaty Dog Food
review/text: Pedigree  smells delicious.  It is an enticing smell, good enough to make humans turn their noses toward it.  A black lab and a standard poodle in our family agree that it tastes delicious.  The meaty chunks of real beef  in a doggy-tasty gravy pleases the most finicky canines. None of the humans in the family have tried it though.<br /><br />It has all the meat in it that a dog needs for maintenance, and it can be mixed with dry food for extra crunch.  There is the right balance of calcium and phosphorus for strong teeth and bones, according to the Pedigree people.  It also has omega fatty acids and the essential nutrient for healthy skin and a shiny coat.  The dogs find it highly digestible so that the nutrients are easily absorbed.  (All these features are listed on the Pedigree web page.)<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Delicious and Gross all in the same box!
review/text: Many people I've shared this with give me weird looks as if I was crazy for buying them.  But when you sit around with a group or involve them in some sort of game (we made them a penalty for folding in a card game), they can be a lot of fun.  Just last night we were at a get together with friends and family and went through a whole box just trying them out and seeing each others reactions.<br /><br />Each color jelly bean can be one of two flavors.  A good flavor or a bad one.  Dog Food or Chocolate pudding for example.  It's amazing how some of them taste.  Most I've found aren't awful tasting, but there are a few that are just plain bad!  The others are interesting since the dog food (for example) really smells like dog food once you starting eating it!<br /><br />The one thing these are not good for is buying if you just want to sit and have some jelly beans - its much more fun with others involved!

review/summary: Lots of Fun for a small get-together
review/text: I was first introduced to this product Christmas day at a get together with friends.  The box is filled with sweet tasting jelly beans and foul tasting ones.... but you can't tell the difference by appearance.<br /><br />Four of us 'played' by taking turns picking a jelly bean and then finding out whether we got the sweet one or the foul one.  Others enjoyed watching our reactions.<br /><br />After having had so much fun Christmas day, I searched for and purchased Bean Boozled jelly beans locally and had a blast with my two nieces (ages 10 and 12) playing the same game.<br /><br />We had more fun than a board game.....  and even those not 'playing' had fun watching us.  These jelly beans are a great ice-breaker for any occasion and fun for all ages and very inexpensive entertainment.<br /><br />Whoever came up with this idea was brilliant.

review/text: I'm a huge tea fan and was thrilled to see Melitta makes tea pods to use in the new one-cup pressure coffee makers.  I've got a Senseo, and these pods work just fine, so I assume you can also use it with the other similar single-cup makers.<br /><br />The tea is great and the brewing process ensures that you get a nice, dark and flavorful cup.  I'd love to see more flavors eventually, especially orange spice.  For now, the black tea pods along with a flavored honey stick from Stash tea does the trick.<br /><br />Highly recommend for tea drinkers with the one-cup brewers.

review/summary: SPIKE SEASONS ANYTHING
review/text: I read about Spike Seasoning on a food blog and couldn't wait to try some.  Unfortunately, Spike Seasoning was not available in my local hometown grocery stores.  Thus Amazon to the rescue!  After placing my order with Amazon my order was at my front door within 3 days of placing my order.  This seasoning is awesome! I started out putting it on just vegetables as the name suggest, but soon ventured on to seasoning other things.  It goes on just about anything and taste great.  I have actually started using Spike Seasoning as a substitute for salt.  It is low in Sodium and actually better for you than salt.  It is not an overwhelming seasoning; it allows you to enjoy the natural good taste of your food.  So glad I found Spike Vegit Seasoning. They also make other Spike Seasonings that are equally as good.  Thanks Amazon for the Spike Seasoning and until Spike products become available in my hometown, I will keep you on speed dial.

Yours may be stale, but it may just be Vegit, which does clump up even in the freezer (I keep it in the freezer,sealed in a glass jar, between uses.  The taste will tell you whether the spices themselves are stale.<br /><br />As for it being too salty for the other reviewer - if it's salty *at all*, it's not Vegit, tho it may be Spike.  Two different products.<br />HTH.

review/text: I used to think that Bacon flavored anything was good. However having tasted various Bacon flavored soaps, candles, mousepads, and sodas, I'm convinced that that is not the case. The mousepads are way too spongy. Everything else is great.<br /><br />And then I tried these. I saw them in the supermarket and decided to try some, just for the hell of it.<br /><br />It's like a party in my mouth. It tastes like they put all the makings of a BLT into a small chip. I got a very fresh batch luckily, and was able to thoroughly enjoy the taste of Bacon, garden fresh Tomato, a hint of Lettuce, Mayonnaise, yet sadly no bread. Not that I'm complaining though. The Bacon taste slightly overpowers the rest of it, which is to be expected given Bacon's holy nature. As such, I can confidently say that this is the best potato chip I have ever put in my mouth.

review/summary: As good as any packaged pasta I've had
review/text: Love this product. It has become my #1 pasta because it's completely wheat free, and corn has a better glycemic index than wheat. Also love the fact that it's made with non-GMO corn. This is also one of the few pastas whose package directions give accurate cooking time - most pastas tell you to cook for way too long, but this is not overdone at all when you took according to directions - I usually have to cook it a minute longer, and I like my pasta almost hard. I find it more robust and wholesome than semolina or durham pasta and better texture than brown rice pasta, which often falls apart.  This keeps its shape and has that nice springy al dente feel to it.  It's great with a good bottled spaghetti sauce, fresh grated reggiano on top and some garlicky sauteed spinach mixed in - fast & easy & yummy when I don't want to cook a more complex meal. Love this brand much better than DeBoles. Great price, too. Everyone I've ever served it to likes it just as much as any store-bought pasta and some folks like it even more, as I do. Sam Mills also has spaghetti, lasagne, shells, fusilli, & other shapes of corn pasta but so far I like the rigatoni best. Really a great product. Oh, p.s. - when you're cooking you do have to stir once in a while to prevent it from getting sticky.

review/summary: Tastes like burnt coffee
review/text: I love coffee and dark chocolate. The combination here doesn't taste like dark chocolate and coffee, it simply tastes like burnt coffee. Don't get me wrong, I like dark roasts, but this isn't a dark roast, it tastes burnt. I believe that burnt taste is what is supposed to be the dark chocolate, but it didn't play out well in my mouth. After drinking several cups, you start to adjust and it tastes a little better, but I would not purchase more. Cream helps lessen the burnt taste.

review/summary: Drinkable, but not outstanding
review/text: I've tried quite a few of the Gevalia coffees in the past, even joining their infamous "get a coffeepot free" club on occasion.  In general, their coffee is quite good, albeit quite high-priced (over-priced is more accurate; I suppose they have to pay for the freebies somehow).  This flavor really didn't appeal to me, though.  The pairing of coffee and chocolate is a classic one, but I didn't find it came together well in this product.  It smelled wonderful, but it tasted somewhat burnt.  I suspect this is an attempt to impart a dark chocolate flavor, but I like dark chocolate, and it didn't taste like that to me.  I usually drink my coffee black, but the second time around with this one I added cream.  It smoothed it out considerably, of course, but the burnt note was still predominant.<br /><br />I like dark coffees, and this one did have a full, rich body (unlike many flavored coffees that often seem to be an attempt to compensate for a weak blend).  As a dark-coffee and dark-chocolate fan, I'm not put off by some bitter notes in the flavor.  However, this brew really was too bitter for my taste; again, probably an attempt to create a dark chocolate taste.  I also expected more sweetness in a flavor called "truffle," but no.<br /><br />It's not terrible coffee, and I won't have any trouble finishing the bag, but I won't seek it out again when its time to restock.

review/summary: Nice change of pace from standard coffee
review/text: I usually drink plain 'ol Folgers regular, no cream or sugar, just black. I gave this a shot for something different. I was pleasantly surprised. Pure arabica beans, from what I've been told, are the way to go, and apparently this coffee is 100%. The chocolatey flavor really spices things up, and when you're brewing this stuff you can't help but try to mentally speed the process up so you can get your hands on a cup. The taste is not bitter at all, and I like my coffee strong, so that's saying something. I usually use a 3:1 ratio of water to measuring cup of coffee when I brew in my automatic drip coffee maker. Seems to be a great balance for my taste. I think the measuring cup is 2 tablespoons, but I'm not sure as I never measured how much it holds (it came with my coffee maker I believe.) Just wanted to point out how I brew it so others can reproduce my results if desired. The only negative I can give it is the packaging. You can't reseal it, and the foil package tends to tear easily.<br /><br />I'd recommend this as a very welcome break from your standard-off-the shelf coffees. The chocolate taste isn't overwhelming nor chemical-tasting, as I've experienced with other cheaper brands of flavored coffee.

review/summary: Maybe not the ULTIMATE indulgence
review/text: I'm a bit of a coffee nut.  I buy coffee from a local company that roasts it, and I grind it at home using a burr grinder just before I brew up a fresh pot.<br /><br />This Gevalia stuff is very very good *freeze dried* coffee.  It doesn't have the depth of flavor that my freshly roasted beans provide, but its very good.  Some details:<br /><br />1) the chocolate flavor is consistent throughout every sip.  Don't expect a Starbucks mocha!  I expected it to be "very chocolately" and its not.  In fact, only a coffee drinker would really call this chocolate flavored coffee, because its really a secondary flavor.  If I were to give this to someone who never drank coffee, I think the subtle flavor of the chocolate would be lost on them.<br />2) the grind is very very fine, as is common with freeze dried coffee.<br />3) there is a hint of "liquorice" flavor, similar to other premium coffees (like Illy).<br /><br />Overall, I would say its a very good coffee.  There isn't too much in an 8 ounce container - 2 to 6 pots of coffee, depending on how much you are making at a time.<br /><br />Its a good gift item, if you want to give someone a little something special.  But, I will stick to my freshly roasted beans :)

review/summary: Ideal use: compliment other coffees (for mix masters)
review/text: If you like to mix and match your coffee sources (all apologies to the coffee-purists out there), then this coffee's ideal use is to add flavor to your regular coffee. For example, if you are making unflavored coffee and want to give it some "flavor", adding a little bit (or more than a little bit depending on your preference) of this can add a different dimension to your otherwise regular coffee. With a smaller amount, this is more subtle, and not as over-powering for people who like some flavor, but not fully-flavored coffee. Similarly, you can add a little bit of this to decaf.<br /><br />As with all experiments, some mixes may turn out better than others...

review/summary: Good, but strong chocolate flavor
review/text: This coffee is a fine ground, really more of an expresso grind than drip coffee. I have a drip coffee maker. It makes a coffee with a strong chocolate flavor that tastes and smells like real chocolate. I used it alone for a few pots,then tried it blended 50% with regular dark roast and medium grind. I find I like it better blended. This coffee is not acidetic and I had no problems with digestion, which sometimes occurs with to me if coffee has to much acid. I liked this coffee and will look into if I can get it with a coarse grind instead of fine because of the pot I have. Overall a good tasting product.

The aroma is rich and delicious.<br />Opinions will differ on taste. While I liked it, my husband wasn't so keen on the flavor. I guess it depends on your feelings about chocolate.<br />Still . . . Folgers Gourmet Selections makes a decently priced chocolate coffee that smells just as good and tastes slightly better.

review/summary: Average cup of coffee, with chocolatey-flavor
review/text: Surprisingly, the brewed coffee has a strong chocolate-like flavor, not just a chocolate aroma, as is so often the case, but it hits a false note and leaves an odd aftertaste.  The coffee itself is not bitter and is of average quality for vacuum-packed but it does not seem especially fresh.  So you get a very average cup of coffee with a pronounced chocolate-like flavor that is much improved with milk and sugar.<br /><br />I say chocolate-like because the the flavor is closer to real chocolate than, say, a Tootsie Roll, but it is definitely not real chocolate.  The label indicates that it has both natural and artificial flavors, although they are not specified.<br /><br />All-in-all, I do not think that this product meets the expectations for a carriage-trade coffee set by the packaging and marketing and is merely average.

review/summary: About a 3.5
review/text: To give some background into my personal coffee taste (for comparison), I'm not a huge fan of most flavored coffes. The only flavor I ever tend to like is hazelnut. As for coffee houses, I'm not a Starbucks fan, but I love Dunkin' Donuts for some reason. So if you despise Dunkin' Donuts and love Starbucks, this coffee might be a 5 to you.<br /><br />It does have a chocolate flavor, which I don't really like. At least it's not bitter, though. It is rather smooth. I take my coffee with cream and sugar so I have not tasted it plain. Maybe it's meant for people who don't add anything to it anyway? Either way, I really prefer a more coffee flavor and this tastes something like hot chocolate and coffee in some strange mixture. I rounded it up to a 4, but I honestly would give it a 3.5 out of 5.

review/summary: Extremely rich and flavorful
review/text: Our family isn't a big fan of flavored coffee beans. I feel they usually have a very artificial taste, and sometimes leave a strange bitter after-effect.<br /><br />Needless to say, our first morning trying this Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee we weren't expecting anything special, but we were pleasantly surprised. The chocolate flavor is full and rich, in fact a almost too rich! Making a full cup of coffee seem a bit too much. This is a flavor to savor, not chug on the way to work.<br /><br />Since then, we've been adding about a tablespoon of the Gevalia to our regular blend in the mornings, and it's amazing this tiny amount adds such richness and flavor to our morning cuppa.<br /><br />Not cheap if used alone, but if you stretch it out by making a blend with cheaper coffee as the base, you'll be thrilled at the wonderful rich flavor. A great way to pamper yourself without breaking the bank!

However, the "dark chocolate truffle" flavor is not very prominent, though there is a slight chocolatey aftertaste. No need to add much sugar; the coffee itself tastes a little sweet. Adding milk adds some richness to the taste. The grind of the coffee is finer than most other ground coffees I've tried.

review/text: I decided to serve this coffee with our Thanksgiving desserts.  My family really didn't have a lot to say about it.  I thought it was good enough.  It wasn't spectacular or taste that much different than your normal batch of coffee, especially when you add sugar and creamer.<br />Chocolate coffee?  I feel like chocolate coffee is a luxury. Based on the price, it's more of a gift-type of coffee and not one to ingest on a regular basis.  Could you drink it regularly? Absolutely!  It's not too strong or heavy, and it has a good taste.  If you are considering it for a gift, it will be appreciated and enjoyed.

review/text: I usually grind my own beans and prefer a stronger brew.<br /><br />This coffee was an interesting blend. With an initial sip, it tasted a little odd so I ended up using a hazlenut cream in it. After the addition, the taste was much smoother. However, I really couldn't get much of the chocolate taste.<br /><br />In addition, the coffee felt much weaker then most caffeine. After 3 months of not having drunken any coffee, I drank 2 cups of this on Thanksgiving night right before I slept and didn't feel it prevented me from sleeping at all.<br /><br />Overall, when I served this coffee to my guests on Thanksgiving, most said it was just ok. They thought it smelt good but also thought it was some what weak.<br /><br />I can't quite recommend this, and I am by no means a coffee snob.

Adding a bit more per cup THEN delivers the flavor. After that, the chocolate truffle part of the flavor DOES come through very nicely.<br /><br />Taken black, with or without sugar, the flavor is very pleasant. When I added cream or soy, the flavor seems to fade into the background and all I had was a very nice cup of coffee.<br /><br />Ramp up the Chocolate taste, Gevalia and you will have a VERY nice dessert coffee, or something to make cramming for exams a little more pleasant.

review/summary: A good flavored coffee. Not my daily favorite but a nice indulgence.
review/text: The Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee comes pre-ground in a vacuum sealed brick.  The first thing that I noticed is that the dry aroma is excellent and the grounds smelled very fresh.  The scent of dark chocolate is strong and noticeable.  Once brewed, the aroma seems a bit weaker but is still quite nice.  I tried drinking this coffee three different ways:<br /><br />- Straight black: When drank this way, I can really only rate the flavor as so-so.  The chocolate flavor that teases my nose is over-powered by the bitterness of the coffee.  I prefer most non-flavored coffees black over the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle.<br /><br />- With milk: Adding milk to this coffee definitely brings out the chocolate flavors and gives the coffee an overall richer and fuller flavor.  I would compare the flavor to a no-sweetener mocha latte.  This is definitely my preferred way to drink this coffee.<br /><br />- With milk and sugar: I typically avoid sugar, but for the purposes of this review I tried some of the coffee with milk and sugar as well.  This was quite delicious and the coffee almost tasted like light chocolate milk.  The flavor was richer and the sugar helps the chocolate flavors pop out a little more so than with milk alone.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent flavored coffee.  I wish that it tasted better straight black, but that is not the case.  Adding milk does wonders for this coffee and definitely makes it into a pleasant treat.  Black coffee drinkers probably won't like this one as much as those who prefer their java with milk or cream.  I wouldn't drink this coffee daily, but definitely see myself returning to it as a weekend or evening indulgence.

review/summary: good -- if you like mellow, flavored coffee
review/text: This review pertains to the Dark Chocolate Truffle flavor of Gevalia's ground coffee.<br /><br />Having subscribed to Gevalia's service at one point in the past, I wasn't expecting to like this coffee very much since I previously found Gevalia's coffee to be much less rich than I like.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoy the flavor of this coffee quite a lot, however, precisely because of its mix of mellowness on top of the chocolate flavor.  I'm not normally a big fan of flavored coffees and generally prefer an extremely strong cup of brew (for drip coffees, typically a French or Italian roast), but this was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />My only real complaint involves the packaging.  Gevalia still seals its packages into little bricks that leave no way to close them once they've been opened.  Since the foil is so tight, opening the bag requires cutting it.  Once the bag is cut, you either need to leave the top of the bag open until you've finished the coffee inside or transfer the coffee into a different container.  Why Gevalia does not use bags that can be folded bag down and semi-sealed after each use (like every other premium coffee brand) is a mystery to me.

You could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire.

Adding things to coffee to improve its taste has always seemed like "gilding the lily," to me.<br /><br />That said, this is not a bad cup. But more like hot chocolate than coffee. If this came in a Swiss Miss box that said, "Coffee Flavor," I'd give it 5 stars.<br /><br />I found that my Cusinart Coffee machine needed more grounds than the directions on the Gevalia box called for, but I often find that to be the case with pre-ground coffees.<br /><br />I most enjoyed the last batch that I made because I didn't have enough left for a full pot and had to make up the difference with some of my regular brand. This toned down the chocolate flavor to the point where I felt it was coffee with chocolate and not the other way round.

review/summary: Good coffee - if you are into flavored coffee
review/text: We always brew Starbucks coffee at home and we rarely consume flavored coffee. We tried this coffee and liked it.<br /><br />If you enjoy flavored coffee, then you are likely to enjoy this coffee.<br /><br />I wish it brewed a little stronger (bold) coffee.

review/text: I'm not a coffee drinker, but most people I know are so I thought I'd try it.<br />It has a nice, rich taste. Really smooth and chocolatey. It is very satisfying and the aroma is warm, sweet and pleasant.<br />I don't think I will drink it too much as I don't like caffeine, but if I did, this would be the one I'd pick.<br />If you love chocolate, you'll like this very much.

review/summary: An artificial dark truffle
review/text: My expectations for the coffee were probably framed by my frequent use of Gevalia's Breakfast Blend coffee.  The dark truffle flatters to deceive.  There is "truth in advertising" in that the packaging clearly states "Artificially flavored ground coffee", but nevertheless, the lack of chocolate as an ingredient really doesn't do any justice for the brand name or the premium pricing for the product.  For the price, one wished  that the flavor was at least slightly better than a sense of a cheaper cocoa-powdered drink.  That said, the coffee is mildly aromatic and pleasant tasting. Despite my love for chocolate and coffee, I actually prefer Gevalia's Vanilla Nut coffee to this one.

review/summary: Quite tasty, but needs cream and name is not really accurate!
review/text: I'm a big fan of flavored coffees: I generally make them up at home in my French press, which I've found is an excellent way to brew up a quick 'pot' of coffee.  I was really pleased to be given the opportunity to review a Gevalia coffee called 'Dark Chocolate Truffle'!<br /><br />I found this coffee to be a bit confused: it is a medium brew, medium strength coffee: the ground coffee was a much lighter brown than I expected based on the name...I was truly expecting a DARK, espresso-like, dark-chocolate like (meaning more 'bitter' than sweet) color: it only somewhat lived up to the name.  The flavor itself is a bit artificial for me: the coffee is on the astringent side, and absolutely NEEDS cream and benefits from the addition of some sugar (I used RAW); what's left after you drink the cup is a bit of 'melted' chocolate-type residue on the bottom of the cup, exactly what you might find when finishing a thick hot chocolate that wasn't quite stirred fully.  I enjoyed the two cups that I had of this, and will drink the rest of this box, but I doubt that I'm inspired enough to purchase this again: I can think of other coffees I favor more, especially at the higher, indulgent Gevalia price.<br /><br />I wouldn't have named this 'Dark Chocolate Truffle', but I did enjoy the flavor, even with the resulting aftertaste ~ would recommend, just keep the things I said above....it's good, not great, mis-named, but TASTY and I did like it, just likely not enough to make me a repeat customer, although some will absolutely ADORE this!

review/summary: Perfect for Chocolate & Coffee Lovers
review/text: Tired of paying an arm and a leg for flavored coffee drinks that are just making you fat? Brew up a pot of THIS at home!<br /><br />We buy a pouch of "flavored" coffee every week or so. Dunkin Donuts or Eight O'clock or folger's gourmet. They are ok with varying degrees of coffee quality and "flavor." We've tried Seattle's Best & Seattle can keep it. This is definitely one of the best.<br /><br />When I opened the pouch, I ws afraid it wouldn't have much in the way of chocolate flavor, but once it brewed...the aroma was fantastic. It's a very nice mixture of chocolate and coffee flavors without the sweet (you can add that if you must). At 7$ a pouch, it is comprable to what we get in the grocery...and quite yummy!

review/summary: Better than most I've had.
review/text: I usually buy Millstone, but recently tried Dunkin' Donuts, Folgers, Gevalia, generic grocery store brands and Starbucks. Gevalia is actually my favorite of the bunch. It's really good. And no I'm not saying that because I got a free sample, but because it is a good, drinkable coffee. Even with flavored creamer I could still taste the chocolate flavoring of the coffee. It wasn't bitter or weak, but was full flavored. It is finely ground, which I like. I don't know if this will be available in stores in my area, but if I come across it I would absolutely buy it again and it would replace my normal brand, Millstone.

review/summary: Corn
review/text: The Gevalia "Dark Chocolate Truffle" coffee comes in a cute cardboard package citing its 1853 origins.  The coffee is contained in a nice gold-colored foil bag, which you have to cut to open.  The finely ground coffee looks quite dark.  After opening the package, I brewed the coffee using the same method that I use for my regular ground coffee, pouring water over a heaping tablespoon in a paper filter.  The liquid was also quite dark.  The taste was a mixture of coffee and chocolate flavors in about equal intensity.  The coffee flavor was not very strong considering how dark it was.  The chocolate flavor was pleasant.  I would rate the combination of tastes interesting, but not exciting.  However, the chocolate flavor left a slightly bitter aftertaste that seemed to last for a long time.<br /><br /> Ingredients listed on the package are few: arabica coffee, artificial and natural flavor.  I like to know what I am putting into my body, so I called the 800 number listed on the package.  The phone menu that I encountered had no option for information on the coffee itself, so I made a random choice.  The call-center person who answered was pleasant enough, but had no immediate information on the ingredients.  She looked up what appeared to be a script for answering ingredient questions.<br /><br />I asked what the ingredients were.  She replied, "Coffee with a small amount of corn derived ingredients."  I asked if the corn ingredients included high-fructose corn syrup.  She could not say.  This time she said that the corn-derived ingredients were "an insignificant amount of corn-derived ingredients."  I tried something different next.  Tell me about the chocolate, I said.  The answer was a surprise.  "It does not contain chocolate."  Then she repeated the mantra, "It has a small amount of corn-derived ingredients."  I thanked her and hung up.  Apparently, you can make anything out of corn,<br /><br />My conclusion is that you cannot trust this product.  It is intellectually dishonest to pretend that this is small boutique-type product when in fact it contains uncertain quantities of unknown chemical additives.  It is totally irresponsible not to reveal the nature of the ingredients when asked.  People do have allergies and other dietary requirements that make it necessary for them to know what they are consuming.

review/summary: Chocolate Truffle Coffee Brightens a Tired Sunday Morning
review/text: After a late Saturday evening filled with considerable conversation, I awoke leery of the day. Weary and unready for daylight, I thought four cups would be enough to realize the world was still good, and they were. My home filled the sweet aroma as the coffee trickled from my machine, and the joy of caffeinated consciousness arrived in full force within moments of sipping. Sunday morning's mercy opened to the freshly ground kindness of Gevalia Kaffe: Dark Chocolate Truffle.<br /><br />The beans were finely ground, and so fewer spoons of it were needed than for my usual preparation for drip coffee. It should be a suitable grind for espresso.<br /><br />Darker than an unflavored coffee, the Gevalia presented a strong, completely chocolate coffee taste. Truly as advertised, it reminded me of chocolate truffles I buy at a shop in a train station. On its own, I found the coffee more intense than I prefer, though modest amounts of sugar and cream mitigated it into pleasure.<br /><br />May your mornings be lifted by the alert fragrance and flavor of chocolate truffle coffee by Gevalia.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/summary: "Chocolate" flavor is too much like chocolate extract
review/text: As one who really likes Gevalia cofee, I had visions of creamy chocolate truffles melting in my mouth when I read the box.  The reality was a rather rude awakening.<br /><br />If you have ever had chocolate extract, it does not taste quite like chocolate.  It is said to contain the "top notes" that are lost in heating and processing of cocoa.  The top notes do not taste like the chocolate we know and love because we aren't use them.  Some people like it, some find it artificial tasting.  This Gevalia chocolate truffle coffee tastes like cheap Folgers with a splash of chocolate extract.  I think the chocolate flavoring ruined the wonderful taste of the Gevalia coffee.  I tried different things:  adding cream, sugar and even vanilla extract.  Although I could get it to taste quite good, the coffee by itself was a disappointment and was not very good without a lot of doctoring.

review/text: The dark chocolate truffle flavor overpowers the coffee flavor.  Not the best combination of chocolate and coffee.  The flavors compete against each other, don't blend well, and leave an unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />Dark chocolate and dark coffee are two of my favorite things, however Gevalia did not capture the potential of this blend very well.  I wouldn't buy this coffee.  It sounds wonderful, but the actual experience was a letdown.

review/text: We made an individual cup of this and battled over who would drink it. You don't really get a "dark" chocolate flavor---it's quite mild---but the product description of "velvety" certainly applies. Add some milk and a little sugar and it's almost like gourmet hot chocolate for grown-ups.  You won't be disappointed if you buy. My only reservation is the price---buying in bulk might be a good idea!!

review/summary: Chocolate and coffee are two major food groups
review/text: If you're trying to avoid sweets over the holidays, but drink coffee and like chocolate, this may be just the thing.  As promised, it is strong and satisfying--so much so that this reviewer, who drinks Starbucks regularly, will be using less that the prescribed amount in the future.  A small cup will have you convinced that you had some imported dark chocolate.  Of course, the coffee does have caffeine, so this can't be a go-to beverage too often during the day.  It appears that a decaf version is available, and that's the one I would keep on hand so as to avoid the fattening snacks which are a constant temptation during the holiday season.<br />$14. a pound is a lot for coffee, so I would consider this a luxury to purchase occasionally or as a gift, or to put on your wish list so you get it as a gift.  There is a "subscribe and save" option which brings the price down somewhat.

review/summary: Excellent, if pricy....
review/text: Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Artificially Flavored Ground Coffee delivers an excellent, if pricey, cup of coffee.<br /><br />Gevalia makes several assertions about their product: "8 ounces of flavored ground coffee in a vacuum packaged foil bag, which ensures complete freshness."  Gevalia coffees, as most higher end coffees, are vacuum packaged.  This does increase their freshness, but it's generally agreed that ground coffees are not as fresh as those immediately ground from beans.<br /><br />"Rich, chocolaty"  The flavor is rich, and it is a pleasant chocolate, not too chocolate to compete with the coffee flavor.  But keep in mind that this is 'artificially flavored' coffee.<br /><br />"Light roast"  This is a light, mellow, middle of the road coffee.<br /><br />"Low acidity, medium intensity, and medium body" The coffee itself is first rate, pleasant but not intense.<br /><br />"Origin: Central America, South America"  The Arabica beans used provide a smooth, flavorful brew.<br /><br />In conclusion, Gevalia Dark Chocolate Coffee provides an excellent cup of mild, flavorful coffee that retains its integrity - it's not mocha, it's a lightly chocolate coffee, not a coffee drink.<br /><br />And if you happen to be making a chocolate dessert that calls for coffee, try this one.  It's an excellent addition to chocolate muffins or Chocolat Grand'Mere.

review/text: Truth to tell, if I could only drink one coffee, this would be it.  The dark chocolate flavor, mixed superbly with an already fine coffee, never disappoints, whether it's in the bag, brewing, in your cup, or in you.  The only real problem I've had is with the price and the fact that if you buy this coffee directly from Gevalia you have to accept periodic shipments, including shipping cost.  Amazon is currently selling Gevalia without these detractions, plus it's on sale.  The Amazon price is $14.40 a pound, but currently it's being sold for 25 percent off that price, or $10.80, making it fairly affordable.  You have no idea how good this coffee is until you try it; what a wonderful way it was to start my Thanksgiving day, or any other one, for that matter.

review/text: I'm not normally a fan of flavored coffee, but I do love dark chocolate (even up to the 99% cocoa stuff), so I figured I'd give this a try. I was very pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />It comes freeze-dried, so you have to cut the package open and then it expends to let air in. The coffee is very finely ground, but it still worked fine in my french press. I drink mine with about 1/3 milk, no sugar, and it was very good like that. You can taste the chocolatiness, but it's not overpowering. I'll definitely finish this.<br /><br />Minus one start because the packaging does mean that you'll have to store it in some other sort of container after initially opening it. There is no good way to reseal the inner package, so I put that package inside a plastic bag and stuck it in the freezer (I don't drink coffee at home all that much so I keep it in there).<br /><br />I am by no means a coffee connoisseur, but I did enjoy this and would consider getting it again as a flavored dessert-type coffee.

review/summary: Very Close
review/text: I try flavoured coffees all the time; and what I am really looking for (I've recently been able to articulate) is a full-blooded cup of coffee that has a taste of whatever is my particular flavour of the month.  I have not found that in many of the brands I've tried.  They've either been too flavour-oriented (which meant the 'coffee' was weak and bland) or basically coffee (with a bad artificial tasting 'flavour').<br /><br />This one comes the closest to what I want.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I agree with another reviewer who says that sugar and cream bring out the best in this coffee.  So for the "give me mine black" crowd, this might not be the choice for you.  But let's be honest, that crowd probably wouldn't sully their palates with a "flavoured brew" (insert appropriate amount of disdain) anyway :-).<br /><br />Note that there is artificial flavour in the mix, but it still tastes really pretty good.

review/summary: Medium Bodied. Distinct Dark Chocolate Flavor, But MAJOR  Bitter Aftertaste
review/text: If it weren't for the significant bitter aftertaste, I would have rated this coffee 4 stars.<br /><br />I generally drink a medium bodied coffee & this coffee was right on the mark on this aspect.  It has a pleasant brew smell & comes out a nice, rich dark color in a coffee cup.  I'm a "regular coffee" coffee drinker in the morning & then switch to flavored coffee or tea in the afternoon.  To me, this is an afternoon coffee or a holiday "after meal" coffee.<br /><br />Without the addition of cream/milk & sugar, the coffee does taste dark chocolatey and, initially, not too bitter & not too sweet.  Taken with cream/milk & sugar, the taste improves immensely, and is a satisfying, pleasant flavor.  The drawback comes at the finish, however, because either way, black or with cream/sugar, there is a major, bitter aftertaste.  That was very disappointing to what I would have rated a decent coffee (not a fabulous coffee).<br /><br />I'm sure Gevalia makes a better tasting coffee (this was my first taste of anything Gevalia).  I'd recommend you go searching for that better tasting coffee.

review/summary: Good with half and half and a touch of sugar
review/text: I've always thought that since taste is a matter of... well, taste, it helps to know a little about the reviewer to understand their review.  I like a medium or dark roast coffee or espresso.  I prefer unflavored, unsweetened coffee, and generally don't like artificial flavors.  Basically, I like everything this coffee isn't.  And my experiences with Gevalia have been pretty poor.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I tasted this coffee and actually liked it.<br /><br />It's an artificially flavored light roasted Arabica coffee.  I brewed it according to the instructions: one slightly rounded tablespoon and six ounces of water in a three-cup coffee press to make one mug of coffee.  It was was too finely ground for a coffee press, so I'd recommend using a drip coffeemaker.  I tasted it black, and found it to be a smooth coffee with very little acidity and no bitterness.  The chocolate flavor was there, but flat and unremarkable.  I added half and half, which made the coffee a bit more rich and helped fill out the chocolate flavor.  A quarter teaspoon of sugar was not enough to make the coffee sweet, but it did help open up the chocolate flavor quite a bit.<br /><br />The aroma of the coffee when I first opened the foil vacuum pack was wonderful, a chocolate scent that was almost sweet, but after it was brewed the aroma faded away.<br /><br />This will become a dessert coffee when we'll be serving chocolate or perhaps fruits that go well with chocolate.  It's not going to be a regular daily brew.

review/summary: fantastic, rich and very strong so make it with less coffee than you usually do
review/text: Original review:<br />I love Gevalia coffees. I used to be a subscriber to their coffee service and would look forward to my monthly shipments. For the most part their coffee is simply stellar. This coffee smells delicious out of the package, and while brewing, but the chocolate taste is too much for my palate. Never thought I would say that something is too chocolatey but this is! If you are a choco-holic this might be the perfect coffee for you. It is a chocolate truffle so I guess it is to be expected.<br /><br />Update to this review:<br /> A couple of weeks later I returned to this coffee. But with one difference. I halved the amount of coffee I brewed with and voila! The flavors came right out in a very pleasant way. The mistake was definitely mine. I like my coffee strong yet I was defintely making this coffee too strong! I say, if you love chocolate and coffee you should give this a shot but make it with about half of what you use to make regular old coffee. The flavors just come right out in a balanced way. My original review was three stars, I have upgraded to four. Could be a 4.5. I would definitely buy this coffee again.<br /><br />I have written many reviews and have never updated one. I was so surprised by how good this coffee turned out that I felt impelled to re-write my review. My original title was: "Smells great but way too chocolatey" and it just doesn't apply once I got the right quantity.

This coffeemaker was recommended by Consumer Reports, is not expensive, and we like it.  I mention that because we have noticed that as the coffeemaker ages, the coffee loses flavor.  I guess the coils don't get as hot.  Also, we always shut the coffeemaker off immediately.  Leaving it on, quickly ruins the coffee taste.<br /><br />On the Gevalia Chocolate, the aroma is wonderful, both on opening and during the brewing process.  Creates a nice atmosphere.<br /><br />The first day, we used 7 tablespoons of coffee to 48 ounces of water.  We found the coffee too full bodied for our tastes. The next day we used only 6 tablespoons of coffee to 48 ounces of water.  Though this would seem to make a weak brew, it was very smooth and with a nice flavor.  Not a real chocolate taste, but a pleasant flavor. To summarize. We consider this a nice coffee to give as a gift, and to brew when guests are in the house.  We will buy it occasionally, but it will not be our primary coffee.  Hope this review helps someone.

review/summary: give this a try
review/text: wifey and i love our coffee.  this is a fun brew by gevalia especially because my wife loves coffee and chocolate and this combination works. if wifey was the reviewer it would probably get a 5 star rating but since i am and i'm not that fond of chocolate i will give it a 4.  if you use a french press take your time, let it sit for a few minutes then sloooowwwly push the plunger.  i prefer a courser ground for french press but it still works so a drip maker with a filter should be better.

review/text: I have always liked flavored coffee, but often they are acidic or bitter with fake flavor. This coffee is very smooth (no bitterness) with a really rich chocolate scent.  Tastes great with a dab of cream :)  If you like chocolate and coffee, this is definitely worth trying, I know I will be getting more.

review/text: I would normally rate this 5 stars for being hearty and bold, but the flavor is a little too phony and the aftertaste is annoying. Despite that, I still recommend this if you want something different than regular Arabica beans.

review/summary: Tasty Flavored Coffee
review/text: I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees because they rarely if ever name all the ingredients used in the product. Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle is finely ground coffee and a tasty dessert coffee. I found it works best in a French press. It's the kind of coffee to have around for guests, holidays or celebratory occasions. Due to those with various food allergies, I wish the FDA made it MANDATORY for companies to name ALL the ingredients in their products. If you're a fan of flavored coffee and like chocolate, you may want to try this. It's the best chocolate coffee I've tried to date. It has a rich, delicate flavor without using any milk, cream or sugar. Happy Holidays.

review/summary: Fabulous aroma - best when used for a special Cafe Au Lait treat!
review/text: Gevalia flavored coffees have been kind of hit & miss for me with all of them having a marvelous aroma but being little short on quality considering the price.  Not so this new Dark Chocolate Truffle flavor.  Attractively packaged in a dark purple and brown box suitable for gift-giving, this ground coffee brews up nicely in my drip maker and in my fancy French Press.  It's a little bit bitter as a black coffee but once you add some steamed milk and just a touch of sugar, you wind up with a superb Cafe Au Lait suitable for after-dinner dessert coffee or just for a special weekend brunch.  It fills the kitchen with its scent.  I could see this making a great base for an alcoholic dessert coffee by adding  some Kahlua & Cholcate curls atop the steamed milk.  My leftover drip-brewed coffee made a nice Ice-blended the next day.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would but this regularly due to Gevalia's price but I would definitely keep some on hand during the Holiday Season!  It has a nice, rich Chocolate flavor.  Overall, this was quite the pleasant surprise.

review/summary: Candy for Grownups
review/text: I had been looking forward to my sample of Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Coffee and wondered how they would manage to blend the flavors.  Some of the chocolate coffees I have tried are do not find the right mix:  the coffee is too strong for the chocolate or the chocolate is too sweet for the coffee.  As wonderful as the flavors of both may be apart, those who get the right blend are in the minority.<br /><br />Gevalia has managed to get this one spot on.  The coffee is robust but not overpoweringly so.  It might not have done as well with milk chocolate but with the dark chocolate it was a perfect match.  Similarly, a weaker coffee would have been overpowered by the chocolate.<br /><br />Those expecting the taste of milk chocolate (the most common in over-the-shelf candy) might be disappointed as will those who like their coffee on the weak side.  But for those of us who like our coffee strong and our chocolate rich, this is an early Christmas present!

review/summary: A rich, full-bodied flavor for coffee lovers
review/text: I've had the regular flavor Gevalia before, and I truly believe it is the finest coffee on the face of the planet, so I was pleased for an opportunity to review the chocolate truffle, which is new to me.<br /><br />The smell is absolutely wonderful. It has a caramel character to it, and it even whetted the appetite of my husband who isn't into flavored coffee.<br /><br />The chocolate flavor has the right balance, I think. Not too strong, but distinct, and for people who want to enhance it, the addition of cream and sugar will accomplish this. (I used cream.)<br /><br />While the chocolate balance is perfect, the coffee itself is really heavy. Personally, I prefer a rounded, medium-bodied coffee. My husband agreed with me on this point. That doesn't mean it isn't fabulous; it's just a taste preference, so it gets five stars anyway because it is a very good coffee and my mother enjoyed the full, heavy flavor.<br /><br />After I continued to drink it a while, it grew on me and I began to appreciate it as I took it on its own terms and didn't compare it to the Gevalia I'm used to drinking. While I still wish it were a medium-bodied coffee, I do like it, would certainly drink it again, and plan to buy more in the future. My mother is completely enamored with this coffee. We will be brewing it for Thanksgiving, and I plan to buy more for Christmas.

review/summary: Gevalia always leads the pack
review/text: Elegantly boxed in royal purple, opening this coffee was like unwrapping an expensive gift (which it was, in a way).  The coffee itself is a solid block inside a gold foil envelope. Once the foil is opened, there's a satisfying whoosh indicating air entering a vacuum and the ground coffee subsides into something easy to measure.  The aroma is simply wonderful.<br /><br />The directions on the box suggest experimenting with the amount of ground coffee per pot.  I used the same amount I always use in a standard 12 cup drip coffeemaker, and it was delicious. A lot of flavored coffees on the market taste like the flavor was added as an afterthought and tend to have a bitter bite.  Not so, this one.  A perfect blend of coffee and dark chocolate, the flavor is smooth, deep and rich. As a bonus, the whole house smells heavenly while the coffee is brewing.<br /><br />As suggested, I'm storing the coffee in its foil bag in the refrigerator, but I don't think it's going to last long enough to matter.  The Gevalia name has always stood for excellence and this one is no exception.  It's superb.<br /><br />Investing in a pack of three would be an excellent start towards holiday gift giving.  I don't know any coffee drinker who wouldn't welcome receiving a box of Dark Chocolate Truffle Ground Coffee.  All you'd have to do is stick a gold bow on the top!

review/summary: This is delicious coffee!
review/text: I've never been a fan of Gevalia, in all honesty. I've always found it to be rather weak and not worth the price. But the flavor of this one sounded intriguing, so I tried it. It's wonderful! Smooth, deep and dark without being bitter, and the chocolate undertones are deliciously rich. It's an excellent dessert coffee, and also serves quite well as "dessert" on its own, for those who decide to skip the actual desserts after dinner.<br /><br />I can't wait to add this coffee to my family's Thanksgiving menu. Update: This coffee got rave reviews after Thanksgiving dinner. Normally my family argues over the coffee... too strong, too weak etc. But today everyone couldn't stop saying "this coffee is REALLY good!" Can't recommend it highly enough.

review/summary: It's pretty good, not really great
review/text: I don't normally drink flavored coffee. But I like trying different things...<br /><br />It's vacuum sealed and when I opened it, it smelled great. I was excited to try it. Normally I make coffee with a French press (it needs to be coarse), but this seemed to be ground finely. However, I have an electric water kettle and a little over the cup Melitta maker. That is how I made it.<br /><br />While making it, it really smelled great (it says "artificially flavored" on the box but I thought it smelled great. So when I tried it, it surprised me that it was strong coffee tasting. If you are getting flavored coffee because you don't like coffee this is not for you! I like coffee but it surprised me both with how long the chocolate flavor stayed with me and with how it had a bitter kick.<br /><br />You might like it better than I did if you like stronger, punchier coffee. This is not weak coffee!<br /><br />To me, it just wasn't really great coffee. I like it, but I don't think I'm going out of my way to get it again.

review/summary: Artifically flavored Coffee
review/text: I received this coffee through the Vines Program.  I had expected a high quality coffee with natural flavorings.  Instead, this coffee is artifically flavored and it tastes like it.  The basic coffee does not stand out on its own and is actually rather bland.  The artifical chocolate flavoring sort of tastes like chocolate, but not like a quality Dark Chocolate.<br /><br />If you are not looking for anything other than perhaps something warm to drink, this might be an ok product.  If, however, you tend to drink coffee from places like Starbucks, Tully's, or other high end providers, this will probably not be your favorite coffee drink.<br /><br />This coffee did nothing for me and I wound up throwing out the pot of coffee and putting the rest of the grounds into my compost bin.

review/summary: A decadent gem from Gevalia
review/text: I'm not usually one for flavored coffees. Save for a wonderful hazelnut brew I had at Thanksgiving dinner about fifteen years ago, I usually stick with darker roasts from Africa & Central-America. In fact, my current favorite is an organic blend from my wife's home country, Honduras. I have, however, found something truly delightful in this wonderful Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Ground Coffee. This captivating coffee ( derived, co-incidentally, given my taste, from South & Central America) has a thoroughly enticing aroma & just the right hint of dark chocolate truffle flavor added to make me wonder if the phrase "decadent indulgence" shouldn't be included on the elegant blue packaging. A exceptionally pleasing cup of coffee is surely in store for anyone who gives Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Ground Coffee a try. An absolutely top drawer product that I very highly recommend!

review/text: Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Ground Coffee in the 8 ounce box is delightful!  With a splash of cream and a bit of honey, a cup (or two!) of this coffee makes a nice replacement for dessert.  The small 8 ounce box is cute enough to include in a gift basket for the coffee lovers on your list.<br /><br />The rich, full-bodied taste makes Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Ground Coffee a great hot treat on a snowy day.  I only wish that the coffee wasn't artificially flavored, and that the ingredients list would tell buyers exactly what artificial flavors were used, instead of only listing them as "artificial ingredients".<br /><br />All in all, this is a great coffee for chocolate and coffee lovers alike.

review/summary: Who are these gevalians and why are their cups so small?
review/text: Pros: When Gevalia says Dark Chocolate, they mean it<br />Cons: Since when did 6oz become a cup?<br /><br />I have always preferred South American coffee to other regions.  A lot of commercial brands have been selling junk from the area but South America's better beans have a smooth taste with very little bitterness.  Gevalia appears to be using some of these better arabica beans from the area but honestly I wouldn't know one way or the other due to the deep, heavy chocolate flavor.  It reminds me of the days when I used to mix cocoa into my coffee cup, long before I became a coffee snob.  I would use this as a dessert coffee because the smooth chocolate flavor is quite nice; especially when cream is added to bring out the flavor.<br /><br />My only gripe is with the directions, "1 rounded tablespoon for each six ounce cup of coffee??"  I guess you will need to do some calculating to equate to a real cup of coffee as you'll need more than 3 scoops to equal the size of that Starbucks Venti you've grown to love.  As for making a full pot, you should be fine using the same scooper you normally use.

review/text: Still my favorite coffee add-on.<br /><br />Gevalia's dark chocolate truffle coffee is very, very finely ground, sweet and not bitter. Not sugary, but cocoa at its best. For a more americanized cup of joe, add one scoop of your usual canned junk, but anyway you serve it, one of the smoothest brews I'veever tasted, and I've tasted a lot of coffees. Classy! I'll always buy it for a few cups of something special, like the holidays (right now). Tops for gifting if your recipient is savvy enough to appreciate it!

The mouthwatering aroma will bring chocolate lovers running. (My kids were quite disappointed to find that there was coffee in the pot with the yummy smelling chocolate.) The Husband (not a dedicated dark chocolate consumer) thoroughly enjoyed his cuppa. He was pleased that the chocolate flavoring was rich and sweet rather than strong and bitter (which he normally associates with the dark chocolate blends). I can't wait to get out the holiday mugs and serve this to my dark chocolate loving friends and relatives.<br /><br />A very nice treat for the coffee lover with a bit of a sweet tooth.

review/summary: Smells great and OMG! This is GOOD!
review/text: The first taste of the black coffee was somewhat bitter with a clean chocolate after taste. The addition of Sugar mellowed it out and eliminated the bitterness. The addition of milk turned it into ambrosia. I kind of expected to be disappointed because other chocolate flavored coffees I've tried have not been very good. This is good, the chocolate flavor is excellent.  The smell is absolutely delightful,it drew family members into the kitchen to ask what that wonderful fragrance was.The lovely aroma was so enthralling that the family member who dislikes/hates coffee insisted on having a cup. She loved it sweetened with milk added and will drink it again.  We joked about using it as a room freshener or wearing it as perfume. This is a very fine grind, a rounded tablespoon of coffee to 6 ounces of water makes a very strong brew. It can be diluted and retains its flavor. My husband loved it too and wants me to buy it when it is available. I think this tastes best sweetened.

review/summary: Doesn't taste anything like chocolate to me
review/text: I have purchased Gevalia flavored coffees for years, so I was looking forward to trying this Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle Coffee.<br /><br />Chocolate is my favorite food, period, and I love chocolate truffles.  I am also a big coffee drinker.<br /><br />Upon opening the package, I took a few sniffs, but could detect no chocolate scent at all.<br /><br />I like my coffee on the milder side, so I put one slightly heaping scoop of coffee for a large coffee mug into my automatic coffeemaker.<br /><br />All I tasted was a bitter taste.  Now I know dark chocolate tends to be somewhat bitter, especially compared to other kinds of chocolate.<br /><br />On the front of the box of coffee it does say it's artificially flavored.<br /><br />For a more high end company I expected better.  Even tho the package was sealed, even when I first opened the package, it did not smell really fresh like it should have.<br /><br />To me, the only things that really ring true about this coffee is indeed it is coffee, and it is somewhat dark, especially compared to regular coffee.  I tasted no chocolate taste at all.

review/summary: Best Combo of Chocolate and Coffee!
review/text: I had the opportunity taste this coffee in an early sampling. I've always found Gevalia coffees to be a quality product. More than once I've ordered it to get a free coffee maker and later had to cancel it because their pricing is a little rich for my blood. It is priced as an indulgence and it delivers the goods when it comes to taste. I am not normally a flavored coffee lover but I have to admit that Gevalia has found the perfect balance between rich chocolate and coffee flavor. It good drunk black, but add a little sweetener and cream, and the flavor is really enhanced in a positive way, delivering liquid version of a coffee flavored truffle. While I'd classify this as a dessert coffee, it would be great as a morning eye-opener as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great addition to the line of quality coffees from Gevalia. Chocolate and coffee lovers will find a lot to savor in these three 8 oz. boxes.
