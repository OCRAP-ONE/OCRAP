review/summary: Easy Way to Get Your Salmon
review/text: This product doesn't taste like fresh or frozen salmon, but it is great to have on hand.  I believe that salmon is good for me, and this is a portion that's the right size for me.  I need to have this on hand when I run out of fresh fish and need my nutrition in easy form.

review/summary: It's mushy & tasteless. Contains skin, cartilage & bone.
review/text: I love salmon. I love canned tuna. I love Chicken of the Sea tuna, in particular. I should love this, right? Wrong.<br /><br />Based on all these reviews, I really thought this might be something special. Well, it's not. The salmon is bland, barely pink and just not tasty. It's also shredded and packed in water, which makes is mushy. The salmon packet contains skin, plus contains small bone/cartilage fragments & pieces.<br /><br />This item might be suitable if you are camping or stranded on a desert island. But for me, I'd rather go hungry. And based on another recent review, there is a dog who won't eat it either. I certainly don't recommend for a household with children given bone & cartilage in the package!<br /><br />One star for contents. An additional star for convenience.

review/summary: Little peppers - BIG TASTE!
review/text: 3/23/11  South New Jersey<br />I've been buying DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Peppers for about six months now.  All I can say is that if you don't have home roasted peppers on hand these grilled piquillo peppers will definitely fit the bill.  These are the tastiest purchased grilled/roasted peppers that we have ever tasted and I think we are roasted pepper connoisseurs.  This company also does sell a roasted piquillo pepper which for our taste is not quite as tasty as the grilled.  Don't get me wrong, their roasted are also good, but the grilled are over the top.  I do "roast" my own and the way I do them we as well as anyone who has ever tasted them go crazy for them.  But again, if you need or would rather purchase cooked peppers the DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Pepper will not disappoint you.  I usually purchase them at the store, however, when I checked the price of them online there was quite a savings at Amazon for a case of 12.  The case arrived in good condition and the jars had an appropriate expiration date on them.  No matter where you get them they are a little pricey, but someone grew and cared for these peppers, grilled, jared, labeled and shipped them.  Allot went into these little jars.  Whenever you see red peppers know that whoever grew them took care of them much longer to get them to the red stage rather than picking green.  I make my own salad dressings and I do add the liquid from the jar to my dressing.  The liquid is  flavored with the natural oil from the peppers and is delicious.  Try them!  You'll like them!

review/summary: Tasty piquillos
review/text: After Trader Joe's discontinued their piquillos I found Delallo peppers at Amazon, ordered them, and have been enjoying them ever since.  Their appearance, flavor, and country of origin (Peru) is the same as TJ's brand, though the Delallo product may be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />I was puzzled by the one negative review, which is a verbatim repeat of a critical review submitted a month earlier by the same writer for a different product -- the "roasted" piquillos.  I wonder if the alleged "mold" was actually char marks from the grill, which is normal?<br /><br />Anyway I received the 12-pack in good condition several days after ordering them, and am pleased with the quality of the product and the prompt, careful packing &  shipping (no breakage).

review/summary: Tasty sugar bombs
review/text: OK, lets face it.  Sometimes you just want some good old-fashioned sugar bombs for breakfast.  But when you go to the store all of the "Name Brands" have gone to the dark side and are now "High Fiber", whole grain or some such similar hooey. As if you could actually make sweetened breakfast cereal good for you.  And they taste crappy, not at all like the original versions.<br /><br />Tootie Fruties taste just like the old fashioned Froot Loops before being wussified.  If you want the original taste and have not succumbed to the silly idea of making your sugar bombs "healthy" these are for you.

review/text: I was very satisfied with my purchase of caramels covered in dark chocolate from Sweet Mona's.  They were being sent to someone very special who LOVES caramels so it was extremely important that they arrived in perfect condition - which they did. Sweet Mona's took extra care in packaging the caramels so they wouldn't melt, as it was June and they were being mailed to the east coast and temps had been in the upper 80's. They made it safely without melting - and I heard that they tasted yummy as well!  Thanks Sweet Mona's for the excellent care and quality product!

However, I'm a DARK CHOCOLATE fan.  So after coming home that day I went online to search for sea salted caramels and I ordered these.  I have to tell you...they are SO WORTH THE MONEY!!!  I paid like $3.00 for one caramel at Whole Foods and the quality of this product is far better!  I will be ordering again and encourage you to do the same!!

review/summary: Great Chocolate...Fantastic Service
review/text: Very rarely do I write reviews, but felt compelled.<br /><br />I live in Texas and the temperatures are running about 95 degrees right now.  I knew I was taking a great risk ordering chocolate caramels from the West Coast (Washington state).  I was fully prepared to receive a puddle of chocolate.  Instead I received a very chic bow-wrapped box encased in a thermal bag with three bricks of what started as a frozen chiller.  The chocolate had not melted at all and while the caramels were soft, they were still in-tact and I will be able to use them at the luncheon I had planned them for.<br /><br />But what put this order into the "I have to review this" category was the care and detail I saw in the service.  The day after I placed the order, I received an email from Sweet Mona's stating that they had looked up the temperature in Texas and they would be packing the chocolate accordingly.  The packing material was what kept the caramels in-tact and beautiful.<br /><br />I will certainly be ordering from Sweet Mona's again and apprecate the care they put into their product.  I have ordered chocolates from other places and have usually just read a disclaimer that states they cannot guarantee their product upon delivery.

review/text: A few years ago I had this tea at a retreat and fell in love with its unique and multidimensional flavor. I was unable to find anywhere that sold this tea until recently, when I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. This is a very sweet tea - I always add sugar to tea and this one is sweet enough without any extra sugar. However, the sweetness is not overpowering as it also has a strong spice flavor. It smells amazing while brewing and tastes just as good. It makes excellent hot or iced tea, with or without milk/cream. If you are looking for something a little bit different to spice up your tea cabinet, this is the perfect choice for you!

They are very dense and not crumbly so you can easily put them in your pocket without getting stinky treat crumbs everywhere.  I really think they are the perfect treat for my boston terrier.  The only bummer is that they are kind of expensive and I wish you could buy bigger bags but I think they are worth the price.

review/summary: Brilliant bulk buy
review/text: I fell in love with Stash chocolate mint tea two years ago.  I am thrilled to be able to buy it now in an economical and environmentally friendly way.  This is used for my private use and I've felt uncomfortable with all the many boxes I've gone through in order to have my six bag a day tea fix.  If you are a tea junkie and care about our landfill situation then go for broke and purchase this way and save yourself a couple of hundred bucks.

review/summary: A ginormous box of 1,000 tea bags
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice.

review/summary: Great Alternative Sweetener
review/text: My review covers the Stevia In The Raw product in packet form. I have not tried the bulk product.<br /><br />This is a great alternative sweetener. It leaves no after taste that I can detect. I use it in tea, on cereal and in three different kinds of oatmeal. Everything that I have used it in or on has tasted the same as it did when sugar was used.<br /><br />I cam accross a couple of articles on Stevia while browsing on the Internet. After reading those two articles I did a little more research and decided to try Stevia. I found this product at our local Kroger store where it happened to be on sale. Kroger carries two ro three other Stevia based products however after comparing the list of ingredients for each I decided to buy the Stevia In The Raw. The list of ingredients for the packet form of this product is dextrose and Stevia Extract (Rebiana).<br /><br />OK, I tired it and it tastes great in everyhting I have used it with but I was curious. The Stevia extract is supposed to be 200 to 400 times more intensely sweet than sugar. If that is the case why was dextrose used and why was it the more prevalent ingredient? I called the company on their 800 and asked this same question. The answer is (according to them) that dextrose is a carbohydrate derived from crushed corn. It is a filler in their product. The Rebiana is so intensely sweet that it was impractical to package it in its pure form in individual packets. The volume would be so small that consumers would wonder if anything was really there. To me this sounds plausible. I am not a dietician, a doctor nor do I work for the company. I simply use their product and like it.<br /><br />I hope this info is helpful. Everyone have a gret day out there.

review/summary: You'll need 3 packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.
review/text: First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase "You get what you pay for" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't "in the raw". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled "raw" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself "raw" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think "Woo Hoo! I get more for less!" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't.

review/summary: This is the only brand out there with minimal aftertaste
review/text: I'm not 100% certain this is the same product sold at [...], but this is the only place I could find to review it, and I wanted to review it somewhere.  I love this stuff.  I've tried all the major stevia brands (including everything at Whole Foods), and Stevia in the Raw (which Whole Foods doesn't carry, sadly) is the only brand that doesn't taste like crap.  All other brands have a heavy bitter-licorice aftertaste.  Stevia in the Raw is unique in that I can put the powder itself to my tongue without grimacing.  I can't even do that with "normal" (i.e. toxic) sweeteners like NutraSweet or Equal (though Splenda tastes fine raw.)  I suppose I have a somewhat sensitive palate, and with the heavy amounts of sweetener I use, I can still detect a slight aftertaste even with Stevia in the Raw -- so if you're a heavy user with a sensitive palate, then just combine it with some erythritol and you're good to go.  No aftertaste whatsoever with that combo.  And this is way better for you than any other (palatable) sweetener.

review/summary: The best Stevia sweetener! NO FUNKY AFTERTASTE!!!
review/text: I've tried for years and years to like stevia, but it's always left a funky aftertaste in my mouth that just ruined it's use for me. Until now, the most tolerable of the stevias was the vanilla cream by sweetleaf, but even that left the funky after taste.<br /><br />A few months ago I decided to go on a marathon stevia taste test adventure and bought almost every brand out there to give them each a go. I didn't have high expectations as I fully expected them all to leave me with the funky taste. I did not do truvia, because it has another added sweetener - it is not pure stevia. I only tested those that were pure stevia plain flavor and vanilla flavor (since the sweetleaf vanilla had been the best one so far).<br /><br />I was shocked beyond belief when using the stevia in the raw and not having any funky after taste! I tried it many different ways - in chai tea, to sweeten hot breakfast cereal, for baking and cooking sweet treats, etc. and no aftertaste! I also tried larger quantities, as sometimes the more you use the increased after taste. So far no matter what I've done with this stevia I've had NO aftertaste what-so-ever!!!<br /><br />If you've tried to like stevia and just can't get past the after taste then give stevia in the raw a go - I think you'll be very surprised and pleased as I've been. Yay - finally a stevia I like.

review/summary: Very good stevia without any extra ingredients.
review/text: I bought them at Shoprite (at 3.79 for a box of 50, its cheaper than from this seller) and I am so happy that I can enjoy sweet things again!  I compared it to other sweetners such as truvia and purvia, I like this product because I won't support coca cola(maker of truvia) or pepsi (maker of purvia) if i buy this.  Also, there is only two ingredients : dextrose and stevia extract.  Each pack is 1 gram, so I assume there is maybe 0.9 gram of which is dextrose, which IS a sugar, but the FDA allows the labeling to be such that if a serving is under 4 calories, it can be called 'zero-calories'.<br /><br />To my understanding, dextrose is needed as the bulking agent (probably stevia extract is so potent, no one can use it if its in pure form) Online searching have shown dextrose contains 3.7 cal per gram, so if you have to use many packets for your tea or coffee, it won't be calories-free.  BUT, 3 packets of this (maybe like 10 cal) made my 12 oz of water with lemon juice taste like a real cup of lemonade made with real sugar, and THAT would be like 110 calories. And it taste so much better and healthier than splenda.

review/summary: What a Mixture of Reviews!
review/text: I guess our taste buds are all completely different considering the mixed reviews on this product.  Myself, I thought the Stevia in the Raw was pretty good.  It was no better or worse than any other sweetner I have tasted.  Considering it is healthier than the others, I will make it my brand of choice.  For one reviewer to call anyone who claims they like Stevia in the raw a liar, that is absurd.  Some people are so mean.  Many people drink Diet Coke and I can't stand it, even after trying to like it for years.  We all have different taste buds, obviously.  That is not a lie!

review/summary: Don't buy Stevia in the Raw if you are diabetic
review/text: Stevia in the raw is not good for diabetics.  I was so disappointed when I read the first ingredient is dextrose.  I should have looked at the label.  I thought it was pure stevia.  Dextrose is high glycemic and can raise your blood sugar. The makers of Stevia in the Raw are deceiving people who aren't firmiliar with dextrose.  Body builders use a shake with dextrose in it.  It is not a product that a diabetic should be using.  I will be taking my box of Stevia in the<br />Raw back.

Stevia in the Raw is one of the best stevia blends that I have tasted.

Maltodextrine is TWICE as bad for you as simple sugar.  So by cutting stevia with maltodextrine, In The Raw has negating anything positive about this product, and made it JUST AS BAD FOR YOU, if not worse than, table sugar.  Buy SweetLeaf instead.

review/text: Purchased a single box in my grocery store, thinking Stevia products would all taste the same. Big mistake. The packet aftertaste was so unpleasant that I tossed the whole box after several tries at sweetening my iced tea. Stevia in the Raw didn't even come close to the Now product I purchased formerly in packets (Stevia Extract, Non-Bitter)which contained maltodextrin (rice sugar product)that probably made the difference. Would prefer to skip maltodextrin. Perhaps the organic extract powder in containers will taste better than the packets. A disappointed consumer.

review/summary: Chemical Garbage!!! AVOID!!!
review/text: I have tried this in many different recipes, all to my dismay and wasted ingredients... It always comes out the same.  It tastes like serious chemicals and is so gross it overpowers everything else.  This is SOOO NOT worth the money or time!  If you're looking for a totally all natural sweetener just buy a lb of dates in the veggies section of your store, cut them in half and take out the pits/stems, soak them in like a cup of water over night (covered well over) then blend them in your blender/food processor. It will make a thick paste that you can store in a jar/container in your fridge for a couple weeks.  I know that may sound like more trouble, but really? You'd be waiting for these things in the mail and when they arrive, I know you'd be dissapointed. Dates are chemical/sugar free, all natural and totally sweet so they DO work in many recipes and even coffee/tea.  Dates, now, after trying many, many sweeteners ( I have a serious sweet tooth) are the ONLY thing I will endorse that is remotely safe for your body and also tastes GREAT.  Peace, hope this helps...

review/summary: Tastes good, but at what cost?
review/text: Stevia in the raw contains saccharine, which is most commonly found in Sweet n' Low, which has been linked to bladder cancer..."The actual warning reads:<br />"Use of this product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains saccharin, which has been determined to cause cancer in laboratory animals."<br />Note that this warning was removed in 2000 by the US Congress (not by the FDA) after heavy lobbying by the saccharin industry.<br />Further research was then done on saccharin, because the FDA wished to ban saccharin outright but the food companies fought this (successfully). The National Cancer Institute ran studies in the next 2 years and found that saccharin was indeed connected with bladder cancer. People who drank only 2 cans or more a day of diet soda had an increased risk."<br /><br />Stevia by itself is one of the 'healthiest' low cal sweeteners on the market but when mixed with things like saccharine - I mean you might as well just use sweet n' low. The only pure stevia brand I have found is SweetLeaf Stevia - it is not as delicious and most certainly has a bit of an aftertaste, but I have gotten used to it since I have a blood sugar problem and can't consume sugar. My advice is that unless you physically cannot handle sugar, a small amount of raw sugar is much better for you than all this artificial crap. Just be smart about the stevia bandwagon everyone is jumping on, because pretty much every brand out there is just some other sweetener mixed with stevia and then sold as 'healthy'.

review/summary: Tastes Pretty Good, Kids Love it, Moderate Nutritional Content
review/text: We bought this on a whim. My daughter wanted to try it out and was pulled in by the chocolate centers. It went quickly and we bought it again.<br /><br />I like it but I wouldn't consider it to be an every morning bowl of cereal. I much prefer a more hearty cereal with a little more substance.<br /><br />Krave makes for a fun snack and can take away that chocolatey craving. It's pretty dry and the chocolate inside is really some kind of a paste.<br /><br />I'd rate it moderate for nutritional content, pretty good for flavor. Not the best cereal by any means.

While I agree, it is less expensive than other name brand chocolate bars, there is not much of a creamy texture I expect in milk chocolate. I also think it is to sweet, at least for my taste.

review/text: First of all I love salt licorice so I am already going to like the product. I would say this is a more mild version so might appeal to more people. I brought this to work and out of the twenty or so coworkers who tried it, only one liked it and came back for more, everyone else spit it out right away and complained that it was too salty (even people who said they love black licorice). So if you are a fan of salt licorice I would recommend this product (you get a very large amount with one order and it will last you months!).

Acts like a puppy at feeding time. His general health has improved and we are happy with this product.

review/summary: 9 Grams of Fiber that tastes like a treat
review/text: I have had all three of the Fiber One Bars (oats & chocolate, oats & peanut butter, and oats & caramel).  I didn't really care for the oats & chocolate, but I like the oats & peanut butter a lot.  It tastes very good with a nice mellow peanut butter flavor.  Even my young boys (6 and 3) like it.  As good as oats & peanut butter is, though, the caramel is 10 times better.  It tastes like a candy bar. Obviously, it has a firm texture, but it's not dry by any stretch.  It makes a great breakfast or part of a breakfast that can stick with you for a few hours.  It can also serve as a very satisfying snack.  I will confess that, since my supply of these bars has been limited, I haven't had my kids try them yet.  But, now that I have been finally able to order these from Amazon, I will definitely let them try this new flavor.

review/summary: Inulin -- take it slowly!
review/text: Inulin, found in chicory root, is the key ingredient here; everything else in the bar is designed to make it possible for you to eat the inulin.  Search the web on inulin (not insulin!) -- it is being touted as a wonderful probiotic ingredient.  And there's no question that eating these bars will make the trains run on time, so to speak.<br /><br />The problem is that not everyone tolerates inulin well, and tolerance is at different doses.  Some people experience gas, cramps, frequent bowel movements with tarry stool, and other kinds of GI distress.  This is not because of the increase in fiber per se -- it is a reaction to the specific fiber here, inulin.<br /><br />The bars are very sweet but don't treat them like a snack until you know how your body reacts.  (I read with horror the account of one person who sat down with a box and polished off four or five in a sitting.) Take it very very slowly.  I can tolerate one (1) bite of a bar a day; more than that and I get in trouble, period.  At one bite a day, this case of bars is lasting me a long, long time.  On the other hand, I'm not worried about the calories in the bar at that rate either.<br /><br />If you don't finish a bar you need to keep it in a baggie or container because it will dry out and become substantially less appealing.  Taste is fine, but I wish I had gotten the chocolate so that I could get my choco fix on at the same time.

review/text: I've tried all the different flavors of bars that Fiber One offers and these are definitely my favorite. The caramel flavor is light and sweet and the fiber in these bars (a whopping 9g!) makes them a very filling snack or a quick meal on the go! I typically enjoy these in the afternoon to carry me through between lunch and dinner but have eaten them for breakfast on occasion as well and they keep me satisfied until lunch. Fiber is one of the hardest things for me to get enough of (25-35g is recommended daily) and these bars definitely help! Some people have reported digestive upset when eating these but I've never had a problem with them. I highly recommend this product!

review/text: If you are looking for a tasty snack, look no further.  These caramel Fiber One bars taste like a cross between a candy bar and a granola bar.  The consistency is chewy, but not so chewy that it gets stuck in your teeth.  Since each bar provides 35% of daily recommended fiber, it's relatively healthy as well.  For those individuals that are on Weight Watchers, these bars are 2 points each... and well worth it.  I highly recommend this snack.  I also recommend the peanut butter Fiber One bars, although they are not quite as tasty, in my opinion.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z40U2">Fiber One Bars Oats And Peanut Butter, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Personal favorite ...
review/text: This is my personal favorite flavor of these bars ... they're more of a butterscotchey than a carameley.  I eat one almost every day so I don't mind getting such a large quantity because they do get eaten.  Much cheaper to buy here with free shipping than a box a week in the store, that's for sure.

review/summary: Good Tasting Granola Bars
review/text: Most health bars taste awful.  Fiber One Granola Bars Oats & Caramel is not bad at all.  A little chewy, but it does not crumble when you bite it while other snack bars shatters to hundreds of pieces of crumbs.  This one you can enjoy even if you are in front of your computer keyboard.<br />Just a bit small for my satisfaction.

review/summary: Fiber all the way
review/text: Great way to get your daily fiber. I eat this every morning for breakfast along with my high fiber bread toast. Taste delicious too. The only problem I have is that it is way too sweet. Too much sugar. Otherwise excellent source of daily fiber.

review/text: These bars are very good for you with an awesome taste!! I love them, I try to eat one for breakfast every day and already have lost a little weight. I wouldn't recommend eating more than 1 per day because of the fiber, well you know!! But they are delicious!! Caramel is my fav along with choc!!

review/summary: nice taste
review/text: Granted, this isn't as tasty as a Milky Way candy bar, but for all its benefits, I could do without my daily candy bar and substitute this.  I microwaved one and put some vanilla ice cream on it and it was awesome.  They are also fine just out of the box.  "Eating oatmeal cookie dough" is one of the best ways to describe these.

review/text: These are easily the tastiest fiber you will ever consume.  The aftereffects are really, really memorable.  The number one ingredient is Chicory Root Extract, an ingredient that just may hold the clue to solving our natural gas shortage.  Wow!  I through a bunch of these out in a day long meeting and everyone enjoyed them.  About two hours later it became flat-out humorous.  We couldn't quit erupting.  We had to finish the budget that day so we all sat around, stewing in our natural aroma, wondering what had happened.  Do a Google search on Fiber One F***ts and you will be amazed.  I love to eat these but not when I have to be in public later.

review/summary: High fiber isn't necessarily a good thing!
review/text: I recently cut fiber one bars out of my diet after I noticed that I get all the fiber I need in a day just by eating whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables and nuts. If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a "healthy" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision. (And so are my friends!)
