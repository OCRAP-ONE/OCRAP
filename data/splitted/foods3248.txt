review/text: I picked up these Crunchmaster Rice (Artisan Four Cheese) Crackers at a nearby Costco Store. They looked good, and a lady gave me one to taste. They were good. Into the cart went a six package box. They're the same as these, only packed together in a slightly different way.<br /><br />The crackers are excellent. They're real crunchy, way moreso than most crackers and they have the faint taste and smell of cheese. They're lightly salted and have a very low fat content. I enjoy them by themselves as snacks, or I eat them with smoked oysters or sardines as a light lunch. Or, I have them with a variety of spreads. They're pretty versatile, and delicious I should add.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Everyone who comes to my house LOVES these crackers.  For rice crackers they have a lot of flavor.  I love that they are also low fat so I don't feel guilty while indulging.  I do not have to eat gluten free but I still buy them for the taste.  I bought them at Costco but otherwise they are hard to find.  The sesame ones are good too but not as good.

review/text: I love the flavor of this cereal and it is a good source of fiber also.<br />Since I have had to change my diet to gluten free foods it has been a challenge to absorb the extra expense. I was buying this cereal at the local natural market and was paying $8.15 per bag plus tax. I am now purchasing this cereal in bulk on a delivery schedule and am saving  a lot of money. I usually eat this cereal once or twice daily and always enjoy the taste.

review/summary: Reformulated to remove all taste
review/text: Prior to 2012, this was my favorite cereal. Tasty, healthy and gluten-free. Sometime in 2012, they reformulated the flakes such that they are now totally tasteless and lack any texture. They are thin and become almost instant mush in liquid. There is no longer any solid 'crunch' or interest. You might as well be eating cheap corn flakes. Save your money until they return to the old recipe.

review/text: I used to buy this cereal for my husband, who has celiac. He tells me that it's been reformulated and now the flavor isn't quite as good as it was and it gets soggy in milk quickly. Sadly, I'm switching to something else. For someone who must be gluten free, this is still a good option, but I'm not sure that the change in the product makes it worth the price anymore.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IMO">Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

If you like cereal and haven't tried this, you're in for a treat.<br /><br />It is especially good as a replacement for cornflakes: more substance, *much* less sweet, and doesn't stick to the teeth.

review/summary: Favorite cereal of all, wheat and no-wheat
review/text: This cereal is wonderful!  It has almost everything I like in a cereal, including 1)  it is delicious, 2) it fills me up (not a lot of puffy air), 3)  I feel good after I eat it, 4) it's organic, and 5) it doesn't have wheat or gluten.  Buying it via Amazon, it is also affordable (about $3.65/pound, compared to $4.69/10-oz box at the nearest health food store (90 miles away), which is about $7.50/pound).  The ONLY thing I don't like about it is that it MAY contain peanut, and my wheat-allergic daughter is also deathly allergic to peanut.  So, she can't eat it.  I can and I do.  She's jealous, because she started eating it and ate a couple of bites before she read where it might contain peanut, and she (picky, picky, picky eater) loved it.  Please Please Please would someone at Nature's Path figure out how to eliminate the peanut?  Anyway, if you're not allergic to peanut, try it.  I definitely  prefer this to any other cold cereal I have ever tried, period.

review/summary: Excellent option for people with Celiac Disease
review/text: When I was first diagnosed with Celiac Disease (Gluten Intolerance), I was surprised at how many cereals contained food additives or other items that I couldn't eat.  Even if I ignored the cereals that were made directly from wheat / barley / oats / rye (the 4 things I cannot eat), there were still many other cereals based on soy, rice or corn (maize) that had barley malt in as a flavoring, so I couldn't eat them.  I tried many cereals until I found this one and I have had this as my mainstay ever since. It is tasty, has an excellent texture and I am sure anyone would like it. You wouldn't need to be on a special diet to enjoy this as a breakfast dish.

It has a thick, crisp texture with a slightly sweet, nutty flavor. It also makes a wonderful, crispy GFCF breading for chicken nuggets - just coat nuggets with some melted GFCF margerine, dip into crushed flakes and bake for 20 minutes at 425 F. YUM...ENJOY!!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E48IMO">Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal, 26.4-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>I have been eating this cereal every morning for many years. My last shipment was different in several ways.  The flakes were thicker, tough and stuck in my teeth, and there was a gritty feel which gave me kind of a sore tongue.  I contacted the cereal company online and they promised to make it right.  Said the cereal had not changed its formula but during the period in question, there was a glitch and the flakes were rolled thinner.  Didn't seem that to me, just the opposite, plus the taste was altered for the worse.  They have sent me coupons to buy Nature's Path products, but no one around my small town carries it.  I will use them, however, when I get to a larger city, 50 miles away.  I then ordered the same cereal "with raisins" described as plump and juicy raisins, from a different on-line distributor.  It's the same, except the raisins are like little hard rocks. We ground the first shipment up for the birds, but they won't eat it either.

review/summary: Great Taste and Good Source of Fiber
review/text: This is my favorite cereal. It's low sugar, low salt, high fiber, great taste, organic and has flax and omega-3. It's a very tasty cereal unless you like the super sugary kind. Make sure that when you get the box, you look on the outside of the shipping box to find the expiration date because the bags are not marked. The expiration on mine was about 6 months after the date purchase. Note that there are about 25 servings and 6 bags, so that's 150 bowls of cereal to eat in 180 days! That's a lot of cereal. You better have someone willing to eat it with you. If you don't think you can eat that much then try the 10 oz packages of Mesa Sunrise. I took the advice of another commenter and put half of it in the freezer to help keep it fresh. I'm on my second bag but slowing down. I change it up by adding fruit, like banana, strawberries or blueberries. I tried carob powder but should have mixed it in my rice milk first before pouring it on the cereal. Raisins or dried cherries would go good with it, too. This cereal holds up pretty well in milk.

review/summary: Great cereal but does have a strange smell
review/text: I love this cereal and was so excited to find it at Warehouse clearout pricing, likely because the expiry date is a month away.<br /><br />The cereal does have a strange smell to it - sort of chemical-like. I have a very good sense of smell, so I really notice it.<br />However, it tastes fine. And the smell sort of dissipates if you leave the bag open for a little while before eating it.<br /><br />I purchased 18 bags of the stuff, so I am happy that it had no bad taste.<br />I threw them in all in the freezer as there is no way I am going to eat all 18 bags in one month, but I had read a review that the expiry date might be soon, so I was prepared for that.<br /><br />I think they did change their receipe, but I didn't really notice as I didn't buy it much prior to recently. It does get mushy in milk, but what cereal doesn't.<br />Much more filling than Chex.<br /><br />I am happy with the purchase - much better than $8-$10 per bag that I have been paying at the grocery store here in Ontario.

review/summary: Versatile, healthy GF cereal
review/text: I used to buy Mesa Sunrise mainly to use for baking and cooking (it's fabulous crumbled as a coating for homemade chicken fingers). As my daughter has gotten older, she has started to like less sweet, more natural food (love it!) Mesa Sunrise has become one of her favorite cereals to eat for breakfast or even just to snack on plain. I love that it's not loaded with sugar, is gluten-free and is a good source of fiber.

review/text: I keep this cereal on hand all the time.  I like the taste.  It is low fat, low sodium and has 3 grams of fiber per 3/4 cup serving.  I open the bag and transfer it into a tupperware cereal container.  I also take the cereal with me when I travel.  When my family eats from the motel breakfast, I can eat this.  Amazon has a good price.  I order it on the subscribe and save program

review/text: This is a tasty cereal.  My husband must have gluten free products and has been eating this for 5+ years.  I have been driving all over town to find it.  Sometimes the health food store has it; sometimes a local grocery has it; sometimes no one has it.  I am saving time and money by getting it from Amazon.  It keeps well in the pantry so having 6 bags at once is okay and convenient.

review/summary: Gluten Free and Tastes Great!
review/text: This cereal tastes great! It's light, crunchy and mildly sweet. You don't get any weird after tastes that other gluten free products tend to have. It tastes like real cereal and not a fake gluten free version of cereal... if you know what I mean. It stays crunchy in all milk varieties (dairy and non-dairy). I just love it!!! I even pack in little containers and take to work to eat dry as a snack. The cereal comes in environmental friendly bags. You get 6 bags per shipment. I pour a bag into a large air tight pasta jar for easy dispensing and I put the empty bangs in the recycle bin. You really can't beat the convenience and price of Amazon's Subscribe and Save. I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I love this cereal.  It is the only gluten free cereal that I have found that tastes good and is worth the price.  It doesn't get soggy too fast in milk and doesn't need any added sugar; a big plus. It also uses whole grains.  I order it by the case so I won't run out of it. Getting it by the case on automatic shipment also helps save a little on the cost.

review/text: I love this cereal! I'm gluten intolerant and it is hard to find a cereal that is multi-grain and gluten free. Most GF cereals are just a single grain and this one is not that is why it is so good. It stays crisp for quite a while in milk and is slightly sweet which helps and doesn't have a million calories per serving. I have this on my list to send to me every 2 months. This is a keeper! Another benefit is that it is organic and I liked that.

review/summary: Organic Mesa Sunrise is awesome!
review/text: We love this cereal, both parents, child and toddler!  Unlike many other Gluten Free cereals, it contains a bit more fiber; which if you are Celiac you understand why I mention that!  The fiber content is not overly high, so I would gather that it has more to do with the flax.  It is a good crispy cereal with a fairly mild flavor, which is slightly sweet.  The one peculiar thing is that even though it tastes great, the smell is not as pleasant as the taste.  This is also likely because of the flax.  And if it gets past the expiration date, you will know it... nasty odor!  That said, it is probably the best organic, gluten free cereal we have found that has more nutritional value.  Unfortunately many GF cereals seem to lack nutritional content.  Buying it by the case from Amazon, using Subscribe and Save is hands down the best deal I have found.  Hopefully someday Nature's Path will make the Vanilla and Maple flavored Mesa Sunrises in the economy size too.

review/summary: I adore this cereal!
review/text: I started eating Nature's Path a few years ago when I was really busy getting my education degree. I have a gluten allergy, and my mom had this cereal in her cupboard, so I grabbed a couple of handfuls in a ziplock bag and went to school. It was delicious! I sometimes crush up Mrs. May's nuts and add them to my cereal for some extra crunch/flavour/protein. Sweet, but yummy!<br /><br />Later, I contacted the company and they told me they not only wash the lines between runs of gluten-full and gluten free cereal, but they also throw out the first two batches of gluten free cereal to minimize cross contamination! I am super sensitive, and I have never had a problem with Nature's Path.

Of course, the inevitable rough handling caused enough of the perforations to come apart that the leading bag of cereal by the opening got punctured in several places.<br /><br />This is a delicious cereal! Previous shipment had the product box inside an Amazon box; the contents arrived intact.  I'll reorder & hope that procedure is replicated.

review/summary: GREAT cereal - just happens to also be gluten free
review/text: As I said in the title, this is great cereal that also just happens to be gluten free.  It's not a "kids" cereal, and has a distinct taste that is somewhat unlike any other (so it's hard to describe).  I purchase it by the case (six) of the large bags (26.4 oz./bag), and eat it often.  I don't know what else to say beyond that - great cereal, very good pricing even when compared to much poorer quality "supermarket" cereals.  Nature's Path makes a number of really quality cereals, and this is one of my favorites.  I give 5 stars only with truly superior products - and this one is a no-brainer.<br /><br />I can imagine there will be some who will not like the taste all that much (especially those used to sugared cereals), so perhaps buying one smaller box at the grocery store would make sense to "sample" it (if they even carry it - try a health food store or the "natural" section of your regular supermarket if they have one).

review/summary: Best gluten-free cereal I've ever tasted!
review/text: It's difficult to get enough cereals in a gluten-free diet.  Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal is the answer to that problem.  I first discovered it in the special foods section of a local supermarket, but it's so popular they can't always keep it stocked.  It's made from flax, amaranth and corn.  It contains heart-healthy Omega 3.  It provides fiber.  It keeps well.  It tastes so great I have no desire to mask it's excellent natural flavor with added sugar.  Mesa Sunrise is my favorite cereal.  I like it so well I order it from Amazon in bulk.  Do try it.  If you like cold cereals, you'll love Mesa Sunrise.

The only problem is you have to purchase it when Amazon carries it and not a 3rd party supplier otherwise the cost is not a savings as compared to the grocery store where I originally bought it.  If you want it no matter what, then the cost is irrelevant but I went to Amazon initially b/c the cereal is pricey to start with.  I love this cereal and I eat it in the middle of the day if I need a crunchy taste.

review/text: O.k., disclaimer:  in addition to being gluten intolerant, I'm actually something of a food snob.<br /><br />What's great about this:<br /><br />Good texture--it's like raisin bran, which is fantastic if you have adult-onset celiac and still crave raisin bran<br /><br />Holds up well in milk.  It didn't get soggy fast.<br /><br />It's really gluten-free! No stomachache, etc.<br /><br />What's not so great:<br /><br />This tastes, I swear, like squash.  Even doused in really sweet almond milk and raisins, I couldn't choke down more than a few spoonfuls.  The taste, if you are a medium-to-supertaster, is beyond disgusting.<br /><br />This would probably be good for not-so-picky-gluten-free-eaters, but it's a bad idea for picky kids, so don't spend the extra to buy it in bulk, until your picky eaters have tasted it, first.<br /><br />More gluten-free food for my local food bank.

review/text: The price of this product (and many others) via Amazon is excellent compared to the "Whole Paycheck" types of "healthy" supermarkets. I'm totally pleased with this cereal. It tastes great, but surely the sugar content boosts its taste appeal. Organic or not, sugar is sugar, and many have been advised to keep their distance from it. Nature's Path should consider using alternate sweeteners, such as, organic of course, brown rice syrup or raw blue agave syrup. The macrobiologists would be jazzed!

The price of salmon has gone up so dramatically over the past few years that it's hard to say whether it is a bargain or not but I think it's OK.<br />This is not gourmet quality but it is very nice lunch or salad quality.<br />Here's my favorite lunch:<br />One half cup cooked jasmine rice - put in the middle of the plate.<br />One half can drained red salmon, one half sliced cucumber, one sliced roma tomato, 1/4 avocado (sliced)<br />all this arranged around the rice.  Put a sprig of basil or cilantro on the plate, drizzle a little of olive oil over, and serve with a wedge of lime.<br />Follow up with a cup of quick steeped jasmine tea.<br />Note that one can makes enough for two lunches - for ladies.  My husband thinks this is utter nonsense.<br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Truly delicious but pricey
review/text: This is the first canned red salmon I've tried and I was really pleased with the texture, flavor and taste - and the price.  A friend bought one of the cans from me to try and she raved about how delicious it is.  Since I really do not enjoy the smell of fish I much prefer this smaller size can which is ideal for one meal for my husband and me, leaving no left overs to "perfume" our refrigerator.<br /><br />Red salmon is considerably higher in Omega 3's than pink salmon. This fish is so good that I've only used it for salmon salad so far.  Perhaps I will make salmon patties out of it in the future even though I hate to add egg and crumbs to hide the delicious flavor!<br /><br />Additional comment - April 2012: I have never been disappointed with a Roland brand product but in the past couple of months the price of this salmon went much higher and have now switched to Pillar Rock brand which is equally as delicious and seems to have less fish odor even though it has skin and bones (more healthful) which the Roland brand does not have.<br /><br />If the Roland brand goes on sale at a really good price in the future I would order more of it.

review/text: I purchased several cans of salmon in anticipation of wonderful salmon. Instead, after 1 can was opened, a visual inspection revealed vertebrae with lots of little bones. A small bite revealed a good taste of salmon, however the whole can was disposed of as it was deemed not safe to eat, due to the bones.

review/summary: AN INGREDIENT FOR A GREAT SANDWICH
review/text: This canned red salmon is the main ingredient of a great salad for sandwiches.  I have an aversive reaction to the skin, and the liquid is a bit much for including in a salad, but removing the skin and draining the liquid makes for a wonderful addition to Jessie's otherwise somewhat bland flavored dog food, and she loves it too.  So I can munch a tasty sandwich and Jessie can get more enjoyment from her breakfast--we all win with this product.

review/summary: Good Chili powder, good price
review/text: This is the same chili powder you get at the local market, but at a MUCH lower price per ounce by buying it through Amazon and in bulk. We've used it for years to make great chili. As I was making chili Friday night to have ready for football games this weekend, my wife tasted it and complimented my seasoning. I had to admit to her that the only secret in seasoning chili is to put enough chili powder in it so that it tastes like chili. LOL That's not completely true, a lot of other things add to the taste, but that is indeed the #1 requirement.<br /><br />I'll just use this large container to refill my smaller "shaker spice bottle" when its empty. We should have our chili powder requirements met for the next few years now.

I recommend letting it steep a bit longer than you think it would require. I enjoy mine with brown sugar and cream. Dessert in a cup...and oh so decadent!

review/summary: Everything you wanted to know, but . . . ?
review/text: I decided this product needed a dissenting opinion among it's unanimous six five-star ratings:) My favorite tea - and along a similar line of tea taste - is TAZO Well-Being Focus (black tea, roasted yerba mate, orange essence, and cocoa peel); to me, this Republic tea's taste didn't quite sit at the same five-star level. I have an embarrassing number of teas in my pantry due to years of searching for a tea that I love as much as great coffee - since coffee doesn't always agree with my stomach and skin. I love the flavor of coconut, chocolate, dates, and malt barley . . . which is how the label describes this tea. I added brown sugar and milk - and would rate the taste, at most, a 4.5. But this Republic of Tea tasted WAY WAY better than Zhena's coconut chai black tea (canister) or Celestial's decaf coconut chai (I didn't care for the latter two). At regular retail price, TAZO Focus is less expensive, too - so Republic of Tea's final rating tipped downward to four stars. (2012 February Tip: our local WF has this Republic of Tea on sale for $7.99, down from $10.99.) You might want to know that the label also indicates "low in caffeine", not caffeine-free, which must be due to the small amount of cocoa powder. There is also chicory in this tea, which now I know makes me very bloated (with increasing gas pains as I write, but I'll try to resist dropping this tea to three stars); I just did a medical search on chicory, and some of the people who need to be cautioned about chicory ingestion are those who are: 1) pregnant/nursing, 2) taking beta-blocker drugs or other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450, 3) have allergies/rashes/asthma, or 4) at risk for gallstones. (fyi re: TAZO Focus - can be hard to find on local store shelves. I order in MAJOR bulk, online. Of course, I just now searched reliable sites and see that large amounts of yerba mate may increase my risk of cancer . . . ahhh, c'est la vie:))

review/text: I do low carb.  Seriously low carb, so dessert is a no-no.  I also adore coconut and chocolate, but those are also no-nos.  I found this at World Market when I went to get some Zhena's Coconut Chai (which runs not too far behind) and even at 10.99, decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I opened the can is that it smelled like a Mounds bar!  It has a more complex flavor because of the dates and Barley and because you're not just tasting a sugared-up product, but it truly makes me not miss dessert so much.<br /><br />I do a few drops of liquid Splenda (the packets actually have .5g of carbs because of the maltodextrin) and sometimes the tiniest shot of cream, and it's dessert in a cup!<br /><br />I wish I could find it a bit cheaper, but on the upside, it's 36 bags and not 18 or 22 like most packages have.  I do figure my satisfaction and the fact that it kills the urge to carb up are well worth it.  Will definitely buy again!

review/summary: No lie, this tea is very good.
review/text: Embarassing to say, but I had this tea sitting in my pantry for a year.  I did have one cup of it back then, but it tasted OKAY, at best.  I steeped the bag in hot water and let the flavors alone dictate my rating of this tea.  That's how I always drink my tea - just hot water and the tea on its own.  I had someone tell me that I should try some good creamer (half-and-half) with this Coconut Cocoa tea, then add some sugar (real pure cane, not processed American brand junk).  The result?  WOW!!!  Talk about delicious! No joke, this tea came alive.  The creamer and pure cane sugar totally enhanced the coconut flavor of this tea.  I had two cups and made some for the kids and they really liked it as well.<br /><br />Yes, this tea is very delicious.  I read something in the ratings about this tea not being thick enough.  Well, no, its not a thick tea.  Its the regular consistency that you would see in any other hot, flavored tea. I see that there are eight cannisters available from the vendor as of right now.  Sorry folks, but I am gonna order all eight of them right now.  Yes, this tea is that good!<br /><br />UPDATE: Found better pricing for this item at the Republic of Tea website.  Vendor on amazon charges higher price and tacks on a high shipping and handling fee.

review/summary: More like dishwater than tea
review/text: This is such a weak tasting tea, that it is barely better than drinking hot water.  Even using two tea bags per cup, it is deficient.  Considering the very high cost (I paid around $11 for the tin) it's ridiculously expensive, particularly when using two bags per cup.  I complained to customer service, and they told me herb teas are supposed to be weak, and I should doctor it up with sugar and milk.  Then offered, if I shipped it back, to replace it with a different one.  Are they kidding....I have to ship it back in order for them to replace the $11 tin?  I think the real problem is, when you look at the tea bag, there is barely anything in it....looks like not even half a teaspoon of "tea".  I guess putting adequate tea in the bag might have dipped into their profit margin.  I'd skip this one and go for another brand.

review/summary: Crazy Jerky
review/text: Ok, to preface this, I AM A VEGETARIAN. With that being said, I haven't had REAL beef or turkey jerky in quite some time and I have been missing it dearly. Having tried many vegetarian jerkies I can honestly say that this is by far the best! Most soy based jerkies are strangely on the oily side and the flavors are usually off. Being a "dry style" jerky fan I am pleased with the chewiness of Stonewall's and the WILD flavor. I have tried most of the other varieties of Stonewall's but none seemed to please me as much as the WILD. I'm also on Weight Watchers and have found that they are fairly low on points (4pts per bag) and are a great source of protein for vegetarians (14g). Be warned, the WILD is quite WILD, spicy spicy but in a good way!

review/text: The Hot Pastrami flavor is divine!  I like spicy things and just ordered another shipment of these because I went through them faster than I had anticipated.  They are moist and chewy, but not so chewy that you're still chewing to make it swallowable after all the flavor's gone.  I think they struck a nice balance.<br /><br />A caveat: If you're used to Tofurky Jurky or Primal Spirit, these will strike you as a little bit airy.  Also, these are a bit higher in fat than the other brands: 8 or 9 grams per 160-calorie package.  These ones don't really feel too oily in your mouth, though.

This is your best bet since I read reviews on here of receiving them stale off amazon.<br />The best flavors are the original mild, bbq beef and the teriyaki beef. I HATE the Cajun varieties, they are so dry and tough to chew.<br />They are high in fat so I usually have to make my husband hide them from me since these are a rare treat for us in the house, I could eat 4-5 bags in a row!<br />Caution if you eat too many bags over a period of a few days, you may experience gas!<br />Try ordering direct and you'll be enjoying the BEST veggie jerquee there is in the US!!!!<br />PS These are made in Louisiana, could you ask for anything more authentic besides the real thing (meaning meat)

Stonewall's original and stonewall's original mild are some of the best tasting jerkey you'll find. What's best, is that this product is meat free. So for all you vegans out there this is especially a great treat idea. The package here is a store display container.  I keep them in the closet and when we remember we have them, it makes a perfect snack.  I think we'll be working on the box for about 2 month and that's with two jerkey freaks eating them.

review/summary: Airy and oily.
review/text: The texture on these things is all off.  For one, they're incredibly airy.  I am a huge fan of Primal Spirit and Tofurky Jurky, and had been used to denser vegan jerky when I first tried these.  It felt like I was chewing air.  Also, because these are higher in fat (8-9 grams per 160 calorie package), they are a bit oilier.  Coupled with the airiness, when you bite down on these, you can feel the oil oozing out of the little nuggets into your mouth, which isn't too pleasant.<br /><br />I don't think the flavor is anything special, either.  To be fair, I'm not sure what chicken tastes like or is supposed to taste like, but there are plenty of wonderfully flavorful vegan and vegetarian products out there.  This is not one of them.

review/text: An ethical workout for the jaw.  It tastes a little sweet, but teriyaki is supposed to.  Of course even considering a "vegan jerky" is to knowingly enter a state of sin.  This is a long-shelf-life processed snack food, not carrots and celery pulled fresh from the organic garden, but hey, no refrigeration required.

review/text: I didn't like these at all.  They're too hard and chewy with a weird texture.  I wouldn't recommend this product.

review/summary: Not perfect, but pretty good
review/text: I've tried two flavors - Pepperoni and Original Wild - and have enjoyed them both.  The texture's pretty good - nice and chewy.  The moisture level is okay, but it could be improved by being just a tiny bit more moist. There's also a little bit of an aftertaste (which I didn't find to be unpleasant, but some might).  The spice level on the Pepperoni and Original Wild flavors were perfect. The Original Wild was medium hot, so it might be a little too much for some.  I loved it though.  I recommend that people try to buy this locally before spending a lot of money on it.  I bought mine from a local vegan store online, then discovered that a large grocery chain carries it in their health food section.
