review/summary: Great Gluten-Free Option!
review/text: I'm so happy to find a gluten-free on-the-go option for lunch. Just the other day I was thinking, I wish they made gluten-free lunchables.  I'm sorry that the other people have more unusual allergies that they would like items for, but this is a great start for many people.  It's great to see the calories labeled on each box.  I had the hummus box today and it was great...everything was fresh and tasty.  I plan to order more.  I do wish they were a little bit cheaper since it does get very expensive to eat gluten-free but those of us who have the intolerance don't have it by choice while those who are vegan or vegetarian choose to be so.

review/summary: Meals were hit or miss
review/text: I bought these soon after trying a gluten free diet. I should note I'm really not picky, I will eat almost anything. That said, some of these meals were pretty decent, and others I had a hard time finishing.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the GF crackers. Only complaint is that one bag in one kit would have 20 crackers, and the next would have 8. (I also bought a 6 pack of just the pepperoni/cheese/crackers kits, so it wasn't a fluke... there was a wide variety in the number of crackers a single bag contained.)<br /><br />My least favorites were the salmon and tuna. I usually love both, and these were really hard to force down.<br /><br />As always with food, your mileage may vary. I personally have moved onto other snacks and foods, so I won't be buying these again.

review/summary: Nice variety
review/text: I like the variety in the gluten free pack. The packs are great. I take them to work for a quick lunch when I don't have time to prepare ahead of time. They taste great and are healthier than buying fast food. The only issue I have is with the turkey pepperoni meal which is way too salty. I don't have issues with high blood pressure or anything like that, but I find that almost 900 mg of sodium for this meal is a bit much. I order go picnic meals at least 8 times a year either straight from Go Picnic website or from Amazon because they are very convenient and generally healthy. I also recommend them for people with small children, because it's the perfect size for them. People ask me all the time at work where I get these meals from and I tell them.

review/text: Thank yo Go Picnic for trying to meet the needs of food allergic kids and adults.  I would like to see more dairy free options though.  I wouldn't recommend the salmon as too many kids with food allergies also have issues with fish like salmon.  Although my son can tolerate tuna, he cannot have the tuna meal due to a dairy allergy.  I'd love to help GoPicnic create more allergy friendly options.

review/text: We've been enjoying this seasoning on our steaks for some time, but this packaging is an great improvement. We first started buying it at a wholesale club where it was sold in a plastic grinder. The grinder was a pain in the wrist to use. I'm so glad that Weber now sells it pre-ground in a shake-on container. Plus, the grill-lid shaped cap is a cute touch. I definitely recommend this seasoning as it's just the right combination of flavors for a charcoal-grilled steak. I'd even use it on chicken or pork, as well.

review/summary: The Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado. The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags. The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored. Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas. He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us. We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room. The smell of peppermint was overpowering. It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint. What a rush! The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry. For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea. Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder. The events of that day have changed my life forever. Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet. I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer. On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour. Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

It smells and tastes incredible, and is our favorite oil for stir-frys.  Don't expect to get skinny cooking with it... but if you want some great scent & flavor, this delivers.

review/summary: Ultimate dog treat
review/text: So these treats smell gross, but I've been able to win over shy and even semi feral foster dogs with these treats. All of the dogs LOVE this salmon! I use it as a treat whenever the dogs go into their crates and they will go sit in the crate staring at the salmon in hopes they might get some extra pieces. It's been wonderful to get foster dogs comfortable with crating because it is so high value, but it is not small enough to use for training. We divide each stick into 3-4 pieces and it lasts a while. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to spoil their pups!

review/summary: Good training aid
review/text: Breaking or cutting these jerky-like sticks into bite-size pieces allows the trainer to store them in a pocket to use them as rewards for learning a behavior.  They don't stain your pocket and almost all the dogs I work with enjoy them.  One tiny negative is the attempt to sell these treats as brain nourishing.  It was proven years ago that ginko blob had zero effect on the brains of mammals.<br /><br />I do, however, appreciate the fact that the treats are made in the USA as too many treats are made in China; and after the debacle with melamine killing our pets I buy nothing for any of my dogs that is not made here.

review/summary: These treats are great for training even the most wayward dog
review/text: I have an english bulldog. Training my bully outside to not approach every dog without first being calm was often a challenge. I had tried to utilize numerous treats before with limited sucess at getting her to focus on my command. Plato's thinkers are not only made of great quality ingredients, but the smell and taste is something that most dogs find hard to resist. If you are looking for a great training treat I recommend these highly. Just break them up into small pieces either with a knife or by hand.<br /><br />These treats have not only worked with her, but with her fellow friends. I constantly refer folks to get this type of treat, when they are looking for a good training treat. And all my friends who have purchased this for their dogs are happy with their purchase.<br /><br />The larger 24 oz jar is the best because they last longer and the lid prevents them from air exposure which otherwise makese these treats hard.

Plus, the ingredients are simple and clean--these things don't seem like they've been heavily processed.<br /><br />With all the bad press about dog treats and dogs becoming ill, I'm really careful what I give my dogs as treats and these treats are worth the extra money. I mix them in with their other natural treat, carrots, but they definitely like these better.<br /><br />The only bad thing is be forewarned--these things really smell. Must be why the dogs go crazy when the box arrives, with their keen noses they can probably smell them through the box.

review/text: Esther loved them, but they're way too big for all but the largest of dogs.  Breaking these at any point in the stick will lead to a mess.  It's like a pepperoni skin on the outside, but like dried fish pulp on the inside.  So, cutting or breaking will lead to dried fish powder in one hand and the outside of the treat in the other.  Again, Esther loved them, but it's a one size serving - period.

review/summary: My dog loves these, and they used to be great but...
review/text: My dog loves these, and they used to be great but the last batch we got were limp and stale. When I try to break them, they bend instead of snap like they usually do. And when finally after a lot of fighting, I could get it to break (really more by having to rip them), the result was a big crumbly mess. Usually I would go through a jar of these rather quickly. Needless to say, this last jar I bought has been sitting here for a few months, because it's such a pain in the butt to deal with. He still loves them, but I don't feel like having to clean up a mess every time he has some, and I also don't like the thought of giving my dog something that's not fresh. Makes me skeptical to purchase again, because they aren't cheap and Amazon does not let you return food items. So now, instead I just stick to the Plato Chicken Strip Cookies that come in the bag. He loves those too. They are highly palatable, and I love the fact that plato's treats have very few, clean simple ingredients since my dog has had allergy issues in the past. The sticks were just a nice change from the regular old crunchy cookie that most snacks are (the shape and texture and all) but oh well, too bad!

review/text: I just ordered this product and from what I can tell, its not organic chicken. It doesn't say organic on the packaging or in the ingredients list.<br /><br />NOT ORGANIC: The reason I purchased this product is because I thought it would be organic. It is important to me to feed my dogs foods that aren't pumped with hormones and preservatives. Additionally, I choose organic as a animal lover in the hopes that animals raised to be organic are typically given a better quality of life.<br /><br />GARLIC IS AN INGREDIENT: Look at any "Toxic to Dogs" food list, and you find garlic on that list. The toxic level for a dog is large; however I have no idea how much garlic is in these treats. I was looking for something that I could feed my dogs on a regular basis as a training reward...and I can't do that in good conscience not knowing the long term effects of regulary ingestion of the garlic in these treats.<br /><br />Only good note is that my dogs do love these treats, but they also love all kinds of other treats that I as their human care taker know better than to give them.

review/summary: Not designed as a training treat
review/text: I just received my order of Plato's Thinkers Salmon Sticks Dog Treats in the mail and immediately tried them out on my dog. Unfortunately the product is not what I expected. I train my Labrador in competitive obedience and agility and need a treat that can be given to the dog in small pieces to keep her interested and alert in repetitive training exercises. However, the Plato's Thinkers Salmon Sticks Dog Treats are not really designed as a training treat. The sticks cannot be broken or cut into smaller pieces without crumbling apart. The sticks have an outer smooth skin that holds the inner salmon ingredients together but it falls apart when cut or broken and the inner ingredients crumble out. I bought these thinking they would be like the salmon strips product that a fellow trainer shared with me at our last dog agility class which could be broken into small pieces. Unfortunately the salmon sticks are not the same product as the salmon strips.<br /><br />The ingredients may be great and my Lab does like the product, but the sticks are not for serious dog trainers. Get the strips instead if you want to be able to break the treats into smaller pieces - a real necessity for repetitive exercise dog training.

review/summary: If You Need To Splurge, Do It With This!
review/text: This is my second time purchasing this product.  It arrives in a styrofoam lined box, swathed with ice packs, which I save for later use, wrapped in plastic in a tin that couldn't leak if it wanted to.  The lid is a bit difficult to get off, but that shows you the delicate eggs are protected.  You know when your Jello wants to stick in the mold, so you stick a table knife between the Jello and the mold to let air in, then the Jello mold pops right out?  Well, do this with this tin.  I stick a knife or fork up under the top of the tin in three or four place to let air in, then the lid comes off without too much trouble.  I will purchase this again in the future.  Simply awesome.

review/summary: I'm Addicted to Twiglets
review/text: Unlike a lot of other British staples, Twiglets are pretty hard to find in grocery stores in my area, so I'm very glad to see they're available on Amazon. They're the perfect salty, savory, flavor-filled snack and there's nothing quite like them. If you've never tried a Twiglet but happen to know what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0ZC7G">Marmite</a> tastes like, well: Twiglets are basically crunchy little whole-wheat sticks that are coated in something that tastes very much like Marmite, although they're not actually Marmite-branded and aren't made by the same company. If you know anything about Marmite, you will know that opinions on the stuff are very polarized - you either love it or hate it, and the same goes for Twiglets. You will either think these are to die for, or your taste buds will recoil in horror at the flavor. If the idea of a tangy, salty, crunchy, savory snack appeals to you, I would highly recommend giving these a try for something a bit different.

When I tasted the kraut on the hot dog, I knew I'd found a good one. I asked the owner what kind of kraut they put on their dogs, and he told me it was Silver Floss: I knew I had to have more of it. I'll never be without it again! It's definitely the world's best sauerkraut.

review/text: Having tried most of the commercially available BBQ sauces out there, this brand gets really high marks from me.  It is Kind of spicy, definitely tangy, and sweet all at the same time. It has a thicker consistency and really sticks to pork or chicken. I even like using it as a dip.  A tablespoon or two mixed with ranch dressing creates a spicy salad dressing that works well on salads. This really kicks it up  when eating BBQ.

review/summary: Great packaging of this popular and tasty sweetening agent.
review/text: We have tried many sweeteners and find that Aspartame tastes the most appealing to our palates.  In fact, we find it to have more of the basic taste of sugar than natural sugar has. I am not being oxymoronically facetious but, rather, referring the lack of the slightly bitter and sour undertones in natural sugar - as well as less of the many divergent and distracting flavours that raw sugar contains.  We don't want flavour in our sweetener when it is purpose is as a neutral elevator of sweetness.<br /><br />As you may know, Aspartame is delivered to the market as Equal, NutraSweet, Canderel and under its generic name of Aspartame to the food industry (e.g., as used in Diet Pepsi).  We feel its inclusion in diet drinks, particularly, seems rather natural.  We also tried Splenda since it was purported to be usable at baking temeratures but found it to taste very unnatural, even distasteful. We need to do more research but our 1st impressions of the so-called modern-ancient alternatives like Truia, Stevia, et al, may be hindered by their emulating natural cane sugar too well and, as such, inheriting its negative attributes.<br /><br />We find the packaging of Equal in the 4 ounce "spoonful size" bottles is simply great.  You leave it on the counter and take as much as we need as we need it: quart, half, flat, heaping teaspoons or any other amount as needed.  We find all other forms, like bags or pills, an insult to our intelligence.  We are not Lemmings who only do as directed.  We use the specific amount of sweetener to set the sweetness of the food to the specific level that we desire on a case-by-case basis. E.g., a strong coffee will require more, a week coffee, less, and Dunkin Donuts caffeinated water the least.<br /><br />When I make my wife's coffee in the AM, I add a little, sip-test the taste, add a tad more, until it is just right.  Equal in the spoonful bottle allows me to do just that.  Using the bag format is ridiculous.  When my daughter bought some, we ended up with partially filled bags on the counter.  You literally waste 20%-30% of your product that way and are thus hurting Gaia.<br /><br />We never did like the fouler tasting and toxic alternatives like Cyclamates (now banned) and the carcinogen, Saccharin (still available).  There are various anecdotal reports of potential health issues with Aspartame but nothing conclusive after a great number of studies in the last decade around the world.  When it is shown to be more harmful than the toxic aspects of natural sugar, we'll be the first to stop its use.  We refer to natural sugar's diabetic, cardiac, migraine, immune system, CFIDS, and countless other related issues.  And, yes, also not conclusively proven.  We just know from persnal experience.  Yes, Martha, everything has issues, including you.<br /><br />Our only negative sentiment is that the granulated 4 ounce "spoonful" bottles are not as readily stocked as the highly wasteful, inefficient, and environmentally taxing bag format.  Yes, Mable, everything is a burden on our environment, especially you.  Aspartame is also not suitable in acidic foods or those heated to cooking temperature as it hydrolyzes (breaks down) and loses its subjective sweetness.<br /><br />There is also a smaller 2 ounce bottle but we find the 4 ounce is a better value, fits on the counter just fine, and is less destructive to the environment as it defecates less plastic into the environment.  We'd strongly prefer it be sold in a lined paper box so it will biodegrade much better than terrible plastic.<br /><br />So, until we manage to avoid sweetening altogther and until there are subtantive reports to its toxicity, we're happy with the sweetener, Equal.

review/summary: great taste
review/text: I love Taco Bell so I knew I would love this sauce.  I have used it on chicken, veggies, baked potatoes and most recently, I put it on my mashed potatoes.  You can use this in many ways, salads, meats etc.<br />The taste is creamy, rich and spicy but not too spicy.  it has a little kick to it and if you like jalapenos, then you will like this.  I am not a big fan of alot of spices and when I cook, I really cook plain but I do like this product.  It's not too much and not too little.<br /><br />If you want to add a little zest to your every day meals, this is a good way to go.<br />*************************************<br /><br />THIS IS AN UPDATE, 2 WEEKS LATER<br />Ok, for me, this sauce is not too spicy, however, I served it 2 times to company.  One time I used it as a dipping sauce for veggies and another time, I used it for a topping on taco night in my house.  Both times, my friends and family said it was too spicy for them.  I personally like a kick but they all found it too spicy but they loved, loved the taste, it was just too spicy.  One of my friends actually started coughing and asked for a glass of water.  So, if you like spice but not heat, this is a great sauce. There are many, many ways to use this and it really can stretch your budget by adding zest to boring ole chicken and fish.  However, it may be too spicy for those of you not used to it..but it tastes great.

review/summary: Delicious with a hint of spice
review/text: This is another of Taco Bell's sauces that I am enjoying. It's just a hint spicy, but full of flavor (though not necessarily bold). I use it as an alternative to mayo on my sandwiches. I recently switched over to lite mayo which I absolutely detest, but I just can't justify the calories and fat in real mayo. That's where this comes in. Each 1 tbsp is 55 calories and less than 1 gm of fat as compared to lite mayo which is 35 calories and 3.5 gm of fat per 1 tbsp. The sauce has slightly more calories, but is well worth the switch. It's delicious, adds a touch of spice to my sandwich and almost reminds of those gourmet type sauces like those added to certain sub sandwiches from a well known chain. I also like it on fajitas, tacos and other traditional Mexican food. I read in another review that it was nice on a lite salad, so I tried that also, and yes, I agree totally, it's a very nice dressing for such. So, all in all, I'm impressed with these Taco Bell sauces (including the Chipotle flavor) and would recommend you at least give it a try.

I'm trying this sauce with pretzels, as a dip, and it's very flavorful. I see that there's spinach and parsley here, as well as the red and green bell peppers. There's a hint of cheese. Tasting lots of stuff. It's very creamy. That creaminess has a drawback, of course -- a serving of two tablespoons has 110 calories. But overall, it's nice, and I'll try it with some cooking, too.

He thought putting cheese in it hurt the taste, and they both said it wasn't at all spicy.

He put it on a chicken burger last night and dipped his carrots in it, then practically licked the plate.

review/summary: I'm using it as a salad dressing--it's great
review/text: Funny to read the reviews of this with some reviewers saying it's not spicy enough, others saying too spicy. I'm sort of in the middle--it seems fine to me but it does have enough of a bite to make it interesting. I think most people will use this as a taco sauce (and I have to tell you, I'm not a Taco Bell restaurant fan, blehhh), but when it arrived I happened to be slicing up tomatoes for a salad, so I just plunked some on and used it as a dressing--and I loved it. Has a very different flavor and the next night I found myself craving it again. So, all week it's been tomatoes, cukes and jalapeno sauce. Not bad.<br /><br />My one complaint about *all* dressings like this is that the jar is too small. C'mon, it can't cost more than a few pennies to make this stuff--all the cost comes from packaging and shipping--so why not make it at least 12-ounces or even more. Again, that goes for all sauces like this, and all salad dressings.<br /><br />By the way, if you have a lactose intolerance (as I do), read the label: this contains whey from milk and other dairy products. I wish that lactose was listed on all labels.<br /><br />Live long and prosper.

review/text: Again, I'm disappointed with the new Taco Bell creamy sauces. I first tried the ranchero sauce, which was not good at all. This sauce, the creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce, is slightly better but the taste is still not that impressive. For one thing, the jalape&ntilde;o flavoring is quite mild and I prefer a much spicier kick to my food. The best way I can describe the taste is "manufactured". It does not taste like freshly made sauce. Too much of the sauce is overwhelming, not because of the spicy factor, but just because the bottled taste would ruin good mexican food made with fresh ingredients. I'm not against Taco Bell brand  I love their canned refried beans and their original bottled hot sauce). These creamy sauces, however, have not impressed me at all.

It is not spicy. To taste the "jalapeno" you will need a very vivid imagination.<br /><br />Is it gross? No, I think the sauce is okay overall, and I'm sure I'll find some food to match well with it, but when you get something called "bold jalapeno sauce"  you don't expect to be getting the world's mildest sour cream. Overall> not gross, but not a "bold" original flavor either. And it is NOT "jalapeno", so if you're looking to actually try something spicy - run away from this rip off.

review/summary: Spicy, But Not Enough.
review/text: When it has came down to Taco Bell, they have honestly made some great Mexican foods and seasonings to make our food  abit more spicy. But very rarely, there can be a time where they have a food on the maket that isn't as spicy as it could've been. That is the case with their Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce. The sauce didn't taste so bad, but honestly I was hoping for a bit more spice and tanginess to the flavor of the sauce. I have honestly tasted their Spicy Ranchero sauce, and that was much more zestier. It isn't bad, but if you are a huge fan of Taco Bell, I would definitely recommend a much hotter sauce for your Jalapeno spiced needs.<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Taste: B-<br /><br />Overall: C+

review/summary: Not what I was expecting
review/text: I was hoping this would be the infamous, well to me infamous, baha sauce I get with my Cheesy Gordita Crunches, but when I tried it, it tasted like a ranch sauce that is overpowered with jalapenos. If you like creamy jalapenos with a hint of a ranch taste, then this is the product for you. Not so much for me though.

review/summary: Impressive
review/text: This is another product that I would not normally pick up to try but am glad I did! This jalpeno sauce is just the right mix of a ranch-type dressing with a little kick added to it. This was great with some homemade mexican food, but would also be very good and fun with a veggie plate for a summer snack. It might be a bit spicy for kids, but adults will love it. Yum!

review/summary: Like it better as a salad dressing
review/text: We found the sauce a little on the light side as a taco sauce, you have to use a lot to taste it with the other things on the taco.  Like it a lot better as a salad dressing because the flavor stands out more.  Recommended as a salad dressing with a smaller recommendation as a taco sauce.  If you like this as a salad dressing let me recommend Marie's Jalapeno Ranch, our favorite salad dressing.

review/summary: Not The Best Of The Taco Bell Lineup
review/text: Yeah, Taco Bell isn't exactly associated with healthy living. While it may say Taco Bell on the label the sauces are actually manufactured by Kraft Foods. They pay Taco Bell to slap their name on the label and voila you get a more recognizable brand. The sauce is not my favorite of the three I sampled. It's just really a processed taste almost like cheese sauce. The other ones actually have a more bold flavor but this one not so much.

review/text: The whole family favored this flavor ove the Chipolte one. They both are very creamy. I didn't care for either on beef, but I really enjoyed it on chicken - either on a chicken taco or a chicken sandwich. The sauce does have some kick, but if you like spicey treats, this probably will rate 'medium' for you as far as a level of hotness. I think people who normally stay away from spicey items would actually enjoy trying this. This could easily become a normal household purchase for us.

review/text: I'm not a real big sauce person, but once in a while, I like to try something different (especially if it might have a little spicy nature to it).  So, when I got the chance to try the Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce, I thought, jalapenos may have a bit of a zing; lets try it.  Well, although the sauce is tasty and creamy, there is very little zing (hence the 4 stars).  Even my 3 year old liked it and she does not like anything spicy. This sauce wasn't my favorite on Tacos, but I did like dipping carrots and celery into it as a little snack.  Cant wait to see what else we use it for.

review/summary: Where's the Jalapeno?
review/text: This Taco Bell Jalapeno sauce was a disappointment too me. With the "Bold" title I expected a spicy jalapeno sauce perhaps cut with a dairy product too make it creamy and palatable too the general public. So not very spicy as I would love. This was more of a buttermilk dressing with just a hint of Jalapeno flavor. I have used it on burritos and as a dip; it works better as a dip. There is no question that if you like the flavor of a good Jalapeno this will disappoint you.<br /><br />As their other 'Bold & Creamy' products two tablespoons of this sauce contains 100 calories from fat and a total of 110 calories per serving size. The serving size is the aforementioned two tablespoons. It taste OK just be aware of its high fat content and calories. When serving size is measured by the spoon full you know the calories are high. I would not seek too purchase this product but would use it again. 3(1/2) Stars.

review/text: Okay so I really didn't have high hopes for this product but actually found many uses for it.<br />Let's start with the flavor: it is creamy, very mild but has a nice hint of jalapeno along with garlic and onion...typical Mex style flavor.  It's nice but not epically good and surely not good for you.<br /><br />USES:<br />1.

review/summary: Rich sauce, a little kick to it, but rather timid
review/text: I gave if 4 stars because it's a jalapeno sauce, yet the spicy level is really weak. I wasn't looking for a mouth-on-fire experience, but if they're going to put "jalapeno" on the label, it should at least have an OK amount of heat in there. You won't find much of that in this sauce. That being said, I tried this on a lot of different items, and frankly it tastes good on almost everything. Hamburgers, chicken nuggets, and of course tex-mex foods like taquitos and quesadillas. It's a creamy somewhat thick sauce, so be prepared if you were expecting a thinner style. I'd recommend it, but then again I'm not a real sauce snob (is there such a thing?) It was a surprise though, as I've never had any Taco Bell item with this type of sauce on it that I can recall. Whatever they're putting it on, I'll bet it's pretty tasty!

review/text: These sauces are light and have a spicy edge.  They mix well with meats, Mexican food, veggies, and some of them are good in salads.  They are liquid, so blend well with other foods. Jalapeno is the lightest, Spicy Ranchero is like the original Taco Bell Hot Sauce Flavor the most. It goes well as a salad dressing if applied sparingly.  The Chipotle one is the most mellow one, all with a bite.  I will definitely buy again.<br /><br />Taco Bell has outdone themselves.

I first tried it on a sandwich made with chicken, tomato and avocado. It lends a piquant flavor without being too spicy. I tried it on shrimp tacos, chicken and cheese burritos, and finally as a salad dressing on a salad that included corn and black beans. I haven't found anything that isn't improved by its spicy magic. This product will become a staple in my house!

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the Jalapeno Sauce.  It is kind-of like a spicy mayonnaise.  I used this sauce in tuna salad, on sandwiches and as a salad dressing.<br /><br />Similar to mayo, almost all of the calories come from fat.  I think it is tastier than mayo and has a nice amount of spice.  You can taste the pepper in the sauce but it doesn't leave your mouth burning.  It's a good balance of flavors.<br /><br />Even if you're not a big Taco Bell fan, this sauce is actually pretty good.

review/text: We used this sauce in the place of mayonnaise on a chicken sandwich and it was absolutely yummy.  About the same fat content of regular Mayo you get quite a zest.<br /><br />I am accustomed to spicy hot ... so this was not very intense for me.  However, if you are not accustomed to Jalapeno peppers or hotter, just prepare yourself.  Better to expect something hotter than it is and adjust accordingly.<br /><br />We found this to be delicious, spicy, zesty, cool ... Yummy.  I wonder why it caries the Taco Bell restaurant name but have never seen this in the restaurants?  A delicious addition to a taco, sandwich or whatever.  Be creative, this is a yummy sauce.<br /><br />As with sauces in this genre, completely processed -- but oh so good anyway!

review/summary: Okay, But Better Sauces Are Out There
review/text: Sure this sauce tastes like jalepeno and is slightly spicey, but mostly this is just like other flavored ranch dressings.  This is similar to a salad dressing you could find for the same price and in a bottle twice as big.  My suggestion - try this and then decide, but I prefer many of the brands you will find in the salad dressing & veggie dip sections of your grocery store.  Those from other brands are bolder and packaged for better pricing.  I would consider this more of a novelty driven by the brand name Taco Bell.  This product will most likely be located near the taco kits & canned mexican food, but try shopping in the salad dressing & veggie dip section - you will find more variety for your money.

review/summary: More like a salad dressing than a taco sauce
review/text: I was so hoping this would have a little kick to it - it doesn't. I was hoping it would have the flavor of jalepeno - it doesn't. I was hoping it would add a bit of spice as a dipping sauce for chips - it doesn't. What it does do is resemble a creamy, ranch type salad dressing. The flavor is so mild (almost nonexistant) that it added nothing at all to a taco or even as a dip with an avacado. It was just so bland and soft that all I could think of was salad. There is no heat here at all by the way! So.... it tastes fine if you aren't really expecting much. If you're from Texas and the Mexico border and accustomed to eating fresh jalepenos with your meals, then this sauce will leave you disappointed and possibly disgusted. If you want a slightly different ranch type dressing to a bowl of lettuce then this stuff isn't bad.

review/text: According to the label this is a "bold & creamy jalapeno sauce".  I then expected a hot sauce that would grab my attention.  The flavor is ok but frankly it's neither as hot nor as bold as I'd expect from a jalapeno sauce.  My bigger issue though is the fat content.  110 calories per serving is ok but 100 of those calories are from fat and there are 11g of fat in a 2 Tbsp serving.  The fat content is way too high for me to use this sauce consistently.  And for anyone looking for a true hot sauce this one just doesn't deliver.

review/text: This Taco Bell Jalapeno sauce is VERY good!  As for taste, it is excellent. But usually taco sauce is low or no fat but this is sauce is extremely fattening so I won't be buying it.  I believe for 2 tablespoons, it is 110 calories and 100 of those calories come from fat. That's so high! It has a buttermilk base so it has the texture and fat content of a buttermilk ranch salad dressing.  The nutritional value is a dealbreaker for me but if that's not important to you, then you'd love this sauce if you like spicy condiments.

Calorie-wise, it isn't all that great but for 2 tbs. you get only 110 calories - the catch is 100 of those are fat calories.  But hey, fat tastes good.  Sodium's not too bad - 310 mg.  There's only 1 g. of sugar.  So if you want a little zest in your food, give this sauce a try.  It's going to be a regular in my pantry.  I can't wait to try the other Taco Bell sauces.

review/summary: A mild and creamy sauce that works well for many different types of food
review/text: Breaking out of the standard tradition of salsa or hot sauce to use as a condiment on tacos and burritos, Taco Bell's latest super market addition is the "Bold and Creamy" line, which works for a variety of different meals.  Having the consistency of a creamy ranch dressing, with just a dab of jalapeno flavor and coloring, the sauce can just as easily work for salads and wraps as it can for any Mexican themed dinner.<br /><br />Of the different "Bold and Creamy" flavors currently available, the jalepeno version has the weakest flavor and is much more mild than might be expected for something with the word "bold" in the title.  It definitely won't make your tacos overly spicy, and seems to be more about adding a creamy sauce texture to Mexican foods rather than actually upping the heat.<br /><br />If you like your sauces more on the mild and creamy side, definitely give the jalepeno sauce a try. For those that want a stronger flavor, skip this one and pickup Taco Bell's Chipotle flavor instead.

review/text: I generally always have some sort of sauce on what i eat. Whether its hot sauce,bbq,mustard,ketchup. I've tried various other sauces so i wanted to try this one out as well. The best way i can classify this is as a spicy ranch sauce. It works well with salads, and adds a moderate amount of spiciness.<br />Of course, like ranch sauces, it is not healthy so you really gotta keep track of how much you put. These sauces are a nice break from the regular stuff, but they really arent good enough (atleast for me) to become a regular.

review/summary: Good taste, but light Jalapeno flavor, not spicy
review/text: We had tacos tonight and I tried out a couple new sauces from Taco Bell.  One of the sauces was the Bold & Creamy Jalapeno sauce.  I liked the sauce on the tacos, but would have liked it better if it were hotter with a stronger Jalapeno taste.  I like really hot and spicy food, so I found this pretty mild.  With that said, it had a good flavor and I liked it.<br /><br />I could see it being used on a variety of foods the same way you would use a ranch dressing.  The main ingredient is soybean oil and 100 of the 110 calories in a 2 Tbsp serving size are from fat, so this is not a diet or light dressing.<br /><br />Bottom line, I liked the taste, but would have liked it to have been hotter with more of a Jalapeno kick.  It is fattening, so don't load up on it.  For a light Jalapeno taste on top of your tacos or other dishes, it is a good sauce.

You can put this sauce on your tacos, fajitas, pretty much anything you feel like.  It works better on tacos when there are vegetables in the taco.  I would buy a bottle to try first if you don't feel like committing to a case.  I can't find fault with it, just that it's not what I would choose first for my Mexican food.

review/summary: The Dip with a Kick
review/text: This summer I have been experimenting with dipping sauces, mustards and barbeque sauces in my cooking and with my meals. As I added in Taco Bell's Jalepeno Sauce into my lineup, and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Really, Taco Bell jalepeno sauce is a creamy condiment with a kick. I like it with boneless wings and chicken nuggets as a dip. I think it would also be good for a little spice in a baked potato, or as a dip with potato chips. It is also good with its desired purpose, namely as a condiment to garnish with mexican foods such as tacos fajitas and burritos. The uses for this yummy sauce are actually quite diverse. I am eager to add it to my Subway sandwich in the near future.<br /><br />This sauce does have a little bit of the jalepeno spice, but I don't consider it that hot of a food. What is tasty is the flavor of jalepenos. If you are a consisuer of chilis and peppers like I am, you will love the authentically ddisticive peppery twist that Taco Bell offers with this fine food.<br /><br />Personally, I think Taco Bell would be wise to include a recipe in its packaging of this item, as it will be fun to figure out how many uses there are for this wonderful sauce.

review/text: This Taco Bell brand jalapeno flavored sauce is really good and creamy. Great on tacos, burritos or any type of food that requires sauce on it. Not too spicy, just a gentle flavor of jalapenos. I don't care for jalapenos, but this was really good. Thanks for sending this to me!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: This sauce was better than I expected. I didnt think it was spicy but my 8 year old daughter did. Children's taste buds are more sensitive than ours and I do like spicy food so I guess it depends on your taste buds. We tried it on ground beef tacos w a tomato/jalapeno/cilantro mixture I make and on chicken soft tacos w bacon and sour cream. It was good on both but better w the chicken. The cilantro overpowered the sauce with my beef tacos. It was also good on taco salad, which I made from the leftovers. This sauce is similar to a jalapeno/ranch sauce they serve on salads in Chili's. This sauce is delicious but will not satisfy you if you are looking for something spicy.

review/summary: Great Stuff!
review/text: I tried three Taco Bell flavors (chiplote, ranchero and the creamy jalepeno).  Of the three, this was my favorite by taste alone.  As it sits on your tongue, you sense a creamy smooth texture with a hint of hot.  I tried it in traditional tacos and it was good but the flavor got a little lost.  I preferred it in a taco salad as it had more vegetables and less taco meat with its own spicy flavor.  Also would be a good compliment on nachos in place of sour cream.

review/summary: Spicy and Tasty
review/text: This is the spiciest of the Taco Bell sauces which I have tried, so use with caution.  It has a great jalapeno flavor and nice texture.  Not as thick as mayo, but more like a salad dressing.  Aside from the obvious uses with Mexican food, it works well as a hamburger topping and a sandwich spread (but it will tend to run off the sandwich).  The best use I have found is as a steak sauce.  Even leftover steak tastes amazing with this sauce!

review/summary: Not bold at all...
review/text: Two things I would like to mention:<br /><br />1) It's not really hot. More like Jalapeno was sprinkled on top of this Sour Cream tasting sauce.<br />2) As mentioned by a prior reviewer, it really doesn't go well with chips either.<br /><br />Beware, you have been warned.

review/summary: A Nice Addition To Most Mexican Food
review/text: I had high hopes for this Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce.  My family and I enjoy most Taco Bell products; both from the restaurant and the in-store products.  I love their Fire Sauce, and wish they sold it in bottle form at the grocery store.  So when I saw this new Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce, I was excited to try it.  I really enjoy just about anything spicy, so my hopes and expectations were high.  Now that I have tried this sauce, I am somewhat disappointed yet find it to be a good addition to most Mexican foods that I enjoy.<br /><br />The name of the product clearly states "Bold & Creamy."  I agree with the creamy aspect of their claim, but feel that the word bold should be changed to something less aggressive, like tangy.  You definitely detect notes of Jalapeno peppers in the sauce, but it is quite subdued and has a somewhat artificial taste.  But I'm not bashing the product or saying that it isn't tasty.  I have found my favorite use of this product is with tacos and burritos.  I add a light amount of the Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce to my soft and hard shell tacos, and then add generous amounts of Taco Bell Fire Sauce (I hoard packets of that stuff and always try to get as much of it as I can whenever I visit the Taco Bell drive-thru).  The Jalapeno sauce gives the tacos a bit of a sour cream flavor, while also added just a slight bit of Jalapeno kick.  I have tried this sauce with several other things from sandwiches to salads, and even a spicy chicken wrap.  While I didn't mind the sauce with the wrap, I didn't enjoy it at all with sandwiches and salads.<br /><br />Overall I will likely continue to purchase this product going forward, but I think a single bottle will last quite some time.  It doesn't have a good enough taste to stand on its own, as a dip or as a replacement for other sauces that I enjoy.  I don't find it to be nearly spicy enough, but I also understand that making it much more spicy would likely limit their sales to a more specific consumer market.  It is an above average product that is a solid compliment to some Mexican dishes, but I don't see this becoming a best seller among the Taco Bell brand name.  But I don't think the product is the type that most people will either love or hate.  It falls right in the middle, and I think most people will find it to be moderately satisfactory.  Go ahead and give it a try for yourself.  I suggest picking up a single bottle before buying a lot of 6, as they sell on this site, just to make sure you enjoy it enough to consider stocking up with that quantity.  I hope you enjoy it.  =o)

review/summary: Spiced Mayonnaise
review/text: Describing food tastes is highly personal.<br />Everyone has a different palate.<br />The suggested uses for this sauce are tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps. I tried it on a taco and found the taste too delicate to really appreciate.<br />It isn't hot, which is fine. Somehow, I really found the flavor lost and had to taste it alone and it tastes like mayonnaise with spices and cheese.<br />I would not call it "bold" at all.<br />I prefer regular mayonnaise, again this is highly variable from palate to palate.<br />I wasn't too happy with the ingredients. It appears as a very processed food.

review/summary: mild taste, great on ground beef
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised at how good the Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce was.  It's a creamy sauce, kind of like a thick ranch dressing.  It tastes a little like ranch too, tangier though.  There is very little jalapeno spice to the sauce, although there is some jalapeno flavor.  This reminds me a lot of the consistency and base flavor of the avocado sauce you can get on Taco Bell grilled steak soft tacos at the restaurant itself; in fact, if they made a bottled avocado sauce, they would have my undying love and affection forever.<br /><br />I tried this sauce on ground beef tacos in hard corn shells and it was good.  A little lettuce and monterey jack cheese made it better.  Personally, I didn't like it on tacos that also had salsa or chopped tomatoes.  The sauce is very good on soft flour shells.  I use it on soft tacos that I've warmed up with leftover refried beans and Spanish rice, and it's excellent.  While it's okay on chicken tacos, it's bold enough I prefer it on beef or beans, something with a stronger flavor.<br /><br />The 8-ounce bottle is about half the size of your usual ketchup or salad dressing bottle, and the bottle says a full ounce is a serving, but you can use a lot less.  I've used it at least 8 times and I'm not quite halfway through the bottle.  I will definitely buy this again and in other flavors.

review/summary: A Good Tasty Sauce
review/text: When the Taco Bell "Bold and Creamy Jalapeno Sauce" first arrived, I had pretty low expectations, so it's safe to say that it suprised me. It has a texture more like Sour Cream than salsa, and it isn't super-spicy, but provides a bit of warmth to whatever you put it on. The most pronounced flavors seem to be cilantro and lime, even though neither one is listed on the ingredients label. It adds a nice depth of flavor to any burrito, taco, or even to an ordinary sandwich, and I think I'd order it if Taco Bell offered it in stores.

review/summary: It's different!
review/text: My family likes Taco Bell and we like this Jalapeno Sauce okay. We eat Mexican-ish style dishes quite a bit at home, so it's nice to have a bottled sauce for a little extra kick. I do like the jalepeno flavor in this particular sauce, but of course, not everyone has the same tastes. I also liked that it comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip lid with a small hole, rather than having to try to pour it out of the larger opening. That makes it convenient for adding just the amount you want. It can be used as a salad dressing, if you like thick dressings... or as a dipping sauce for tortilla chips, or on tacos, burritos, what-have-you.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: Unlike other reviewers, I really liked the sauce. Yes, it's a little sweet, but I'm a big Jalapeno fan, so I think it's great. It's good to add to something like tacos or burritos, and you can tell it's a Taco Bell product. It's tastes similar to the other sauces that Taco Bell commonly puts on it's products. It's not something I would use everyday, but I would add to spice up a regular taco night!

review/summary: Not Bold, but maybe Somewhat Adventurous & Creamy
review/text: Taco Bell has introduced a new line of three "Bold & Creamy" sauces. I decided the most straight-forward way to evaluate this sauce was to try it with some of Taco Bell's own products. I went to the local drive-through and picked up a couple of tacos and some chips.<br /><br />Trying this on tacos, I found it to be OK. There is a mild taste of jalapeno and the sauce is not at all unpleasant. To me, however, tacos are beef, cheese, and a little lettuce in a crisp corn shell with maybe a dollop of a red (or green) tomato- & chile-based sauce. Maybe that's because growing up in California in the 1950's and 60's, that's the only kind of taco you found at the family-owned restaurants that were here long before Taco Bell.<br /><br />This is not to say that Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce is a bad product. I've tried it as a dipping sauce with vegetables and chips and as a dressing on a plain hamburger patty. Using as a dip, you get more of both the buttermilk and jalapeno flavors and are more likely to notice the mild (some would say very mild) heat. I also found it to be a nice change of pace from blue cheese, A-1, or Worcestershire sauce on my hamburger patty.<br /><br />All three of the "Bold & Creamy" sauces are based on soybean oil, water, vinegar, buttermilk,  and a few other standard ingredients. The jalapeno variety adds jalapeno peppers, cheddar cheese, green bell peppers, parsley, and spinach to the basic formula.<br /><br />If you don't mind creamy sauces on your taco, Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce is worth a try; even if you do mind, you may, like me, find plenty of other places to uses this sauce.<br /><br />One note: the "Best if Used By" date on the bottle I received was less than two months after I received it. This seems kind of short to me for a bottled product that's refrigerated after opening. It may have been an older lot, but it's something to keep in mind if you're thinking of ordering in bulk or taking advantage of a sale.

review/summary: Tasty Sauce
review/text: Taco Bell Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce is tasty with a bit of a kick. Not too hot, just a mild heat with good flavor. Note, this sauce has the distinctive flavor of coriander, which is typical in Middle Eastern dishes, such as falafel. Still, unless you dislike coriander, it does not detract from the enjoyment.

review/summary: Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce
review/text: Very very mild jalapeno flavor. You have to work hard to pick up the flavor of the jalapeno. The sauce has a creamy salad dressing thickness to it and overall this is a very neutral flavor. It's not bad, but it's not good enough to recommend. It definitely needed more jalapeno snap to it.

review/summary: Definitely has some bite. I like it.
review/text: First let me say that when I was younger I liked my hot sauce hot. If it didn't make the top of my head break out in a sweat it didn't pass. This won't do that, and I am glad. My tastes have changed. Now I like a lot of flavor and something that is not over the top in the heat department.<br />I do think it is creamy, yes even smooth, but I would call it moderately hot, but not bold in the flavor department. I like it that way. I use it in conjunction with my favorite hot sauce and mixed with the TB Jalapeno Sauce it makes an exotic flavor combination.<br />When you have it with chips alone it has more bite than when mixed into a sandwich. So as a chip dip it is hot within reason, but as a sandwich add on it imparts an interesting flavor, but not overbearing. All you know is the sandwich or burger is just that much more interesting. I like it.
