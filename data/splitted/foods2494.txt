review/summary: Newtons Fruit Thins
review/text: We recently received a box of Newtons Fruit Thins from Amazon Vine and I have to say ... these are tasty little treats! My husband is a big fan of fig newtons and we usually keep those around for his lunches. Where a fig newton cookies is heavy - heavy cake-like cookie, thick spread of the fruit - these treats are very light and crispy. To me this is what makes the difference if you are the type of person that likes a snack with a crunch to it. The blueberry flavor just sent it over the top as well. A much lighter taste than with a regular fig newton - again, not a heavy cakey treat, but a light cracker-y/cookie. These would be wonderful as an afternoon snack or at a little girl's tea party.<br /><br />Two thumbs up!

review/summary: A grownup's cookie
review/text: These are crisp cookies with berries sprinkled through the cookie.  Not like the Newtons Fruit Crisps, or regular Newtons, which have a layer of fruit pur&eacute;e.  The cookie is 2.5 inches wide and about an eighth of an inch thick.<br /><br />I rarely buy packaged cookies, so I don't have a lot of points of comparison.  The texture of the cookie reminds me a little of a graham cracker, only denser.  There is a strong scent of blueberry and a distinct flavor of dried blueberries.  They are not very sweet, which I think is a good thing.<br /><br />They'd be tasty spread with a little soft mild cheese or peanut butter.  On their own, they're good; just not knock-your-socks-off good.  More of a pleasant snack.  It occurs to me, though, that they'd make an interesting pie crust; similar to the kind you make by crushing graham crackers or chocolate wafers and mixing with butter.  I'm thinking they could be very nice in a pie crust with a vanilla pudding filling.<br /><br />Here's the nutritional scoop:  There are three cookies in a serving size, which results in 140 calories, 5 grams of fat (1g saturated, 3g polyunsaturated, 1g monounsaturated), 90 mg of sodium, 50g of potassium, 21g total carbs, 2g dietary fiber, 8g sugars and 2g protein.  Not too bad as a snack from the nutritional standpoint, at least by comparison to most cookies.  From the ingredient list, they appear to be vegan.  Also, they are sweetened with brown sugar, not high fructose corn syrup.  They do contain wheat and soy products.<br /><br />I'd say go for it if you're looking for a packaged cookie that's on the healthier side.

review/summary: Newton's Fruit Thins
review/text: This is a new product made with real fruit.  It is more of a cracker than a cookie and is thin and crispy.  Three cookies constitute a serving.  A serving  is only 140 calories and provides 8 grams of whole grain. The cookies contain no high fructose corn syrup and are a healthier alternative to similar products on the market.  Newton's Fruit Thins should be a popular snack or lunch box item.

review/text: Not a fan.  There's really nothing good about these.  They only taste a little bit like blueberry, but what really gets me is that they are more like crackers.  I saw "newtons" and I assumed they would be soft and cake-like.  But no, they are hard and crunchy like crackers - and they kind of taste like cardboard.  Imagine eating Wheat Thins without any flavor at all (even the plain ones have some sort of spices on them) - that's what these remind me of.  My toddler also hated them, and so did my pregnant wife.  My dogs liked 'em, though!

review/summary: Ok, But Not Really What I Expected
review/text: The Blueberry Brown Sugar Newtons Fruit Thins had a nice blueberry flavor with a slight hint of brown sugar and are a crisp cookie - unlike the historical "Newtons" brand which are soft and chewy.  They are also low in carbs and calories, giving you a somewhat healthy snake.<br /><br />However, I was not particularly fond of them.  To me the Newtons Fruit Thins tasted basically like a cookie-shaped, blueberry-flavored, graham cracker - dry, somewhat bland, and devoid of any real, enthusiastic flavor.  Obviously the packaging states that the cookies are "crispy cookies", but truthfully I was anticipating more of the "Fig Newton"-kind of texture rather than a hard cookie and was somewhat disappointed with the product out of the box (however this was due only to my preconceived notions).<br /><br />Upshot is since I rarely eat cookies and when I do, I enjoy something sweet and tasty, I doubt I will return to this product.  In my mind, if one is really looking for a thin, crispy, low fat treat, you might as well by some good old graham crackers - they are much cheaper.  The Newtons Fruit Thins just don't do it for me.  I also don't really understand the purpose of branching out the "Newtons" brand name into such a completely different product.  It's like coming out with a "Hummer" line of motor scooters - you think that the public wants a more economical vehicle, but tagging on such a dissimilar brand to the new product only confuses people.  Similarly, you see a public request for healthier snacks, but tagging the Newtons brand name does nothing but give people a false sense of what you are selling.  Seems to me that it would be better for Nabisco to just come out with a completely new line, but then that's just my opinion.

review/summary: The Blueberries Tasted Great, But That Was About It
review/text: These are supposed to be a thin cookie that has real fruit and whole grains in it. They smell good and do taste of real blueberries. However, the taste tends to stick with you for quite awhile after you have eaten a cookie. The cookies themselves kind of remind me of a flat <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EF3FR6">Pop-Tarts, Frosted Blueberry</a> without the frosting, although they have the consistency more in line with a hard cookie, which I really don't like. I was not impressed at all with the overall taste of the cookie except for the blueberries.<br /><br />The healthy part of the cookie was real fruit, whole grains, and no high fructose corn syrup. The whole grains were in the middle of the ingredients with no corn syrup. The fruit part passes the taste bud test with a score of 100%. The whole grains look like they were just tossed into the mix for a selling point without really having enough to make a difference. Also, even though there was no corn syrup, there was still sugar, fructose, and brown sugar. Three cookies are considered a serving size for a total of 140 calories.<br /><br />When I saw that Amazon was selling them for $7 a bag that did it for me. I'm not impressed at all with these. I could chew on cardboard with jam on it and have a better snack that has more fiber in it. The only reason I gave it two stars is because they do know their fruit.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's.

review/summary: BLUEBERRY GRAHAM CRACKERS
review/text: Newtons Fruit Thins Blueberry Brown Sugar, 10.5-Ounce (Pack of4)<br /><br />I have to say that I was very surprised by how good these cookies are, great tasting blueberries. When I had the opportunity to try out these snacks I jumped on it and ordered them. I am a big blueberry fan, not sure if I have ever said that in another review but I love em. So I was really interested in trying this healthier type snack out, I am glad I did.<br /><br />Like I usually do I shared this with my girl, bro, and a few others and we all agree they are good. To be honest they taste just like a blueberry graham cracker, wonderful. Now it says pack of four on here but it really means four rows of these cookies. So you do get a lot snacks here so it is worth the price that they ask. Add in that they are made with real fruit, blueberry, and wonderful brown sugar and you get a great snack.<br /><br />This is a low carb and low calorie snack, but don't over do it as with everything else. I do recommend this nice little snack since it does taste good. Every one that tasted these with me agrees that they are indeed good. Try them out if you are a blueberry fan, they are really good.

The flavor of blueberry is not overwhelmingly strong, I think the taste is just right. They are just right for a light snack. There are no where as many crumbs that seem to come with regular cookies, which is nice if you have kids, and like I said my daughter really enjoyed them as well.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9XBIE">Fig Newtons</a> are some of my favorite cookies. I like them because of the nice balance between the fruity filling and the chewy cookie. When I ordered these thins I expected them to be similar in flavor to the other Newtons that I was familiar with, but they turned out to be an entirely different type of sweets. They are very similar to the other kinds of thins. The blueberry flavor is noticeable, but it's not overwhelming. I haven't been able to discern the brown sugar aroma, other than in terms of the general sweetness. I actually like these thins a lot, and I have to restrain myself from eating too many at a time. They make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee. Overall, these are very tasty thins.

The blueberries are hard little rocks with a strange texture that isn't very appetizing. The flavor of the cookie itself was alright, a definite brown sugar taste. The serving size is small, and not very satisfying for the calorie count. Overall I would try a different snack product over this one.

review/summary: Excellent Snack!
review/text: The first thing I did when I received this package was turn it over and give the ingredient list a quick browse.  NO High Fructose Corn Syrup!  Yay!<br /><br />I then passed a couple out to the kids for their opinions.  17 year old boy immediately scarfed his down and then made a grab for more.  He said they taste a little like graham crackers with blueberries mixed in.  He rated them a 9/10 (don't ask me why the 1 pt deduction) and agreed that he would recommend buying them and would pack them in his lunch.<br /><br />8 year old boy ate his a little slower and said that they were a little like a cookie but not as sugary.  When asked for a rating he replied "I dunno" but did say he wanted them in his lunchbox the next day.  He said that they are almost as good as cookies.  LOL<br /><br />I tried a few myself and agree with the graham cracker comparison, although they are not quite a crumbly.  The taste is quite pleasant and there is no aftertaste at all.  The brown sugar sweetens nicely and gives the cracker a pleasant taste.

review/text: Personally I don't like a lot of filling sometimes. I like the fig newtons but these are very different because they have a lot less filling- more like a crispy biscuit with dried blueberries and an oat-y taste.<br />However, this price is outrageous. At my local safeway, they oftentimes have a sale for Buy one get one Free, so the usual price of $4.50 is actually $2.25 per bag. For for bags that's only $10.<br />I noticed they have cranberry oat for a little over $16. This is a decent price if there is no sale, and you like the your cookies with a slight citrus tang to it.

review/summary: Addictive Wafer Variation on the Old Cookie Standby
review/text: Fig Newton aficionados may pooh-pooh this textural variation on the old classic, but they may not even notice that this product is remotely related except for the name. Thin and crispy, this is a surprisingly tasty cookie that bears little resemblance to the original Fig Newton. The Fruit Thins are made with real fruit and contain eight grams of whole grain per serving. The blueberry and brown sugar combo is a good pairing of flavors. While they may look like a healthier snacking option, they are still cookies after all, an indulgence that will hopefully not be the subject of your bingeing. The serving size of Newtons Fruit Thins are three cookies, which equal 140 calories, five grams of total fat and 1 to 1.5 grams of saturated fat. Good luck with that.

When you actually start eating them, they crumble at the first bite and make quite the mess.  I wouldn't want my toddler to eat these in the living room, for example.  The Fruit Thins are a great alternative to a regular processed cookie, however, and are 140 calories and only 5 grams of fat for 3.  Compared to some others, this is quite a bit better nutritional profile.<br /><br />I wish they were a tad more moist and chewy, which I expected from a Newton cookie.

review/summary: Excellent Crackers!
review/text: These are very tasty crackers! They are about 3/16" thick with 2 1/2" diameter. They are sturdy enough to spread a decently thick cheese on, or can be topped with other items. I like how they are less likely to break than many other crackers intended for serving with cheese and other toppings.<br /><br />Normally when I see the name "Newtons" I think of the Fig Newtons, and expect a moist and soft snack. These are not soft & moist. The difference is comparable to the difference between soft cookies and the stiff ones. That was the main thing that was different from my mental image of what these thins would be like. However, they are not too dry. They have a bit of moisture content so they hold up quite well.<br /><br />These thins taste great! The brown sugar is more of the background base flavor that one would expect to taste, and the blueberry gives it the flavor mixture that really makes these a pleasure to eat! I have to say, this mixture is quite excellent! It is not too strong, so I could eat a whole package without getting tired of the flavor, and yet each cracker has enough flavor that I can eat just one and be pleased.<br /><br />Newton's Fruit Thins are a delightful snack, with a perfect blend of maple sugar and blueberry flavoring. They are nice and sturdy (not a single one arrived cracked) and the price is quite excellent! I find them great for snacking, and they are actually decent at curbing hunger. I was very hungry just a while ago, and snacked on a few and am fine now.

review/text: I've never really been a fan of fig newtons, but thought I would try these new cookies anyway.  For cookies, first of all, these are pretty healthy. 140 calories, 5 grams of fat, and 2 grams of fiber. They're made with whole grains and real fruit.  No fake stuff here.<br /><br />And for something that's pretty good for you?  They tasted good too.  LOVE.

review/summary: Nice crisp cookie but too sweet
review/text: I love the texture, crunch and lightness of these cookies. They remind me of English tea biscuits, which I love. However, After trying two of the flavors (blueberry and fig/honey), I find that they are just too sweet. I think they would be a much better (and probably healthier) cookie if the sugar was cut back. If you don't mind a very sweet cookie and a thin, crisp cookie appeals to you, you'll probably like them. But if, like me, you prefer a bigger dose of fruit and a smaller dose of sugar, you might be disappointed with these.

review/summary: Finally a crisp cookie!
review/text: I like crisp cookies, and have been beaten down by the soft cookie movement (yuck).  These Fruit Thins are great!  Very light and crisp, with a bit of whole grain bits in the cookie for texture.  I tried the blueberry ones, and the blueberry flavoring was a little unbalanced, it overpowered the brown sugar flavor.  However, they are quite tasty, and more importantly, crisp.  I plan to try the cranberry ones and see if the fruit flavor is as strong.  Overall I recommend them!

review/summary: Good compromise for kids snacking
review/text: The Newton Fruit Thins are about 3" thin, crisp cookie which is also similar to a cracker.  I tried the Blueberry Brown Sugar. They are flavorful and better for you than a traditional cookie.  They are a good alternative when your kids want high calorie cookies.  You can have 3 of these for 140 cal, 5 g fat, 1 sat. fat, and 8g sugar.  Usually you would only get 2 package-type cookies for the same calories and higher fat. My husband liked these as much as the kids, but because they are not as substantial as a cookie, he found himself wanting to eat more of them to be satisfied.  Everyone liked them and wanted them again.  I don't think they are for everybody but you won't know until you try.

review/summary: Good Cookie, but a Little Sweet
review/text: Recently, I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FELBH8">Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey</a> cookies.  Then someone brought a package of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEJ968">Cranberry Citrus Oats,</a> type to work.  I liked the cranberry cookies better. Now I have also tried the Blueberry variety. My favorite is still the cranberry.<br /><br />The blueberry cookies themselves are good. They are thin, but that was the idea, wasn't it? The cookies have a nice texture. You can taste the blueberries, but the sugar makes them sweeter than the other varieties. The calorie count, 140 for three cookies, is about the same as the granola bars that I sometimes snack on. Just don't eat the whole box at once.<br /><br />The ingredients are also reasonable with the exception of the use of palm oil. As palm oil use has increased dramatically over the past ten years, commercial growers have been clearing rain forests in Indonesia and Malaysia to create palm oil plantations. The palm oil is used in food production, as in these cookies, and in the manufacture of bio-fuels. The result is a loss of endangered species and ironically increased carbon emission. There has been some movement to either reduce palm oil use or use only palm oil from sustainable sources. There have even been stories of girl scouts agitating to sell only palm-oil-free cookies.<br /><br />Kraft is aware of the palm oil situation. It is not clear that they are doing anything about it. This is from a July 15, 2009 Wall Street Journal article: "Kraft spokesman Richard D. Buino said that while the company supports the RSPO's [Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil] efforts, 'it is clear more work is needed to consolidate standards, enforce principles, verify traceability along the supply chain and ensure competitive pricing to bring certified palm oil to market. We're monitoring the RSPO process and actively engaging our suppliers to monitor their certification efforts to find viable options for sourcing sustainable palm oil.' Neither Nestl&eacute; nor Kraft directly addressed purchases of Malaysia's certified palm oil."

review/summary: Yummy, but not addicting
review/text: You know the cookies or crackers that you simply cannot just eat one?  Newtons Fruit Thins are not this type of cookie.  That's not to say that they're not delicious because they really are!!!  Everyone in my family liked them, including kids and my hubby, but I noticed that nobody ever asked for them on their own volition.  It was simply a cookie they ate and liked if it was offered.<br /><br />One teensy, tiny complaint is that they're kind of high calorie.  There's really nothing healthy about them despite the picture of blueberries on the front.  I don't know why, but they just SEEM like they should be healthy cookies by the packaging.  Do not be mislead into thinking that they are.  Nabisco NEVER even hints that they might be healthy, but it's just a perception I get when I look at them.

review/text: I've tried ordering several types of snacks from Amazon, and invariably the contents have more broken and crushed pieces than typical at a grocery store.  It's not really their fault--- package shippers just aren't designed to handle these items carefully enough to prevent breakage.<br /><br />As for the snack itself, it gets props for good taste, using some wheat flour and some real fruit, but still too much sugar, too little fiber, and unnecessary added fructose to have it rate as a healthy snack.

review/text: These have quickly become a family favorite for a quick after-work snack.  I found the Blueberry Brown Sugar to be the sweeter of the flavors offered in this line, but not in an over-powering way.  The serving size is adequate (3 large crackers) and the packaging holds them together well so that you don't end up with a crumbly mess.  I recommend them, they are more subtly flavored than similar cookies on the market and they are on the healthier end of the spectrum.

review/text: I love Fig Newtons and I love crisp cookies.  I really wanted to love these new cookies.<br />Kudos to Nabisco for trying to make a healthier type cookie that uses real fruit, flax, natural flavoring and sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.<br />We are slowly eating these as they aren't bad, but they also aren't the cookie or snack we want or crave.<br />As many others have noted they are a bit on the dry side.  They are visually appealing cookies and I actually like how thin they are.<br />Overall, they are just a bit to bland and dry for me.  Hopefully Nabisco will look at all the feedback on this and make some tweaks to the "recipe" and re-release these.

On the plus side, the brown sugar is delicious. As with the cranberry product, this cookie is good on its own, but much better with a cup of coffee or tea.<br /><br />A serving of three is enough to satisfy. They're good, but filling, and you won't keep munching until you look at the package and realize--oops!--they're almost all gone.<br /><br />If you like blueberries and want to indulge yourself a little, try these.

review/summary: Good, pricey and has been done before
review/text: I shared these Fruit Thins in the Office and the response was 45% YUCK, 40% GOOD, and 15% Neutral.  The Yuck group complained that the cracker was too dry, fruit tasted like cough syrup, texture was too chewy.  The Good group liked the Fig and Honey flavor better, and like that this was at least nutrious compared to similar crackers.  I fell into the neutral group and my main opinion is that it is okay, this type of cracker has been done before, some have had baked better versions and the price is quite expensive for a bag of crackers.  One of the more colorful comments is that NEWTON'S are always characterized by a soft fruit filled cake and this product just does not come close to that description hence the comfort food factor which might have made this more acceptable is lost.  Good effort, bad execution.

I have also tried the<br />Chocolate/Raspberry and I think they go better with coffee or a dark hot chocolate,<br />basically a stronger drink. But they are excellent, just not as delicate as the Blueberry,<br />or the Cranberry/citrus which I find as tasty as the Blueberry.  The Fig is good, but I have<br />to be in the mood for them as their flavor is very unique.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Tea Biscuit these are excellent and they are great for milk dunking.<br />These were easy to find locally as well and at a much lower price.

Basically they are thick granola like crackers but are more on the soft than crunchy side.  Layered in is a slightly sticky fruit type filling.

Not one person who tried them disliked them; I only had one neutral comment, and that did not dismiss them entirely. I could have, frankly, eaten the whole bag myself, if restraint had not stopped me.<br /><br />The next stop at the store will be involving a pursuit of the other flavors in the Newton Fruit Thins line. This one was a shot out of the park.

review/summary: Good tasting Crispy Cookie
review/text: Nabisco's new snack cracker, Newtons Fruit Thins, is a good tasting snack that doesn't contain some of the worst ingredients found in many snacks.  I tried the Blueberry Brown Sugar kind, and enjoyed them, as did my wife and daughter.  They tasted good with a very blueberry taste.  While you shouldn't classify these as a health food, they are not as bad as many snacks.  I like that they are made with real fruit, whole grains, and no high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />Three of the thin cookies add up to 140 calories, and it would be easy to eat many more than three, so a person dieting will have to control portion size.  Out of those 140 calories, 45 come from fat, and one of the 5 grams is from saturated fat.  However, no trans fats, which is good.  90 mg of sodium, so not too high.  The ingredient list has things you know, not a lot of man made things, so I like that.  It is a more natural snack.  Ingredients are: Unbleached Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Folic Acid), Whole Grain Wheat Flour, Soybean and/or Palm Oil, Sugar, Rolled Oats, Dried Blueberries, Brown Sugar, Flax Seeds, Fructose, Salt, Baking Soda, Soy Lecithin, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />For a thin, fruit flavored, cookie snack, Nabisco's new Newtons Fruit Thins are a good tasting crispy cookie.  We enjoy them, and I like that they are not as bad for you as many other snacks.  If you control how many you eat, these are great for those with a sweet tooth.

Also for those of you who are dieting, 3 of the cookies, which are a decent size have 140 calories or in Weight Watchers, 3 points, so not too bad on the calories or the points.<br /><br />I am enjoying them and will be buying more!

review/summary: Absolutely wonderful
review/text: I found these cookies a breath of healthy fresh air in the typically over-sweet standard selection of American traditional cookies.  I never understood the fascination with the sweet, fatty, calorie-laden favorite cookie in this country - the chocolate chip.  The Newtons are very European, where  on my travels I discovered the idea of the light "biscuit" style cookie that people there snack on with tea or coffee.  It's not a coincidence that Europeans are not nearly as overweight or obesive as we are, and this type of cookie snack is a small part of why that is with their differences in diet and attitudes.<br /><br />I liked the Raspberry Chocolate very much, but thought the Blueberry was the best.  The latter has a delicious blueberry flavor with nice bits of dried fruit, along with a tastey and healthful flax seed crunch.  With my morning coffee, just fabulous.

review/text: A delicious, fresh-tasting cookie, with the real flavor of blueberry. If you could take the concentrated aromatic yumminess of the filling of a "blueberry newton" and spread it throughout a crispy wafer, this is what you'd expect. Definitely not a disappointment. I will order more!

review/summary: if you want healthier, these are good
review/text: This package was delivered not long before the tornadoes struck so I had almost forgotten about them. This afternoon I was looking for a snack and remembered these cookies.<br /><br />They were very crunchy and crisp although a bit dry; solved that with a tall cold glass of milk. The blueberries tasted real although got a little gummy and stuck to my teeth. The brown sugar was very subtle - I definitely have a sweet tooth. These are nothing like Fig Newtons.<br /><br />If you are looking for a tasty healthier cookie with no HFCS, then Newtons Fruit Thins are what you want....

review/summary: Enjoyed by some
review/text: These are semi-thin, crunchy cookies with dried blueberries mixed in.<br /><br />The good:<br />I loved the packaging and the fact that I could keep the contents fresh with the folding wire.<br />I appreciate the lack of corn syrup and the whole grain %.<br />They are low in sugar and even have some iron.<br />I love that they have no cholesterol.<br />My husband and son really liked their taste (very important to know when one craves junk food and the other has high cholesterol).<br /><br />The negative:<br />I thought these would have a new kind of taste but they don't.<br />Each cookie is about 45 calories.<br />The fat content is quite high (8%).<br />I didn't like the taste much.<br /><br />Would I buy them again? Not for me, but if I am filling up the pantry with food for others to snack on, I will definitely pick these over other cookies.

review/summary: Not your typical Newtons
review/text: My children taste tested these and only one of them liked them.  The cookies were crisp, so if you envisioned these to be like a soft, chewy fig newton cookie, that is something that you should know.  The picture on the front makes the cookie look softer than it actually is.<br /><br />The child that did like them also loves blueberries.  He gobbled the cookies up and asked for more.  The fruit bits aren't microscopic; you can actually see them in the cookie.  The cookies are very thin though and I don't know that they hold up well in milk.  They are thin, as advertised!<br /><br />They have no High Fructose Corn Syrup in them.  One other thing I would like to note is that when you open the package up, you can definitely smell the blueberry flavor.  It is fairly strong too.

review/summary: Gooooood Cookie!
review/text: I love this cookie* and it's my husband's new favorite. It's crisp (sturdy, not delicate; great for dunking), not too sweet, and with blueberries that add a chewiness and a wonderful, natural flavor. The nutrition stats are decent (3 cookies = 140 calories/5g fat/2g fiber); 30+ cookies in a package and we're satisfied by 4-6 cookies. At a sitting, that is :) we like them so much that we've been back to the grocery store and are finishing up our third package.<br /><br />*Note: the "Newtons" name seems a branding/marketing tactic; these bear little resemblance to e.g. Fig Newtons other than being a less-sweet, more wholesome, fruit-oriented cookie.

review/summary: More Milk Please!
review/text: My initial impression of Newton's Blueberry Brown Sugar Fruit Thins was that they were too dry.  I confess that, at the bottom of the package, are the words "crispy cookies".  I had expected a chewy-like fig newton except with the more appetizing blueberry filling than the fig filling.  So I had started out with some false impressions.  I ate a few and my wife ate a few and then they sat on the shelf until last weekend when our fine Northern Plains community was struck with an awesome blizzard that left the whole county without electricity for three days.  We had food in the freezer and a gas grill on the snow-drift covered deck so we were able to survive.  One of the best treats we had during those cold, gloomy days was the rest of the Newtons Fruit Thins.  They were gone in a hurry.  Once I got away from the idea of a chewy blueberry bar, those crispy crackers weren't too bad.

review/summary: Finally, a NEW cookie!
review/text: My husband and I are not big fans of sugary sweets, so I hesitated at trying this product.  Well, bring them on!  This is a crispy, slightly sweet wafer filled with real blueberries!  The serving size is three cookies, and with their slightly oversized diameter of approximately three inches, I found just two to be more than satisfying.  These cookies are a natural for ice cream or fruit.  I would not, however, give these cookies to really young children because of the sticky dehydrated blueberries compressed into the cookie.  They stuck to my teeth, which was OK for me, but I'm not sure how a child under two would do with this product; maybe OK.  Overall, this is a very nice light dessert item.

review/summary: Excellent cookies alternative
review/text: Nabisco has done it again with this great new product. It is not exactly a cookie, and it is not exactly a cracker, but something in between.<br /><br />These Fruit Thins are called crispy cookies on the packaging, and they are crisp enough to seem like a cracker, but they are not dry like a cracker. They have a wonderful fruitiness about them. I had the blueberry and bown sugar version, and they had real pieces of chewy blueberry in the cookies.<br /><br />They are not heavy like some rich desserts, but have a rich flavor. I like that they are made with unbleached flour, which gives the cookies a warm brown color. I especially love them with hot tea; my husband likes his with coffee. These Fruit Thins make a great snack or a light after dinner dessert.<br /><br />Three cookies are only 140 calories, with 5 grams of fat, only 90 sodium, and only 8 sugar grams.<br /><br />The packaging is nice in that the cookies are not loose in the bag but set in a plastic tray. Now I know that environmentally, this is extra packaging, but I like the tray because it keeps the cookies from getting crushed in transport/shipping.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent snack or dessert.

review/summary: Blueberries and Brown Sugar
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these new cookies, and to be honest, I have mixed feelings about them. They're thin and crunchy, much more like crackers than cookies. The texture is very similar to graham crackers, actually, and they're not very sweet. They have tiny dried blueberries in them, along with brown sugar for flavoring. I would not have called them "cookies", because they're much more like crackers. The flavor is a bit odd. I don't know how to describe it. Rather bland, actually. My favorite part is the dried blueberries, so it's a shame they're so tiny! These cookies make for a quick breakfast, or a mid-afternoon snack. Just make sure you have something to drink, as well, to wash them down.<br /><br />The ingredient list appears mostly "normal", without a lot of weird stuff: enriched flour, whole grain wheat flour, soybean and/or palm oil, sugar, rolled oats, dried blueberries, brown sugar, flax seeds, fructose, salt, baking soda, soy lecithin, and natural flavor. They're somewhat low in fat (5g) and they've got some fiber in them (2g), zero trans fat and zero cholesterol, and 8g of sugars.<br /><br />I would hesitantly recommend them, but I have a feeling that many people will be as ambivalent about them as I am. They're not great, they're not horrible. They're just sort of . . . eh. On the other hand, I do keep eating them. So perhaps they grow on you? I can't see kids enjoying them, it's definitely a more "mature" kind of cookie. My husband feels the same way--he doesn't love them, but doesn't hate them, either.

They're also nothing like the Newton Fruit Crisps; they're much, much tastier.  You can taste the traditional Fig Newton flavor, but the blueberries really add a great twist, making it a totally different cookie.  If you're a Newton fan, you'll definitely want to try these.

review/summary: Crispy, Lingering Blueberry Flavor
review/text: Crispy, full of flavor without being too sweet, blueberry taste lingers deliciously on the tongue: I thoroughly enjoyed the Newtons Fruit Thins.  And--judging by how quickly they disappeared from the cookie jar--the rest of the family did also.<br /><br />The picture on the front of the package made it appear that the cookies were larger than they actually were.  A full serving is 3 cookies...that seems about right since the "cookies" are more like thin cracker wafers than actual cookies.  The manufacturer might want to consider placing a see-through celophane window on the package rather than the current picture.  Otherwise buyers might think they're purchasing one thing and would be getting something that looked quite different.

review/summary: Not Your Typical Newton
review/text: I love the soft and chewiness of a Fig Newton so I wanted to try Nabisco's newest product Newton's Fruit Thins with Blueberry and Brown Sugar.  It tastes like a blueberry muffin but in a thin crisp cookie reminiscent of shortbread.  My 5 year old saw that we had cookies and immediately asked for one.  But, she was expecting something soft and chewy and handed it back to me after one bite.  But my 3 year old appreciated the flavor and didn't mind the crispiness of the fruit thins.  It was hard to just eat one but be careful, it's easy to eat more than the suggest serving size of 3 cookies.  Here's the nutritional information:<br />Serving Size: 3 cookies (30g) About 10 servings per container<br />Calories: 140<br />Calories from fat: 45<br />Total fat: 5g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 90mg<br />Potassium: 50mg<br />Total Carbs: 21g<br />Dietary Fiber: 2g<br />Sugars: 8g<br />Protein: 2g

review/summary: Delicious, well balanced flavor
review/text: So I brought this package into work and shared with a coworker and we both came up with the same conclusion. Yum.<br /><br />Of course, I will explain. These are thin, almost English tea-like cookie crackers. They're decent in the health department, with some fiber and 3 of them are 140 calories. What's nice is the balance of flavor. They are not overly sweat. They have a strong but not overpowering blueberry flavor. I'd definitely add these to my snack list.<br /><br />For those that are health conscious, there is fructose in these. It is one of the last ingredients. There is also wheat and soy for those of you with allergies. If you are not allergic, give them a try.

review/summary: Not too sweet, not too bland, just right.
review/text: I received both this flavor as well as the cranberry citrus flavors to review, & I have to say that I prefer this flavor over the other one.<br /><br />PROS: The blueberry flavor is nicely done. While it doesn't taste exactly like a fresh blueberry it's still a pretty yummy flavor. It sort of reminds me of the blueberry compote you get on top of IHOP pancakes. (This is good for me since it's a good way to get the taste without the obscene amount of fat & calories that you get in IHOP pancakes.)<br /><br />CONS: While I got used to it after a while, I wasn't really expecting these to be thin & crispy. It's not a dealbreaker but I know I'm not the only one who was expecting a softer cookie.<br /><br />Over all, I'll be purchasing these again to eat. They make for a nice, relatively healthy treat to pack in my lunches.

review/text: Somehow, I expected the Newtons Fruit Thins to be sort of soft and chewy, like a blueberry flavored fig newton I suppose. However, they're more like a cross between a thin, crisp, dryish blueberry-sprinkled cookie, and a graham cracker. The ingredients all sound healthy, and they are rather tasty, once you get used to what they are, so I did enjoy them, and the kids made them disappear overnight. They're just what they are, and not what I had expected them to be, but that's okay. Give 'em a try to see if they work for you.

It would be great if someone could design one of these single coffee makers where one could pour in the full 6 / 8 ounces of hot water at one time and not have to hover over it to keep topping it off, at the same time worrying about over filling it.<br />Note: the thermal carafe is the best portable hot travel mug I have used.

review/summary: Best mushroom powder ever
review/text: I thought I would just google mushroom powder for the heck of it, and came across this.  Now, I have been grinding my own porcini powder for several years, it was very time consuming as well as expensive.  Messy, too.  But I love putting it on potatoes, in soup, on fish, just about everything I could think of.  I love mushrooms.  I had been out of powder for quite a while, and I could not really afford to buy any to grind.<br /><br />I saw this product, and thought it was too good to be true, there had to be a chemical or something in it, or a filler.  But I ordered a couple of containers anyway.  OMG, the stuff is the real deal.  Real porcini..nothing else.  And it is ground finer than the stuff I was making.  And smells fabulous.  It is a HUGE bargain compared to doing it myself.  I don't even have to be stingy with it.  I am overjoyed.  Sometimes I open the lid just to smell it.  It is amazing.  I couldn't be happier.  I will be a grateful customer as long as they carry this product.<br /><br />A few suggestions..in rice a roni, in gravy, in wild rice, in broth, on potatoes, sprinkle on fish with a little bit of garlic powder, seasoned breadcrumbs,and bake, added to cream of mushroom soup  for more flavor, a little in scrambled eggs, the possibilities are endless..

review/text: I have a yorkie who even after having her teeth cleaned at the vet, use to have horrible breath and hair that matted very easily. Since changing her dog food, she no longer has the horrid breath and her hair looks and feels fantastic! I will definitely buy this repeatedly- worth every penny to us!!

review/text: This is almost like sitting under my great-grandmother's guava tree hoping for a bumper crop so she would let me eat more than one (homemade jelly had first priority and I SWEAR she counted them). WONDERFUL taste and texture. So, please don't buy these so I don't have to share.

review/summary: Cinnamon good, Cherry Cough Syrup, Lemon Nice
review/text: This is an interesting combination. The Cinnamon flavor is light so it doesn't bring tears to the eyes or burn the mouth. The Cherry tastes a bit like cough syrup. The Lemon flavor is very nice and just what one would expect for a Lemon hard candy.<br /><br />I won't buy the combination again as I prefer a much stronger cinnamon flavor. I avoid anything tasting like cough syrup and I can get the lemon drops separately.

review/summary: Ridiculous!!
review/text: I will never pay that much for a canister of Hills Bro Capp.  I pay $3.28 per canister from Walmart.  I wasn't understanding what volume of product you were getting for the price, so I clicked on the 'More Info' link.  That's absurd!! The offer for $19 plus for 3 canisters is even more insulting.  I could easily purchase 2 cans for what they're asking for 1!!  Not a good deal...

review/summary: Another great Indomie noodle
review/text: These noodles taste great, but I would suggest adding the flavor packets in as soon as you start cooking, instead of pouring the noodles/water over the seasonings immediately before eating, as instructed. The latter leads to a far weaker flavor than Indomie noodles usually have. Adding the seasonings in at the same time as the noodles results in a much richer flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint is the noodles themselves aren't very good, even for instant noodles. This isn't a big deal, but it's more noticeable in their soups than in their Mi Goreng.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: Ayahuasca Vine alone will not give any pleasant or interesting trip. But combined with mushrooms or DMT it will give an intense trip. This special combination is capable of inducing a powerful psychedelic experience because the MAO inhibitor present in the Ayahuasca preserves the DMT. DMT is a psychoactive chemical which produces intense visuals and strong psychedelic effects but is usually rendered ineffective when taken orally because it is easily broken down by the body's MAO enzyme.

review/summary: A true Hot Pepper
review/text: If you are looking for a true hot chili pepper this is the one for you. However, not recommended for the average person. Even those of us that think the hot peppers that are avalible in the stores are like sweet peppers, we still only use very small amounts of this pepper to make dishes very hot to us.<br />Few warnings though, do not get on skin, or in face it will hurt you a lot. Best used with eye protection, good venting, and gloves. If you get it on your skin wash it off as quickly as possible. If in face, flush with lots of water and seek medical help.

review/text: I orderd these lollipops for my daughter's birthday party. By far the best prices I could find and everyone said they were delicious. I liked them because they were small and most of the children at the party were younger. They come one a long stick but it is very easy to cut to whichever length you want.

review/text: I can't vouch personally for this product as I selected it to send as a gift to my brother-in-law for his birthday (he lives on the East Coast of the USA and I live in London).  It was delivered very quickly in plenty of time for the actual date I wanted it to arrive.  Brother-in-Law was thrilled as he's keen on BBQs, and enjoys good quality meat.  My sister and niece were also thrilled.  They celebrated Father's Day with the Birthday sausages and happy smiles all round.

review/summary: The only way to go
review/text: This plant food is incredible. It's super-concentrated plant fuel. Whether you have a green thumb or not, I highly recommend Schultz. It's inexpensive and lasts forever (only 7 drops per quart of water). If you tend to notice last-minute that your plants are dying, this stuff will save the plant.<br /><br />It does promote incredible growth, though, so if your plants are healthy and you start using it every time you water, be prepared for that.<br /><br />I've never tried it on outdoor plants (I live in an apartment), but I've heard nothing but good from friends who also use Schultz.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Incredible value, Super-Concentrated, and definitely worth checking out.

review/summary: All purpose plant food
review/text: I purchased this product as I liked the all-in-one formulation and was inspired by others' comments about how it has successfully snatched their flora back from almost certain demise.  I haven't been disappointed.  I live in a shady area, but decided to try my hand at growing some potted herbs outdoors (basil, cilantro, catnip, catmint.)  Even with the limited amount of sun, the herbs are robust with the addition of this product.  True to other reviews, it also saved my droopy looking fuchsia which I thought I would lose.  In short, I'd definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Fantastic Fertilizer
review/text: Straight up love this fertilizer.  I use it every-other-day on my herbs, at either the prescribed "7 drops per quart" or half that, depending on how I feel my plants are doing.  Provides a perfect mix of nutrients for indoor plants.<br /><br />Every few weeks I like to spike my plants with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer, so you may want to pick up an small bottle of something else to complement Schultz.  The nitrogen-rich fertilizer will give your herbs a nice flush of leaves, but you don't want to do it too often or you'll have a lot of leaves with little flavor.

review/summary: Plant Saver
review/text: I have an umbrella tree at the office where I work. Though matter how much or little I watered it, the leaves would turn yellow and fall off. I gave it coffee grounds. I even transferred it to a larger pot with Miracle Grow soil. Nothing still. As a last resort, I bought this. I put a few drops of this into the water and not only did it stop dying, it actually has a lot of new growth. I'd recommend this product to anyone new to plants. This has the ideal ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium so it'll bring most houseplants back to life in no time.
