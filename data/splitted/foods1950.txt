review/summary: Taste of Europe in Your Kitchen
review/text: I've been lucky enough to travel to Europe several times. When I woke up at the hotel, I would always look for the oaty-nutty cereal at the breakfast table called muesli that goes great with yogurt. Turns out, I don't have to spend $$$ on airfare to get this tasty treat - I can order it through Amazon much cheaper and it tastes just as great. It's best to pour the milk on the muesli and let it rest for 5 to 15 minutes. The oats and nuts soften up and fill your taste buds with nutty goodness!

review/summary: Favorite cereal of all Time!
review/text: I have loved this muesli all my life but it can be hard to find and is a bit pricey.  Purchasing by the case on Amazon is a dream come true--easily available and a generous price break gives assurance that my favorite cereal will always be in stock in my pantry. This muesli is the standard by which all others are measured; perfect blend of grains, nuts, not too sweet with a creamy/chewy texture when softened with milk.  A scrumptious cereal that is extremely healthful--who could wish for more?

review/summary: Muesli Has All the Others Beat
review/text: Familia Original Swiss Muesli has no other muesli that measures up to Familia. Cereal is so good I eat one 32oz. box every 1 1/2 weeks.so I eat 6 boxes in ~ 8-9 weeks.I run out of them too quickly.I use a pretty large bowl & alternate my brunches with eggs so as not to use up muesli too fast.I thought muesli was German for mixture,gemischt,but muesli means puree especially when milk is added. With colder weather approaching next month,I warm milk up to eat a warmer cereal.Cereal is very versatile that way.Probably later in the Winter I'll go with the green-boxed no sugar 32 oz. boxes. I hope they're available for special no-charge handling.<br />[...]

review/summary: 33% price increase in spring 2011 (while store prices unchanged)
review/text: I had a subscription for regular deliveries, but the price went up by 33% (from $31.07 to $41.09 with subscription discount) in spring 2011. I'm told that commodity prices are rising everywhere, but I checked prices in two stores and they are unchanged. Amazon's previous prices ($5/box with subscription in Jan 2011) were cheaper than in stores, but now they are nearly $7/box compared to $8/box in stores, and having to buy in bulk quantities is not really worth it.<br /><br />The sugar free version is currently cheaper, but I am sure they'll increase the price soon.

review/text: I remember eating Muesli a long while ago and it was delicious.  I just couldn't afford the price.  Recently I splurged and bought a box.  Well, something has changed.  The contents were nothing like the picture and nothing like I remember.  Lot's of very fine sawdust like material overwhelm the rest of the contents.  I couldn't find even a residue of an apple.  Some oats, a couple of raisins and lots and lots of sawdust like ingredients. I will force myself to eat it since I paid over 7 dollars for the stuff but really they should refund my money.  I don't think I'll be eating this stuff again.  Don't waste your money.

review/text: After realizing that I was spending three or four dollars a day on coffee I decided to buy a coffee maker and to go along with it I purchased this coffee.  This coffee is fantastic for anyone who drinks coffee simply because it has a very good "coffee" flavor.  Anyone who argues that it's either too strong or too weak should adjust the amount of ground they're using because I've prepared coffee for several different people and all of them have agreed that the taste is absolutely fantastic.  I've tried several types of coffee from various retailers and of varies origins/costs and every time I find myself throwing out the other coffee and running back to Maxwell House because no other coffee can motivate me to get out of bed as well as this one can.

review/text: This review is supposed to be about the Maxwell Coffee I ordered, so I'll just say that I really like Maxwell House coffee, and it's one of the three brands I buy on a regular basis, and I love the reuse of their containers with the jim-dandy built in handle.  Very handy paint pails.  I purchased this coffee on the Subscribe and Save promotion, so I got it at a great price - quite a bit cheaper than at my local super market.  Now, on to the real review....<br /><br />I love the idea of Subscribe and Save, but it's been a bust for me.  This is the third time I've had to order a brand of coffee available under Subscribe and Save.  Both of the other times, before my subscription could be filled the second time, my memebership was cancelled due to the product not being available.  I hope this time works, or this program is a complete failure.  Why are you offering something you can't back up, Amazon?  This isn't the sort of customer service I'm used to from you.  To quote a not-so-famous but well known personality, "Get'er done!!"

review/text: I really do not like this coffee. It has a very strange smell. It seems like its made of low quality beans. I prefer Dunkin Donuts even though its a bit more expensive; about $20 per bag, but its much cheaper then actually going to Dunkin Donuts and getting coffee. I drank many different brands including Colombian beans which I grind myself. This is one of the worst I drank next to Folgers.

So, if you have a salmon lover in the house, give this a try.  The "Queen" loves it and since she's the "Queen," she knows everything, right?  It does have more protein than Friskies regular brand and since she was a rescue, it certainly has helped her regain her strength faster. Highly recommend!

review/summary: Tried and true, traditional wisdom for you
review/text: The cough suppressant in this product is from menthol (10 mg per cup), which adds a noticeable, cooling medicinal taste to this tea; yet, the taste of this tea is so spicy and aromatic that it isn't "medicinal"...like a cough drop.<br /><br />I've enjoyed this lots of times without cold symptoms.  The aroma is healing too, so it's a tea that you inhale the steam from and feel the clearing of nasal passage.  This formula for cough relief is genuinely "traditional" as the brand name says, and comes from a European (Swiss) recipe/manufactured in Germany, and has a fascinating history described on the box.  It's my opinion this tea is tasty without anything added.  Recommended.<br /><br />FYI on the other ingredients, making for the great taste, but ineffective to your cough: meadowsweet flower, wild thyme, licorice root, plantain leaf, Echinacea, elder flower, oil of peppermint.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I was reluctant to try this out, because I've had so many terrible jarred pasta sauces and no one had reviewed this product yet, but my fears were quickly put to rest.  This is the BEST jarred pasta sauce I've ever had.  Actually, it's probably the best pasta sauce I've ever had prepared by someone else, period.  Only a super-fresh homemade sauce, made with wonderful ingredients (San Marzano tomatoes, roasted onions and garlic, etc.) can compete.  Considering that such a sauce really takes hours to make, all told, I'm thrilled to use this instead.  This flavor in particular is an excellent base to use for other sauces - it won't overpower the other ingredients you add, but it has such a fantastic flavor it can easily be used on its own.  One of my favorite things to do is use a half-a-jar of this sauce over organic prepared ravioli - it's a super-quick, somewhat healthy meal that tastes amazing.  The heat from the freshly boiled ravioli is sufficient to warm up the sauce, so there's no need to even cook the sauce separately - you just pour it on and you're done!<br /><br />The jars are very nice, thick, reusable polypropylene (#5).  I use them to bring my lunch to work everyday - it's pretty surprising how nice they are - they are definitely not disposable junk.  There are some reports of an occasional jar arriving broken if this item is shipped via ground, which is honestly hard for me to imagine.  I use Amazon Prime, so mine arrive via two-day, and the packaging is always flawless.  To address this problem, Amazon had a "Pasta Lovers Gift Set" from this company with extra packaging, but it doesn't appear to show up in searches anymore.  It contained four flavors - Marinara, Arrabbiata, Tuscan Vodka, and Barely Bolognese, if I remember correctly.  All delicious - the Arrabbiata is fairly spicy, though.<br /><br />Anyway, buy this sauce!  The more people buy it, the more wonderful flavors Amazon will presumably carry.  One final note - this is a GREAT DEAL for these sauces.  If you don't believe me, take a look elsewhere on the web for this company's sauces - five bucks a jar is an absolute steal for an all-natural product of this top-notch quality.

I loved learning about this whole new world of cooking without meat, but tomato-based pasta sauces beyond marinara have been a challenge.  It is quite easy to become dependent on meat to provide flavor in Italian sauces and I haven't been able to really crack the secret to doing a hearty sauce without it. I've tried recipe after recipe and just can't seem to get something that really has a robust flavor.  Well, the Scarpetta people don't have my problem.  Tomato and arugula? I thought I might be crazy when I ordered it, but the reviews were so good and there was a promotion, so I thought, what the heck.  I'm glad I did.  Until I can figure out how to do something like this myself, this is the next best thing.<br /><br />No corn syrup, no preservative mumbo jumbo, but a better sauce and more strong, bold, bright and sweet tomato flavor than anything you're going to find in the jarred section of the grocery store.  I'm a big believer that the best Italian food is often the simplest approach, done well.  This sauce is a perfect argument for that philosophy.  Sincerely recommended.  If I had a gripe, it would be that we ate the whole jar in a night.  Could I get one of those gigantic plastic salsa bottles full of this, please?

review/summary: Scarpetta is betta
review/text: My husband and I love the Tomato and Arugula sauce.  I served it the other day with asparagus tips warmed  in the sauce, over Kashi Pilaf with a poached egg on top and a bit of Parmesan.  It is just the right consistency, with a mellow freshly made flavor, superior to the canned product. Even the container is nice and reusable.

review/summary: Taste awful!
review/text: After reading all of the positive reviews for this product, I decided to try it.  It looked delicious, nice packaging, but the taste and smell were really bad.  It had a bad tomato smell and taste, it just tasted old, not fresh as I expected.  The dates on the packaging were fine, not out of date, but the taste was a different story.  Now I am stuck with 3 more jars and afraid to eat it again. I also ordered the Bruschetta as well.  Haven't tried it yet, I'm a little hesitant to try since I don't want to be disappointed again and know that I wasted even more money.  Lesson learned, I won't buy anything from Amazon again without knowing more about the product or having tasted it before. I will stick with my favorite sauces from Patsy's (NY restaurant with same name).  They are sold in select grocery stores.  They are jarred sauce but taste amazing and fresh.

review/summary: Healthy Soda with Great Taste
review/text: *****<br />This Izze Sparkling Blackberry Soda isn't exactly a soda and isn't a really a juice---it's a healthy alternative drink that's a bit of a combination of the two. It contains a lovely medley of healthy juices without sweeteners except for the actual juice concentrate. For fizz and refreshment it includes 30% sparkling water.<br /><br />The juices it contains are: white grape juice, apple juice, blackberry juice, and lemon and raspberry juice concentrates. It also contains sparkling water, citric acid, natural flavor, red grape juice concentrate for color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), niacinimide, and pyridoxine hydrocholoride (vitamin B6). All of this together surprisingly tastes exactly like blackberries!<br /><br />Izze Blackberry is very sweet but light (not thick and syrupy). The adults in my household really like it and I think children would enjoy it too. There's really nothing not to like about this healthy juice or soda alternative beverage!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Another Flavor and another thumbs up!
review/text: This is the second flavor from Izze I have tried.  The first was the Clementine.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Blackberry.  Unlike the Clementine flavor the name of the drink also makes up one of the juices used to make the beverage, blackberry.  Like the Clementine a cocktail of juices from concentrate are added like Apple Juice and Lemon Juice to give a balanced flavor.<br /><br />At just over 8 oz. a can this is not a drink to hydrate in quantity so much as a tasty pick me up.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />I do find it funny that we seem to be turning into a Red Bull world.  When did little 8 oz. cans of beverages become so cool?  I always thought more was good.  With that being said 8.4 ounces is just right for this drink.<br /><br />90 calories for just over 8 ounces is starting to get up there for me.  That is enough calories that I at least have to think about when I drink the beverage.  A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book.  The only issue I had is the calories.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />This green tea is great for the price; Hyson is typically considered a lower quality tea except for the young variety. The leaves are small and nicely curled, and is a good representation of variety. It has a nice earthy/grassy flavor and is fuller bodied than many other green teas. It's great iced in the spring with a little True Lemon.<br /><br />As with all green teas, be careful not to "cook" the tea. If your water's too hot, it'll produce tea that's bitter and unpleasant. As I said, I cold brew so it's not an issue for me, but I think the recommended temperature for this tea is about 175-180 degrees for about 2-3 minutes.

review/summary: A Small Bottle of a Really Good Scotch
review/text: Johnnie Walker Black Label is a good solid Scotch for drinking all by itself.<br /><br />This blended Scotch with all Scotches over twelve years old, is an interesting character. All alone in a nice glass, the first flavor is a lot of smoke. After a little time in my mouth other flavors develop, pepper, vanilla, and a little bit of honey. Add a little bit of water to the Scotch and most of the smoky flavor goes away, and that aftertaste comes out - the vanilla, pepper, honey flavors. But then add an ice cube to just the Scotch and things change up over time. At first the smoke flavor is around. As the ice melts and water gets in the Scotch, the smoke goes away and the other flavors are left. Once the ice gets the Scotch cold, all that smoke comes back. It's fun to play the disappearing smoke game. I'm not sure I'd mix this Scotch - it takes plenty good enough on its own.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the smokier Scotches, Lagavulin, Scapa, Laphroaig, and others from Islay. I like Green Label a lot more than Black Label. Of all the Johnnie Walkers, I dislike Gold Label, and, of course, Blue Label is my favorite. One of the primary single malts used in Johnnie Walker blends is Cardhu.<br /><br />The Double Black is worth a try. Everything is just amped up a couple of levels.<br /><br />There is a strange Johnnie Walker Scotch that is worth trying - Swing. It's not in the smoky zone, but it is one very nice Scotch.<br /><br />Johnnie Walker Double Black Scotch Whisky 750 ml<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HQTEYU">Johnnie Walker Scotch Swing 750ML</a>

review/text: We have a German Shepard/ Akita mix with food allergies to just about everything.  This is the only food she can eat without a reaction.  Natural Balance now has a very similar limited ingredient, duck and sweet potato product, but for some reason, that one makes the dog's stomach run.  The biggest cons with this product is price and availability.  We have to order it online because there are no local retailers that carry this product, and having such an expensive dog food shipped only makes the price harder to handle.

review/text: I was kind of excited for this Pumpkin Spice MH International Coffee flavor since I'm a pretty big fan of the similarly flavored Starbucks holiday coffee flavor.  I tend to use the MHI Coffee powders as flavor enhancers in my daily brew, but for once I wasn't crazy about the flavor.  Actually, the first thing I really didn't care for was the "self-foaming" aspect to this one, almost as if it has some tiny pumpkin-flavored pop rocks in it or something.  Not needed and kind of weird to me.  Overall the taste is alright, though I feel it needs to be paired with a regular cup of coffee for optimal taste.  Just by itself with hot water it's kind of flat.

review/text: My family just loves the Maxwell House International Coffees and drink them several times every day. This was our first try of the latte versions.<br /><br />I got Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte mostly because I wanted something that seemed seasonal and pumpkin is a big fall season flavor in my family. I had never tried any of the lattes and thought I would give it a whirl.<br /><br />The Pumpkin Spice Latte is just as easy to make as the regular coffees. I make it different ways, trying it using water and again using milk. Either way you make it, it smells very delicious, very pumpkiny. However I do think it tastes a bit better when you use milk instead of water. I didn't get a lot of foam whichever way I made it. The Pumpkin Spice Latte tastes very good. I didn't think it was too spicy. It reminded me of my Mom's recipe for pumpkin pie.<br /><br />Overall, the Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice  Latte tastes very good and was a big hit at my home.

review/text: This is a Maxwell House International coffee. It will not have the deep, rich taste of a brewed espresso latte no matter what.  But if you want something quick to approximate a latte taste this works well in a pinch.  The first cup I made was per the instructions with water.  Not bad.  It had a 'milky' texture and a bit of foam to boot.  I added a dash of sugar and cinnamon to give a bit more flavor.  I decided to try it with milk.  This actually worked much better.  Deepened the flavor a bit and actually tasted closer to a steamed latte.

review/text: Since receiving the MHI Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte, I've used it only occasionally  because the taste is just not as good as Starbucks or Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf for all you West Coast folks.  I used with it first with water and then half and half, with the taste improving with the half and half, but still its not a top of the line product, and my taste buds are very sensitive.<br /><br />Anyway I will keep it short, buy this and stock it if you must or perhaps you do not care about Starbucks or the $$$ and even perhaps you cant tell the difference in taste between all the Latte offerings out there.  If you are into Starbucks or Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, you probably won't like this much.

Tends to stay mixed, with little need to re-stir later.<br />- It makes a nice foam at the top (you can hear something crackling when it first dissolves...kind of funny/intriguing...) ;-)<br />- The taste is great; I have made it with just water, and it it creamy enough for me.  Make it with milk for a really decadent, creamy latte.<br />- It also works well when I use 1/2 brewed coffee and 1/2 this (prepared w/water or milk) -- this mixture tends to kill the foam, but it doesn't affect the taste.  Sometimes I prefer it this way in the morning, both to make a less sweet drink and to extend the yummy pumpkin mix longer!  :-)<br />- You can add more powder to the drink after you decide it's too weak -- with some of these mixes, the newly added powder clumps up and is impossible to mix in...but that's not a problem with this product.  It's very forgiving!<br /><br />CONS: (very few)<br />- It takes some trial and error to get it to the right sweetness -- use a MEASURING teaspoon, not a regular spoon, at least until you get used to how much you'll need.  You don't want to accidentally add too much mix, especially if you're trying to make a specific amount for a travel mug or something.<br />- I seem to need to use a bit MORE than indicated on the directions to really get a nice latte (when I made it with WATER, that is) -- made with milk you can use less mix.<br />- Lots of sugar...but of course, I see this as a treat, so that's not a big concern for me.<br /><br />OVERALL:  I WOULD recommend this to a friend.<br /><br />It has a really lovely blend of flavors -- they got it RIGHT.  Not too strong a pumpkin flavor, not too much spice...just a very nice combination.  And the foam on the top is a nice touch, and doesn't taste fake or weird.<br /><br />I appreciate that it STAYS MIXED, too, as that used to be my pet peeve with these types of instant flavored coffee drinks in the past (you had to "celebrate the moments of your life" while stirring constantly/furiously).  ;-)<br /><br />Now I just wish they also made this in decaf for the evenings...  :-)

Yo, I thought this stuff was going to be off the hook because it has Maxwell in the name like that dude from Get Smart, and that was a pretty cool show. But when I tried out this stuff, it was just pumpkin dust. How is this supposed to get me through my day? I tried pouring milk in the container and eating it like that, but it just tasted like how Michael Moore looks.<br /><br />If you love pumpkins, you should check out the rare shake at Jack in the Box.

review/summary: Great for a cold and stormy day!
review/text: Personally, I have always like the International Coffees. I did stay away from the spiced ones, as they seemed not as smooth and a bit overpowering on the spices. I didn't find that problem with the Pumpkin Spice Latte. It seems to have the right blend and balance of spices to the rest of the ingredients. Nothing came across as overpowering. The froth that develops on top of the beverage has an added bonus... As soon as you add the mix to the liquid, put it close to your ear and you can hear it crackle. :)<br /><br />Pumpkin Spice makes a wonderful and relaxing drink - perfect for that cold autumn or winter night when you want to snuggle under a blanket and read or watch TV. Every time I make a cup it puts me in a holiday mood - the spices smell so much like Thanksgiving and Christmas.<br /><br />If you like the hot holiday beverages at places like Dunkin' Donuts, you should like Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte.

review/summary: Perfect for a cold wet morning
review/text: In Tucson where I happily make my abode, away from cold wet mornings, one doesn't often neeed the succor of a hot chocolate or spiced coffee but this last week we have had a cold spell rip through the Southwest that had made temperatures in Chicago warmer than those in Arizona so I decided this would be the perfect time to warm my hands and my heart's cockles with Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte. The first time the water was not quite hot enough but I still loved the foaming broth, the second attempt I added a touch of honey but this morning, this morning I added a spoon full of brown sugar and I feel like I'm drinking a pumpkin pie. Intense flavors, warm belly and I'm ready to head off to work! I'll buy this for myself often in the fall weather of Arizona.

review/summary: Good, but needs more pumpkin...
review/text: Things I like:<br />Pumpkin.  Just in general.  I would eat it with a goat, I would eat it on a boat.<br />Maxwell House International Coffee... like... all of them.<br />The Lattes in particular.<br /><br />That said, I can't seem to rate this one more than 4 stars.  It's *good*, mind you, it's just something of a disappointment in the pumpkin department.  What you will get is a nicely flavored coffee drink with a nice foam to it, but I found myself having to somewhat imagine the pumpkin flavoring.  So, was it good?  Yes.  Would I order more?  Mmmm.  Probably not.  I like the other Maxwell House International flavors better.  (Try the mocha latte!)  If you can't take my word for it, try to find this flavor sold individually somewhere before you order a pack of 4.<br /><br />P.S.<br />One tip, and this goes for every Maxwell House International flavor I have tried -- they say you can make it with milk or water.  Try 50% milk and 50% water.  I find all water is too...watery while all milk just makes it too rich.  Half milk and half water always seems to turn out just right.

review/summary: Change of directions, maybe?
review/text: The Pumpkin spice Latte is another seasonal release for Maxwell House and much like all the other flavors it is very week in flavor.  For me personally I always need to add more powder to get any taste from these, if I follow the direction I get a watered down drink.  And who drinks 6 ounces of anything these days?  Once I adjust to my taste it has a pleasing taste much like a mildly spiced pumpkin pie with whipped cream.  The creaminess comes from the foam created when you combine the water and powder.  However it does take a ton of mixing to get it to finally combine.  The amount of powder you need to get any taste is not worth the price you pay.

review/text: In this time of financial crisis, having a latte is almost a luxury, but I love the drink, so Maxwell House came to the rescue. I love the taste, the aroma, and the flexibility to mix my own coffee latte any time of the day. It adds a new excitement to the coffee break in the office, and it satisfies without having to walk out to the coffee shop, and spend nearly the price of the whole can in a single cup. I add half teaspoon of instant coffee in the mornings to increase the coffee taste, but during the rest of the day I drink it as it is. It takes great even with only boil water. I also tried it with milk and adding some cocoa too. The mixing possibilities are exciting, and of course, every new one is an excuse to have another cup. I highly recommend it.

review/text: Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte has a nice pumpkin spice flavor.  I'm not normally a fan of pumpkin spice unless it's in a pumpkin pie but the coffee has a nice sweet flavor that is not too strong.  The only setback is a kind of gritty texture in the coffee which I associate with very fine coffee grounds.  I am reasonably sure that it is not coffee grounds but the pumpkin spice because of the flavor I discern from the grit.<br />It's not my thing but I'm sure that it is for some people.<br />I give this item 3 stars because of the nice flavor but the gritty texture.

It is very good when made with milk but suffers when made with water. So make it with milk it tastes great. However, the only other negative thing I have to say about it is that the container it came in tends to leak when tilted. I'm not sure if this was just because it was a trial container or if they all do this. I can definitely recommend it to anyone who likes coffee.

review/summary: Pumpkin spice and everything nice
review/text: Maxwell House's International Coffee brand provides the alternative to instant coffee.  With a wide variety of choices to choose, especially during the holidays when coffee drinkers seek out that holiday flare to their regular cup of coffee, choices range from peppermint mocha to pumpkin spice.  Depending on one's taste, when the weather becomes cooler and the leaves begin to turn orange and brown, a cup of pumpkin spice latte sounds like a good compliment to any Thanksgiving dessert of pies and cakes.<br /><br />Pumpkin spice latte has a flavor of cinnamon and pumpkin that one can drink as a hot cup of coffee or to add little kick to a regular cup of non-flavored coffee.  But however one prefers to drink their coffee, Maxwell House's International brand is a sophisticated choice for the casual or light coffee lover.

review/summary: Good, but not good enough
review/text: A good latte but probably not good enough for the dedicated latte lovers...<br /><br />Maxwell House and the ubiquitous tins of blended, flavored coffees have been around for what seems like forever.  This is not a bad thing.  They are generally dependable, convenient and very, very sweet.  I have long been addicted to french vanilla flavored coffees and Maxwell house excels in this flavor. At first I was somewhat leery about pumpkin spice flavor, probably because a few days before I had a Peet's pumpkin spice coffee that was overpoweringly strong.  However, since I control the mix, I control the flavor. Definitely I see this drink as a seasonal item (I have visions of frost on the pumpkin as I drink it) but it is quite tasty in an artificial way; the cinnamon flavor is much stronger than the coffee flavor.  Following instructions the first time (4 teaspoonfuls of coffee) the coffee had a nice frothy appearance and definitely satisfied the sweet tooth.  In fact, the next time I added only three teaspoonfuls and the flavor was still adequate. The manufacturer mentioned making it with milk and I suspect this would give it a richer taste, but to me the addition is unnecessary.  For the frugal amongst us, I occasionally use this mix as a sweetener for my regular coffee and even this makes an unusual autumn blend.<br /><br />I am having a cup of the product and it definitely takes some of the chill out of a frosty morning.  Now the bad thing -- it has 2 grams of saturated fat!  For this and the excessive sugar many of us should not make this a regular part of our diet.

review/summary: Where's the Pumpkin?
review/text: Having bought a pumpkin spice latte at A-Plus a few weeks back, I quickly developed an obsession for the drink. So when I saw this product, I thought it would be a great, convenient, and more affordable alternative. (At Amazon's current price, I could get almost three cups for the price of one at the convenience store and save myself the gas.) Unfortunately, it proved a weak substitute for the real deal. While there are hints of pumpkin pie-esque nutmeg and clove in the flavor, this just isn't that much different from regular latte or cappuccino for me to care. And the pumpkin, if it's there at all, was undetectable to my taste buds. I tried this mix in both water and milk to give it a fair shake and it blends to a nice foamy top in both. Not an awful product by any means, but did not meet my, admittedly already well-formed by the competition, expectations.

review/summary: I'll stick to my local coffee shop
review/text: I didn't start drinking coffee until a few years ago.  I started with the International Coffees, then switched to flavored brew coffees, and now usually drink plain brewed coffee with flavored non-dairy creamer.  To save calories and all the artificial ingredients, I really wish I could drink plain black coffee, but I just don't like it.  When I saw this product available through the Vine program, I thought I would give it a try.  It's okay, but nothing great.  It's sweet and has a slightly spicy flavor, but really no coffee flavor to speak of.  It's certainly not the quality of a latte drink you would get at a coffee shop.  On the plus side, it is super easy to make plus costs much less than a latte drink from a coffee shop.  The product does not contain much actual coffee, so it certainly won't give the morning pick-me-up that I have come to expect from my morning coffee.  So I think I will stick with my usual brewed coffee with flavored non-dairy creamer in the mornings and the occasional latte or similar drink at the local coffee shop.

review/text: The taste of this is very weak with little actual coffee taste.  I put in some instant coffee crystals and it definitely improved the taste.  The foam is nice, the best foam I've ever seen in an instant drink.  The pumpkin spice flavor is good, too.  Without the added instant coffee it tastes like a frothy milk-only drink and it's too rich for me to finish a cup (made with water; I can't imagine how rich it would be with milk).  Between the rich taste and the calories at about 180 per cup, it's not something you'd want every day.

review/text: If you are looking for a cuppa with a bit of spice in it this is good.  I've had several different flavors of this brand and think this one is right up at the top of my list but anything pumpkin is at this point.  It works out nicely when you can't get out to the coffee shop to get a fresh cuppa pumpkin spice and it's great on those rainy cool evenings when you just need something warm and the taste of the Autumn Season.  I did however find that I needed to use a bit more than called for so it wouldn't be weak.  I think I used an extra teaspoon.<br /><br />Another way to really enjoy this is to put two teaspoons into a cup of hot cocoa.  Yumm!  I think this is my favorite way of drinking this so far.  I also use a bit of fresh creamer just for more body.  Overall, I like it!  An inexpensive product with good flavor and ease of use for those lazy cold days to come.

review/summary: Very good for instant coffee
review/text: One of my favorite things about fall is the return of pumpkin spice latt&eacute; at the coffee houses, so I thought I would give this instant version a try. I have purchased other flavors of this line before - my opinion is that if it's a heavily flavored coffee (chocolate, mint, etc.), you can add more of the powder to make it richer and therefore palatable. It's good on a cold night. This flavor does not disappoint. Like the other flavors, this one is not awesome, but it's good. And it's convenient. The directions on the can suggest adding milk instead of water for a richer latt&eacute;. I tried it both ways, and I agree that it's better with the milk. I actually think half milk and half water is just right. It's not as good as what you'll get at the major coffee houses, but it's really good for instant coffee. If you're a true coffee connoisseur, you won't like this coffee, but then, you wouldn't be buying instant coffee anyway.

review/text: The timing of this coffee couldn't be better:  I have been on a pumpkin craze!  I love pumpkin, and I find myself craving it constantly in the fall, so I was thrilled for the opportunity try Pumpkin Spice Latte.<br /><br />Similar to the other latte-style coffees by this brand, when you blend the powdered coffee mix with boiling water, it develops a bit of a foam, mimicking coffeeshop-style coffees.  The coffee has a pleasant scent that is both pumpkin-y and spicy.  The taste is quite good--it definitely has a nice pumpkin flavor, but being the pumpkin lover that I am, I would have preferred an even stronger pumpkin effect.  In addition, there is not much of a coffee flavor to this latte, so I missed that a bit.<br /><br />In the end, although I wouldn't exactly consider this a coffee drink, it's a nice little specialty drink--I think of it more as the fall version of hot chocolate.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Warm cup of autumn...instantly
review/text: I don't normally drink instant coffee, but I thought I would try this because sometimes I just don't feel like brewing a pot of coffee or messing with the espresso machine.  This is definitely nice and easy.  I just fill a coffee cup with steaming hot-from-the-faucet water and put it in the microwave on HI power for an extra minute to get it nice and toasty.  Then I add 4 heaping spoonfuls of the Pumpkin Spice Latte.  As soon as the coffee granules hit the hot water, it makes this sizzling noise almost like a drop of cold water hitting a sizzling hot frying pan, just not that severe.  I find myself looking forward to that sizzling noise it makes.<br /><br />Despite adding 4 heaping spoonfuls, I feel like the coffee is still very watery.  I know I can add more of the mix in, but I also don't want to add too many empty calories so I deal with the watered down flavor.  I knew I was just getting instant latte and wasn't expecting a strong espresso.  The flavor of the pumpkin spice is good, but I wish it were spicier.<br /><br />The latte looks really pretty in a glass mug (I'm posting a picture above for reference) and nice and foamy at the top, just like a coffee house latte with steamed milk would look like.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoy fixing this for myself when I'm cold and want a little pick-me-up.  I do not drink this for the full coffee experience and would recommend anyone trying this latte to have the same mindset going in.

review/summary: Versatile beverage mix
review/text: If you're looking for a coffee flavored drink, you'll want to look elsewhere (unless you follow direction #3 below).  As with all of the "cafe-style beverage" mixes, this pumpkin spice latte mix is mostly sugar and non-dairy creamer.  But, in order to give a well-rounded review I tried this product in a number of different ways to see how it would taste:<br /><br />1--as a hot drink prepared according to the directions:  When mixed as directed I found the flavor to be a bit weak and was disappointed.  It was sweet and frothy, slightly cinnamon-y with another flavor which must have been a combination of ginger and pumpkin.  OK, but not great. You need to double up on the mix to get a good flavor (but that also doubles the calories)<br /><br />2--as a warm drink prepared with milk:  This is a nice alternative to hot chocolate mixes, tasting a bit more grown-up than cocoa.  The milk seemed to take the edge off the sweetness.  Much better taste than prepared with water.<br /><br />3--as a powdered creamer in my regular (hot) coffee:  Here is the coffee-drink flavor I was looking for and this is how I plan to consume most of the remainder of the carton.

review/summary: Fairly tasty...not as "pumpkin-y" as I was hoping
review/text: I love this time of year...pumpkin spice everything!<br /><br />So I really had high hopes for this!<br /><br />And...it's very tasty.  Smooth, creamy (like a lot of the Maxwell House International Coffee mixes frankly) and you can really taste the cinnamon and hints of nutmeg and other spices.  But...there might be a kiss of pumpkin flavor but it's not strong (say as in a pumpkin latte from Tully's or Starbucks).  I was a little disappointed by that.<br /><br />It's also fairly sweet on its own...there was a touch of bitter aftertaste though so I've been adding half a pack of splenda to a thermos of this and it solves the problem.  But if you don't like sweet at all, too bad...it's light but the pre-sweetness is there.<br /><br />That said, I really do like it.  I just wish it was more like the "pumpkin pie in a cup" another reviewer claimed that made me really hope for just that.

review/summary: ...make some fond Holiday Memories! :)
review/text: Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte<br /><br />Don't ya just love Autumn, and all the little extras that make it special? :)<br /><br />Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte, mixed with boiling water, dissolves quickly -- and, magically (if I dare use the word) produces that nice frothy layer on top of the latte.<br /><br />A very pleasant (not too strong, not too sweet) pumpkin spice aroma and taste, that will have you going for another cup -- oh, and don't forget the seasonal cookies or pumpkin bread. :  I like my Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte a tad stronger than the directions, so add an additional tablespoon of the mixture. This just may be another way fond Holiday Memories are made!  Highly Recommended! --Katharena Eiermann, 2011

review/summary: Too Much Spice, Not Enough Pumpkin
review/text: I, personally, am not a big pumpkin spice person.  I like pumpkin pie, ice cream, etc. but the pumpkin and spice coffee somehow just doesn't do it for me.  During the Fall I usually get one or at the most two pumpkin related drinks, then I'm done until next season.  I mostly got this because my girlfriend loves pumpkin spice flavored coffees from places like Starbucks.  I tried it and thought the flavor was a little weird tasting, not bad necessarily - but strange none the less.  I couldn't finish my cup.  My girlfriend said she thought the mixture was way too heavy on the spice side and very little pumpkin flavoring.  Although she finished her cup, she said she wouldn't want to drink anymore.  There must be a big difference in this and the coffee house drinks, since my girlfriends still drinks those all of the time.  Somehow I either got a bad mixture or these are just being made with too much spice.  Personally I'd say it's worth trying, but if you are looking for a premium pumpkin coffee alternative - look elsewhere.

review/text: This coffee is DELICIOSO!  There is a wonderful froth on the top that is extremely creamy.  This coffee tastes like a pumpkin latte from Starbucks except it costs so much less!  There is just enough spice to it but it is not overwhelming.  The pumpkin flavoring is just delectable.  I cannot say enough good things about this coffee.  I have been making a cup each night and I am in heaven!  I would definitely recommend you trying this coffee because it is so good!

review/summary: Pleasant and Mild
review/text: The Pumpkin Spice latte mix from Maxwell House is very mild. But this is one of the things I liked about it. There is a stronger cinnamon and nutmeg flavor than pumpkin.  I love that there isn't a strong coffee taste. I don't love the aftertaste at all, but then I dislike the aftertaste  from all milk and coffee flavored foods/beverages.<br /><br />If you like mild flavored lattes (if you use less mix that directions typically state) then you will probably enjoy this latte mix. And if you feel like you need a stronger coffee flavor, you might consider adding your latte mix to a cup of hot coffee rather than milk or plain water :)

review/summary: Tastes good ... but not much coffee...
review/text: Many years ago, as a teenager, I LOVED these "international coffee" blends, expecially the "suisse mocha" flavor - it was my entree into the world of coffee.  This was long before Starbucks.  I haven't had it in ages but I'm a sucker for anything pumpkin so I decided to try this. Honestly, I liked it better than Starbucks "pumpkin spice latte."  It is tasty and soothing.<br /><br />HOWEVER - don't kid yourself that you are drinking "coffee" - instant coffee ranks a distant 3rd (or 4th?) after sugar and nondairy creamer.<br /><br />Also - the new "lock in fresh" packaging is a bit of a fiasco. I capped the container tightly but I'm still finding powder on the outside of the container, and the counter. Preferred older packaging.

review/summary: Kind of oddly flavored, overpriced for size and weak flavor.
review/text: These International coffees by Maxwell House are, in my opinion, expensive. Three dollars(ish) for a can is not too bad, until you realize you need heaping tablespoons to make a decently flavored mug of coffee. If you have big mugs like I do, you have to add even more. Thus, whenever I splurge and get a can (usually a cinnamon flavor or vanilla) I end up adding a tablespoon to my normal, already prepared cup of coffee.<br /><br />This flavor in particular, I was hoping for something better. I love (LOVE!) the Pumpkin Pie flavor cappucinos at 7-11 and really hoped this would be something like it. It wasn't. It's got a bit of spice to it (thus being called Pumpkin Spice) and nothing much else..like pumpkin or vanilla. I realize it was perfectly named, because it really tastes like you put a small, small dash of cinnamon in your coffee and maybe some clove. Very little. Even after following the directions on the can, it just tasted lacking. Also, it has a weird flavor and texture as coffee, which I can't quite explain. Not good either. As for coffee flavor itself, I would say it had very little.<br /><br />The froth was pretty good, nothing like the picture on the can but it was there.<br /><br />Overall I'd give this maybe 2 stars just because it does make your coffee smell and taste like something for Autumn, but overall you need to use too much of this small can to get the flavor the manufacturer probably intended, and that's not too great to begin with.

review/text: I've always been a fan of the International Flavored Coffees and am glad there was a new flavor.  I've tried the coffee twice and felt it had a nice pumpkin flavor and enjoyed it very much.  I would probably buy another.  I'm really glad the company is branching out to other flavors and spiffing up the product a bit.

review/text: Perfect beverage for the chilly holiday season! The aroma is wonderful, it fills up your nose and just makes you think of fall and Halloween and Thanksgiving. It's a fantastic smell and the taste is delicious. It can be a bit weak (so -1 star) if you don't use enough powder or if you make it with water but if you use milk or add regular coffee mate creamer to the water mixture then it thickens it and fills out the flavor. Delicious.

review/summary: If you like sugar and water...
review/text: I really really wanted to love this product. Both my wife and I are fans of pumpkin spice coffee, and we hoped this product would give Starbucks a run for its money. However, all you really get is sugar flavored water. We used 4 teaspoons as suggested and it was too thin and too sweet, so we cut back to 3 and it was just sugary water. We went to five and all that happened is that it got sweeter. Yes, it has a slight pumpkin flavor, but for the most part it doesn't measure up.

review/text: This latte tastes more "spice" than "pumpkin" to me, and could have been better with extra pumpkin flavor and a bit more coffee. But there's nothing like sipping a hot latte with a blanket and good book on a cold day. Consider adding a little instant coffee to create a pretty good drink.

review/summary: Odd aftertaste
review/text: Apparently, pumpkin is a difficult flavor to replicate.  While the appearance and texture of Maxwell House International Coffee Pumpkin Spice Latte is lovely--a nice white froth at the top, a nice comforting weight to the liquid--it has a slightly soapy aftertaste.  It's still good, but the aftertaste is a little weird.<br /><br />It's necessary to use four spoonfuls of the mix for a coffee mug, which makes this a slightly expensive treat, but it's a grand mid-afternoon pick-me-up that doesn't seem to contain much caffeine.  I appreciate that the International Coffees don't have an instant coffee flavor.  My favorites are still the original Cafe au Lait and Cafe Vienna, but Pumpkin Spice is all right for a change of pace.

review/summary: Pretty good flavor
review/text: First off, I am not much for coffee flavored coffee and so I drink what I like to call candy coffee. I enjoy making coffee really sweet.<br /><br />This has a nice even pumpkin and cinnamon flavor to it and still has a bit of a coffee taste for those who don't like it too sweet. I added some hazelnut creamer to it and it was perfect for me. The only problem I have with these coffees is the fact that it takes forever to stir the poweder in the liquid and so I have those floating islands constantly bouncing around.

review/text: Let me start by saying I'm not a coffee drinker. I strongly prefer tea, but I thought I would give this a shot. I was incredibly impressed! I don't usually like the taste of coffees, but I thought this was delightful..very spicy with a hint of cinnamon. It was very easy to make and VERY frothy! I had a few other family members try it, and they were impressed as well. My sister (also not a coffee drinker) told me she wanted another one. My dad (who usually doesn't like sweet coffees) admitted it was pretty good. I can't imagine anyone not liking this! I will definitely be looking for more products like this in the future.

review/summary: Yummy spiced drink - sort of a cross between white chocolate and coffee though
review/text: I've tried a lot of the International Coffee drinks - I don't drink them daily, just as an alternative to hot chocolate once in a while.  This is probably one of the better ones I've had lately, but only because it doesn't have an acidic bite to it that comes the coffee blend they use.  That also means that there's not a lot of coffee taste in this.  Rather than a flavored coffee latte, this is more like a spiced white hot chocolate with a little coffee infusion.  I had to really search for the pumpkin taste - while it smells faintly of pumpkin pie, it doesn't really taste strongly of it.  I got it more in the aftertaste.<br /><br />The powder dissolved really well into the boiling water - definitely has to be boiling - and I got a nice, long-lasting foam on top.  I have a big cappuccino mug that I use in the morning and it took 5 heaping teaspoons to make a perfectly flavored cup.  It does taste richer if you use milk (I used skim), but it also makes it seem sweeter to me - a little too much to deal with in the morning for me.<br /><br />Even though this really wasn't a spiced "coffee" in my opinion and there wasn't a huge amount of pumpkin taste, I did enjoy this for what it was and it's one of the better International Coffee drinks.  It's not overly sweet if you don't use milk, but you can adjust the creaminess if you do use it.

review/summary: Tasty, but not very coffee-y
review/text: I skipped trying this with the water recipe; other reviews already said it was better with milk (and I suspected as much). I made it with lactose-free milk (I can't tolerate it) and it was delicious! It has some instant coffee for flavor, but not enough. Just now, I tried adding it straight into my coffee, and it is also tasty. I would imagine the best way to prepare this is to make it with hot milk and add shots of espresso (assuming you have a machine). It is not too many calories, and just sweet enough without being sugary (which is the problem with drinks from places like Starbucks-way too much sugar!)<br />I don't know if I would pay $8 for this, but then again it has ~17 servings, and one can really only get 1-2 drinks at a coffee shop for that price.

review/text: I really enjoy this product. While not exactly redolent of pumpkin spice, it does have a wonderful aroma and a very pleasant, rich and creamy taste that surprised me. As a latte, it has a luscious foamy top that makes it taste almost sinfully good.<br /><br />As I am currently watching my weight, I enjoy having a cup every afternoon. It tastes almost decadent, but at 90 calories, it is anything but. It is simply a great taste treat for even the calorie conscious.

review/summary: Great seasonal flavor as a change of pace from your standard morning cup of joe
review/text: There's always room in the cabinet for yet another flavor of coffee to help get you going in the morning, and this one's great to help get into the holiday mood to boot.  Normally instant coffee isn't my thing, but the "Pumpkin Spice Latte" flavor is surprisingly good. It's definitely better with milk than water, and has a very rich and creamy feel.  As a change of pace from standard coffee with flavored creamer this is definitely recommended for anyone who likes pumpkin or nutmeg flavors.<br /><br />One pitfall to be aware of is that this type of instant coffee is prone to clumping badly, so be sure to add the milk to the coffee and not the other way around or you'll end up with big clumps floating around on the top.<br /><br />Obviously flavored instant coffee meant to imitate a latte isn't health food, but it's worth noting there is a decent amount of sugar in each serving, and weirdly even a fairly high amount of saturated fat.  I wouldn't recommend having a couple of cups of a day, but it's not terrible for you as an occasional treat to replace your standard morning cup of joe.
