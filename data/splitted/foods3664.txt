review/summary: Very tasty and very filling
review/text: These bars strike the perfect balance between healthy and filling. They're also both crunchy and soft. A lot of bars don't fill me up, and leave me hungry afterwards, so this one is nice that it's 200 calories and filling. I love bars, but I'm different than most people because I just get them for how good they taste, and how they make me feel. So, these were perfect for me.<br /><br />I only realized after I'd eaten most of them that they're vegan. So, this didn't impact the taste or the experience at all for me like a lot of vegan stuff does for me. I loved them, and they were a perfect breakfast for me that made me feel great all day.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Healthy<br />+Filling<br />+Crunchy<br />+Soft<br />+Tasty<br />+Contains raisins and peanuts<br />+Vegan and vegetarian<br /><br />Cons:<br />-So gooey that the wrapper is left with a bunch of goo

review/summary: Like Payday Candy Bars, Only a Little Better
review/text: The Pure Natural Peanut Raisin Crunch bars are delicious. They are much chewier than I expected (luckily, they don't hurt teeth--and I have sensitive teeth. These were awesome in that aspect). I expected something similar to Nature Valley. These, however, taste like candy bars--specifically, Paydays.<br /><br />The calorie count is fairly high for a granola bar--200 per bar. However, they are packed with protein, absolutely packed, and all things considered, the sugar levels are very decent. It provides a rush of energy, but it's the good kind--it lingers, lets you down slowly, and doesn't lead to a crash.<br /><br />Overall, these are very delicious, and a great alternative to other bars. The only thing I didn't like was that they were smaller than I expected. That's such a small thing, though. These bars taste great, and they are highly recommended.

review/summary: Tasty vegan pick-me-up bars
review/text: True, these bars are quite sweet. But it's really nice to find a snack bar that is explicitly vegan (not to mention certified organic, gluten-free, and kosher), made by a company dedicated to promoting healthy living. And you can see the ingredients you're eating! I think the bars may be a little on the sweet side for just snacking, but as a cyclist, I've found them to be give me a perfect boost of energy on long rides. If you're expending a lot of energy and burning a lot of calories, they really hit the spot. And you really can't go wrong with 7 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber.

review/summary: Really Wanted to Like These
review/text: I am always on the lookout for great snacks that I can grab and throw in a bag.  Reading the description on these I was pretty sure that I was going to love them.  I was very dissapointed.  The bar itself is extremely dense and the peanut flavor is overwhelming.  It says there are plump raisins but I could barely find any.  I gave it two starts becasue of the protein level and low amount of sugar.  There is a blurb on the package about the story creation of these bars from the founder, who says that she created these with her daughter.  I can't see kids eating these bars at all. These bars are for you if you like dense granola bars with a strong peanut taste.

Maybe my sweet tooth is getting in the way, but delicious is not a word that I would use to describe the product.<br /><br />Please dont get me wrong. These bars don't taste bad.

review/text: Not 100% Organic, which is a shame. But it has a great texture. Its awefully sticky, but I like that. As do 2 out of 3 people that I sampled. 7g of protein which is pretty good and 5g of fiber. Great for a mid afternoon pick me up or those on the way to the gym. Because its a softer texture and raisins and perhaps the myriad of syrups, its awefully moist and doesnt need to be washed down with water like other 'trail mix' type bars. Its also gluetin free for those people who need to worry about that. The raisin really did seem particularly fresh. Not too much in the vitamin and mineral dept unfortunately. The sticky texture got a little much, for my tastes and the bar was a little small, but all in all highly recommended! Enjoy!

review/summary: Salty and delicious!
review/text: My box of Pure Natural Bars came on one of the hottest days of the year. I was going to refrigerate them before chowing but I couldn't resist. I tore open the package to the warm smell of peanuts, I mean it was heavenly!  In a way, I was hoping that it wasn't going to be too sweet. For as hot as it was, the bar was intact and not gooey and was packed with peanuts. It was easy to bite into and didn't stick to my teeth but the taste of salt was definitely predominate; to the point that I needed a glass of water afterwards. Now, I have to emphasize it only lists 230mg of Sodium but I think the contrast to the sweet made it seem like more. I offered a bar to a friend who loved that it was gluten free and organic (as did I ) and the first thing she said was, "Wow...SALT"  We both love salty foods and I think the surprise is that it comes in a bar that is historically sweet, so our expectations may have been the problem (if you can even call it a problem).  After a while it occurred to me how important the sodium is to my retention of water during these extraordinary hot days, especially on my daily workouts. I'm giving these guys a 5 start review  because I would definitely have this bar again, not only because it is nutritionally sound, it tastes delicious, and it did fill a hunger and gave me that full feeling for a long time (and the fact that endured the heat that it did makes it truly portable). 200 Calories, 18 Carbs, 5 Fiber, 9 Sugars and 7g protein.  Not a bad line up for lunch.

review/summary: Sweet and Salty Goodness! Not just for Vegans!
review/text: Right up front, let me say I'm not a vegan. Unsuccessfully, I have attempted being a vegetarian and eating only natural foods, avoiding processed foods, etc.<br /><br />The thing that has always kept me from being successful is the fact that, for me, the taste of the food is "off" when compared to non-vegan (vegetarian) foods. Not so with this product.<br /><br />The PURE Naturals Peanut Raisin Crunch Bar is really quite good! My immediate thought was that I was eating a Payday candy bar, so distinct is the peanut taste. It's sufficiently salty with the undertone of sweetness from the raisins and the molasses without the overt sweetness associated with "nougat" in the Payday bars. In short, these are a really nice healthy alternative to a peanut-centered candy bar.<br /><br />Would I buy these in the open market? Yes, I would. I've reached sufficient age that I need to be conscious of my diet. Additionally, the sugars in this are natural and better for me as a diabetic. There's 7 grams of protein which makes it great for staving your appetite for a bit. The 12 grams of fat is not "bad" fat and the sodium content (230g) is significantly less than is typically found in regular candy bars or a can of soup.<br /><br />Try these! You'll like them.

This WAS very good and by far the best out of most similar bars. The retail price isnt too bad and they dont try to use trendy marketing ploys to get you as a customer.

review/summary: Tasty but not crunchy
review/text: These are supposed to be a "crunchy" bar, according to the package, but the nuts are the only crunchy thing about them - otherwise they're sticky, chewy bars!  Which doesn't mean they don't taste good - they do - but they stuck to my dental work something awful.  Before I knew that, I gave one to my Mom to try also - she wears dentures and couldn't even begin to eat one of these bars.<br /><br />That being said, the ingredients listing was pretty decent, not any "weird" ingredients or preservatives.  A little high in sugar content for my low-carb eating style, but enough protein to offset some of that.  They're really just a higher-protein candy bar, without high fructose corn syrup and no transfats either.<br /><br />For a quick, stick-it-in-my-purse type snack in case I get caught out and about with no other choices, these would definitely hold me over til I found something more suitable.

review/summary: Nothing to set them apart, but good
review/text: I've tried a lot of good food or snack bars, and this certainly is not bad by any means.  But there just isn't anything to set it apart.  We've got some other brands in the cupboard, and these are going slower than the others.  I'm also not sure the salt is evenly distributed throughout the bar.  Occasionally as I chew, saltiness is more evident than at other times.  Finally, they're labeled gluten free, though the label also says they're manufactured in a facility that also processes wheat.  So if a potential buyer has celiac disease or is exceptionally gluten intolerant, use caution.  I'd like to think that they've had the bars independently tested for gluten, since the listing of being processed in a facility that also processes wheat products could suggest cross-contamination.  However, that may just a legal requirement - not sure.<br /><br />Since it's been a few days since I had the last one, I went out and got one that I'm eating while I'm reviewing it.  It is nice and chewy, and would need to be thoroughly chewed due to the fairly large pieces of peanut in it, though that's certainly not a negative.  These aren't supposed to be "fast food."  Bottom line would seem to be, if you're looking to try another kind of bar for variety, this is certainly worth a trial, though I think I'd buy a single bar in a health food store if possible, before committing to a case.  Rating: HIGH 3-stars.

review/summary: Tasty Energy Bar
review/text: These bars actually lived up to their billing -- a nice mixture of salt and sweet owing to the prominence of salted peanuts and raisins, which happen to be the two primary ingredients in the bar.  Comparing the Pure bar to the Clif bar (my usual standby), the Pure bar is half the size, has as almost as many calories, and has more sodium and potassium (good when you are sweating a lot).  I'm not sure that the Pure bar will replace my Clif bars as most of the Pure bars calories come from fat where as most of the Clif's come from carbohydrates (which are more easily converted to energy by the body during a workout).  As far as a between meals snack, though, you can't lose with the Pure bars as they are quite tasty and packed with quality ingredients.

The bars are moderately chewy, and one bar does a very good job of quelling a hunger pang. As I said, everyone tried one, and five out of five people enjoyed these.

They are actually pretty sticky and gooey, so not something to toss to the kids in the car unless you have some wet wipes handy.  As far as snack alternatives go, Pure Natural Bars are certainly better than chips or cookies if your kids will eat them.  (Mind didn't care for them!)

review/text: One of the problems with bad copy is that it sticks with you longer than good copy.  I'm talking about the description of this bar, which pretty much annoyed me the entire time.  I had to wonder if a child could possibly make the decision to become a vegan at 6 years old, without any influence from her parents.<br /><br />That being said, the bars aren't too bad.  They are sweet and salty, which makes them appealing for those of us who crave that sort of thing.  The bars reminded me of an expensive Payday bar in many respects, except it's got raisins.  For those folks who are allergic to peanuts, steer clear.  This is chock full of them.<br /><br />The bars are small and yet have 200 calories.  No vitamins listed except 2% of RDA calcium.  7grams protein.  More than half the calories (110) are in fat.  Basically a very fattening treat that poses as healthy food.  Not that fat is bad, but 28 calories in protein and 61 calories in carbs (of which more than half are sugars) make the 110 calories in fat kind of lopsided.  That Snickers bar is looking mighty good by now.

review/summary: Vegan bars surprisingly good (but 200 calories each)
review/text: This is a very reasonable vegan nutritional bar that I have been trying out as a breakfast item. It has a nice filling taste and the raisins are not overpowering or dominating the taste which was my main worry when I first saw it.<br /><br />It comes in a cardboard box with 12 individually wrapped bars. If you like to reuse-before-recycle as much as possible, you can easily reuse the box to store other items after you finish the included bars.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, according to the nutrition facts on the box, one bar has 200 calories, with 12g of fat (2g saturated), no cholesterol, 230mg sodium, 260mg potassium, 18g carbs (5g fiber, 8g sugars), 7g protein, 6% iron and 2% calcium. The box stresses that only real natural vegan ingredients were used.<br /><br />This is a sticky bar, so you may not want to eat it at a place where you can't wash your hands after.

review/text: The ingredient list on these bars is short and all natural - something that I always enjoy seeing.  As for taste, these bars pull it off nicely.  Not too sweet like most other bars.  The peanuts add a nice flavor.  Personally, I think the salt taste is a little too strong (I don't salt any foods), but my friends don't agree with me.  They like the salt and thinks it's just right.<br /><br />Because of the peanuts, these bars give me better energy than granola bars (which tend to be all grains).  Recommended for a hold-me-over snack or hiking treat.

review/text: These bars were okay. Not great. But I suppose that people who are accustomed to eating gluten-free products will find these bars tasty. The main problem I had was the high sweetness factor which I assume was used to cover up the taste of the non-traditional ingredients required for the bars to be labeled gluten free. There was a bit of a aftertaste.<br /><br />Also, the consistency of the bar was just a bit too chewy for my taste - more stickiness than I liked.<br /><br />Not bad but I'd buy a single bar to try before purchasing a full box. Very reasonably priced, though.

review/summary: Filling and tasty
review/text: These snack bars are made primarily of peanuts and raisins, and they're corn syrup free and vegan. I really liked the taste of them, and they're much more filling than most snack bars I've tried. They're not too sweet, which was a selling point for me.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />They're filling.<br />They're not too sweet.<br />The ingredients are natural.<br />There's no corn syrup in them.<br /><br />Cons:<br />They're a bit sticky, which makes them not ideal for a snack on the go unless you don't mind sticky fingers.

review/text: I did not like these bars one bit -- far too peanut-ty for me with not enough sweetness.  Might as well just eat a handful of peanuts.  But I have quite a sweet tooth.  My husband who does not have a sweet teeth liked them very much for exactly the same reason--straightforward peanut-ty flavor and not much else.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I was expecting a sort of sweet, crunchy granola/cereal bar, but no. These are chewier, with nice big peanut halves. It's the perfect balance of salty and sweet. The fat content is a little high at 12g per bar, but nuts do tend to do that... saturated fat, however, is only 2g.<br /><br />This is a good choice for a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. Just enough to keep you going until dinner. I'll be buying these in the future.

review/summary: All Natural, but a Little Bland
review/text: Usually, I love a sweet/salty combo in the right ratio, and these bars had that. Not too salty, not too sweet, just a little of each.<br /><br />The ingredients are all natural, and include organic peanuts, raisins, brown rice syrup, chia seeds, molasses, sea salt, and so on. Each 1.5 oz bar has 200 calories.  Nothing bad here.<br /><br />Except. Even with the good ratio of sweet/salty, and even with the fine mix of natural, organic ingredients, the flavor is on the bland side.<br /><br />Maybe I was expecting them to taste more like a candy bar, or maybe I'm simply not used to organic ingredients (do they taste different?) but I just didn't fall in love with the taste of these.<br /><br />Still, I give them four stars, because of the healthy ingredients they contain.

review/summary: Yummy, gluten free, vegan, kosher!
review/text: These are great bars to add to a lunch, for snacks, to put in your purse, backpack or car.<br /><br />The peanut & kinda taste of raisins is there, yet the grapes & fruit taste is sweeter & doesn't taste like there is sulfur in it. The peanut taste isn't overwhelming either. These are simply wonderful & a great snack for any time!<br /><br />The only think I would change is to make the bars larger in size, as it is difficult to only have one!<br /><br />Fruity sweet, but not overly so, no added sugars & best of all, gluten free, vegan, kosher too!<br /><br />This is one of the best bars I've ever had (& I've tried many!)<br /><br />These will be on my shopping list in the future, and hopefully they'll make larger bars for adults, or those of us that can make a small meal out of them when out & about!<br /><br />No drawbacks here!<br /><br />If you like a sweet, and mild dash of salt flavor, you'll love these! Well balanced snack & if you have kids that aren't sugar addicted, you can rest assure they won't be trading these for something else from another kids' lunch at school!<br /><br />These are great for adults as well & give you that "pick-me-up" you need during the day between meals.

review/summary: Are they gluten free?
review/text: Chomped one down as soon as the pack arrived. First impressions: 'Way gooey but probably had been subjected to excess heat in PO truck. Salt dominates compared to other bars I've had that call themselves sweet and salty, which flavor combo I have liked very much but is not present in this bar. Dense and filling - satisfying - for its size.<br /><br />Above all, anything that takes the time and effort to be and label itself Gluten Free gets a huge thumbs-up from me. Statisticians used to think about 1 in 250 in the US could not tolerate wheat or gluten; today's estimate is more like 1 in 100 as physicians are starting to think outside the boxes into which they were trained, and are recognizing celiac disease and/or wheat allergy as the causes of persistent, hard-to-diagnose intestinal problems sometimes presenting as late as the sixth or seventh decade of life.<br /><br />There is one small glitch here, not sure how small a glitch. These bars are clearly labelled Gluten Free but there is also a statement, "This product is produced in a facility that also processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, sesame, tree nuts." This statement does not mean that the product is MADE ON machinery on which wheat has been processed, and then reused to produce these. (Even if that were the case, thorough cleaning should eliminate gluten.) But after I ate the first bar, I had the typical celiac reaction and couldn't figure out what I had done wrong, as I had not ingested anything with gluten. And I confess I didn't suspect this product. I waited 5 days and ate another bar. Bingo. Within 24 hours I again had that unpleasant intestinal reaction, and it was preceded by the painful gut-rumbling and feeling of pressure that always happen when I ingest gluten.<br /><br />Now it happens that I have enough scientific training to know that neither of these incidents proves causal relationship between ingestion and reaction. But it certainly has my eyebrows raised, and should make you wonder, too. An accidental ingestion of gluten is not fatal to the celiac but long-term it produces damage and short-term it is a real nuisance. I'm not providing all the graphic details of what happens to me.<br /><br />So back to the goo issue. I had put the remaining bars in the fridge. Yes, the second one, several days later, was far less gooey. But still, a lot of goo remained on the wrapper. (Would it get there if not exposed to heat? Dunno.) To me, that brings up two problems. First, my basic use for snack bars is to keep from getting too hungry while driving, so they get kept in the vehicle. Any crumbs that fall are going to be nasty cuz they are sticky as opposed to dry-crumby which I can vacuum out easily. I did note that not too many crumbs fell.<br /><br />Second, sticky-wrapper disposal can be tricky and requires special attention. These are far more likely to attract vermin and again, stick to things and leave a residue I don't want. A sticky piece of wrapper just fell and disappeared as I was writing this review. It took some contortions and a flashlight to retrieve it but retrieve it I must or attract mice to my computer station. Speaking of mice, I now have to go get a wash cloth to get the stickiness from my fingers off the computer mouse.<br /><br />About the flavor, well, I was thinking that they might be ideal when I want a salt fix as opposed to a sugar fix. A close friend used to say that he thought I would eat hay if I thought it was good for me. Yes, I'm like that (snorts and whinnys). But these taste less like hay, more like cardboard.<br /><br />UPDATE, a year later: I stuck the box of these bars in the fridge and every once in a while when I have had the energy to tackle something difficult, I've eaten one. The jury is still out on the gluten issue - sometimes I've not had the gluten reaction. But I am even more firmly convinced that when a product is labelled "Gluten Free", that it should in fact be gluten free. Not just "maybe" like these. I mean really, it makes me wonder what part of allergic, etc. some people don't understand.<br /><br />The stickiness and hardness continue to be problems making enjoyment difficult but perhaps I've gotten used to that, expect it. Over time I have come to like the mildly sweet/salt taste better. Although I'm not totally thrilled with taste or texture, I have moved my rating from two stars to four.<br /><br />Thanks to the manufacturer for sending a whole box rather than just the single so often sent to Vine reviewers - I needed more in order to do a thorough review.

review/summary: Gooey Nastiness
review/text: Overwhelming peanut flavor, sticky and difficult to remove from the wrapper, and just not appetizing.  As a pro, these are fairly low carb (13g net) so they should be acceptable on some low carb diets.  Be aware they are high in fat (12g for a 43g bar) and have about 200 calories.<br /><br />My wife tried one too and she said it needed chocolate and no raisins.  My son liked them okay though, but he is at an age where a lack of flavor goes over well.  I wouldn't buy this particular flavor again.  On the plus side, the quality of these bars is high so I might try some other flavors.

review/summary: Very filling and rich gluten free bar...
review/text: I chose these bars because I follow a gluten free diet, and I'm always looking for convenient bars with protein, that can be used as a meal replacement for breakfast or lunch occasionally.<br /><br />These bars are 200 calories each, and they taste very rich and are very filling.  If you like raisins and peanuts eaten together, you will like these.  The bars contain brown rice syrup, which has a small aftertaste, but only someone very picky would mind it in these bars - I barely noticed it.<br /><br />I especially love that they are gluten free and vegan.  No gluten or dairy worries for me.  HOWEVER, I just wanted to give a small warning.  Even though they say "Gluten Free" on the box and bars, there is fine print that says:<br /><br />"This product is produced in a facility that also processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, sesame, tree nuts."<br /><br />That was very surprising to me, because usually when that warning is on the label, the product is not labeled "gluten free".  So I suppose there is a very small chance of cross contamination.  I don't mind it at all, but someone who is super sensitive might want to beware.<br /><br />Great taste, great snack or meal replacement.  Recommended.

review/text: Pure Natural Bars are a great snack for someone who is health conscious. These bars are made with all natural ingredients. No added high fructose corn syrup or other types of sugar, nor does it have artificial sweeteners or anything like that.<br /><br />I like peanuts, so I found this tasty. Because there are no added sweeteners, it has the natural sweetness but is not overwhelming. If you have a serious sweet tooth, stick to the artificial stuff. Because it has peanuts, there is a bit of salt taste to it so you get the sweet and salty. I like that flavor.<br /><br />If you are health conscious, and/or want to snack on something all natural, this is a great one to try. Also, if you are a vegan, this is vegan friendly, no animal products.

review/summary: Okay but not the best flavor of Pure Bars
review/text: Eh - not super great.  These bars are very peanutty (comprised mostly of whole peanuts with a sticky binder), but I expected the raisins to be more like raisins.  Instead, they seem to be pulverized and are part of the sticky binder for the peanuts.  In my opinion, the bar does not really have a raisin taste, even though it is called Peanut Raisin Crunch, possibly due to the other sweeteners used.<br /><br />PEANUT RAISIN CRUNCH PURE BAR INGREDIENTS: Organic Peanuts, Raisins, Brown Rice Syrup, Peanut Flour, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Organic Agave Fiber, Peanut Butter (Peanuts), Chia Seeds, Molasses, Sea Salt, Coconut Oil, Water, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />The bars are kind of sticky in texture (aside from the crunchy whole peanuts) but surprisingly, not overly sweet tasting, as common for some of the stickier "trail mix bars".  The saltiness is a nice balance, although the "sweet and salty" taste is not what exactly what I would expect from this description.  Maybe this is due to brown rice syrup being the main sweetener (also with molasses) and not the standard white sugar.<br /><br />To sum up, I do not think I will repurchase this flavor of Pure Bars. If I am craving peanut and raisin / sweet and salty taste, I will just have a handful of salted peanuts mixed with raisins (back to real whole foods - what a novel concept!).  However, I do like and recommend the regular Pure Organic Bars - for instance the Wild Blueberry, Cranberry Orange and Apple Cinnamon are excellent, and a variety pack is available to find your favorite.<br /><br />8/3/11  Updating my review to say that after eating additional bars, I did notice a few whole raisins in the bar (not just pulverized - maybe that part is solely sweetners), but still no raisin taste at all.  The bars are pretty good and I can see that if you eat more and more of them, there is a chance of liking them better.

review/summary: perfect blend of sweet and salty; very yummy
review/text: My mouth is in heaven.  I am always searching for a healthy snack bar that doesn't have too many calories, inulin or sugar alcohol. I want something with ingredients I can read that has a good amount of protein and fiber balanced against low carb and fat.  This bar meets all the criteria.  You get 5 grams of fiber from the peanuts and agave fiber and 7 grams of protein.  The fats are a little on the high side (12 grams) but that's coming from the peanuts.  I love that the peanut butter used in the bars has just one ingredient - peanuts.  You get a total of 18g of carbs with 9 of those coming from sugars.<br /><br />I received my bars on one of the hottest days of the summer (108 degrees F) and my bars were warm and gooey.  I suggest a quick trip to the fridge if it's hot outside because the bar was too sticky to get out of the wrapper.  The stickiness and warmth didn't affect the flavor however.  It was a perfect balance of saltiness with a slight sweetness from the molasses and raisins.  The peanuts gave a little crunch so it wasn't all gooey.  This is a snack bar that will go on my shopping list from now on.  With 200 calories per bar, it will make a filling afternoon pick me up or go with a salad or soup for lunch.  For the vegetarians out there - these bars are vegan.

review/text: According to the label, these have everything you want in a bar... but I just didn't like them. The package is hard to open and it has the consistency of modeling clay; that is pretty standard for power bars in my experience. There is a powerful peanut smell when you open it, but surprisingly less peanut taste when eating it. Overall I thought it was a drab and tasteless sticky mess, something like the food you would expect them to eat in a dystopian novel. Something with some tartness and zing, like cranberries, would have been much appreciated. I was worried about my husband's impression because he hates raisins, but you can't tell there are any raisins in it.

review/text: Finally a protein bar that's more salty than sweet. I don't have a sweet tooth, so when nearly every similar bar that I have tried is pushing the sugary tooth at me, I find this one that fulfills my protein and fiber requirement without needing to call my dentist. This bar is salty, with just the right touch of molasses. I taste peanuts and a hint of syrup. Yum! The raisin sweetness is so subtle that I can hardly taste it. In my opinion, this is the best protein bar I have ever tasted.

They're handy in my family as a post swim practice snack, but I find lots of the bars on the market are either too junky, too processed and chemical tasting, or are filled with claims that make them soundlike steroid jrs.<br /><br />These Pure bars really fill a need for us. They taste good - and they taste like the real food they are.  They don't claim to turn you into superman.  They're vegan and kosher, too.  Order of ingredients: organic Peanuts, Raisins, Brown rice syrup, peanut flour, organic tapioca syrup etc.  Good stuff.  These are not diet bars (200 calories) but paired with a glass of milk they're good recovery food after a hard workout.

review/summary: Lots of Things to Like, But Still Not My Favorite
review/text: I like that that this nutrition bar uses lots of organic ingredients, that it also has protein, fiber, is low in sugar and is also gluten free. The bars were kind of sticky which is probably because of the Brown Rice Syrup and the Tapioca Syrup to hold it all together.  It had lots of peanuts, with a few raisins, so it was definitely way more salty than sweet.<br /><br />Overall, I think this bar was just ok, and it was much too salty for me.  Salt was the overwhelming flavor which masked the peanut butter and the raisin taste.  For a nutrition bar I prefer the Clif Luna Bars that are MUCH tastier and better for you (I like the Nutz Over Chocolate).  They also have more protein, almost as much fiber, fewer carbs, less fat and sodium, less calories, and tons more vitamins including Iron and Folic Acid.<br /><br />When I eat a Luna Bar for breakfast I am good to go until lunch, and is easy to eat when you are rushed for time, but want something delicious and nutritious at the same time.  I didn't feel that way after the Pure bar. I was hungry not long after eating it, and it was so sticky that I couldn't eat it on the go like I can the other.  I don't think I will be buying them.  They weren't bad, I just prefer another choice....by a lot!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CEO81">Luna Bars, Nutz Over Chocolate, 1.69-Ounce Bars (Pack of 15)</a>

review/text: I'm not a vegan or looking for gluten-free foods, but since this product is labeled as such, I'll take it at its word.  My real interest in this bar is the "natural" foods that comprise it.  I can pronounce everything on the label.<br /><br />Pluses:  You can really taste the crunchy peanuts and sweet raisins; they're both packed with "real" flavor.  The small bar also has 7g of protein (not nearly as much as a protein bar, but good for a pick-me-up) and 5g of fiber.<br /><br />Minuses:  The bar is very sticky (probably because of the real molasses in it that binds everything together).  It sticks to the wrapper...and then your fingers.  And that's eating it in air-conditioning.  Perhaps popping it into the refrigerator would help?  The small bar is also 200 calories, but at least it's filled with healthy ingredients.  Use it as a snack, not a side item!<br /><br />All in all, it's a tasty treat -- even moreso than a granola bar (and probably a little bit healthier too!).

review/summary: something new
review/text: This is an interesting bar - not like anything else out there. I don't really like oat or soy based bars, so this was an interesting substitution to a granola bar. It is kind of like all natural snickers bar without chocolate coating. It is chewy, not dry at all. It is less sweet than other bars I've had - it is still 9 grams per bar, but you don't taste it that much. I think it is because they overdid on salt. It is high on sodium - 230 mlg per bar. And I did find it salty. Wish they reduced sodium on half - then it would be my new favorite bar!

review/summary: It's pretty good
review/text: The packaging says it's sweet and salty and it is.  It's also kind of crunchy, gooey and sticky but that's not a bad thing for a snack bar.  I like the taste because it's not overly sweet, the salt mediating the sweetness.  The Pure Natural bar is being promoted as a healthy snack with natural ingredients.  In my opinion, they beat the heck out of the taste of some of the other healthy snacks I've found for sale at the local health food stores but they're not quite as tasty as some of the commercially available "not-health-food" bars you can find at the supermarket or warehouse stores.<br /><br />While it's not promoted as being a "diet food", I had to compare the nutritional information on the packaging with two other products we had in the kitchen cabinet--Sunbelt's Oats & Honey Chewy Granola Bar and Nature Valley's Chewy Fruit & Nut Trail Mix Bar.  The Pure Natural bar is a little bit larger than the other two (1.5 oz vs 1.4 oz. for the Sunbelt and 1.2 oz. for Nature Valley).  The Pure Natural bar has 200 calories per bar with 12 g of fat and 230 mg of sodium.  Nature Valley bars have 140 calories, 4 g of fat and 65 mg of sodium while the Sunbelt bar has 180 calories, 7 g of fat and 85 mg of sodium.  Without getting into the healthy characteristics of the ingredients of all three products, those people who wish to reduce their intake of fat, sodium and calories will find there are alternate products to the Pure Natural bars with lower numbers per serving.  The Pure Natural bars do have a significant advantage over the other bars in the protein levels--7 grams for Pure Natural and 2 to 3 grams for the other products.  And, for the record, the Sunbelt granola bars have a whopping 4.5 g of saturated fat--23% of the daily value.  That's more than double the Pure Natural bars and more than 10X the saturated fat of the Nature Valley bars.<br /><br />So...I like the taste of the bars but, honestly, I wouldn't go out of my way to find them or pay a lot more for them.  According to my wife, who recently bought a box of the Nature Valley bars, she spent less than $10 for a box of 30.  When I consider the price, taste and nutritional information, the Pure Natural bars come up a little short.  If you're one of those people who just has to have something labeled as natural that promotes itself as a healthy choice, they might be worth it to you.

review/summary: Packed!
review/text: This little bar has a lot going for it. It packs 200 cal, of which 110 are fat calories, 230mg sodium, 5g fiber, 7g protein, but only 9g sugar, and it's all packed into 1.5oz! It feels pretty dense and solid too.<br /><br />Taste: This is pretty subjective. I found it gooey but pretty flavorful. The ingredients are all natural stuff (no preservatives or long sounding chemical names listed in the ingredients). I would likely take this on hikes for my hunger pains. I like this bar and I will definitely check out this company's other products to see what they have.

review/summary: An OK, healthy treat
review/text: I think it works, nutritious and a reasonable 200 calories, combining a treat and food. Personally, I did find it a little too sweet for me, maybe too much molasses. I would take a Snickers bar over it anytime, at least it is more tasty than this and, in moderation, certainly a reasonable compromise in nutrition.

review/summary: Tasty, but very small
review/text: These bars have a fairly good taste to them, and have a texture that makes them almost like a chewy nut-based candy bar; they are very sticky.  If you're sensitive to salty peanuts, I don't recommend these since that is the dominant taste. In fact, I couldn't taste the raisins in them at all.<br /><br />These come in at 200 calories,  12 grams of fat (18% of your daily value), 230 mg of sodium (10%), 18 grams of carbs (6%), 5 grams of fiber (20%), 9 grams of sugar, and 7 grams of protein.<br /><br />While I do like these, I'm giving them 3 1/2 stars for a few reasons. First of all, this is an awfully tiny bar for 200 calories.  I know that nut bars (Larabars come to mind, too) tend to have more calories than non-nut-based bars, but these are very tiny.  Additionally, while they are billed as using organic peanuts, in the list of ingredients, about half of the ten main ingredients are not organic, including the peanut flour and peanut butter that are added in addition to the actual peanuts.  It seems misleading to use organic peanuts, but not organic PB.<br /><br />For a vegan bar, these are tasty, but I don't see myself purchasing a box after I run out of my first box.

review/summary: Satisfies snack craving and isn't too sweet!
review/text: Me: "Oh! My bars arrived."<br /><br />GMR: "Huhn." Dubious edge to his voice.<br /><br />Me: "Hmmm, it says vegan and gluten free. Well. Hmmm." I open the box, stare at the bars.<br /><br />GMR: A smart-arse tinge slips from his lips. "Sounds de-li-cious  . . ."<br /><br />"Well, I am going to try one right now. After all, I am a Vine Voice!"<br /><br />"A what what?" GMR asks.<br /><br />"A vine voice. You know. Amazon Vine?"<br /><br />"Uh. Huh. Uh."<br /><br />"Remember? I told you Amazon invited me to be a Vine Voice and I have to try out stuff and then review. Remember I told you?"<br /><br />"You didn't tell me, but sounds, um, sounds . . . yeah. Uh. Huh. Uh." GMR's eyes are glazing.<br /><br />"Well. Anyway. Yeah. That's what I do." I take out a bar, open it. PEEEEEEEEEEEEEL PEEEEEEL PEEEEEEEE_EEE_EEE_EEE_EEE_EEE_EE_EEEEL back the paper. "Dang. These are pretty sticky."<br /><br />GMR looks at the bar with one eyebrow cocked up high. Gives a kind of ewww look.<br /><br />I finally get the paper peeled and stare at it, sniff, and then take a big arse bite and chew chew chew chew, chew, chew chew, chew.<br /><br />GMR has lost complete interest and is staring into the refrigerator for something that has gluten and animal guts in it or something most un-vegan like. He IS from New Orleans after all--we all know they eat anything in South Louisiana--haw haw! That's exactly what I tell him after I finally finish chewing and swallowing the first bite (several minutes have gone by tic tic tock tock!):<br /><br />I say, "Haw Haw! South Louisianians eat ANYTHING, so why won't you try this. It's not bad. I am liking these I do think."<br /><br />"Ungh." He grabs cheese from the fridge and breaks off a hunk, eats heartily.<br /><br />I take another bite and then another. It's not so bad at all. I say, between bites, "Hey, it reminds me of a Payday candy bar! Except not as sweet. Remember those? You love those!"<br /><br />"Huhn. Uh. Uh uh," GMR finishes off his cheese and is wandering to the tv remote.<br /><br />I finish my Pure Natural Bar and drink down a big glass of water, for they do make me thirsty--that's not a bad thing, right? Nope. Whew. Sure was sticky and chewy, but I like chewy sometimes. What I really like is that it isn't too sweet--I hate sickly sweet stuff, especially in bar things that aren't candy bars.<br /><br />I think I say this out loud to GMR, but I'm not sure, since the back of his head isn't answering.<br /><br />I say to the back of GMR's head, a little louder, "You know, this bar kind of filled me up some. I'm not hungry anymore."<br /><br />"That's great. Uh huh. Huh. Uh huh." Jeopardy music is on and soon GMR is calling out answers to questions.<br /><br />I lovingly place my Pure Natural Bars on the counter and pat them. Over Alex Trebek's making a joke about one of the contestant's saying something that only they find funny, I say, "Really, they're pretty good. You should try one."<br /><br />"The Baltic Sea! . . . Geometry! . . . John Wayne!"<br /><br />"Well, then I'll just keep them for myself."<br /><br />"Nineteen forty-five! . . . Machu Picchu!"<br /><br />The next day, which is today, I have another, and it satisfies my cravings between lunch and supper. Not bad. They really aren't so bad at all. I'd buy them. They're a bit chewy but the chew helps me to take my time eating them. I like the way they aren't too sweet, as I said, and they have plenty of peanut taste-which I happen to like. They are hard to open; however, and I have to really work to peel the paper from them. But, all in all, I am pleased with the product!<br /><br />UPDATE! - I love these bars and ate them all - great for my "before workout" snack or snack in the afternoon. I wish they were a little bit less in price, maybe say, $1.00 each or $12 a box - a little bit more maybe? If I went into the store to buy them individually, I'd think of paying $1.00 but hesitate for more. However, I enjoyed them and miss them - dang. Want more. :-D

review/text: I like using Amazon.com. It is convenient, wide-ranging, and often has very low prices.<br />HOWEVER,<br />When I checked for the above dog food on Amazon, it was priced at arpound $54...PLUS $20 SHIPPING = $74/34 lb bag.<br />My local Petsmart store sold me the ame size bag at $34.99!<br />Let's see...$35 or $74 ?????  Hard to choose,I know, with only a 110% price diff,  but I think you get the point.<br /><br />AND... to Mr& Mrs Purina... WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE 40 & 50 pound bags? Prices/bag have increased but it is offset by smaller bags??? Oh yeah, I get it, just like Goldman Sachs is doing God's work, and AIG's survival is essential to the earth remaining in orbit!<br /><br />PS: if anyone cares about my political views, I firmly believe the world (or at least the US, and hence goeth the world) would be a far better place if all those in Congress were replaced by Great Danes.

review/summary: Bubble Tea Kit
review/text: This is a fun and unique gift pack.  Great for teens and young folks (who don't need supervision in the kitchen).  Instructions were straight forward and the end result turned out great!  Highly recommended.<br /><br />First step involved boiling the tapioca pearls.  Just make sure you have enough (if not additional water in the pot).  Because of the excess starches, these pearls need room to expand and soak.  Don't over cook.<br /><br />After drained and cooled, you make (shake) the packet ingredients.  Our favorite was strawberry, but Mango came in a close second.  Have not tried the tarrot yet (fear of the unknown).<br /><br />We even tried standard lemonade (our own making) with the bubble pearls and it was good as well.<br /><br />Don't forget to get extra straws.  You can't suck these pearls through standard sippy straws.<br /><br />Happy bubbling.

review/summary: Triscuits, diet Coke and weight loss... perfect combo!
review/text: It's taken me a year to lose 64 pounds and Triscuits has been a big part of it! A snack with the tomato and olive oil is a legal way to munch in the evening while relaxing in front of the tv. The flavor is great. I ordered it online because it's difficult to find the tomato Triscuits stocked in stores. The bulk price from Amazon.com is comparable to sale prices and better than regular prices in store. By combining it with the tomato Wheat Thins (for my husband), I was able to get free shipping. When the snack turns into my dinner, I use the Triscuits to dip in hummus (for protein). Diet Coke is my treat. Great, healthy way to lose weight! Thanks, Triscuit, for making such a variety of flavors. Thanks, Amazon, for offering great prices, free shipping, fast turn around time, and bubbled packaging so that my crackers weren't broken!

review/text: I'm a beef jerky, sausage, and all-things-meat junkie. So I figured I'd order some stuff in bulk off the net. These are pretty darn good. The trick is to let them hang in the open air for as long as you can resist eating them. The longer the better. I imagine letting them hang for a really long time (months) would be detrimental, but I never managed to let them hang for more than a week or 2. After the first week or so they hit their stride and are prime for eating.

review/text: These people from Bavaria really know how to make this stuff. The Landjagers are super (you have to let them dry for them to develop their full, intended flavor), and it is worth any sausage fan's time to check out their complete offering of German style sausages and hams.  Due to the perishability of some of their products their S&H charges appear outrageous but I guess that sending frozen or refrigerated foods costs money.  Personally, I recommend their coarse grind liverwurst but that is a matter of personal taste.

review/summary: Amazing taste
review/text: I love these. That is the easiest way to put it. I purchased these because they have always looked so delicious. The only complaint I might have, is that these couldn't last. Everyone in the house ate them right out from under me.<br /><br />I would purchase more, but the one thing that has stopped me from doing so is that the shipping price is quite simply put, outrageous. Maybe the next time I have a bunch of extra cash I'll pick up another batch, and hide them very well.

review/summary: Fantastic product, WAY overpriced, shipping unbelievably expensive.
review/text: I purchased both the regular and peppered Landjager by Bavaria.  Followed the recommendations of other purchasers and immediately unwrapped the product and placed it on a cookie sheet between layers of paper towels in a cool dry space to dry.  Tried some the following day, it was excellent and it improved even more the following day as it continued to dry.  Terrific flavor and consistency, once it dries more will surely be as good as that I ate in Germany hanging in the bars.<br /><br />The cost is another issue, $20.63 per pound plus freight which adds another $6.32 per pound for a total of $26.95 per pound (shipping would have been far more had I only purchased one package) and that's for Postal shipping, not UPS or Fedex.  There was no notice of shipment from Wisconsinmade, so I was informed that it was here with a friendly postcard in my mailbox left by the postman who wouldn't walk up the drive to the house.  So after making a 10 mile round trip to the Post Office the following afternoon after work I had my Landjager.  Please be advised you will pay a dollar amount for shipping that would pay for UPS delivery, but the product is shipped USPS and you'll discover that Wisconsinmade makes a substantial profit on the shipping end as well as their exhorbitant product costs.<br /><br />Again, the Landjager is great !  I just can't afford it.

review/summary: EXCELLENT Landjaeger!
review/text: This landjaeger is the REAL DEAL! I have actually been hunting in Germany (for boar, which was a blast and a TOTALLY different story), and, lo and behold, what did we eat in the field? LANDJAEGER! No lie. The product from Wisconsin made must be made by the cousin of the guy in Germany because it tastes exactly the same, and believe me, both were excellent. I had one little problem with a shipment (and I am POSITIVE that it was an aberration in the shipping process) in that the vacuum seal on the package was not intact. Well, let me tell you, within 12 hours, not 24, TWELVE hours of my feedback on Amazon about it, I had been contacted by a very nice and concerned person @ Wisconsin who was 1. apologetic (how rare is THAT in today's bad customer service world, and 2. Sending me a whole new shipment. This place is the BEST! Get your landjaeger here! I am going to explore what other goodies they have, too. SERVUS!

review/text: My dogs love these smoked cow ears, and I love it that they are from grass-fed, antibiotic-free cows. I have one large dog and 2 small dogs, I gave these 4 stars b/c they last several days with small dogs. However, my lab can chew one up in a few minutes! The down side, for me, is the cost, the shipping charge is the same as the cost of the product itself, doubling the price. I will order these again if there's a way to bring the shipping cost down.

review/summary: Jasmine matcha - light vegetal flavor - not heavy floral
review/text: This matcha smells like a nice light matcha.  I really love jasmine so I had hoped that the scent would come thru, but it did not.  For those that are not into a strong floral jasmine flavor, this is the jasmine matcha for you!<br />My first impression of this matcha was, "Where is the jasmine?"  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I was unable to detect a "flavor" in this matcha.  That of course does NOT mean it will taste bad, just not what I expected.<br />I always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  My matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha, water and my sifter!  I'm becoming a matcha pro now.  No need to go looking for my tools, they were all handy.  This matcha brings me to a place where I imagine sitting with friends passing around a matcha bowl contemplating our day.  I would love to share this outdoors on a warm spring or summer day.  Today is 60 degrees so I have to use my imagination.<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar and 6 oz of water.  Last time I had a total of 7 oz and the matcha was bitter.  After going back to my 8 oz I tried the matcha and still felt that it was a touch bitter.  I added 2 more oz of water and a bit more sugar.  I know it's psychological, but I feel healthier drinking this matcha!  It's just so light and fresh and reminds me of a health food drink.<br />The smell of this matcha once mixed with water takes stayed the same, light and vegetal.  I am now curious how the Pure Jasmine Matcha compares to this one.  I was torn between them when placing my order.  The quality of the matcha is very good.<br />I'm not sure if this matcha will make my keep cupboard.  Red Leaf Tea has so many flavor offerings that I think I'll try those before going back to this matcha which doesn't seem far off my normal matcha.  My plan for the rest of Jasmine is to mix it to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  I ordered the large size so I will save a bit for next spring when I can enjoy it outside.<br />To try Jasmine Matcha from Red Leaf Tea visit here:<br />[...]

review/summary: Lindt Excellence Extra Creamy Milk Chocolate!!!  Yum, Yum!!!
review/text: I discovered this Chocolate accidently at the Fresh Market speciality Grocery Store in Ridgeland, MS several years ago.  Since then I have consumed hundreds of bars!  At one point Wal-Mart carried it but those bafooms dropped it.  At one point Kroger carried it but no more.  They both sell Lindt Chocolate bars but not this flavor, at least not here in the Jackson, MS area.  Walgreens sells lots of Lindt bars as well but they have never carried this flavor, at least in this area.  If you LOVE MILK CHOCOLATE don't dare even taste this because you will not believe your taste buds!  It is outrageous it is so good!!!  Since I can no longer buy it locally I will hope that Amazon keeps some Sellers on queue that can provide it.  I am a SINGLE FLAVOR single item type person so the multitude of flavors and brands does not interest me.  This is an item to DIE FOR!  Try it and you will, like I did, fall in love.  Then you'll have to marry it!  ;-)  ENJOY!  Thanks Amazon for making stuff like this that we can't find locally available!!!

review/summary: Not for brutal chewers
review/text: I have a brutally aggressive chewer (35 lb springer spaniel mix) that pulled the fabric off the top of the octoupus's head in less than 30 seconds.  She used her incisors to grab hold of and rip off the fabric.  Within a few minutes she had removed all of the stuffing from the octopus head.  She then ripped into the legs and removed two squeakers in less than an hour.<br /><br />Note my dog has done damage to all toys except the classic kong and bounzer ball.  She rips pieces off the kong dental jack and kong stuff-a-ball.  So my rating is aimed at owners of extreme chewers.

review/summary: Long Lasting
review/text: I bought Oscar for my 2 month old Cardigan Welsh Corgis in April at a local pet store.  As of today (Aug 30th), Oscar only has minor wear on his bottom.  My dog loves it when we spin oscar on his head and she will chase him across the room.  She also loves to "surf" on him across our wooden floor.  So far I am very impressed as the breeder warned me not to buy her stuffed animals as they usually end up shredded in a couple of days.  I also have Scorch the Scorpion who has also help up well, but the dog does not like him as much.  I ordered Girard the Giraffe and I'm very excited!  If your dog is a heavy chewer and loves stuffed toys definatley try one of these!

review/summary: disagree; these are for serious chewers
review/text: I have TWO one year old yellow lab/golden retreiver mixes who are SERIOUS chewers.  We went through every imaginable toy until I saw the Tuffy sea ray in a pet shop on vacation and thought I would take it back to the dogs to give it a try.  Thank the Lord! I finally found something they can play with and NOT destroy.  It is four months later and they still love it and it has held up well.  I am going to buy them several of the other Tuffy toys for Christmas!  I think these toys hold up well and are worth a try if you have a serious chewer.  (My dogs have destroyed a leather sofa; they chewed up the wood frame and hobnail upholstery tacks that decorate the sofa like they were kibble!) These toys are pricey, but give them a try if you have a serious chewer.

review/summary: My Dog's favorite toy!
review/text: First of all, Tuffy toys aren't meant for dogs to sit down and chew on. They are play toys, and if used the way they're meant to be used they will last for a VERY long time. If you let your dog chew on this toy all they want, then yes, it won't last very long. My dog loves to play with this toy, it is her favorite toy and her go-to for tug-of-war. We don't let her take it away and chew on it, though we do let her squeak the squeakers and throw it around for herself. We bought it in July for her Birthday, and it's now September and she hasn't broken through the first layer. The squeakers do break pretty fast, but all it takes is for the dog to bite it the wrong way. My dog goes through cow hooves in less then a day, rawhide in 2 minutes. She is a very strong chewer. I would definitely recommend the octopus for a strong play toy for a good chewer. There is no toy that will survive a dog chewing on it all they want. If you want to give your dog something to chew on and destroy, get a hoof, rawhide strips, or a bone. If you want a great fun toy for you and your dog to play with, this is it.

review/summary: Pretty Tough
review/text: I have had three of these.<br /><br />I have 5 dogs.  Three of them are chewers, but the most aggressive chewer is the smallest (about 30 lbs).  This toy held up very well against my dogs, and is the uncontested favorite toy for my yellow lab.  She plays very rough with it, although she doesn't "purposely" try to rip it apart.  It generally lasts a few months, before getting a hole in it, usually due to some very aggressive tug-of-war between our biggest dogs (75 lbs and 65 lbs).<br /><br />Once the hole has been made, our yellow lab focuses her attention on destroying it, and can generally make a mess of it in under an hour and utterly destroy it the same evening.<br /><br />I would agree with all the different reviewers... the ones that say it's a very tough toy, and the others who complain that it won't stop a committed chewer.

review/text: My dog Chance has an Octapus toy "Octie" and it lasts to this day. I think this is because the Lobster toy is much more fun for him. The octopus is SO big in the center that he cannot grab it there--- where as the lobster toy is grabable (word?) in so many places as well as on any of the lobster legs. He has such greater enjoyment in being able to grab "Lobbie" ( the lobster) than he has in not being able to grab the octopus mid air.

review/summary: 7 out of 10 tuffies scale is accurate
review/text: My black lab's purpose in life is destruction.  Nothing gives her more pleasure than to rip stuff apart.  She even loves to chew up pine cones and sweetgum balls.  Most toys that claim to be for tough chewers don't last more than a few minutes with her.  With consistent supervision and "interventions" (taking the toy away from her), I was able to get this toy to last a few months, albiet missing an increasing number of tentacles over that time span.  That is a record for her.<br /><br />This is a very well constructed toy and they put a lot of thought into it.....durable material around the borders, multiple rows of extra strength stiches, and squeakers sewn in little pockets. The only changes I think they should make:  don't put stuffing in the tentacles and sew off each tentacle so once it is chewed off, the dog can't access the stuffing in the center of the body. These "faults" are why I gave this toy a 4 instead of a 5.<br /><br />The bottom line:  If your dog just likes to play rough and pull and tug, this toy will take the abuse.  However, if your dog is like mine and will obsessively chew on one spot for hours on end.....give it up already! You are never going to find a stuffed toy that will last unless you: 1) ONLY use it for interactive play such as fetch, 2) take it away immediately when your dog begins to obsessively chew it, and 3) NEVER allow your dog to have access to the toy unsupervised for ANY length of time.  Sorry.  That is just life with a dog that lives to destroy.  You can't blame it on the toy.

review/summary: Scorchingly Hot...but GOOOD!
review/text: For any of you who want to try one of the hottest peppers in the world, these will satisfy all your curiosity.  My advice is to cut one up into small flakes about the size of crushed red pepper flakes & then put one flake in your mouth.  A co-worker who eats jalapenos every day popped a flake in his mouth, jumped outta his chair screaming, and spit it out into the trash.  I personally thought that was overly dramatic, as it shouldn't have been that bad, but that one flake is definitely hotter than a whole jalapeno.  The smoke flavor is great.  I put about 5 flakes into a bowl of chili and let them sit there & infuse into the sauce before I took my first bite.  The heat wasn't overpowering at all, neither was it harsh like Tabasco is, but had a very satisfying warmth that spread quickly all through my mouth, and the smokiness was a fantastic addition to chili.  Who woulda thought.  So these aren't just for playing a practical joke on your friends.  You can actually use them in cooking with good results.  One thing I've noticed after I got these is jalapenos don't seem hot at all anymore.

review/text: We started buying this cracker because our grandson has a severe nut allergy, and this product and the factory it is produced in are both nut free.  It has become the favorite cracker in the house, good by itself or with cheese or other stuff on them.  Great taste, not overly salty.

review/summary: Too bad they were crumbs
review/text: The order was easy to place.  The product was reasonably priced.  The delivery was amazing.  My only complaint is that the bottom half of each of the boxes is crushed.  Very disappointing.  The crackers that are whole are GREAT!!!  The crumbs aren't too crumby either.

review/summary: Tasty Crunchy Snack
review/text: If you like the flavor of rosemary and a crunchy chip, you'll find a tasty marriage of the two in these baked whole wheat crackers.  They are low in sodium and sugar.  Only 120 calories in six crackers so they're great for the waistline, too.  Tasty with a little slice of cheddar cheese on top.

review/summary: Mario Batali Cherry Tomato Sauce
review/text: Fabulous sauce with fresh homemade taste. Lots of flavor with pieces of real tomatoes and a little bit of pepper flavor. Found it at Costco for $7.99 for 2 24oz. jars.  Amazing price and I highly recommend.
