review/summary: Wow Wasabi !
review/text: My first and last food review.  If you haven't tried them do.  Simple recipe.  Dried peas, hot Japanese horseradish, salt and sugar.  (How do they put that wasabi on the pea anyway?)  High taste low fat.  Lucky too, because they are addictive.<br /><br />An interesting aside.  Wasabi has antibacterial affects upon the teeth.  Don't have a toothbrush?  Grab a wasabi pea or two.  Just don't breathe on anybody.

review/summary: Very good wasai peas
review/text: My first experience of wasabi peas were from a large chain pharmacy's asian snack mix.  I tasted those peas and I knew I had to have more!  I went looking around and found these on Amazon.  First, I have to say these arrived in 2 days, and they are very professionally packaged in a double sealed bag.  The seller is highly impressive.  As for flavor, I'm undecided.  They are a bit too much "pea" not enough other flavor.  I'm not sure exactly what it's lacking, but the flavor isn't what I was expecting.  It definitely has a strong pea flavor (not that that should be a negative, heck, they ARE dried peas!), and the spice is good (I like a bit more spicy, but there is definitely sufficient spice!), but it's lacking something I can't put my finger on.  I haven't run in to any hard peas, and they are fresh tasting and I can see how most gave them 5 stars.  I might try a few other brands to figure out if I can find what I am looking for, but if I don't find it, I will definitely come back for more of these!

review/summary: Luv 'em, Luv 'em, Luv'em!
review/text: Heard about these on Dr Oz show (yeah, I know....) as one of many ways to help boost metabolism so thought I would give them a shot as a healthier snack than what I usually do.  First, I received these within a couple of days (and I live in Alaska!) so the shipper is great.<br /><br />The peas were full of flavor and have a super crunchiness that satisfies my cravings.  Individually the peas are not very hot, but put 3 or more in your mouth and you will know they were there! Due to this, I can't eat them by the handful; which is a good thing!<br /><br />All in all, a great product.  One caution: different manufacturers use varying amounts of sodium so, if you are on a low sodium diet, watch out.  I forgot to check the package on this brand so can't tell you how much they use, but will do so after I receive my next shipment.

review/summary: Wasabi
review/text: The Wasabi peas were purchased for my husband and daughter.  I was hoping to find a less expensive product with the same taste as the W. peas purchased at Walmart.  The price was a little (not much) more reasonable and the size larger than previously purchased.  However both my husband and daughter were disappointed in the taste of the Wasabi peas.

review/summary: Delicate Healthy Tea
review/text: I've tried a lot of these "organic" teas over the years and they always seemed a little tasteless or way TOO tasty, trying to get your taste buds attention.  So I have stuck with regular Earl Grey decaffeinated for thirty years and didn't intend to change until a friend gave me a sample of this South African tea to try at an "English" high tea event where they served unusual teas from around the world.  It is very subtle, has a lovely aftertaste and having read the literature that came with the sample it apparently is incredibly good for you on a basic health level.  In fact far more so than the green teas we have all heard about for years.  Plus I really like the tin it comes in, I have been using it for pens on my desk.  Brilliant product, don't really know why it's never been around before now.

review/text: The best tea, bar none!  The fact that it is organic, naturally caffeine free, and full of antioxidants is just a bonus.  I love that I can brew a big pot and it never becomes bitter or overly strong, even when it sits. The low tannin makes it great for settling an upset stomach and very agreeable to drink.  The more I learn about rooibos tea the more fascinating it becomes. What a great product!

review/summary: Disappointed!
review/text: The fettuccine arrived carefully packaged but upon opening the bags (we've used 3 so far), the noodle were broken or crushed. Instead of a nice long pasta, it was more like pasta bits! When I took a closer look, the fettuccine in every bag were in the same crushed condition. The instructions for cooking were a bit vague - "cook for 1 to 5 minutes"? I ended up cooking it in lightly salted boiling water (with a drizzle of olive oil) and tasting a noodle every 2 to 3 mins to check. When cooked, the fettuccine does not have a nice "al dente" bite, but more doughy and pasty. Bleh. The colors are pretty but the taste did not live up to expectations. I will not be buying this again!

review/summary: Its like drinking battery acid
review/text: I'd give this negative stars if I could. After steeping according to directions I ended up with a pot of tea that had a very bitter, chemical taste, so i threw that batch out. I tried again, steeping it as you would a green tea, 175 degrees less than 1 minute. This was drinkable, but not good. The taste was very astringent, somewhat bitter. I actually got a sore throat from drinking it. I then tried blending small amounts of it with other teas. I tried 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp gyokuro, the green was completely overpowered by the white. Threw that batch out as well. Then I tried blending 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp monkey picked oolong. The result was okay, but then I went to the bathroom. My urine smelled like burnt plastic!?!?!?!? It was so bad that I actually searched the house to find the source of the chemical fire. It was the next time I went that I realized where the odor was coming from. I've never experienced anything like that before. Bottom line, I probably won't be purchasing ANY teavana products again.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: This tea is horrible. The product has a dirty laundry smell and does not taste much better. I expected better from something so expensive. It is simply not worth it. Cheaper white teas from other brands are much better. Rishi, H&S, and numerous other tea companies have better white tea. In all honesty, this tastes worse than bagged tea. Teavana has some good products, but they are just too overpriced.<br /><br />Did I mention how horrible Teavana's customer service is? They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern.

review/text: So I was looking for more snacks and got the gummies. Was pleased to get this earlier than I imagined. I have been looking to lose weight and try and live healthier in general and know fruits are good to try and these low fat gummies can really help me lose weight. I am not at all diabetic and tried the fruit before too I think, along with the mandarins oranges (kind of like those). This is tasty and I want to try this flavor more often. I just have to start being responsible when it comes to my weight and my cholesterol. Not that I am an overeater just am happy to get something sweet that isn't as fattening but very good to have around when I get hungry. I get hungry and reach for more. Very flavorful. I couldn't be happier and I eat candy and sweet things whenever I want so I know what I'm talking about. Do try if you are searching for snacks or candy you want to make sure you have a bag. It's so unique of a flavor and in a good way not like anything you wouldn't really enjoy the flavor is amazingly good.

Their flavor is fresh and bright, and they taste just like the real thing, but with that fun gummy texture.<br />The lychee gummies are no exception. They have the aroma and pleasant aftertaste the fruit has with the hint of tanginess--they taste a hint more like the fresh kind than the canned, for those of you that have had both.

review/text: These are nice because they have a subtle flavor, but I like the flavor to linger on such a mild candy.  I really like Kasugai Litchi (Lychee) Hard Candies better.  This is a nice gummy candy because it does not stick to teeth.  I really like Lychee fruit like the other person.  I have had them at restaurants.  Orange Flavor gummies are really better because they are more intense flavor and that is what I like in a gummy I have decided.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/text: Kombu is a wonderful energizer, especially during the summer and in the cold and flu season.<br /><br />Drop one strip into boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, remove and cut into smaller pieces.  Add to 6 cups of water, then add 12 teaspoons of shiro Miso (mild white miso), heat and stir until miso dissolves.  Avoid boiling the ingredients. Add cubed tofu (soft is best), spinach or swiss chard cut into thin strips, shiitake mushrooms cut in thin strips and scallions thinly cut including the green part (reserve half for soup garnish). Heat, but do not boil, for about 10 minutes.  Servie with a splash of soy sauce for a little extra flavor.<br /><br />The Kombu has a very mild flavor and best if not overcooked or over softened.  Great for vegans and better than chicken soup!<br /><br />Enjoy !

review/summary: Terrible product! Expensive, tricked, distasteful and embarrassing
review/text: I have never written a bad review in my life, but I felt this was way beyond what i could take. I had recently moved for work and my husband wanted to send me a surprise birthday gift that I could share with my co-workers. So, he spent over $50 and ordered mini cup cakes from this site and gave them the exact address and department that it needs to be sent to. However, the package did not have department address, just the main address, so it traveled all around the company and landed on my boss's desk! She informed me and when I went to pick it up, I told her that it was cupcakes and she invited all my co-workers to share my birthday. Can you imagine the shock, when I opened the box and had to pass out 30 boxes of candy to my new co-workers instead of cup cakes? They tried to be a good sport and tasted it .... it was terrible ... it had all melted and stuck together in the heat like one big discolored, shapeless flat blob! I felt sick and was throwing up after it and so did couple of my co-workers. I was so embarrassed, I had made a fool of myself, made myself and new co-workers sick, wasted everyone's precious time and my husband spent over $50 for this!!! I spent my birthday evening alone, crying and throwing up. I feel so embarrassed interacting with any of my co-workers who had to suffer from this experience. I am very disappointed with the product and service.

review/summary: Amazing, and real!
review/text: This is an amazing product and I use it often.  I'm a classically trained executive chef with experience working in some of the nicest restaurants around the world, including with real fresh truffles in France and Italy, and this is the flavor.<br /><br />I've done comparisons and find it to be just as strong as the competition and it tastes like real truffles, not their synthetic counterpart.  99% of all other truffle oils out there are made with a synthetic flavor that tastes and smells similar to truffles, whereas this is flavored only with real truffles (hence the organic certification they can't use chemical flavorings).

review/text: This is by far the worst black truffle oil I've ever tasted.  It's all oil, no truffle.  Most quality truffle oils only need a few drops for flavor - this should take the entire bottle and still not get enough.  I was hoping that by purchasing organic I'd get the quality I've come to know, but certainly not in this case.  Stay away from this mess!

review/summary: Smooth... Almost Too Smooth
review/text: I have tried Stolichnaya, Grey Goose, Absolut, Svedka, Smirnoff, Tito's, Three Olives, Belvedere, Van Gogh, and then an oddball of foreign vodkas, supposedly of premium quality. All these brands have their strengths and weaknesses, and some of them taste very nice.<br /><br />However, NONE of them are as smooth as Effen vodka.<br /><br />Effen vodka is actually engineered to appeal to a young crowd, and their innovative methods of purification and distillation differ from the usual vodka brands. Personally, I've found- while doing a blindfolded test of popular vodka brands- that Effen is not only the smoothest vodka of the brands listed above, but the tastiest; you can actually spend less time feeling the burn (which doesn't exist in Effen vodka btw) and more time appreciating the ingredients the distillery used to make such a fine product.<br /><br />The bottle, needless to say, is pretty sleek and sexy.<br /><br />I highly doubt you'd be disappointed with such a vodka. Please try one today...

review/summary: Delicious treats... LIMITED selection!
review/text: I love Chupa Chups. Trust me, I am very happy that this product is for sale on Amazon. Unfortunately, however, the folks who wrote reviews about the lack of selection were correct.<br /><br />I appreciated the reviewer who broke his 100 lollipops down by flavor - I will do the same thing here (below).<br /><br />These are the four flavors guaranteed to be inside this container, based on the web page on Amazon and the outside packaging of the pops (it lists the 4 flavors on the outside of the container). It's false advertising, for the most part.<br /><br />Strawberry Yogurt = 54<br /><br />Mango Yogurt = 1<br /><br />Chocolate & Vanilla Ice Cream = 26<br /><br />Strawberries & (Vanilla) Cream = 19<br /><br />I am giving this product 3 stars because it was basically a quality product (meaning I could consume/use the contents). I took away 2 stars for the promise of the presence of 4 flavors. I've read all the arguments that these are "random" selections, but let's face it: some flavors are more popular than others. In my batch, more than half were one flavor; this dispels the myth of randomness, since picking from 4 categories "at random" (mathematically) would not result in this extreme dispensation of flavors, for example 54 Strawberry Yogurts.<br /><br />You won't regret buying these, because they are delicious and awesome. You may want to shop around for a better selection, though - especially if you're a fan of all the flavors, like I am. I would have really loved an assortment.<br /><br />Enjoy your sweets, wherever ye may find them. Thanks for reading.

review/summary: My picky eater Phat Boy LOVES this...
review/text: My precious young cat "Phat Boy Cuddlecuss" is a VERY picky eater and he has a very sensitive stomach which he takes medication for. He won't eat Science Diet, Blue, Pro Plan, Fancy Feast and just about any other expensive canned cat food there is. My vet even prescribed Science Diet ID for Sensitive Gastrointestinal and he ate that for about a week and then he'd never touch it again.<br /><br />As soon as I pull these Whiska's open he comes running. So far he likes all the flavors he's tried so far- Filet Mignon, Rostisserie Chicken (his favorite!), Roasted Turkey, 2 Tuna varieties and the King Crab version. When you open these they have a lot of meat juices which looks just like meat juices that you'd have from cooking a steak and letting it rest correctly (au jus). It doesn't seem to dry out like other canned cat foods if you have some leftover.<br /><br />Usually, you can find these at Wal-Mart for .54 and other stores at .69 each. Whiska's usually has some great coupons for B1G1 if you go to their website. So, unless you just want the ease of having them delivered, you can find a better deal for these than they are listed here.<br /><br />Overall, these are great cat food for my picky eater with a sensitive stomach. For my 5 cats one of these split up lasts only through one feeding, but, I like knowing that they are always fresh. I'd recommend as this is the ONLY canned food that my Phat Boy Cuddlecuss will eat.

review/summary: Perfect Pancakes
review/text: I simply love Bob's Red mill products, and love Amazon for selling them for quite a bit less than Whole Paycheck. I've been enjoying a lot of things from them recently, including Kamut Breakfast Cereal and a really delicious soup mix. Their Buckwheat Pancake mix is another example of a healthy, tasty, and reasonably priced item from Bob's Red Mill. I got a taste for Buckwheat pancakes as a kid (My mom used to make them on cold mornings in January), but stopped eating them as an adult. My wife LOVES pancakes, and while I enjoy them too, I find the regular kind not keep me filled up, nor are they particularly healthy. I remembered that I used to really like buckwheat pancakes, and decided to hunt some up. I found these, and have been enjoying them ever since.<br /><br />The mix is easy to prepare, but this isn't a 'complete' mix and does require an egg and some oil in addition to cold water. As an alternative you can use milk, which gives the pancakes a slightly richer flavor. Milk or water, either way they're tasty! Buckwheat is a wholegrain, meaning these fill you up and keep you filled much longer than traditional pancakes which are full of sugar and cheap carbs. I can eat probably a dozen regular pancakes. I can only manage to put away 5-6 of these guys!<br /><br />A few recommendations on preparation:<br /><br />1) Mix the pancake batter and then let it sit 30 minutes or even an hour in your refrigerator. It makes the pancakes lighter and fluffier.<br /><br />2) Go for thinner batter rather than thick. It makes the pancakes easier to cook, and gives you a tastier pancake as a result.<br /><br />3) Cook on medium heat, not high. Because the batter is dark to begin with, it is harder to tell when your pancakes are done without overcooking them. Use less heat to help you get them cooked perfectly.<br /><br />4) You can easily mix this batter with a regular pancake mix to make 'hybrid' cakes if you find these are a bit too thick for your taste. I've gone that route a few times for my wife since she likes her pancakes less dense than these.<br /><br />5) Get yourself some real maple syrup! Nothing goes as well with Buckwheat pancakes than real maple syrup! That's how the American pioneers ate them, and I love feeling like I'm participating in an American tradition when I make these for my family.<br /><br />6) Eat them for dinner! Pancakes and eggs for dinner is amazing.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with these pancakes. Buy them. Cook them. Eat them. Repeat!

review/summary: Pretty Good Mix, but You Can Do WAY Better From Scratch
review/text: BOB'S VS. BISQUICK:<br />I went to Bob's Buckwheat Pancake Mix (have now gone through two 4-packs!) from using Bisquick, mainly to get away from the refined flour and get some better, whole grain nutrition.  I'm happy I did, and wouldn't go back; it's my body I'm feeding.  The negative is, and some others have noted it here, is that this mix doesn't produce particularly light, fluffy pancakes.  They're good, but not super light like Bisquick did.  Maybe if you beat and fold in egg whites (but I don't eat eggs).  That's not to say they don't rise, or they aren't good, and great tasting.<br /><br />BOB'S VS MADE FROM SCRATCH<br />No comparison.  I bought organic bulk buckwheat flour (which you can get pretty inexpensive in a 25lb bag if you're a nut) from Amazon; search for "Great River Organic Milling."  I then made my own egg-less, butter-less, milk-less version from something I found on the web:<br /><br />3/4c Buckwheat flour<br />3/4c Whole wheat flour<br />1.5 tsp Baking Powder<br />1/2 tsp Baking Soda (I think you could switch this to Baking Powder, but this came from the recepie)<br />1/4 tsp salt<br />1 tbsp (that's tablespoon) Agave Nectar (you can totally skip this; it's a low glycemic index sweetener)<br />2 tbsp olive oil (you could use melted coconut oil if you're worried about the heat on the olive oil).  I wouldn't skip the oil though; buckwheat can be a bit sticky on the pan, even a no-stick.<br />water to consistency (I'm assuming you've made pancakes before; I never measure my water)<br />*Cook IMMEDIATELY after adding the water.  Do not let it sit around for 20 min.<br />*Cook on lightly oiled no-stick pan; I use cast iron and it's great, but you do need a little oil as Buckwheat is a bit sticky.<br /><br />Good lord, they were ridiculously light and fluffy.  Amazingly so.  Blew Bob's out of the water.  I haven't tried 100% buckwheat flour yet, but after doing some more reading, it appears that would work fine as well.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Bob's mix produces pancakes that are so heavy in comparison, because it's basically the same ingredients.  Perhaps it's something about a fresh mix.  Maybe the baking powder/soda goes flat????  I have no idea, but I'm doing all mine from scratch from now on.  No question about it.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />If you really want to just open a bag and use it, I think Bob's is great stuff, and good for you.  If you want super fluffy pancakes, make your own; they're much better, and that way you can also go all-Buckwheat.

review/summary: Nostalgia on a plate ...
review/text: I grew up eating buckwheat pancakes about once a week for breakfast in the midwest.  Until I was in my 20s, I didn't know there was any other kind!<br /><br />This mix is VERY close to what I remember eating as a child. If you've never had buckwheat before, you're in for a treat.  It has a distinctive "nutty" flavor that can't be duplicated.  This mix is easy to prepare, and the pancakes cook up fluffy, although a bit more dense than buttermilk pancakes, and with plenty of good buckwheat flavor.  I enjoy them with real maple syrup (which I also purchase here on Amazon), or with the wonderful huckleberry syrup I can now get here in the Pacific NW.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill products are available locally in grocery stores, but at much higher cost than Amazon.  I plan to keep some of this mix around so i can treat friends and family to a these hearty tasty pancakes.

review/text: The Buckwheat pancakes have a hearty, earthy flavor that is appreciated by most, but not all people.  For those who prefer white bread and Bisquick pancakes, these will be a bit heavy and the dark brown color was an objection one friend had.  For me, however, these cannot be beat, especially with real Maple syrup and fresh blueberries.  Bob's Red Mill products are a good deal through Amazon, as compared to grocery stores.  The packs of 4 keep the product fresh until use.

review/summary: Not Aunt Jemina's !
review/text: An American breakfast tradition is fading from too much competition for market shelf space and corporate mindset. Every market used to carry two or three brands of buckwheat mix. "Bob's" is the only buckwheat mix I can can find now in CA stores, and that's at a health food store. It does make buckwheat pancakes but they're dry, cardboard-like, very heavy, and not at all like the lighter, moister Aunt Jemima buckwheats that were my favorites for over 50 years. If you buy this to replace the discontinued classic Aunt Jemima mix, you'll be disappointed.

review/text: Although I'm going to keep the product (because I like Caramel Macchiatos), I didn't get the item that was pictured. I wanted the Gevalia brand and instead, I received a Tassimo Caramel Latte Machiato, 80 ct, from Maxwell House, a completely different manufacturer's brand.  As I said, I will keep this shipment, but when someone orders something, what arrives should be the item that is pictured on the website.  Even the "Item being reviewed" window on this page shows the Gevalia brand in the brown packaging...not the the Maxwell House in the silver packaging.

review/summary: I feel at peace with the world when I drink this Zen Tea......
review/text: Tazo has done it again, folks.  When they concocted Zen, they definitely knew what they were doing.  For starters, this isn't your abuela's green tea.  Zen has notes of ingredients that include exotic green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint and natural flavor.  I especially took note of the spearmint, upon sipping it for the first time.  It's invigorating and dances on your tongue.  You can drink Zen with (or without) honey.  It's really your preference.  The tea tastes great on its own, but honey adds a great note of sweetness to this wonderful blend of herbal and green tea.  This is one habit you don't need to worry about breaking.  If you are ever feeling stressed out, make a date with yourself and set five minutes aside to sip this lovely beverage.  You won't be sorry.

review/summary: Zesty spearmint and lemon are modulated by green tea into a substantial potion!
review/text: Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor. The aroma is sweet spearmint. The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample.

review/summary: Good for Some Things, Not So Much for Others
review/text: I bought this because I'm trying to find a decent alternative to Splenda that I can use in beverages and baking.<br /><br />I drink LOTS of iced tea, all year round and that's primarily what I hoped to use this for. Unfortunately, I did not like the taste of it in my beloved iced tea. I admit I'm picky about my iced tea and this just didn't taste good to me.<br /><br />It's pretty good in hot teas and I made an apple cake that was heavenly! I'd recommend using the tartest apples you can find such as granny smith because the recipe called for one cup of sugar and I used only a scant half cup of the agave, it was plenty sweet. When I make the recipe again, I'll use slightly less.<br /><br />I made peanut butter oatmeal cookies and they were good but I did notice that the bottoms brown MUCH MUCH faster when I use this syrup than when I use Splenda. I'd definitely recommend using insulated cookie sheets or slightly lowering the oven temp for cookie recipes. Also though my recipe calls for creamy peanut butter, next time I'll use crunchy because the cookie batter was pretty sticky which can also cause the bottoms to brown faster. To "fix" the cookie batter I made, I added chopped peanuts and that seemed to help.<br /><br />I also made banana bread with this and usually my banana bread (made with half whole wheat flour and half white flour) has a pretty dense texture. Using this syrup made it have a "fall apart" density/texture which sort of annoyed me though it did have a good flavor. Next time I'll try using slightly less and see if that doesn't help it hold together more.<br /><br />The downside to this syrup is that I, like many other reviewers, received one bottle that had leaked and WHAT A HORRIBLE MESS! Also the bottles are just wrong. The opening causes drips and no matter how hard I tried not to let it, it would always drip down the side of the bottle and required wiping off with a wet paper towel. I didn't see on the bottle if this required refrigeration after opening or not. I just refrigerated just in case and it fell over inside my refrigerator and though the cap was tightly screwed on and closed, it leaked in there too and was a big pain to clean off the glass shelf and I cannot imagine the nightmare if you have the open wire kind of shelves because at least it was contained on just one shelf in my fridge.<br /><br />Bottom line: Unfortunately, I still like the taste of Splenda better though I'm afraid it's not good for me and also, the agave is NOT portable and cannot really be taken with you easily to use away from home. I would buy this again to use in baking but will continue to search for something else to use in beverages.

review/summary: just like sugar
review/text: i think this is an excellent and healthy alternative to sugar for sweetening anything. i made some ginger cookies using this and molasses as my only sweeteners. the batter is runnier than if using sugar, so i added a pinch more baking soda and a little more flour. their website has recipes. i disagree that this is like pancake syrup. it is much healthier than maple or imitation corn syrup-based syrups, but it is watery. also, in cold drinks it thickens up like honey does, so it takes longer to dissolve. sweeten your iced tea when you first make it before adding ice and hot drinks or hot cereals or baking is no problem. it has no after taste or unique taste (like honey does) whatsoever, so is equal to sugar in its uses without the spikes in blood sugar. i think this will become the new sweetener of the future due to its lower glycemic index and that it's much healthier than the lab-created high fructose corn syrups or artificial sweeteners. i hope the price comes down as well. this sells regular price for $5.99/each at whole foods market here, so it is not a huge savings to order online considering you have to buy a case, but convenient especially with free shipping. i am going to order the dark next time to use in place of brown sugar in recipes and maybe for pancake syrup. i highly recommend this syrup for all your sweetening!

review/summary: Organic Blue Agave?  Not sure it's for me!
review/text: I had high expectations but am riding the fence about it so far.  It's syrupy which is okay except it doesn't dissolve in iced tea.  In hot tea, it leaves somewhat of a strange taste.  I've used it on my morning cereal by putting it on the cereal before adding the milk and it seems to work.  Maybe I just need to get used to it but, so far, it's a slow process.  There weren't any guidelines on how to use it and that probably would have been helpful.  I'll continue to try using it, though, until I'm fully convinced one way or the other.

Since I knew the product was still good, being a sugar source, I just washed off the agave outside of the bottles. Am I concerned about ordering again this product? Yes, even though getting a great deal on the product, paying for sloppy work isn't my cup of tea.<br />The agave has a smoother taste then honey and the flavor blends in better to what it is added to.

review/summary: Agave "Nectar" is a scam
review/text: from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word "Agave" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as "diabetic friendly". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing," said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses", she told me. "Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.

review/summary: Best sweetener you can buy
review/text: I discovered this sweetener a couple of months ago and have been a huge fan ever since. I have tried stevia, Splenda, and any other sweetener that claims to taste "just like sugar" and always find that they do not, in fact taste anything like sugar. I am not one of those supertasters either, but I definitely am one of those people who never drinks diet soda or any food that has been processed to make it lower in fat or calories. They never taste right, so because of a fundamental unwillingness to compromise flavor, I believe that it is better to eat less of something than load up on chemicals. Blue Agave nectar is absolutely as close to sugar in taste as you can get without actually being sugar. It is low in calories, tastes like sugar, is natural and has a low GI index. The only things I have used it in so far are coffee and ice tea and for these things, it is perfect. I cannot vouch for how it stands up in baked goods but I am going to be trying that soon.

review/summary: Wonderful Natural Sweetener
review/text: Any of the Wholesome brand Organic Blue Agave sweeteners are wonderful.  They taste great and they do the trick in sweetening your drink (or whatever you want to sweeten :-)  Because it is sweeter than sugar (at least to me it is) I find that I only need a little squirt, probably less than a teaspoon for a 24 oz cup of tea.  It is liquid and flows easy, so you can use in ice tea or hot tea.  It is a natural sweetener, extracted from the agave cactus plant.<br /><br />The sturdy plastic bottle with the flip-open and flip-close cap states that it is a low glycemic index sweetener and is slowly absorbed into the body, preventing sugar spikes (important for diabetics).<br /><br />The bottle I have in my hand is the "light"  variety and has 60 calories in a tablespoon.<br /><br />The bottle states this product can also be added for baking or anywhere you would use sugar.  There is a website for recipes www.organicsyrups.biz.<br /><br />On a side note:  I went to a tea lecture recently, by a tea expert.  If you are interested in the health benefits of green tea, red tea, and white teas, she said that adding a chemical sweetener or refined sugar (white) chemically alters the health properties in the teas.  That is one of the reasons I searched for good alternative sweeteners that are healthy and non-chemical.  The agave nectar tastes like sugar.  It does NOT taste like the artificial sugars.  Even stevia (which is said to be natural) has an imitation sugar taste to me.

So I picked up this light agave syrup from a health-food grocery store.  I just made my first cup of tea with it, and I have to say I really like it.  It's a subtly different flavor than white sugar, I'd say your initial thought is slightly toward honey even though it doesn't have honey's strong taste, it's a softer flavor than white sugar or fake sugar somehow.  In all, a very pleasant taste, and I will certainly tell the office baker about it :)

You definitely can back off the amount of sweetener you use with this product. That makes up for the price. I found it at Costco for a cheaper price than online. Definitely give this product a try!

review/summary: Sweetness for Diabetics
review/text: My husband has diabetes and dislikes the aftertaste of artifical sweeteners. Agave is a wonderful solution.  It provides good taste and no spikes in blood sugar levels.  It does contain calories, so moderation is the key, as in anything we eat or drink.

review/summary: Great low glycemic index sweetener / Buy 6 23.5 oz & save $
review/text: at this writing, the Subscribe & Save price is the best value that i have found on the web or in stores on this great item.  We've been able to use it in many cooking applications (cranberry sauce comes to mind first) as well as in beverages, though we've not attempted to make pastries or the like with it as yet.  Where there's a will, there's a way  :-)

review/summary: Very Happy
review/text: Having first tried this brand at Trader Joe's and liking it, I decided to take the plunge and buy more in a larger amount.  The shipment arrived with no problems.  I use agave nectar for my morning coffee instead of white sugar and like it because it adds sweetness, not other flavor like honey does (agave has a slight flavor).  While there were no container leakage problems during delivery, I have had some occasional leakage after using the bottle.  Just a drop or two that will run down the side to the bottom, even with a tight cap.  Not a big deal as it cleans up easier than honey with just a little water.  I am very happy with Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Blue Agave.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: I totally agree with most everyone out there that this is THE sweetener to use in iced tea.  The flavor is much more neutral than honey, brown rice, syrup, or barley malt syrup.  Mixed with pure lime juice, it is a wonderful tropical fruit salad glaze...try it over strawberries, mangos, bananas and blackberries.  Mmmmm!  Free shipping makes this the best price around.  Love it!

review/text: with all of the info. on the dangers of chemical artificial sweeteneres, I was pleased to find a natural alternative that tastes great. I use it in hot bevereages and on hot cereals. I suppose you could use in cold beverages, but it would be like honey - hard to dissolve in cold.

review/summary: Best discovery I've made in a long time
review/text: I stumbled across this product in my grocery. I've been concerned that I'm using too much artificial sugar substitute, so was looking for an alternative that was hopefully natural. I tried Stevia, but something just wasn't quite right with the taste. Someone else finally nailed the reason for me....there is a mild licorice taste to Stevia, and I HATE licorice. I tried the light Blue Agave and LOVE it. There are so many great things about this product: taste is great, low glycemic index effect, and it's all natural. I use it in my tea, greek yogurt, and on top of waffles. It's very sweet, so you don't have to use much. It tastes like a mild honey to me. I am so pleased with the product that I ordered the cookbook. I purchased it from Amazon in bulk, because it's a much better price than the grocery. This is now a staple in my kitchen cabinet. Thank you, thank you to the manufacturer, and to Amazon.

review/summary: Blue Agave  light Swetener
review/text: I discovered the Organic Blue Agave Light Sweetener when I found out I could not use regular refined sugar. I have been using the product for over a year now and am pleased with the way my body tolerates it.<br />I buy enough cases to make sure I do not run out of the product.<br />Using Amazon.com has been very convenient for the purchase.I never have to wait long for the delivery.  I recommend it to all the people who can no longer use regular granulated sugar.
