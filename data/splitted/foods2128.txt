review/summary: Flavored Cream
review/text: I use flavored cream for my coffee, and this was a great buy.  I would have paid alot more in the stores.  I would not have got more then 24 creams pre a box and paid almost 3.00 dollars for it.  I will buy my flavored cream this way for now on as long as I can get it.

review/summary: Amazon still not padding this item properly
review/text: I decided that I couldn't beat the price on these creamers since the local grocery store went up to more than .13 cents a creamer.  As at least one previous reviewer reported, many of the creamers arrived leaking.  The creamer box was only padded on two sides by air bags leaving the other two sides and the top and bottom in direct contact with the sides of the shipping box.  Most of the creamers, including all the broken ones, had compression marks from shipping.<br /><br />At least Amazon gave me a 20% refund for the broken creamers and I was able to wash off the residue from the unbroken ones.  I am disappointed that Amazon hasn't figured out by now that they need to pack this item more carefully.

review/summary: Review - third order of this product
review/text: I normally do not write reviews, however, I find them helpful when ordering online.  I had previously read an unfavorable review of this product but decided to give it a try anyway.  The first two times I ordered the creamers, I had no issues.  When I received the third order, I understood the negative review.  This is a great product: tates good, price point is good and easy to use for our coffee drinkers.  However, there are either QC issues or packaging/shipping issues.  The product arrived with the outside  saturated with leaking creamers.  Inside were many damaged creamers.  I did not take the time to inventory how many were leaking (let me just say many) but I was extremely disappointed in the condition they arrived.  I recently set up an automated order not only for this flavor but also 2 others.  Will have to determine if I can continue ordering when product arrives damaged and unusable.  Do I have recourse on damaged product???

review/text: I bought 288 ct Hazelnut flavor. Flavor is good and strong, for people who like nutty flavors in their coffee, this is the way to go.<br />Some reviews said when they received theirs it was almost expired. I guess I was pretty lucky, cause it has more than 6 months of shelf life when I received it.<br />I like it can be stored at room temperature, it's good for people don't have refrigerator at office space and good for traveling!

review/summary: never order again
review/text: I ordered the large box of creamers for the office. It seemed we were always running out. I compared the cost and it would have been much cheaper to continue to buy at the store but I was tired of stopping.<br />The box arrived with 1/8 of the creamers broken open or having the creamer all over it and still not useable.<br />So the overall cost became even more so when you consider the damaged creamers.

review/text: Another reviewer gave this product a one star rating because of delivery problems.  Amazon stands behind it's customers and would have quickly replaced the damage creamers or refunded her money.  The product is good and I recommend it with one caveat.  Each pod has 1 gram of saturated fat and 40 calories.

review/summary: Slightly sweet, slightly astringent, extremely delicious!
review/text: I can't even begin to enumerate the uses I've found for this amazing product. Mix it with a little flax seed oil for a sweet, healthy dressing. Marinate chicken or seafood, bake, and it will turn into a sweet glaze. Mix it into stir fries. Add it to sweet potatoes, carrots, butternut squash, or any other sweet-ish veggie instead of sugar. Fry up some chopped bacon, caramelize some onions in the bacon grease, and use the Honey Ginger Condiment to deglaze the pan for an amazing sauce to put on nearly any vegetable, such as french green beans, asparagus, broccoli, snow peas, or sugar snaps.<br /><br />Honey and Ginger Condiment by Acetum is vinegar based, but has a complex sweetness with just a hint of ginger. The sweetness curbs some of the astringency of the vinegar flavor, making it quite mild and versatile. I buy 2 bottles at a time to ensure that I never run out!

review/text: Simply a convenient way to supplement salts when needed. For me that's at centuries where the organizers dilute the sport drinks or only have water available. As a heavy salt sweater and subsequent cramper, I need the extra 'lytes. By the way. The way to cure(minimize)muscle cramps is to over-condition for your events; hydrate; get enough electrolytes and calories. I think conditioning is the biggest factor next to heat.

review/summary: El Sabroso Guacachips
review/text: I recently purchased a case of these chips, thinking they'd be on par with their cousin, the blazin' hot, nacho tortilla chips...they were not. These chips did not have the classic 'stone ground' flavor, but neither were they billed as such...they were ok. The guacamole coating was severely lacking in zest. If they could have ramped-up the cheddar and sour cream flavors, which I couldn't detect at all, I might have been able to rate these as four stars. If you're going to order these chips, I'd advise you to have some savory dips standing by!

I decided to let him open them early because I was so excited that he may find guacamole chips that he liked as good as the doritos brand. These are NOT it! They are not bad if you have some dip, but by themselves we found them bland.

review/text: I have bought these nuggets from Amazon direct at a good price (can't remember an exact amount they cost but it was very reasonable. Now to order these, because Amazon no loner stocks, requires going to an outside source and the prices are unbelievable. They end up costing $6.00 or more, in part because the shipping is so high, but also the price per item is out of sight. $6.00 for a bag of candy I can buy in my local grocery price for about $3.75 at most. It was more convenient to buy from Amazon in large quantity, but not at these prices!

review/text: I have high blood pressure and love pretzels.  I felt deprived of my favorite snack until I found this product.  I had tried other low salt pretzels, but they were just not very good.  Then, while visiting in Florida I discovered Snyder's of Hanover Unsalted Mini Pretzels.  They are delicious and only 75mg. of sodium for 20 mini pretzels.  The bonus is that they are fat free.  I could not find them anywhere in my area so Thank you to Amazon for selling them, and at a cheaper price than Snyder's website.  I even gave my doctor a bag.  He has high blood pressure too!

I decided to "splurge" on a bag of regular pretzels and gagged on them because of the amount of salt.  I had to throw away the bag.  I am sticking to these unsalted pretzels for as long as the company makes them.  I started having trouble finding them in local stores, so I was so excited to find them on Amazon and at a better price, too!!<br /><br />5/15 -- I was going to reorder again.  Wow -- the price has really gone up since I first ordered them and since my last order.  They are now about the price of getting them at the grocery store.  Hope the price goes back down soon.

review/summary: Perfect afternoon snack to help avoid a feeding frenzy
review/text: I love the fact that these pretzels come in 100 calorie packs. It is just the right amount for an afternoon snack. We have a bunch of pretzels, peanuts, almonds, etc. on a snack table at work. Around 2:30 every afternoon my resolve to stay away from the salty, filling (and fattening) yummy goodness on the table would start to wane. By 2:32 I would be coming up with reasons to hover around the snack table. By 2:40 I'd be covered in peanut shells, done with my feeding frenzy and figuring out how I was going to avert a repeat performance tomorrow. Then I found Snyder's of Hanover 100 Calorie packs. Seriously, folks, they are my saving grace. And they have just the right amount of salt. I thought 60 bags would be a ridiculous amount if pretzels to purchase, but it worked out great, they lasted a couple of months and I've already purchased another box.

Since moving to the midwest, I have not been able to find them.  I was very disappointed in them when they were shipped.  About 1/4 of the bag was pieces and crumbs.  Another reviewer mentioned this and I should have known, but I really had been craving pretzels and was hoping that Snyders had fixed their problem with shipping. Pretzels, great; shipping not so goood.

review/summary: Salt Free Pretzels
review/text: It had been more and more difficult to find decently priced Salt free pretzels in the stores.  The price offered by the case plus the free shipping made it possible to have a continual supply of unsalted pretzels in the house, without paying an arm and a leg.  The only problem was that, with the change of the expiration date on the credit card, Amazon's instructions resulted in my buying two cases instead of one.  But, the product is worth the price.

review/summary: Good Snack for Kids and Adults Alike
review/text: Not all pretzels are created equal.  These are fat free, and made from, if I'm not mistaken, a whole grain flour.  If I had a bag on hand, I'd look at the ingredients label and tell you exactly what kind of whole grain flour, but we're out at the present time (what a surprise).  My daughter loves to snack on these, and as a snack item, they beat a bunch of alternatives hands down.  The only thing..... they're addictive.  Get yourself a little bowl and don't go back for more!  Moderation in all things......

review/summary: Lee Kum Kee Premium Soy Sauce
review/text: This is a great product for people who are into Asian cuisine.  It has a more subtle flavor than the Lee Kum Kee Dark Soy Sauce (see my review for that) but like the Dark Sauce, is less salty than the soy sauce products generally available in the U.S.A.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />My one concern is that it comes in packs of 2 and the bottles are quite large (16.9 oz. each) so if you don't do a lot of asian cooking it may expire before you can use it up.

review/summary: light sparkling clean taste
review/text: This is an excellent soy sauce, the taste is light and sparkling and it won't overwhelm your meat or vegetable taste. I discover it in "Asian food to go" with small condiment packages and it satisfies everytime. No, it won't bring your food to new dimension, it enhances the taste of your main ingredient whatever it is - meat, poultry or seafood if you prefer it to salt.<br /><br />Regarding expiration date - soy sauce or fish sauce can last for years if full and unopened in a bottle, if it comes in a big bottle, pour them in smaller glass bottles to the rim with air tight lids, put in dark place and use one at a time to prevent oxidation that spoils and alters the taste. Air and temp spoil foods<br /><br />I have tried different brand of soy sauces, this is the most satisfied soy sauce available in USA

If you like salty flavors and like chips over sweets, then you'll probably like this.  Very salty and slightly meaty flavored.  And it is vegan.  My dad says it tastes like an old barn smells.

review/summary: A Yankee's take on a British staple
review/text: Having lived in the US all of my life (although I have traveled quite a bit) I had never heard of Marmite until last week. I've been participating in an on-line, UK based think-tank dealing with international brands and digital advertising. As we discussed products that we grew up with and are still loyal to Marmite came up several times. I looked at some Marmite ads (the British call them "adverts"), and then searched for it on Amazon. Being a dedicated foodie I decided to give it a shot. Here is my impression:<br /><br />When I first opened the glass jar and gave it a whiff it seemed oddly familiar. I put just a dab on my spoon and tasted it straight. Again, strangely familiar. The taste was very strong, almost condensed. I could taste the beer-like yeast but I was also getting a savory, deep vegetable flavor. Then it hit me.<br /><br />I love to make sauces and I often use pre-made glaces and demi-glaces which have a very thick consistency when gently heated (before heating they are almost solid). They come in many different varieties: beef; duck; veal; chicken; lamb; seafood; mushroom; vegetable; etc. Marmite has a strong resemblance to a straight, undiluted, vegetable glace. Pungent, earthy and with that quality that the Japanese refer to as "Umami". WOW! Who knew? Well, I guess a lot of people did but it was new to me. Now, what to do with it...<br /><br />My on-line British friends gave me some sage advice: use it sparingly and on some sort of bread with butter. I bought some fresh English Muffin bread from a local artisan bakery shop, lightly toasted it, coated it thinly with about 2/3 teaspoon of Marmite and spread some salted Vermont cultured butter onto it. HEAVEN! The Marmite balanced out the heaviness of the butter perfectly. That gave me the inspiration for my next test. I've alway loved a toasted bagel with cream cheese or Marscapone but need something to cut the palate-coating fat of the cheese besides a slice of onion (lox works well if you have it). Marmite fit the bill technically, but I think that I will have to get used to the combination. Still, I will keep using it here for a while and I think that it might become a favorite for me.<br /><br />Next I tried it in a simple sauce. I browned a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter (who am I kidding? I used 2 tablespoons of butter). After the shallots were browned I added 3 tablespoons of Marite and 1 teaspoon of water. I reduced it a little and added 1/3 cup of heavy cream, a small bouquet garnet in cheesecloth and 1 tablespoon of dry sherry. I reduced it by about half and adjusted the strength by adding more Marmite (I needed more, maybe I should have used less cream). When finished it tasted really good, not great but it could certainly WOW most people. Put this on fish, chicken, turkey, or any light meat or veggie and it works.<br /><br />Marmite has an advertising campaign that tells people that they will either love it or hate it. I am definitely in the love camp.

review/text: I have never been outside the U.S. and I don't think I have a drop of British or Australian blood, but I love both Marmite and Vegemite, and get both at World Market (formerly Cost Plus World Market) for about $5 a jar. Marmite is more syrupy and salty than Vegemite / Vegemite is more solid and less salty (but still quite salty) than Marmite. VEGANS TAKE NOTE : both are good sources of vegan B vitamins, but Vegemite lacks the crucial B12 and Marmite HAS B12.

review/summary: Best spread thin with butter
review/text: Admittedly Marmite is an acquired taste, but many Americans who dislike it are just trying it wrongly. You spread it really thin, over butter (bread can be toast or bread - both are good), not thick, like peanut butter (it is a strong flavour). Our house is never without a jar and it's a staple of lunchbox sandwiches. The 500g jar is the best - fewer corners to try & scrape out.

review/summary: It 'might' deter mosquitoes...
review/text: On a visit to Australia I started having a daily bit of Vegemite, which is similar to Marmite but lacking B12. At home in North America I am normally a mosquito magnet - they love me! But I noticed in Oz that the 'mozzies' were leaving me alone, choosing to attack my non-Vegemite-ingesting wife instead. The only thing I could think of that was different was my daily intake of Vegemite.<br /><br />I've started having a bit of Vegemite or Marmite any time I think I may be exposed to mosquitoes and it really does do the trick. Your mileage may vary, but I think it may be worth some study. By the way, I have beer and/or bread nearly every day without any noticeable reduction of my mosquito attractiveness, so those items must not have the necessary concentration of yeast or whatever the little buggers find repugnant.

review/summary: Now I know why the British and Aussies drink so much beer
review/text: I decided to indulge my curious nature and try some. After all they say this brewers yest extract is chocked full of B-vitamins. I was told that Marmite is 'sweeter' than standard vegemite. Well - let me tell you- I could taste nothing sweet at all. The salt content was overwhelming and as they say - use it sparingly.<br /><br />If I were making a meat sandwich or some other dish requiring salt, I would easily substitute this product. As far as health, I'm sure people that must watch their sodium levels might have an issue. The material is slightly pungent but it was the saltiness that I remember most. I suppose it does taste better than drinking a bottle of soy sauce. The texture of Marmite reminds me of very thick molasses.<br /><br />My advice is that it would be a better substitute for salt since it brings in a large compliment of B-vitamins.  If you try to eat it by itself - a few pints of beer may be needed to prevent dehydration -lol.<br /><br />Cheers

The choice of herbs is a little odd but they all grow really well together.<br /><br />The cherry tomato kit was horrible.  It's a lot of work to try and get them to grow right and I've only had 1 tomato ever grow.  The stalks want to grow tall but without anything to support them they start toppling over.  Overall, way too much work to be worth it.  It's easier to grow tomatoes in a pot!

review/text: This is the first Aerogarden kit that I have not been pleased with. My two Cilantro pods did not sprout at all. I contacted Aerogarden and they said there is a known issue with the Cilantro and they are investigating ways to fix it. I would not recommend purchasing this kit until they work out the problem.<br /><br />The other herbs are growing just fine. The Epazote is growing like crazy- although I'm not sure what to cook with it.

review/summary: Gourmet Herb - mixed success - poor selection
review/text: My herbs initially grew far slower than the instruction book indicated. However, once they did get going - wow! I am having to clip every few days. I am using the classic aerogarden.<br /><br />There are a few disappointments, however. The choice to replace cilantro is really a disappointment, as it is an herb I use far more frequently than thyme. The basil is very overwhelming - two varieties are just too much. I can grow this one outside no problem, so I would have appreciated more delicate herbs. In any event, I feel like I am really wrangling with it to keep it from shadowing the others. The parsley has failed to grow very thickly, which gives me only a little every few weeks. The biggest disappointment are the chives. Only a few sprouted, maybe enough for 1 person every few weeks. Now that I think about it, the basil and mint are the only plants that have truly grown satisfactorily.  Honestly, I would hesitate to buy this particular kit again. Instead, I will stick with the cherry tomato kit for the winter and probably the salad greens in the summer.

review/summary: Romaine lettuce was easy to grow and has very large leaves now
review/text: I have enjoyed my Aero garden.  Everything, I have planted in it has done very well.  I never have to worry about pests that you normally get in an outside garden.  It involves a little maintenance but its worth the fresh edible food it provides!  The romaine lettuce I recently planted has flourished well is large and tastes great.  If you've never owned an Aero garden then I would say its worth owning.  Also, keep in mind that it's light is shines bright most hours of the day and part of the night so find a place in your house you wouldn't mind the bright light.  The garden, also provides a water trickling sound which is kind of zen.

review/summary: I must be doing something wrong
review/text: I love the idea of this product but I am definitely doing something wrong. I've tried 3 seed kits and I haven't had a terrific amount of luck. If all that you're interested in is basil, you have it made. Not much else seems to grow very well. My chives were a failure as were my purple basil, cilantro, and parsley. I called and complained to the company and they were kind enough to send to me another seed pack. The sweet basil flourished but everything else pretty much floundered.<br /><br />Truth be told, I would recommend growing your own basil, parsley, rosemary, cilantro, and chives during the warmer months. If you're fortunate enough to live in a large city, you can buy herbs from your grocery store for a relatively low price during the off seasons. I live in Houston and our Central Market sells organic herbs for $.99/bunch. I wrap my herbs in paper towels and bag them in plastic bags the day that I purchase them. They last for a few weeks. I definitely get my money's worth without having to spend a bundle on an Aerogarden. One caveat though, buy basil and use it within 3-4 days. It's great in salads too!

I'm EXTREMELY angry that I did not get what I ordered. If they were going to make a substition, they should have asked. If automatic substitions are their policy, they should state that in the description. If the description is wrong, THEY SHOULD FIX IT. This item has been listed with this description for MONTHS before I purchased it. If I had wanted 3 kinds of basil, I would have purchased the basil mix. I expressly wanted the chives and the parsley. Buyer beware.

review/text: Well, this is my fourth garden for my Pro-100, and so far I have more herbs than I can use.  The Basil always seems to do well, and this garden is no exception.  Tons of basil!<br /><br />The Cilantro has done better in this garden than it has ever done for me.  The parsley is growing nicely.  The only herb in this garden not doing so well is the chives, but to be honest I never use them anyway.<br /><br />Overall this is a great garden, if you are growing it, just keep pinching the tops of the basil off instead of raising the light, until all of the herbs catch up with the basil.  Otherwise you might have trouble with the mint and cilantro.<br /><br />Overall, this garden has been worth the money for me.  You can buy more herbs for the money at the store, but then again there is a convenience factor with these gardens.  You will always have some herbs available when you decide to cook a certain meal, without going to the store.

review/summary: Not quite as advertised
review/text: While my green bean garden hasn't yet made it to the blossoming stage, I'm somewhat disappointed with this kit for a couple of reasons, but mainly because the included accessories don't match the instruction booklet.  There are no holes in the seed pods to insert the support coil wires, which has resulted in about half of my bean plants falling over and breaking once they got more than about 6 inches high.  I've grown green beans indoors hydroponically by other methods, and the plants required lots of extra support.  I just don't see these plants reaching the harvest stage with the included equipment.  Also, one of the seeds failed to sprout - although the do give you a few extra, the one I replaced it with didn't sprout either, and by then there was no point in trying again as any further sprouts would be too far from the lights.

This way I can have them fresh all year even in the winter! This is great since I live in Ohio.<br />There is a good number of alternative kits at their website.I have purchased the Mexican herb kit also.<br />The original kit that came with the garden is growing very well and will be ready for harvest in a couple of weeks.<br />Very easy to set this up and care for.Mine is located in a dark corner of my dining room. It brightened up that room and easy accessed from the kitchen.<br />It does have an on time of 16 hours,but I have it set to go off at bedtime and it comes on early morning.<br />I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it highly for anyone who likes to grow their own herbs or lettuce etc...

review/text: I must say that my 3yr old and I have really enjoyed watching our Aerogarden grow.  It really is a lot of fun, and it's the first time that my 3yr old ate lettuce.  She has always refused to eat lettuce but I'm guessing  that actually planting it and watching it grow has encouraged her to try it.  So the garden is worth it from that point, but from a seasoned lettuce eater - yuck.  The lettuce is limp meaning there is nothing crisp about it at all.  It also has no taste.  I have tried a few different leaves from the garden and it doesn't taste like anything.  Maybe that's why my daughter likes to eat it.  My seeds are new so that's not the problem.  It's just tasteless and limp.

review/text: My husband loves having salad greens so I thought he would be pleased when I bought this. However, at first glance he thought it wasn't going to produce enough lettuce for the huge salads he likes to eat and he said he wished I had bought herbs instead like we did last time. So far we've harvested twice and the taste of the lettuce has been lovely. The first harvest was small, enough to decorate the side of two plates. The second salad was much larger, enough for two American style side salad plates. The chef pack comes with enough pods to grow an Aerogarden full of lettuce twice. I pulled off some lettuce for a sandwich once, and that seems like a good use of this thing (concerning the volume issue).

review/text: I got my areogarden as a gift a little over a year ago and was ecstatic. I live about 12 hours away from my family so when I  go home for Christmas or any other trip that takes over a week of being away from my aerogarden it dies because I cant add the water.<br />  My aerogarden came with the general herb kit and I found out the only herb I used from it was basil, so when my first batch starved from a lack of water I decided to get the master gardener kit. Because of my obsession with basil i planted an entire 7 pods of basil. I couldn't trim it back fast enough, I wound up tossing handfulls of basil because it was burning on the lights.<br />  Once again I had to starve my poor plants and go home for about a month, this time i planted only 2 basils and 5 flowers about 2 or 3 weeks ago and low and behold the basil is more than big enough to eat. None of the flowers have bloomed yet, but all are growing nicely.<br />  Honestly I want to buy another areogarden just to be able to play around with another master gardener kit. Its a very good value as well, $40 for 3 full rounds of plants (obviously you need to buy your own seeds). I've also heard that the dirt refills for the seed starter kit works with the master gardener kit too. 70 pods for $20 plus nutrients will get you 10 full rounds on a 7 pod areogarden. I love it ! !<br /><br />ps.. I kill every plant I put in the garden.. i an the true black thumb.. so if i can do this anyone can

review/summary: Some problems with germination
review/text: We've had an Aerogarden for two years now and love it.  This is the first time we have gotten the Japanese Herb Kit and it has some problems:  the Red Shiso, Green Shiso and Nira Chives did not germinate at all.  We e-mailed Aerogrow customer service department and they are sending us a new Japanese Herb Kit free of charge.  We've used the herbs that did germinate:  Chrysanthemum, Mitsuba and Cress in salads and on sandwiches.  The flavors of these herbs is interesting, but we are really looking forward to using the Red and Green Shiso, which are more widely used in Japanese food.
