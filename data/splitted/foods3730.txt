review/summary: Best Arizona Iced Tea Product!
review/text: I have only had this tea once. It was when I was on the west-coast for a wedding (I live in NY) and it was by far the most tasty and refreshing of the entire Arizona product line.  The tea is brewed with both black and white teas, and additionally contains sugar, which makes the iced tea stand out from the majority of iced teas and soft drinks on the market today.  As always, still a $1 for a 24oz. can!  When I find a local retailer (or a reasonably priced online-retailer) I will be more than happy to list some here.

review/summary: Extremely rare...
review/text: I've been looking for these all over the place by my house. The only time I see it is when I go on vacation to the Jersey Shore. Every vacation, I stock up and buy like 10 of these from a local convenience store in Asbury Park! Please make them available so I can stock up more than once a vacation! I still have two left in my fridge, waiting patiently for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner, purchased when I went on vacation in early June!<br /><br />This is by far my favorite Arizona product... Its light, yet flavorful. unbelievably thirst quenching, and made with real sugar. So much better than soda...

review/summary: Best tea ever!
review/text: I use to be able to get this at the local non franchise supermarket near my house. Haven't seen it in a while. I can get it at the liquor store right over the Indiana State Line. It says right on the can 99 cents, but I can usually get it for 89 cents. There is nowhere to get it anymore, but I am completely sure I wouldn't pay $60+ for a 24 pack. This vendor should be prosecuted for scalping. Tea is better than I can make at home, although I have been experimenting a little bit. I am unable to find plain white tea locally. I never checked online though.<br />Tea = GREAT!<br />Vendor = Should be arrested!

review/summary: I love this gum!  Cost per piece could be better
review/text: Let me begin by saying I love this gum.  Other reviewers do not like it but before taking their word for it, I suggest you try a small pack from elsewhere before buying a huge,  240 pieces in this 4-pack of 60.  If you like this gum, read on...<br /><br />I chew about 10-20 pieces of gum a day and always search for a more economical solution.  The big e pak gives me a reasonable cost per piece - not as good as Costco prices for 10 x 12 piece foil packs but good enough.  If you are penny pinching, I suggest you go to Costco because the cost per piece is roughly 60% of the cost per piece from this four-pack.  Nevertheless, I like to have a large stash on hand and ordering this four-pack gives me my extra gum stash.<br /><br />One final note for environmentalists.  I prefer the plastic containers to the foil packs because I think they are easier on the environment and run out less frequently than the 12 piece foil packs.  Thus, I can save gas for driving to Costco and do not clutter the landfill with endless numbers of foil pack refuse.  If you feel the same way then you may prefer the big e packaging.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NN7F52">Eclipse Sugar free Big-E Pak Gum, SpearMint by Wrigleys - 60 Gums / Container, 4 ea</a><br /><br />I recently quit smoking so I've been chewing a lot of gum lately.  I prefer the sugar free and purchased two 60 piece containers of Eclipse Spearment gum.  I really love the flavor of spearmint in gum.  When you first start chewing it, the flavor is so strong it will about knock your socks off.  I really love spearment, but this is too intense for me.  I was on vacation out of town when I purchased this at a drugstore so I can't even return it for a refund.  I will NEVER buy this product again.  I think I'd better stick with sugar free bubble gum or cinnamon gum.  Even though the 60 pack is a better deal, if you are trying a product for the first time, always go with the smallest one in case you don't like it.

review/text: This is one of my hubby's favorite candies. We have trouble finding them in our city. We used to resort to buying bags of Halloween candy that would have some mixed in it.  Last year, we couldn't even find those.  So, I did an online search, found them, purchased them & my hubby's eating them. They arrived fresh, and tasty.  So very, very glad I found these online.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, Sugar Daddy lollipops are milk caramel. They come in two sizes; this is the smaller size &  approx. 1"x2"x1/4" not including the stick. If you chew on them they will get stuck in your teeth.

review/summary: Great Snacks for Travel or Work
review/text: I like these bars and don't think that the molasses flavor is too heavy. Sesame seeds are relatively mild in flavor, but the combination of molasses and sesame is pretty good. Each package contains three flat sticks (sort of like oversized sticks of gum). An entire package is about 270 calories; however, it's possible to eat just a portion and put the rest into a plastic bag for later. The sesame seeds are calorie-dense foods and the molasses adds some iron to the nutrition mix. These keep pretty well and are good for travel, hiking, or just taking to work. The downside is that the bars do break easily so they tend to get messy. On one hand, that's good if you just want to eat a small piece; on the other hand, you probably won't receive too many unbroken ones in the box.

review/summary: Frosting from a box? Who woulda thought!
review/text: I'll admit, I'm not very handy in the kitchen. But when my child's birthday came around, I was determined to bake a cake our mostly vegan family could all enjoy. Have you ever read the label from those pre-made cakes at your grocer's bakery? They are loaded with chemicals I cannot even pronounce, let alone even begin to understand why they would be ingredients in a cake for that matter. I came across a few recipes for vegan cakes, and with a slew of ingredients I didn't have in my pantry, I figured a mix would be an easier choice. That's when I stumbled upon Cherrybrook Kitchen Cake mixes and frosting. I chose to try the yellow cake with chocolate frosting. The other reviews for the chocolate frosting were very good, and I was not disappointed. While it is true it is made up of only 3 ingredients, these pre boxed mixes are about convenience. Now that brings me back to the issue, mix called for the addition for butter or a substitute. While I read others successfully using vegetable shortening as a butter subsititute, I opted to used Willow Brook soy margarine, which made the frosting overly salty. SO i would not recommend using that. But overall, you can tell the frosting was DELICIOUS! The texture was great. We still managed to eat the whole thing even with the saltiness!<br /><br />Overall I'd highly recommend Cherrybrook's Chocolate frosting mix. It is absolutely delicious, and would be a great addition to your vegan or allergy free kitchen.<br /><br />The reason I deducted 1 star, my only complaint, with a product of this caliber, how Cherrybrook goes out of their way to maintain excellent quality standards, they should go the extra mile and make all their ingredients ORGANIC! Then it would be PERFECT.<br /><br />UPDATE: I went ahead and made the frosting again, but this time using Spectrum Naturals Organic vegetable shortening. The frosting was delicious, Very light and creamy, but it somehow lacked that flavor punch that came with making with the soy margarine. Next time around, what i plan on doing and what I would recommend to anyone using this frosting, use half shortening and half margarine. Also the frosting gets hard when it gets cold from being in the fridge, so take it out of the fridge awhile before you're going to eat it to allow it to soften.

My whole family loved the frosting but thought the cake was dry and didn't taste good.  They made it clear they would be happy to have the frosting again but not with that cake!<br />I just used this product again to make chocolate cake balls.  I made a Gluten Free Bob's Red Mill Chocolate Cake Mix, baked it, crumbled it, added this frosting, chilled and made into balls with a melon baller.  Then I chilled again in freezer and dipped in Wax Orchards Classic Fudge, Fat Free and fuit-sweetened dark chocolate sauce (also gluten free).  I served today with fresh strawberries and pecans. It was awesome!  Great for a decadent celebration.

review/summary: words are not enough - groans of pleasure best describe this
review/text: A checker snorted at seeing this product. I told him when you have allergies often you need it made in a dedicated facility. Confectioner sugar is one of those hidden culprits you generally don't think about. If your making a cake by scratch, allergen free, you have so many extra things to add that its nice to save time with such a superior frosting that is so easy to make.<br /><br />This is so good no one realizes its "allergen free". I found a 1/2 & 1/2 ratio of Spectrum shortening & Earth Balance butter substitute, (non-soy & non-diary, the red tub) gives the fluffiest texture. I beat it longer then recommended and it get very light. I also use my upright mixer to aid in that.<br /><br />My daughter, whose allergic to egg & is very limited for easily made baked goods, puts it on crackers and loves it. When you have very limited diets due to a lot of allergies you learn to think outside the box. Its gone on marshmallows, occasionally makes it onto brownies or Ener-G's sugar cookies, and a few other things but our favorite way is to eat it off the spoon. If you over soften it in the microwave (runny, very runny)we found it can be used on alternative ice creams as a topping. It is best to leave on the counter to bring to room temp.We also like to add flavors that compliment the chocolate such as Orange or Coffee.<br /><br />Locally this is difficult to find and often double the price so we got the 6 box set and saved a bundle in theory. In other words we ate it like, um, piggies and had to buy more for what it was actually intended for thereby increasing the price.

review/summary: BEST PRICE, IN GLASS BOTTLES
review/text: I am trying my best to eliminate plastic from my purchases, especially when it comes to food products. I think this is only one of two brands I've come across in my search that packages hemp oil in glass bottles.<br /><br />I had another brand of hemp oil sold in a plastic container. There is a definite difference in taste, compared to the hemp oil in a glass bottle.  I much prefer the taste of the hemp oil in a glass bottle.<br /><br />Keep this organic oil refrigerated after you open the bottle.<br /><br />I use it on salads.  I do not use it for frying or sauteing.<br /><br />I've learned that any oil at high heat becomes a transfat...yes, that evil transfat. I now only use ghee (clarified butter) or organic coconut oil for any frying or any baking.  Every other oil I use, (hemp, olive, walnut, avocado) I use only for seasoning or in salads.<br /><br />This product was shipped to me exceptionally well-packaged and securely wrapped.  Each bottle was individually wrapped and cushioned in bubble wrap, within a box that was additionally cushioned all around in more bubble wrap. Perfect.<br /><br />When I run out, I will certainly buy this product from the same Seller who gave excellent customer service.

Items like bunch of popcorn, only may be 50m g of pistachio, 3 candies, 3 to 4 cookies. What is this going one here?? I order 2 similar gifts but your company loot my money. I need to get my money back. I will post the photos of the items which we found inside the package inbeteen bunch of packing paper.<br />THanks,<br />Poonam

review/summary: Delicious! The Original Super-Food!!!
review/text: If you have never tried Millet you are in for a very pleasant surprise. Millet has been around for a very long time but fell out of favor in American diets long ago. It's a shame because millet is one of the most complete nutritional foods available. It is low fat, has low/no gluten, very low allergic - ie easy to digest making it the perfect choice for many that have allergies to other grain forms and is packed full of vitamins, minerals and essential amino acids like methione that are rarely found in other grains but critical to normal functioning.<br /><br />Millet can be cooked like a hot cereal with a tad of honey added in the morning, added to rice or other grains to make a pilaf type dish, ground for breads or added whole to cold cereal, muesli and other forms. This is a nice starter set for those trying it for the first time, comes in re-sealable bags and is delicious.<br /><br />Millet remains a major source of nutrition in many nations and for those that think they have a memory of millet but not sure where/how...it is those main little round seeds found in bird food mix. This is a clean, organic form rather than agricultural quality.<br /><br />Stores easily, lasts a long time, Packs a punch when it comes to nutrition. Makes a great food for emergency preparenedness since is cost effective, super nutrious and easy to cook with in a variety of forms. Toss a handful into rice to boost nutrition without the high cost, grind or add whole to bread for a delicious flavor and texture plus superior nutritional benefits.<br /><br />Try it - a versatile superfood you will really grow to love!

review/summary: Very nice surprise
review/text: Had my first experience cooking and eating Eden's millet and both my husband and I liked it very much. He's not a fan of couscous, but this he liked. It has more texture, resembles rice but is more compact. Like rice, millet is a blank canvas. You can mix it with orzo pasta and create a pilaf w/fresh herbs and/or veggies, add it to soups, for stuffed peppers, or eat just as a side dish seasoned simply with salt, pepper, and perhaps a dab of butter.  It cooks in less than 30 minutes, has 4 grams of fiber for 1/4 cup uncooked, and contains all the essential amino acids. A healthy and interesting addition to one's diet.

review/summary: This and a Coffee Grinder, and You Have Fresh Gluten Free Millet Flour
review/text: Millet makes a great gluten-free flour, but it has issues:  millet flour goes bad fast, but it's only a "secondary" gluten-free flour, so you wouldn't want to buy a lot at once. (You can't use it as the primary flour in gluten-free baked goods because the resulting baked goods are too hard.)<br /><br />The millet flours that are commercially available aren't necessarily gluten-free, so that is a serious obstacle to using millet flour as well.<br /><br />However, millet has a complete amino acid profile, meaning that you can be a vegan gluten-free person and live on millet;  it's worth the effort for that reason alone.<br /><br />If you have a Krups coffee grinder, and this, you're set for millet flour the next six months of gluten-free baking.  This is really good stuff--use it to make shortbread and arepas mixed with rice flour and all-purpose gluten-free flour.

review/summary: A Mildly Sweet Nutty Flavor - Delicioso!
review/text: I tasted millet a long time ago and didn't like it.  However, upon adopting two pet mice, the care manual recommended that it be a part of their diet, alternating with tiny pasta and barley.  I chose this particular brand because it is organic, and I wanted to provide them with natural nutrients as much as possible.  I had absolutely no intention of making it a part of my own diet, or even tasting it.  It simply didn't interest me.<br /><br />But as a curious homo sapien, when filling their tiny bowls with this offering, I found myself tasting a small spoonful myself, thinking it's flavor would send me to my toothbrush to refreshen my mouth.  I have to confess that, after serving the mice their portion, I ate the entire leftover amount and wished I had cooked even more.<br /><br />It is light and fluffy and some millet I know has a grainier texture.  So the liking of it depends on one's taste.  It is very close to the texture of Lundberg California Brown Rice <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CEQ8X">Rice, Brown, Short Grain, Organic, 25# Bulk</a>, although lighter in substance.  The flavor is slightly sweet and nutty.  After cooking for 30 minutes, and fluffed up with a fork, it is irresistable.  Even my mice eat an amazing amount of it considering their tiny size.  There is no such thing as leftovers!<br /><br />The recipe on the package is interesting.  It is titled "Millet with Sweet Corn & Gomasio."  I had no idea what Gomasio was; however, a search engine informed me it is a dry condiment, similar to furikake [a condiment of roasted tan and black sesame seed, green nori flakes, and dried pickled red shiso (beefsteak) leaves], made from unhulled sesame seeds and salt.  It is sold on the manufacturer's website.<br /><br />I decided to temporarily bypass the gomasio and just heat up a little frozen sweet corn on stovetop, adding it to my portion of the millet at the end of cooking (as corn isn't good for mice).  Because of its lightness, it is a perfect compliment to the millet; someday when I'm feeling brave, I may even try the gomasio.<br /><br />Millet is also extremely healthy (the package says it has a complete essential amino acid profile).  So one is getting that added benefit as well.  It may not be to everyone's taste, but it has become a welcome constant staple in my home.

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious source of SILICA that is NON-GMO VERIFIED
review/text: Silica is a trace mineral that strengthens the body's connective tissues - muscles, tendons, hair, ligaments, nails, cartilage, and bone - and is vital for healthy skin. Silica deficiency can result in reduced skin elasticity and can hamper the body's ability to heal wounds. Food sources of silica include MILLET, leeks, green beans, garbanzo beans, strawberries, cucumber, mango, celery, asparagus and rhubarb. In its natural form, silica is found in the horsetail herb.<br /><br />Eden is one of my favorite companies to purchase from.  They care so much about making the highest quality products for their customers with complete transparency.  There site offers complete information about their products such as on this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QXYZ4M">EDEN Millet, Whole Grain,16 -Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> it eden gives the following labels/tags: gluten-free, wheat-free, kosher, organic, low fat, low sodium, antioxidants, fiber,macrobiotic, and NON-GMO VERIFIED!  They also give the following nutrition facts on millet:<br /><br />According to the FDA "Diets rich in whole grain and other plant foods, and low in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease and some cancers." Also, "Low fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors." EDEN Organic Millet is low fat, contains no saturated fat or cholesterol, a good source of fiber, protein, thiamin B1, and magnesium, and an excellent source of manganese. It is also a complete protein source containing all essential amino acids. Gluten Free. 100% whole grain.<br /><br />Millet is extremely versatile whole grain. Determined by the amount of water used in cooking, it can be light and fluffy or soft and creamy. EDEN Organic Millet is delicious plain, with fresh or dried fruit, or with sweet vegetables such as winter squash and sweet corn. Serve it as porridge and as a main grain for lunch or dinner. Millet tastes great with just about any condiment such as EDEN Organic Gomasio, EDEN Shake, and EDEN Dulse Flakes, or with roasted seeds or nuts. For best results and to impart a nuttier flavor and fluffier texture, dry roast the washed millet in a cast iron or heavy skillet, over a medium-low flame, stirring constantly until golden, and then cook according to package directions. It is deliciously creamy and soothing in soups and stews, and can be used to make grain burgers, croquettes, salads, and in desserts, whole grain muffins, breads, pancakes and waffles. It makes awesome millet mashed potatoes; just cook millet with cauliflower and mash. You can even use it to make stuffing for squash and cabbage rolls.<br /><br />Millet tastes great sweet or savory.  Add some cinnamon and maple syrup for breakfast.  OR throw some into whatever sweet or savory soup you are creating.  Throw some in your coffee grinder to make fresh millet flour.  Since millet's natural flavor is so mild, you can do with it just about anything and it just tastes great adding nutrition and giving you a great source of silica.

review/text: I took advantage of the 50% off special last summer to try some new-to-me products, including 4 flavors of these sesame seeds, and loved all of them! This was probably my least favorite of the four, but it still added a nice touch of smoked flavor to the foods I've used it in, it just doesn't seem to be as flexible as the other flavors. But I still keep it handy and use it frequently.

review/text: I cannot find these delicious eggs down here in Virgina.  I decided to check out Amazon because if anyone can get it, it is Amazon.  Well, to my delight the Zitner's Butter Krak eggs were on the site.  I immediately ordered a box of them.  We had a "mom and pop" grocery store when I was growing up in NJ and we sold these "loose" for a nickel.  They were much bigger then,(nowadays everything is made smaller)and we sold so many around Easter time.  People just love them. I just love them.  I have shared several with other people who have never heard of them and they intend to buy some next year at Easter time.  Please continue to make them.  I have suffered for over 7 years without them down here in VA.  I will order again next year. Thanks for such a great memory.

It turns out that he is the unofficial head of the chili-heads, the hot sauce movement)<br /><br />However the variants - garlic, lime and chipotle are far inferior and don't match the quality of the original hot sauce.<br /><br />Hey - there is nothing wrong with trying a selection but Cholula has failed to meet the very high standards they set by their original hot sauce.<br /><br />Just a heads up.

review/summary: Very close to the real deal, but are they really worth the money?
review/text: I took a chance and bought the case of 6 here on amazon instead of trying out a box from whole foods. I'm glad I did. They taste pretty close to the real thing, in my opinion. The texture of the dough was really wet, though, and would not take to cutting out shapes, but after refrigerating the dough for a bit, it made it easier to roll out and cut out Christmas cookie shapes to decorate. The best thing is, they are produced on a dedicated facility, dairy free and wheat free, so you can be sure they are safe - even for peanut allergies.<br /><br />At $5.90 per box (plus a steep shipping fee, $11.59, c'mon, really????), they are quite expensive and each box only makes about a dozen round cookies. Still, if this is your only alternative to making sugar cookies from scratch yourself (which I'd recommend trying if you are cost-conscious - check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/073821423X">Gluten-Free on a Shoestring: 125 Easy Recipes for Eating Well on the Cheap</a> for a from-scratch sugar cookie recipe that costs about half of one of these boxes), it may be worth the expense for those special occasions (birthdays, Christmas, etc.).

review/summary: The best gluten free cookies by far!
review/text: Being gluten intolorent I thought I would never have  a yummy cookie again! Now I have been proven wrong. My little girls picked this out while I was doing my gf shopping and man am I glad I let them get it! My picky kids ages 4 and 6 along with my daycare kids ages 2,3,4 and thier grandmother all loved these cookies. I was convinced they werent gluten free but they there where no side effects after I ate them. woww are we going to be good customers for this company!

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: First, let me say how sorely disappointed I am with this mix.  Second, let me say I am an experienced baker and cook.  I desperately wanted this mix to work as I am currently enduring a maternal avoidance diet courtesey of my 8 month old's multiple, severe food allergies.  I cannot tell you how I looked forward to the day I tried this "safe" mix.  Unfortunately, I consider the money spent on this mix to be a total waste.<br /><br />The two main problems with it are, in the following order:<br /><br />1)  Gritty texture.  The grit is not horrible but it IS there and you cannot help but notice it.  For the amount of money charged per box of mix, they surely must be able to improve the texture of this product!<br /><br />2)  Overwhelming vanilla.  The recipe calls for an excessive amount of vanilla, which leaves an almost sickening aftertaste to the cookies.  I triple checked the back of the box before pouring out the specified amount because it looked so off to me.  While the amount of vanilla IS something that can be tweaked at home, I feel it is inappropriate and unacceptable for the buyer of this product to have to make ANY changes to the recipe/ingredient ratios to produce a consistently pleasing, tasty cookie.<br /><br />The whole concept of this mix, it seems to me, is to provide people with severely restricted diets a quick, easy, AND delicious treat that would otherwise have been made from scratch.  After my experience, I would rather cook from scratch every day for the rest of my life than make these again.<br /><br />Hopefully someone at Cherrybrook looks at improving/refining this recipe...soon!

review/text: April 2012 I ordered Incredible corn seed, I have grown this corn varitey for years. I chose your site because I didn't need a large quantity, just enough for a backyard garden. Today I harvested the corn. I am very disappointed in the harvest and don't in any way think it is the variety advertised. On stalks of about 6.5 to 7 feet tall, Each ear is uniformly long and skinny , 11" (too long for Incredible), 13 perfectly straight rows of very deep yellow kernels which have a very tough pericarp and not much flavor.  Incredible ears should be 9" and have about 18 rows of sweet tender kernels, growing on stalks of about 8 feet tall. These ears remind me of field corn. It's very disappointing to waste my time, energy and growing season on such an inferior seed.

review/summary: Best Store-Bought Pizza Sauce!
review/text: After trying many other brands of pizza sauce and not experiencing much success, I decided to conduct a taste test with my family between two of the better reviewed store-bought pizza sauces, Pastorelli and Don Pepino. They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left. I think that speaks for itself. I will continue to purchase Don Pepino pizza sauce and I highly recommend that you give it a try!

review/summary: NOT NATURAL DO NOT BE FOOLED!!! HAS MSG IN IT
review/text: Please do not be fooled as I was when it came to eating this seemingly healthier alternative to regular Cheetos. Also, do not believe everything that is listed from these sellers on packaging or the internet, they are all marketing ploys to get a wider range of consumer to buy their product, in this case they are trying to attract the consumers who are usually very health conscious and read labels. I saw one of the sellers here list this product as having NO MSG.<br /><br />That would seem to be correct because the company has chosen to cleverly market this particular brand to people who are trying to eat healthier. They have changed the name on the ingredients from Monosodium Glutamate to Torula yeast which is a free glutamate. In my opinion if your going to eat and enjoy Cheetos just buy your favorite kind because they are all the same and this bran is no healthier for you than the rest. It's made from GMO corn, and has MSG in it wether thats the name they are going by now days or some new gimmick to poison you, either way your feeding yourself and children unhealthy foods, this should in no way be viewed as a natural alternative to "regular cheetos." I once was fooled and felt I was making a "healthier" junk food choice for my kids when they would want something that I normally wouldn't buy. I was dead wrong and have discontinued this product from my grocery cart. Just thought I would let others know so they can do their own research on the matter.

review/summary: Belly Fat??
review/text: I have reordered this product before in 240 count. I was waiting for my appointment at Yale New Haven Hospital and viewing the hospital closed circuit TV which was explaining health tips. The topic changed to the benefits of green tea and it mentioned it's anti oxidant properties and the fact that it helps reduce belly fat!!. I do not have a real problem in this area as I am 5' 10 1/2" tall and weighed 209 lbs. After surgery I had to watch my diet and with the help of Stash Green Tea consumed cold from a 32 once thermos at least three times weekly I have lost 17 lbs and inches from my belly area. TIP; Cut the string and tab off four tea bags and place in a 32 oz. thermos, top off with filtered water. You can refill with water all day or add one or two additional tea bags while leaving the others in the thermos. Keep refrigerated if possible. Ice cubes will rupture the tea bags. Try this for three months for at least three days a week or more and see if the belly isn't flatter!!

review/text: I'm picky about my green teas. Sometimes they're too weak, sometimes it just doesn't smell/taste like green tea, or sometimes it's just horribly bitter/sour and unpalatable (think most grocery store teas).<br /><br />But Stash's green tea is TERRIFIC. There's a good element of leafyness (it IS green after all) without much bitter/sourness. I can usually pull at least 2 good cups of hot green tea from each tea bag.<br />I was actually previously disappointed by Yogi's Green tea (it's just purely green tea leaves, can't remember the exact name of it though) - when steeped in hot water it smelled like burnt tires, so I almost lost hope in American grocery store teas. I previously would only buy the Yamamotoyama green teas (slight roasted flavor) and Stash's green tea tastes remarkably similar, which makes me incredibly happy due to the Stash tea sales that have been going on at my local markets. WOO!!!

review/text: It should probably be called Lemongrass Mint to more accurately describe the taste.  It's especially good as ice tea, but drinking it hot is enjoyable too.  The mint taste is not as strong as the lemongrass.  I notice that some reviewers here say they barely taste the lemongrass, while others think it overwhelms the mint.  It's a good idea to buy a box of this tea to try it out before ordering 6 boxes.  I usually drink Bigelow Plantation Mint black tea, so I'm accustomed to a strong mint flavor.  Lucky for me that I like lemongrass too, so the balance of lemongrass and mint was not a problem for me.

review/text: I realize that taste in tea, and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference. For me, I found this tea to be unpleasant. Opening the tea bag, I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings. As I drank the tea, I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste. I am not sure how to describe it . . . perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste. I do not get the sharp "bite" I normally expect from a good green tea.<br /><br />I will try this for a week, and see if I am missing something, but as for now, I can not recommend purchasing this tea.

review/text: I far prefer this brand of green tea over Lipton and some others I've found available at the grocery store. Good quality tea, good flavor. However, the price they are offering you to buy in bulk online is higher than buying 6 single boxes at the store. I've found this tea is always between $2 and $2.50 per box of 20. Multiply $2.50 by 6 and you get $15.00. They are asking $16.50 before shipping for the same amount. I think I'll keep buying it at the store.

review/summary: I LOVE this tea
review/text: This is my "go to" tea.  I love the flavor- it's not exactly the flavor you get in a Moroccan restaurant, but it's very very good.  The mint isn't harsh- which is what I like about moroccan mint.  And if you add lemon to it (and I add a little German rock sugar) it's just amazingly good.  The new Mojito mint by Stash is also great.  I don't like it quite as much as this one, but I drink a ton of tea, and have about 5 favorites- and this and the Mojito are definitely two of the 5 (I also love the Stash organic Chai)

review/summary: ITS ALL NATURAL AND IT TASTE LIKE IT....VERY HEALTHY THOUGH..
review/text: So this is the first green tea ive bought and the second ive tasted. The first one i tasted was alittle better tasting. This stash green tea however does taste lets say, 'natural'. what i mean by that is it taste exactly like what it is, all natural dried herbs. It does look like leafs though not just crushed up almost powdery stuff like the other bag i drank. Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor. Overall though i DO recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the 'natural' taste, so if your just after those health benefits you wont be disappointed if you want good taste this probably wont make you happy.

review/summary: Best I have found
review/text: I have tried many types of tea - from "the scoop your own, tea-shoppe, imports" to the "waiter swears this is the greatest one ever" - and never did I expect to find my favorite, bar none, in this simple unassuming little box. I drink this every single day at work, often using 4-5 packs a day. Fair warning: this 6-pack may not be that great of a deal, depending on where you live. I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less. BUT, that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. The tea itself is great.

review/summary: Mildly Minty
review/text: Some mint teas are overwhelming but Stash's Morocan Mint is just mildly minty. It is made with spearmint, lemongrass, peppermint and green tea. I don't really taste anything too lemony. This has a smooth, refreshing taste that you can enjoy every day or when you are tired of tea with milk. I like this tea with one packet of stevia. It would also be great with honey. If you don't think this is strong enough use two tea bags like I do.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Pure and Not Bitter
review/text: Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long. This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma. I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia. It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors. This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea. White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine. So this particluar tea is very healthy. However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so good.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: No Bitter Taste like Other Green Teas
review/text: My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you. I think it tastes better than a lot of chai teas made with black tea leaves.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: The Best of the Best!
review/text: I love Jasmine tea! More than anyone trust me. I got my first shipment of six boxes yesterday and have signed up for delivery every two months. The box it came in said "Stash" on the side. I'm assuming this tea came directly from the company. I should think it did by how cheap it is! At the grocery stores near me this tea is $3 a box on sell. This is a great deal!<br /><br />Stash is by far the best company for jasmine tea. I love this stuff! The only thing I would say to a new customer is don't reuse tea bags. Other than that, enjoy! It doesn't get better than this!
