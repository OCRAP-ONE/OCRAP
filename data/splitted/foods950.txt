review/text: I was disappointed to see that this product contains Sucralose.  It also contains sugar so why the need for an artificial sweetener too?  I now have 54 kcups of a product that I really don't care to put in my body.<br />Some people are sensitive to artificial sweeteners, like my daughter who immediately went to the bathroom after drinking a cup, so the should definitely be listed.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1YA">Grove Square Single Serve Cappuccino Cups, French Vanilla, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count</a> My husband purchased this because he knows that I like (another brand) Cappuccino. Disappointed and upset are only two words that I can use to describe the experience. It was extremely sweet and already lightened (very light) and what I consider an instant coffee !! No where did it say that it is instant or artificially lightened. I called the company and they said it did not have to be labeled "instant" coffee. I don't think he even wanted to listen to me. I told him that I probably would not buy another of their products, especially after reading other reviews......and I would forwarn people about the product!

review/text: The only reason this gets one star is because you have to give it atleast that much.  This is not anything like a K-cup.  It is instant coffee in a K-cup wrapper.  There is a supposed guarantee on the box but I have called the number many times and can never get anyone to call me back.  I usually won't bother trying to get my money back on this kind of thing but I have made an exception due to the horrid product.  In the company's defense, there are probably so many people calling to tell them about this wretched product, they may have not had time to get back to me.

review/text: I got this and wanted to try it out and the price was right!  Wow - the taste is sub-par and does taste like something you would find at a gas station dispenser!<br /><br />When I was reading the nutrition facts I noticed that it had 80 calories per serving (not a big deal), I then scanned down and saw that it has 23% of your daily saturated fat!!  Wow!  When I read through the ingredient list the first ones are: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, corn syrup solids, and then instant coffee and some others.  I'm not health nut both those things don't sound that healthy to me and I can see where the saturated fat is coming from!

review/summary: Good cup of "fake" cappuccino, just know what you're buying
review/text: Yes, this has instant coffee in it and is ready to drink. If you have ever gotten one of those instant cappuccino drinks from a gas station you pretty much know what this is going to taste like. (you know, the one you have to hold the button and make sure you release in enough time so your drink doesn't overflow!) I enjoy it for what it is, because sometimes I just have a craving for those cheap cappuccino drinks. A few things to note:<br /><br />- Make sure you don't brew more than 8 ounces with one cup, it will be diluted. The stuff is powder mix, it doesn't brew like regular coffee grounds<br />- Please pay attention to ingredients if you are health-conscious (See below for nutrition info & ingredients)<br />- It can leave residue in your keurig/brewer so try to run a round of hot water right after brewing<br />- The box indicates that each serving contains 20-30mg caffeine<br /><br />Nutrition Info for 1 cup:<br />80 calories, 4.5 grams fat (all saturated), 170mg sodium (7%), 9g carbs (5g sugar), 0g protein<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, corn syrup solids, instant coffee, sodium caseinate, salt, cocoa, natural & artificial flavors, dipotassium phosphate, cornstarch, mono- & diglycerides, solicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color, sucralose

review/text: I never review products, good or bad, but this "coffee" is so bad I had to.<br /><br />This is not the typical k-cup coffee. This is an instant coffee similar to Nescafe or SB Via but tastes horrible.<br />The sugar/splenda mix makes this way too sweet. Mixing it half and half with black coffee makes it drinkable.<br /><br />This is basically just adding hot water to instant coffee. There isn't a filter or coffee grounds in the cup.

review/text: I am not a huge coffee drinker, so for me the best cappuccino is one that doesn't have a strong coffee taste. . .I actually prefer the gas station variety over the 'real deal'.  If that's what you like, then this is the perfect fit!  I love it, my husband loves it as well, and he was quite skeptical!  We purchased an actual cappuccino maker several years ago and hated the strong coffee taste, so the machine went back to the store.  He refused to believe me, that this mix was what we were looking for, until I made him a cup!  He's surprised and happy to have a cheaper way to make a favorite drink at home w/out having to stop on the way to work!

review/summary: VERY Good!
review/text: The Grove Square Capuccino Cups are just great.  A real treat!  Some of the flavored K-cups are just that - flavored coffee - and you need to add your own cream or milk and sweeteners.  But this is all ready the minute it stops brewing!  To me - the entire concept of the Keurig is to have your favorite beverage ready instantly.  If you have to fill little cups and add your own filters or add your own cream and sugar and flavoring - it isn't quick and instant - and you might as well go back to brewing an enitire pot of coffee or use the espresso machine.  K-cups for the Keurig makes it instant - and with this Vanilla Cappuccino - its ready right away - no need to add another thing.  AND - this is the ONLY place we've found that carries this product.  I've looked at every store in our area that carries K-cups and no one carries this.  Also - the price is great.  Especially this time around.  This is the 3rd time I've placed an order for these and the price was the best ever - $8.47 I think - for 24.  Great price!  Usually they are are betwween $10.47 and $12.  My only regret - I wish Grove Square would also make a Mocha K-cup.  That is another of our favorite coffee drinks.

Can't taste any "espresso" or coffee.  My first time buying this Grove Square brand and this flavor.  Won't make same mistake again.  Will buy only 1 box to try next time.  Disappointed.

review/summary: Great tasting and good price
review/text: First off i am not sure what people expect. This Fr Vanilla Cap has a great taste, creamy texture and needs nothing added to it.<br />But AGAIN, i read the product info and it stated (sugar/sucralose blend)<br /><br />I use SPLENDA brand sucralose anyway in my coffee. If you do not like the artificial sweetener, then do not order this product. But do not vote it down because you didn't read the info and/or sucralose leaves an after-taste.<br />I have no after-taste from it and therefore I enjoy this product very much.<br /><br />I use this in the B60 Keurig on the middle setting (8oz if i remember correctly)<br />My Pros:<br />-Good price<br />-Creamy texture<br />-Tastes great<br /><br />Will buy again<br />For people with the dopey comments:<br />Let me add: IT IS MACHINE-MADE cappuccino! What do you think a cheap Keurig is? Gourmet coffee?

review/text: It tastes like a decent powdered cappuccino because that's exactly what it is. I noticed the used k-cup was very light compared to the other ones I had brewed, I opened the top and it was empty. There's no actual coffee in this, just instant. I think it's an okay value for the price, but I wouldn't purchase it again.

review/summary: Comparing Bob's Red Mill to Tropical Traditions Shredded Coconut
review/text: We select the best quality foods we can afford and this includes coconut.  This review is a comparison between the Bob's Red Mill and Tropical Traditions finely shredded coconut which I have been buying on their website - for some reason Amazon carries many of their products but not their coconut.<br /><br />Here is my comparison.<br /><br />Freshness- This item arrived with an expiration date of 3/2013, which is eleven months from delivery.  I wish I knew what the exp date was on the TT brand - but it lasted me well over a year on my shelf and I believe that since they harvest the Coconut (they are primarily a coconut products company) it may have been fresher.<br /><br />Price- I buy the Tropical Traditions in the plastic 3.5 gallon pail, which I buy online when it is half price at $17.50, which costs about $5 a lb.<br /><br />I decided to compare it to Bob's Red Mill which I researched and felt was probably the highest quality on Amazon, so I got it with the Subscribe n Save, so I saved a little more.  Without the Subscribe n Save, Bob's Mill has free shipping and currently comes to $4.38 a lb. I think Bob's Mill is priced well for what you are getting.<br /><br />Shred size- is very close - but the Bob's Red Mill is slightly larger.  I felt that the Tropical traditions was just a little too small for my taste.  It "disappeared" in my cooking and oatmeal and I never got to enjoy the crunch or the chew of it, only able to enjoy the flavor and smell.<br /><br />Dryness- both were equally dry and felt very similar.<br /><br />Aroma- the Tropical Traditions won hands down here.  The Bob's Mills smelled fresh enough, just a very mild slightly toasted smell.  But the Tropical traditions has a much stronger sweet coconut smell (it is NOT a sweetened coconut product) which I find very appealing.  And this is after sitting on my shelf for over a year! It was not rancid at all. Since both of these items are shredded finely, and as I said, I do not "feel" the coconut in my food, I'll probably go back to the Tropical Traditions line since that is what I am left to enjoy - the smell.<br /><br />Packaging-  I like that Bob's Mill is conveniently packaged in 4 backs so you can freeze three for later.  The Tropical Traditions comes in a plastic pail that is very very hard to open.  And then you really don't want to keep opening it.  Plus it does not fit in the freezer or fridge.  So the pail is a waste in my opinion.  I use mine for other things.<br /><br />I rate both products as 5 star items. Tropical Traditions wins if money and packaging are not an issue.  If they are then Bob's Mill wins handily.<br /><br />We eat a lot of coconut, I use it in my cooking and we eat it for breakfast.  We eat it at least 3 to 4 times a week in our oatmeal mixed in with organic flax seed, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036Q6DSS">Flax USA 100% Natural Organic Flax Cold Milled Ground Golden Flax Seed, 40-Ounce Packages</a> home frozen blue berries (store bought have high pesticides) and maple syrup.  What a wonderful way to eat healthy!!! I find that adding coconut adds just enough protein, 1 gram, that I am able to last all the way through till lunch without getting that sudden hunger I get an hour or two earlier without the coconut.

review/summary: Just what it says it is
review/text: I could not find unsweetened coconut at any store in our area and wound up having to buy the case of Bob's brand from Amazon.  Thank you Amazon for having what people need!<br /><br />No surprises with the product.  It is dried, finely shredded coconut just as advertised.  Because it is so fine it tends to scatter around if you are using it to coat nut balls or truffles, and the kitchen looks like the recipe directions said:  "First take one teaspoon of coconut and sprinkle it evenly over counter and floor"............  :)<br /><br />I also use it to make coconut milk and that sure beats the heck out of buying a fresh coconut and going through the whole long process that I used to do years ago. It is great to be able to have just the amount of coconut milk I need at any given time without the unhealthy vegetable gums that come in all of the canned coconut milk I've seen.

review/summary: Good coconut
review/text: I bought this mainly to make homemade coconut milk in the blender, because in the US I can't find any coconut milk (the type for drinking cold and using with cereal etc.) in the supermarkets or online that doesn't have a boatload of unnecessary additives (flavors, gums, thickeners, colorings, vitamins, and whatnot).<br /><br />I love Kara Original Unsweetened in the asceptic container which is sold in the UK in the soy and rice milk section of many supermarkets.  It doesn't have any additives I object to (at least in terms of what is claimed on the label), and it tastes great.  I'll put a link to it in a comment that I will attach to my review, if you are curious to see what it's like.<br /><br />(There seems to be a Kara brand of coconut milk mentioned by one or two online shops in the US with a somewhat different logo, but the contents of that coconut milk are completely different than the contents of it in the UK, and I don't want to drink it.<br />I am not sure why food manufacturers in the US concentrate on gussied-up, artificially-thick, msg-saturated, overly-sweet, oddly-colored, messed-about-with-in-a-lab products when many things are simply lovely enough in their plain, nearly-natural form.  I guess I do know why they do it, but I don't agree with it.  People can't even recognize normal food tastes anymore and reject anything that doesn't ultra-stimulate their taste buds and zone out their neurons.)<br /><br />Anyway, I tried to make coconut milk in my almond milk maker (it is actually a soy milk maker that is also designed to make almond milk) and that was a NO GO!  Then I looked for recipes online and found a few variations of making it in a blender with hot water and straining it - pretty simple.  I had to upgrade my blender because I had an ancient one that sorta just pushed the coconut flakes around without roughing them up, so I got a top-rated one (in the moderate-priced group of blenders -- blenders seem to be either 20, 60-90, or 400+!) for about fifty dollars here and it's doing a pretty good job of making the milk.  All the online recipes said to use cheesecloth to strain the blended coconut flakes, but I just use a wire sieve with a fine mesh, for less hassle.  I only make 4 days' worth at a time because I've read that homemade, refrigerated coconut milk goes bad after a few days.<br /><br />At the time I bought this Bob's Red Mill Shredded Coconut Unsweetened, I wasn't sure that I was going to want to make coconut milk in a blender, so I chose the slightly less expensive one (this one), over another brand that was organic, just to try it.  Then, there was a computer mistake on my order and I got 2 boxes of 4 bags, instead of 1.  So I have a lot of this coconut to use up before looking at what else is out there!<br /><br />Oddly, the organic brand (which I only later discovered was available in my local supermarket after all, so I wouldn't have needed to order my trial-coconut online anyway, because I came across it by surprise jammed in with the small display of organic herbs/spices instead of sitting with the sweetened, flaked coconut that most US stores carry, which in my local supermarket is with the baking nuts and sugar) appears a lot whiter in the bag than Bob's does, and I don't know if the organic brand's coconut is treated in some way to appear bright white, or not (I don't think it is).  If you are concerned about the light brown color of the Bob's coconut in your final product (of whatever you are using it for), I discovered that it does end up turning much whiter after it's been in hot water (to make milk) or after it's been used in baking.<br /><br />This coconut tastes good, works well in baking, and seems to be a quality product.

review/text: I just received this and already a huge fan.  Great texture.  I never liked shredding coconut or the stuff you are used to as a kid, but this is great.  nice and has a crunch or bite to it.  I don't know where people are saying it's too thin, it seems great to me.  ....I saw a raw recipe for some chocolate treats that used coconut oil, shredded coconut, cocoa powder and some honey or sweetener of choice - didn't have any shredded coconut and found this at a great price, fast shipping.  As soon as I got it I made some and very yummy.  Love coconut flour but tend not to bake too much, so this will be a great kitchen staple to use in all the raw goodies.  Thanks.

review/text: I was looking for long, stringy shreds of coconut, like Baker's Premium Shred used to be -- and which apparently no longer exists. These alleged "shreds" are tiny coconut chips about like what you find mixed in the middle of a Mounds bar, minus all the sugar and other candy goop. It's what years ago we used to refer to in the food-service business as "dissected" coconut -- grated, yes, shredded, no. I've used many Bob's Red Mill products and liked them all. We'll use this, but it is a real disappointment. Perhaps I didn't read the description well enough before buying.

It doesn't require much kneading and tastes like vanilla, a bit on the sweet side though.  If old (over a year), it will taste rancid and be a bit hard but can still be rolled out.  Wilton brand rolled fondant is gross tasting and not as soft and pliable.  Marshmellow fondant is more pasty tasting and gummier.

review/summary: Excellent taste, good for us vegetarians
review/text: My husband and I love Gefen jell desserts. They create a nice little low-calorie dessert (80 calories per half-cup serving), and topped with some Cool Whip, they make a refreshing after-dinner treat. The strawberry jell has a great flavor -- not too sweet. They really do set very quickly, and the texture is close to Jello, at least as far as I can remember Jello. There is no gelatin in them, which is why we eat them, as we are vegetarians. My one criticism is that they use dye (an FD&C Red), which explains how they get the great red color. If you are concerned about food dye, then I would recommend Natural Desserts Jel Dessert, which uses natural food dyes like beet powder and beta carotene. I will admit that storage of 24 packages can be an issue, but the price is very good, and it's not easy to get Gefen foods everywhere.

review/summary: Great juice. TERRIBLE price
review/text: V8 Juice: 5 stars<br />Amazon Price: 0 stars<br /><br />I love V8 and cannot give it less than 5 stars, but I must comment on Amazon's ridiculous price. Paying $49.50 for 12 bottles of V8 simply isn't smart because you can just as easily buy this at your local store. It's doubly idiotic because it's the smaller 46 oz size. I bought a 64 oz bottle (2 QT) from Walgreens tonight for $3. I'll do the math for you. $49.50/12 = $4.12 a bottle (9�/oz). Mine is 4.6�/oz. Amazon's is twice as expensive.<br /><br />I suppose if you are house-bound or overseas and must have a case of V8, you could order this. For the rest of us with working feet and/or cars, we could just go down to the local grocery store or supermarket/Costco.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/12/11:<br />Amazon has lowered the price, but it's still not competitive w/ Walgreens when there's a sale. $3.32/can for the smaller 46 oz size vs. my 64 oz bottles.

review/text: I'm a life long vanilla lover and was thrilled to discover this product in my local market while I was living in Southern California. Now that I'm on the East coast, I've been unable to find it. As you might imagine, I was delighted to find it on Amazon. This product is sweet (without any sweetening additives) and the lovely vanilla flavor is rich and long-lasting.  It permeates and enriches whatever I have used it in. I recommend it most highly!

review/summary: One of the best vanillas you will taste and at a great price
review/text: I discovered Orlando Vanilla a few years ago while spending a week in Puerto Vallarta. I am a chef and specialize in pastries so a good vanilla is important. I've tried Nielsen Massey vanillas and they are excellent but they still have a bit of a chemical/alcohol scent to them. McCormick extract (the most commonly found at your local supermarket) is so strong alcohol-wise that once you've had good vanilla you'll never go back to cheap chemical tasting junk.<br /><br />Orlando vanilla (and their other brand La Reyna) is strong, smells sweet with no chemical notes.  The aroma of vanilla permeates the kitchen when you use it. It is very reasonably priced and since most recipes call for about a teaspoon of vanilla you will find that an eight ounce bottle like this gives you enough for 48 typical recipes. Depending on your taste or the strength you are looking for you might get fewer or more portions.<br /><br />I buy mine from Puerto Vallarta when I go. I usually buy two liters (a liter is a bit more than a quart) and this year I have a tour of the factory scheduled. Kept in a cool, dark place vanilla extract has an extremely long shelf life so no need to worry about spoilage. I don't think you can go wrong using this extract. The only other way to get better flavor is to use good quality vanilla pods (see my review on those if you are interested)

I don't know if it is safe or not, but after paying $75.00 for six little pies I'm going to refreeze them and risk eating them. This is my first dissapointment with something I bought on Amazon.

review/summary: can't beat NUGO bars
review/text: Nugo bars are the best nutrition bars out there. I am not sure they call them that but I usually have a Nugo bar every other day for lunch and they are satisfying and taste better than other bars I have tried. I think these are excellent and if you like dark chocolate you will like these. They do make a milk chocolate peanut butter bar too but I am not fond of milk chocolate and did try them. The Nugo bars have helped me lose 60lbs and hopefully will help me keep those pounds off. If you are young and active, these would be good to take biking, hiking etc(in cooler weather). When I bike, I use the vanilla ones which are also good. Don't think you can go wrong with Nugo bars. One thing, I have found them usually cheaper at a grocery store but occasionally Amazon does offer them at the same or slightly lower price but if you live where they aren't available then I would certainly recommend getting them from Amazon.

review/text: I have been gluten free for over a year and had grown accustomed to tasteless foods (this has gradually gotten better over time).  I ran across these bars on Facebook and decided to give them a try.  They are really good and I love that they are covered in real dark chocolate that's not bitter.  I have tried several flavors and have not been disappointed.  The peanut butter taste is subtle but enjoyable.  I will definitely order these again.  Actually, I have stopped ordering all other bars and eat Nugo bars exclusively.  They are very filling and satisfy my late afternoon sweet tooth.

review/summary: Smooth, buttery, moderately strong
review/text: I originally bought Diedrich's Sumatra from a different web site, but now that Amazon has it I have a subscription! This is one of my two favorite K-Cups (the other being Rainforest Espresso). Sumatra is very smooth... that's really the best word to describe it. Not too strong, not too weak. A good late afternoon coffee that won't shock your system or keep you up until 2AM. The flavor stands up through cream and sweetener just fine (I take mine, as a friend describes, the color of masking tape). It is similar to French Roast but a bit more refined. No hint of acid, and absolutely no bitterness or "burnt" flavor at all.<br /><br />If you're not sure, Diedrich also has a sampler box that contains Sumatra and some of their other flavors. That's how I originally stumbled on it. But as soon as I had finished my first cup from the sampler, I went and ordered two boxes.<br /><br />Order this coffee, you won't be sorry.

review/text: When I was researching buying a brewer, I noticed that some reviewers said that they couldn't get strong coffee out of their K-Cups, which concerned me because I love strong coffee.  So, I bought all the "bold" K-Cups I can find.  Problem is- my hubby likes it more medium bodied.  Here's a beautiful answer- the Sumatra blend is bold and well rounded and gives that "ummm" reaction and I make it on the middle setting to make it strong.  The hubby makes it on the large setting to make it a true medium (and I even like it as a medium).  One set of two boxes combined with the tea and flavors we have usually lasts around two to three months.  We went through all two boxes worth one month.  It keeps you coming back for a second cup.

review/summary: Best k-cup I've tried
review/text: I really like bold full flavored coffee without bitterness or too much acidity.  I wouldn't call myself a coffee aficionado but I do know what I like.  I own two French presses, an Aeropress, several drip machines, and a moka pot.  All are great but I love the ease of using my Keurig. After purchasing it last year I have probably tried 20 or 25 different k-cups.  For a while I really liked the Donut Shop by Coffee People.  But I grew tired of it.  It's great when it's hot but not so much when it cools off a bit.  Some of the other full bodied cups tend to be very bitter.  The Black Tiger, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, Newman's Extra Bold, etc. all can be good but not great.  I had pretty much decided that given the convenience of the Keurig machine I would have to sacrifice a bit on taste.  Then I stumbled on Diedrich's Sumatra and I'm hooked.  This is the one you want to buy in bulk and keep in the pantry.  It's a very good Sumatra blend that is great hot or even just slightly warm.  It's never bitter and very smooth.  It has that classic chocolate Sumatra flavor.  For me this is the only k-cup I've found to be consistent time after time.  I'm on my fourth box already.
