review/summary: Bad Buy
review/text: I recently found out I was allergic to gluten and went looking for granola bars. This was the closest I could find, and I was very very disappointed. They taste horrendous. I took one bite and had to throw the rest out. It's a shame, but I recommend finding another brand, because even by GF standards (which I consider lower than wheat containing standards) these are really bad. Try Udi's GF granola that comes in a bag if you're looking for something sweet for breakfast. It tastes great.

review/summary: Kids love this
review/text: This is the most popular Glutino Breakfast Bars around here.  Not just my family but also the young boys (5 and 6) that I sometimes care for, who don't have issues with gluten, ask for them.  It is less sweet than the other flavors, and Glutino Breakfast Bars are in general not as sweet as other brands.  It also tastes very wholesome and natural, almost like fig bars but with less over-powering filling, made of apples.  We have tried other flavors---blueberry is pretty popular here too, but not cherry and strawberry, they taste more like flavoring than real fruit to us.  The bars are soft but not too crumbly and easy for even 3 or 4 year olds to hold.  We always have a couple of boxes because we go through them quite quickly, and have not gotten tired of them!

review/text: I was looking forward to eating these bars for breakfast, but when I bit into one, I was surprised by the sweetness. I wouldn't eat these for breakfast every morning, I don't know if I would eat them for breakfast at all, but they are good, just a bit on the sweeter side. This is not the first glutino product I have tried, but it is the first cereal bar from glutino I have tried. I would buy them again but maybe get a different flavor, like strawberry or blueberry. These bars taste a lot like fig newtons. Overall, good.

review/summary: Great Bars Are Easy on the Stomach
review/text: We are an always busy famiily of four, with two of them teenagers, and we eat a LOT of bars, with different people having different favorites. Our daughter does not have celiac disease, but has an easily upset stomach, and likes these Glutino Gluten Free breakfast bars best. I like all kinds of bars, but I've also noticed that Glutino bars (of whatever flavor) satisfy me whether for breakfast or a snack AND at the same time do not make my stomach feel like there's a lump of food in it. I think this is due to the lack of gluten, because I've also noticed that gluten-free muffins do not make my stomach feel full the way a regular muffin made with flour does.<br /><br />In addition, the Glutino bars have no cholesterol and very low sodium.<br /><br />Here's some basic nutritional information on the Glutino Apple bar. For comparison, I show the information for other bars currently in our stash. (Sorry, the review format doesn't allow nice spreadsheet columns.)

review/summary: Apple filled sawdust bars
review/text: I saw that it actually has several good reviews but this was one of the most disgusting things I ever tasted. This was the first gluten free product I tried followed by a sandwich with brown rice bread. I thought I would end up starving because it all tasted like sawdust. I did make myself eat the whole cereal bar but it was horrible. I kept the box sitting on my desk because I hated to throw away a $5 box after eating one. Yesterday after them sitting on my desk for over 4 months I finally threw them in the trash yesterday. I was very sad & disappointed. I was looking for something quick, easy & tasty & this was far from tasty. I haven't found a good cereal bar yet but I find plenty of alternative things to snack on & eat that taste better. I definitely suggest you start with 1 box & make sure you like them first.

review/summary: Love Glutino but not this product
review/text: After going on an anti-inflammation diet, I was forced to find substitutes for almost everything I was used to eating.  I've had lots of success with Glutino products, but this is not one I would recommend.  The bar itself isn't too bad, but the filling is pretty awful.  It disintegrates into a nasty, almost grainy paste.  The apple taste is ok, but the texture of the filling was very hard to swallow.  I tried this for the first time on my morning commute, and had I not been on a crowded bus I would have likely spit it out. I definitely will not by these again and am not sure that I can bring myself to finish the box.  However, definitely check out Glutino pretzels, wafer cookies, and other products!

review/text: Surprised pleasantly by this product which I originally purchased locally here in AZ for $1.39 a package [got two for the trial]. Liked it so well that the Maggi search took me to Amazon. The product was available at a very reasonable price and no s/h charge for a case. Ordered two 48 package cases which arrived quickly and in excellent shape. We follow a Maggi Hot & Sour Soup technique of adding a well stirred egg slowly  in to the soup [stir in one direction] about two minutes before it's finished. You'll soon ask the question - where did all those noodles come from? HA! Enjoy a treat...

review/text: This syrup is yummy! It doesn't taste of fake or chemicals like other brands of watermelon flavoring that I have tried. I will definitely buy this one again!. I made watermelon lemonade for the kids and I used this in watermelon margaritas for the grownups. Great for a summer party. I think it would be nice to use in a wine spritzer too instead of grenadine for some color and better flavor.

review/text: //This soup is actually tasty, but is not gluten free. Less than 10 ppm?? Give me a break!! I have tried this soup twice on my 3 yr old and both times he has a instant reaction. Call the phone number on the back of the can and you get a person that doesn't have a clue and literally will read you what the back of the can says. Couldn't even tell me if it was processed in the same facility with gluten. His exact words "Ma'am, it says gluten free on it." Useless. Do some digging on the internet and you'll find a company statement saying "natural flavors and spices might contain traces of gluten". Put it on the can!! Just wanted to write a warning to all the sensitive Celiacs out there.//

review/summary: Great cashews
review/text: I love cashews, but not all cashews are created equal.  I've had cashews that are too gummy, too brittle, too roasted, too salty, not salty enough, too sweet, or not sweet enough.  I've even had (supposedly unflavored) cashews that have tasted strangely like BBQ.  Gross.  Planter's always gets it just right with their cashews, and these convenient little bags are the perfect size for a snack.  Highly recommended for nut lovers.

review/summary: Delicious, perfect snack size package, stays fresh
review/text: I love these cashews. They're Planters, so they taste great. These snack sized packages cost more than buying a larger container but they have three significant advantages that make the extra cost worth it to me: 1)Portion control. I only eat 1 ounce because I only eat what is in one packet. I like knowing that I'm only eating a 160 calorie snack. As healthy as nuts are, I really don't need to be eating more and I don't think I'd be as disciplined with a 16 ounce tub of cashews sitting between me and a television. 2)Freshness. I find that by the time I get towards the bottom of a larger container, the cashews are always soft to some extent. To make things worse, I find myself hurrying through the last of the container before they get even softer (so they taste worse and I'm eating more...) This won't happen when each ounce is individually sealed. 3)Portability. I'm not much of a take-my-food-with-me type of person, but if I'm hungry and in a rush to get out the door, grabbing a packet if these and an apple goes a long way. One other thing I like about these snack packets is that they open easily and down the long side of the packet, so the cashews inside are easy to get to. I ordered with 'subscribe and save' and enjoy having a pantry stable delivered to my door on a regular basis -- thanks Amazon!

If you're not into strong coffee than use less until you find the exact amount that<br />suits your taste . Personally I like this coffee iced . In my opinion<br />it brings out more of the flavor . But that's my taste . I have tried<br />several other favors of Coffee Masters and enjoyed them all . Creme Brulee is yummy , as is the Amaretto , and Caramel kiss .

review/summary: EXCELLENT COFFEE AND PRICE!
review/text: My husband and I owned a retail store in 1990 amd we used to buy the coffee wholesale from Coffee Masters to sell in our store. We even visited their manufacturing plant and it was a class act and the owners were great people.  Whole bean coffee was not "popular" back then as it is now.  When we sold our store, we missed having all their great coffees at our fingertips.  When I found out they sell coffee on Amazon, I was delighted.  It is several dollars cheaper than the Millstone brand that you find in the retail stores and it is a far better product.  We have our account set up on auto-ship and with that program you get a discounted price.  The excellent thing about this program is you can cancel at any time, change the type and flavor of coffee you want and change the delivery times.  It is a win-win situation because you get excellent coffee for an excellent price.  Thank you Coffee Masters for making your product available on the internet.  I will be a customer for life!<br /><br />Diana O'Rourke

review/summary: I consider this purchase SAVING money
review/text: I am still trying to find a local store that offers certified USDA sprout seeds. But until I do I continue to order here on Amazon...and these seem to be the best pick I've found.<br /><br />If you love the health benefits and/or taste of sprouts on your sandwiches, salads, casseroles etc. this is the best way to go. Not only do you SAVE money by growing your own, you can't beat the fact that you are getting organic, guaranteed pesticide-free ones here that you grow in your own kitchen. I am a sprout lover and find these far more full of taste, freshness, and crispness than even those that I buy in the organic grocery stores so I much prefer to grow 'em on my own.<br /><br />Too, I have found these to offer a good bounty of sprouts. Once grown, they'll last far longer than the store bought was well. (You are avoiding the transport and storage time prior to purchase of ready-grown sprouts which is probably part of the reason for that.)<br /><br />Not to mention it's kinda fun to see em grow!<br /><br />Only negative I'd have for the seeds is the cost of shipping to Austin. I wish these were on the free shipping program from Amazon and I'd just buy enough to get the free shipping. But even so, it's a cost savings and a taste bonus that makes it well worth it!

Organic seeds shouldn't have foreign substances in them period. Think about it. To tell you the truth they shouldn't even be in a plastic bag. Paper bags like the one's that Eden uses for their beans would be perfect. Plastic is nothing more than petroleum.

review/summary: A little too spicy for me, but still good
review/text: I only use about 1/2 the packet of the powdered soup base and it almost makes me start to sweat. I will be getting some Knorr cubes to try and cut the spicy down a hair, but other than that, these are great!!<br /><br />Chunks of onion, what looks like lettuce (possibly seaweed), and some ther vegetables make these far superior to Maruchen in my opinion.<br /><br />When you are deployed to Afghanistan and the chow hall choices start to get a little old, these area a great alternative. I usually go to the chow hall and pick up a little meat to cut up and stick in these and if i can find other suitable vegetables; I'll toss a few chopped up in and it makes for a great little meal. Now if I could only get my hands on some fresh eggs to make an "egg drop" variation; that would be fantastic!

review/summary: Handy. Tasty. High On Sodium. Low On Protein.
review/text: A few weeks ago I picked up a couple noodle bowls that I can keep in the pantry for occasional lunches or things like that. One was the Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup Hot and Spicy (Beef Flavor). It's real easy to prepare and I just follow the simple instructions. I use the microwave method and it's ready in a matter of minutes, The flavor is good. It's spicy, but not overly so. Strangely, although it doesn't seem overly spicy to the taste, if I inhale the fumes it irritates my nasal passages somewhat. I have had to learn to eat it without inhaling. The sodium is high so I don't like to have things like this very often and I'm careful of sodium the remainder of the day. The protein content is too low for a complete meal, so I add a few protein items. Today, I added a couple pieces of beef jerky. All in all, I'd say it's one of the better beef-flavored bowls I can remember. It's good to have a few handy things like this around but I wouldn't want them to become a major part of my diet..<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: 25% reduced sodium 80% reduced taste
review/text: I recently purchased three different Nong Shim noodle packs: their big kimshi bowl, ~2.6 oz shin bowl, and this beef and picante one.  This one tastes awful in comparison to the other products I mentioned above.<br /><br />The noodles themselves tasted very weak/strange and you can see little bubbles on them when you bring them up into the light.  I have a feeling it's because whatever they did was most definitely not how these noodles or the base were meant to be created.<br /><br />This is NOT a very spicy product compared to the other two and I felt kind of ripped off being that the main reason I bought this was because I wanted very spicy noodles as they were advertised as.<br /><br />Furthermore they leave an unsettling after taste that I only receive when I'm eating laboratory created sweeteners and things like that.  That being said I didn't have this aftertaste when eating the other bowls.<br /><br />I read all the reviews before I bought this product and urge you guys to try one of the other bowls.  This isn't just worse than the previous recipe they had for this bowl, but against all the other full msg bowls as well.<br /><br />Don't drink all the soup base if you want to reduce you sodium intake, eating this is just a disservice to you taste buds.<br /><br />I suggest the kimchi and shin bowls (kimshi being the best) they are both very very good, unlike this one.

review/text: I've eaten a lot of Ramen in my time as well as Cup-of-Soup and others. The one thing I did like about this product was that it was spicy - not overwhelmingly so, but just enough to give a nice little burn going down. Unfortunately, that was the only good thing about this product. The rest of it was bland and tasteless - no flavor, just spicy - and lots of sodium. They need to think about adding some flavor to the spiciness so that you want to buy it again. When they do, I'll try it again; until then, once is enough for me.

review/text: Having tried most of the commercially available BBQ sauces out there, this brand gets really high marks from me.  It is Kind of spicy, definitely tangy, and sweet all at the same time. It has a thicker consistency and really sticks to pork or chicken. I even like using it as a dip.  A tablespoon or two mixed with ranch dressing creates a spicy salad dressing that works well on salads. This really kicks it up  when eating BBQ.

review/summary: Best Candy Melt to work with in my experience
review/text: I recently decided to jump on the bandwagon and give cake balls a whirl for a July 4th Party I was having. I had never even seen, much less heard of candy melts prior to this undertaking. Of course, where do I go first when looking for something? Amazon.com! Now...I live in Texas and it's H-O-T right now, so I was concerned about product "meltage" during shipping. I drove myself on over to Michael's and purchased a plethora of Wilton Candy Melts. Well, I couldn't help myself...based on the positive reviews of the Mercken's Candy coatings, I decided to go ahead and order some White (5 lbs)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R92">5 LBS. Merckens White Coatings</a> and Blue (1 lb.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00085F7S2">1LB. Merckens Blue Coatings</a> Candy Coating. To my surprise, both arrived without melting...shocker! A few days later, I ordered Yellow Mercken's (1 lb.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008D6R9W">1LB. Merckens Yellow Coatings</a> and Paramount crystals <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012A2FVY">Paramont Crystals, 1 lb.</a>  , along with a couple other items. This shipment came and the candy melts had, well, melted! The Paramount Crystals were also a melted mess, but I figured since it was going to be liquified anyway...no harm no foul (or is it "fowl'?). I wasn't surprised by this...have you ever BEEN to Texas in late June? As my late Grandmother would say "It's as hot as Corn Liquor!" (not that she knew how hot that was, since she NEVER drank alcohol in her 94 years!) So, I will not remove a single star from my rating based on this product melting...after all, it is INTENDED to melt! ***take note those of you who remove stars based on issues irrelevant to the item itself, you know who you are, you're the people who rate a PRODUCT based things that don't speak to the product...such as shipping speed, poor customer service or other acts of God which have nothing to do with the actual worthiness of the product itself. Rant over.<br /><br />Okay...now that I got the "back-story" out of the way...the actual review! I set about making chocolate cake balls to make a r/w/b flag and some cheesecake balls, which were oh-so-yummy, but a big, fat, time-consuming pain, to put on a stick, coated and decorated with sprinkles. I also was going to be dipping pretzel rods and Oreos...a regular "dip-fest" as it were. Being one to experiment until I find the best/easiest method...I melted some white almond bark (I'd used almond bark in the past for white and choc dipped pretzels with good success), Wilton's Candy Melts, Ghirardelli White Chocolate (the bars for baking $$$$$), and finally the Mercken's Candy Melts. Of the 4, the Mercken's was the "winner" as far as ease of dipping, smooth consistency and taste. I hesitate to put taste in there, because it's so subjective and besides, they all tasted good to me. But, I do realize taste is an important consideration for most people. Really, the Ghirardelli had the best taste, but the cost and the difficulty in it "setting up" as nicely gave the edge to Mercken's for this project. The Mercken's did edge out the Wilton candy melts as far as MY taste buds go. Your mileage may vary. The Almond Bark was the least expensive, slightly more difficult to work with for this project, not real white, very yummy. Mercken's is available in many colors, is readily available (in Dallas), is less $ than Mercken's and certainly the Ghirardelli, but not quite a smooth and a tad more difficult to work with.<br /><br />Since this review is for the yellow coating, I wanted to mention you might consider purchasing a large quantity of the white candy coating, since it can be purchased in 5 lb. bags, and just use Candy Food Coloring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FWVX">Wilton Primary Candy Color Set</a> to tint it to a shade you like.  Regular food coloring does not work...it must be specifically for candy.<br /><br />If you're particular, like I am, and the extra cost doesn't bother you, go with the Mercken's . If this is a project with and for the kiddos, the Wilton melts will be hunky dory. It's not that Mercken's are head and shoulders above Wilton's candy melts, just moderately so. Wilton's are certainly more widely available, cost less and come in more colors.<br /><br />Bottom line (for me) is that Mercken's was easiest to work with and that was/is the biggest factor in my preference. With the sprinkles and candy coating...all the desserts I was serving were so uber-RICH and sugary, I rightly figured the cake-pops and such wouldn't get eaten as much as they would be looked at for their decorating value and cuteness factor. My soiree hosted no kids...just a a house full of (thirsty) adults who were more focused on the offerings of adult beverages and jello shots than they were the desserts.<br /><br />***Note, I have pretty much the exact same review for the 1 lb. white, 1 lb. blue and 1 lb. yellow Mercken's Coatings, thanks to "Cut and Paste", to spare myself the trouble of re-writing the same review. Therefore, there is need to read my reviews for those items.

review/summary: Cheep jerky cheeply priced.
review/text: You get what you pay for.  This jerky was crumbly and overly seasoned with MSG.  Papaya extract is used to soften the meat, but is over used in this jerky.  The result is a crumby texture that does not hold together when chewed.  It was not disgusting, but I would not buy it again.  Try their one pound bags instead.

review/summary: Super Delicious & Tender
review/text: Have no idea why anyone would say this beef jerky is tough. It is the most tender delicious beef jerky I've ever had. I have tried jack links & the like. THOSE are the toughest pieces of jerky ever. For a while I was getting walmart brand teriyaki beef jerky because of how tender it was...Then they stopped carrying it. My mother brought home 5 packs of these one time. She got a really good deal. I thought it was gonna be just like every other beef jerky...I WAS SO WRONG! It was super tender and seasoned just right. They were 3/4 lb bags that were gone in less than a week. I think I had jerky breakfast, dinner, and lunch with these things. SO GOOD. You cannot go wrong with this jerky.

review/text: On our search for that perfect beef jerky, we came across this promising beef jerky.<br /><br />This beef jerky comes in a resealable bag, so you don't have to eat it all at one sitting or transfer it to a resealable container.<br /><br />The taste is on the sweet side, salty, not too smokey & not too hot (spicy), but that's a good thing.  The pieces range from "huge" to tiny.  I didn't find any gristle or inedible pieces.  My son said he noticed an unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />This beef jerky isn't terrible, but in our opinion, it's not good enough for another try.

review/text: My dogs LOVE these Smartbones!  So much so that they sometimes turn their noses at other treats I try to give them.  These bones are a great alternative to rawhide, and Amazon & Co. have some of the lowest prices on them.  I have seen them sold for as high as $15.99 in some local stores.  The only downside is that they do not last very long, as they are so easy to chew through.  My dogs (Lab mix and Boxer mix) power through the medium and large sized bones in just a few minutes.  Still, all in all, worth the money!

review/text: I was expecting this product to be something I could sprinkle on my cream cheese when I eat whole wheat or low-fat bagels, since they aren't generally very tasty.  Unfortunately, I don't think this product was intended for that because the spices are pretty big and extremely crunchy.  (Picture sprinkling dehydrated onions on something and just biting right into it.)  I think this product is more intended to be used in cooked dishes so that the spices soften up.

I've missed the taste of this heavy, sweet rye bread and when I found it on Amazon, I ordered it, made it, baked it, ate it,,,and yummmmm, memory fulfilled.  Sweet, heavy, delicious.  Simple to put together since it is pre-prepared except for adding the yeast which is included.  Takes a bit of time because of allowing it to rest, and allowing it to rise, but actually very simple.  I'm not a bread maker, but felt like one when making this.  Just delicious and memory fulfilling.

review/text: I was disappointed with this malt powder. It really doesn't have a very strong malt flavor. The Carnation Malt powder you can buy in the grocery store is far superior taste wise to this product. You have to use an amazing amount of this stuff to get close to tasting "malty". So, today I bought a jar of the Carnation at the store to add to this so it doesn't go to waste. Sorry Kegworks, this is just more like instant milk flavor than a true "MALT" flavor. By the way, the Carnation is also cheaper than this. Postage was way too high, but I didn't mind paying it expecting to get a superior product.

review/summary: Instant Malt Flavor
review/text: This product arrived quickly and it is exactly as shown and advertised. The shipping costs were high, to me, but it did insure fast arrival. I bought another item at the same time i am still waiting for.(week longer so far) So, if the need for a quick malted drink is moving you, this did its best to quench that urge.<br />I have used it in various things as i had done with my malt additives in the past.  i used it with the homemade yogurt I now use instead of the hand packed french vanilla for my shakes people now call smoothies. I used it to add to the flavor of a cheesecake i make (coconut/malt, standard vanilla/malt,etc) It most definitely helped the cheesecakes and the shakes benefited as well.<br />My only issue, and not a complaint really, is the flavor isnt what i was looking for. It has its own flavor, for sure and i didnt need a ton of it for the presence to be noticed. I found the flavor pleasant enough and the fact that it was instant helped too.  I started using the malted milkshake flavors a long time ago and i didnt know of any retail instant types. some had to be 'melted' like or made into a syrup with hot water before i could successfully make them fully disperse into my shakes. that was 50yrs ago and i worked at a place where we made malted milks/shakes and the product was not the same as what i could get from the normal retail store. That is the flavor i am looking for, just the malt, none of the other flavors, vanilla or whatever sweeteners that is added to the mixes.  i can not detract from this product because it is good, easy to use and about the same price as the  big name brand, a bit more maybe. It should suit the tastes of a great majority of customers. Only a few might not love it but that is the case with any product.

review/text: Israeli couscous is impossible to find here in our "urbanized rural" area.  It's a product I have to look for when traveling out of the area.  I had not heard of the whole wheat version until I decided to look for Israeli couscous on Amazon.  This is terrific, tastes a little nutty rather than grainy, and cooks nicely in about 10 minutes (1 cup dry couscous to 2 cups water or broth).  It's terrific for risotto-like dishes. The problem for me is the price, especially when you add shipping.  You essentially get 3 scant cups.  That said, I like it enough to pay it again if I can't find it elsewhere.

review/text: I have been diagnosed with a Hiatal Hernia and acid reflux. I suffered with constant hoarseness, sometimes loosing my voice, not to mention the sleepless nights when I could not lie down. I have sit up to sleep many nights & you just don't sleep as well as when you can't  go to bed with your head on a pillow.  and all the medications give me gastritis.( I have tried all of them).  The Hoarseness was so bad  I had trouble talking , couldn't sing at church anymore and while I still have some of the hoarseness,  it is MUCH better since I started using Himalayan  Salt. I have been keeping quiet about it for about 2 weeks but finally told my daughter this week. I guess I was afraid if I talked  it would come back as bad as ever.  I was actually able to sing a little at Church this week end! So  now I am sure this salt is  is helping . I bought my first two small shakers at a local Health Food Store and then found this site on amazon, The price is so much more affordable. I gave my daughter a salt shaker full this week to try and I will see my sister this week end and have a shaker full for her to try. I Should shop for smaller shakers :) I will be ordering more salt soon if I keep giving this away but I am so thrilled with the results and I love the taste. I just want everybody to try it.<br />I don't even like the taste of my grocery store salt  after tasting  Himalayan  Crystal Salt<br />Try it You Just Might Like It

This may sound silly but it seems a little "saltier" than table salt, so it's easy to overdo it.  I guess I got carried away in wanting all its minerals and benefits, I used too much sometimes nonconsciously :).  The only thing that could be improved is that it should list all the minerals and all that on the container, although most people know the reason they're buying Himalayan salt beforehand.<br /><br />I don't even use a saltshaker.  I just pour a little into the black lid and sprinkle it onto my food from there.<br /><br />This stuff is just great.  And you get SO MUCH...this is one of the few products (if not the only) in the world that ends up being bigger than it looks on the advertisement!  The container is huge, for such a great price.  Thank you!!

review/text: These are great--I have bought another kind before but these are great & I like them being in 3 separate bags so I only bake 6 at a time.
