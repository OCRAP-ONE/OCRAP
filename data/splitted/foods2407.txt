review/summary: A tasty alternative.
review/text: I really love peanut butter, but one sandwich worth of peanut butter uses up most of your daily intake of saturated fats generally. This powdered stuff doesnt come close. It is as easy to use as simply stirring with a spoon and comes out just fine by my estimation. There isnt really a noticeable drop off for me personally, but i dont really eat really sugary peanut butter anyway (i would normally buy Justin's or somesuch). The chocolate is just right in this as well. Although i wanted to be able to eat PB&J's without taking up all of my fat intake, i also wanted to have something for my daily smoothies. I play around with variations, but my go to drink is kale, banana, apple, mango, and mint with flaxseed meal. This makes a great addition to that blend.<br />Anyway, i have seen mention of cheaper prices elsewhere, but for me, with Prime membership and a $5.50 price point currently, i feel the price is more than adequate, especially when factoring in no shipping and two day delivery.<br />I recommend trying this product. No transfats, high fructose corn syrup, or any added carp. Just a good, simple product.<br />Enjoy!

review/text: This stuff is good, and once you wrap your mind around the possible ways to use it,  you will need to be buying more!  The powder is very fine, much like Nesquick. Baking with it is easy, as well most things.  The flavor is spot on, though eating it plain is not recommended. I love this mixed in with my cereal or breakfast shakes.

review/summary: YUMMY "diet" food!
review/text: I just received my order of this and the regular PB2 today.  I've lost 53 pounds on my current weight loss and exercise program, but have been wandering off down the road to fat land again, with peanut butter and chocolate chips.  I had this for dinner tonight on a multigrain bread, with a banana sliced in.  Can't even imagine the calories I saved and I have no desire to dig into the regular peanut butter jar.<br /><br />The taste isn't quite like real peanut butter, more like roasted peanuts to me, with just a hint of chocolate flavor.  Doesn't matter whether it has the exact taste or not as long as the fat is gone and the taste is good.  This passes the test with flying colors.<br /><br />The texture is not quite like the creamy fat of real peanut butter either, but I'm not bothered by it at all.<br /><br />I will buy this again and hope that my review helps others to at least give it a try.  It might just be my new BFF for the next 40 lbs.<br /><br />Glad I heard about this and decided to take it for a test drive.

One of the greatest products I have come across in years.

review/text: After reading some mixed reviews, I decided not to get my hopes up too high for the chocolate pb2, so I didn't go into trying it expecting nutella or anything.  The consistency was a lot smoother than I expected, not as grainy as regular peanut butter, which I didn't mind.  It was nice and creamy and though it may not be as sweet as regular peanut butter, it was sweet enough for me to be happy to eat it alone with a spoon! haha.  I thought it was actually really good and can see myself keeping with this stuff for a long time.

review/text: I have only tried the Chocolate PB2, and after reading all the rave reviews, I was hoping it would be a little better.  I won't say I was disappointed, because it's still fine to use instead of peanut butter, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  You can't go into it thinking that the texture and taste will be too similar to real peanut butter.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3 because it's only 45 calories for 2 TBSP! The outstanding nutritional stats make up for it!

review/summary: Peanut butter minus the guilt!
review/text: I LOVE peanut butter.  I am the kind of person who will eat it out of the jar with a spoon, all by itself!  I like it that much.  Needless to say, this love affair is dangerous for the waistline.  Enter PB2, with 45 calories per 2-tbsp serving--an absolute godsend!  I tried and liked the plain version but this chocolate one is even BETTER!  It's not just chocolate flavored, there are actually tiny little granules of chocolate goodness in it, like micro-mini chocolate chips.  Yum!  Sure, it takes a bit of mixing and experimentation to get the consistency just right, but in the end it's great as a peanut butter stand in, either in recipes, as a dessert topping, or yes, even all on its own.  I love this and love that I can indulge my inner peanut butter fiend without too much fear of having to buy new pants.

It's just a little grainy, but that's to be expected when mixing a powder.  I like dipping fruits and veggies in it!  It's definitely satisfying, I'm just going to look at other buying options, b/c the price here is pretty astronomical for such a small amount. Only giving 4 stars for this reason, but it's a 5 star product!

review/summary: Feeding my sweet-tooth AND shrinking my waistline!
review/text: I'm not worried about my fat intake at all, but I love peanut butter and would easily eat 400 peanut butter calories daily.  I'll eat a spoonful by itself, put a couple in a smoothie...  With the same amount of PB2, I'm eating 90 calories.  That means I can dip apple slices & dark chocolate, eat spoonfuls, and still put some powder in my smoothie without gaining 2 pounds a month.<br /><br />I bought one bag of chocolate and one of regular and mixed them together (thinking if it was nasty, the chocolate would help it taste better).  It actually tastes really good! My boyfriend says he can't tell that it's not regular peanut butter (I can tell) and that he prefers the powder to real peanut butter in shakes and smoothies. (I make fake ice-cream all the time by blending ice, almond milk, banana, and pb2).<br /><br />Honestly, the powder doesn't taste the same. However, it is close enough to make me keep eating it instead of the real peanut butter in the cupboard.  I like that I can make it as creamy or as thick as I want, and I have to say ignore the picture that someone posted here, because it really doesn't look that nasty!<br /><br />I took a chance buying the larger bags because it's cheaper by weight, and I am not at all disappointed. PB2 is well worth the money and I will be buying it regularly.

review/summary: Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter
review/text: I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again "regular" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.

review/summary: One word:  SMOOTHIES!
review/text: Oh my goodness... If all I ever used this in was smoothies, I'd still get my money's worth.  I never imagined I could drink a peanut butter smoothie without first packing my bags for a fat/calorie guilt trip!  In order to get this much peanut butter flavor you'd have to add a ton of peanut butter to even perceive it in there.  To the woman that said it was too pricey, I'd say that ONE peanut butter smoothie from Jamba Juice costs as much as a bag of this stuff.  I'm SO glad I found this product and can't wait to see what other yummy uses I can find for it.  The possibilities are endless!<br />Try this recipe:  1 cup non-dairy milk (soy or almond) 1 frozen banana, 1 tbsp PB2 or PB2 chocolate  Blend and enjoy.

review/summary: So Good why isn't it Bad???
review/text: After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the "bowl" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called "netrition.com" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food, Netrition is a whole lot better!

review/text: This product is wonderful!  For a low-fat, low calorie alternative to peanut butter, this is the one.  I use the chocolate version - cocoa added.  It is still 90% peanut butter taste, with just a hint of cocoa and a little better color.  If you mix it with a little extra water, you have a good peanut dip or sauce for cooking.

review/summary: You'd be "nuts" not to use this!!
review/text: OK, if I were to tell you that you could get pretty much all the goodness of peanut butter without the calories, this, my friends is it.<br /><br />I'm a physician, so I'm always conscious about whether a product is more hype than fact, but in this case, PB 2 does not fail. It's made from impeller pressed peanuts (essentially the waste product of producing peanut oil), and this "waste product" is nothing short of rich peanutty taste without any oil in it. As a result, it's only 45 calories/serving compared to 200 calories/serving in regular peanut butter.<br /><br />Making this into peanut butter by reconstitution with water is a little tricky though. For those true peanut butter afficionados, you'll instantly spot the difference. The flavor is certainly there, and if anything, PB2 is more peanutty than natural peanut butter. But what it has in flavor, it lacks in texture. If you like the "stick to the roof of my mouth" sensation of peanut butter, you maybe disappointed because its texture is a little more pleasing to your tongue. However, as another reviewer said, the key to this product is SMOOTHIES.. let me say it again... SMOOTHIES.<br /><br />Oh my god, I make smoothies with this and it is incredibly delicious. Ridiculously tasty with peanut taste, and ZERO guilt. I only wish we were sold what would otherwise have been a waste product of peanut oil manufacturing process for something less than the cost of real peanut butter -- but if that were the case, then this wouldn't be capitalism, now would it?

review/text: It's amazing how good this PB2 tastes. Chocolate and peanut butter together how can that be beat! This has a little more sugar than just the peanut butter but it's really nothing compared to most things we eat now a days. I mix it right with my protein shakes and it kicks it up better than anything I've ever tried. Now the reason for the 4 stars. I don't blame amazon but the seller themselves for the really high price for this. I went on Bell Plantation website and was able to get 4 pounds of it for $30 which is a sick deal. It has 37 servings per pound which comes out to be very cheap per serving. I would HIGHLY recommend you not by it here on amazon but rather through their site, you will get it in less than a week. Think about it if you only use even just one scoop per day it would last you a little over 4 months and one scoop is plenty to give you an awesome tasting drink.<br /><br />Here is a Protein shake i make daily and it tastes really good,<br /><br />2 TBSP of PB2<br />1/3 cup powdered milk<br />1 TBSP Phsyillium Husk- for extra fiber<br />1 Scoop Protien powder of choice.<br /><br />It's a simple quick snack of about 250-275 calories so it's not a meal by any means.

review/summary: Peace Prize Worthy
review/text: Got this yesterday, have been like a mad scientist since...adding it to almost everything and thinking about more.  Last week got the newsletter from CSPI and PB2 chocolate and plain featured on the back.  CSPI trustworthy, so I went for it.  I normally get a jar of natural peanut butter, pour off the oil and then for several days put in paper towels to sop up the remaining oil.  Then I have maybe a teaspoon at a time - rarely more than a full tablespoon in a day.  We are in Easter Candy Season and the spectre of chocolate peanut butter eggs is everywhere.  Hard to be at peace with oneself when peanut butter - and especially combined with chocolate - is readily available.  Now this PB2 stuff is not especially chocolatey - but it is a wonder and my next order [soon] will be to try the basic version.  The contents of the one pound package will have to be transferred to an air tight container.  Note recipe on the side of the bag:  just plain weird for a "health food product" - a "MexiNut" dip involving an undiluted can of bean with bacon soup, canned tomatoes, velveeta, 1/2 cup of PB2 chocolate, and chilli powder.  As the soup, the tomatoes and the velveeta are sodium nightmares and the soup and velveeta heavy with fat, loaded with addditives, why would the company promote such a disasterous use of its "healthy" product?  Use your own good common sense and happy eating.

The flavor is not quite the same as normal peanut butter, probably because of the low fat content, but it is still pretty darn good.

I have ordered both varities, regular and this chocolate peanut butter, twice.  I love both of them, but the chocolate peanut butter is probably my favorite because I feel like I'm having a resees cup.  The product is all natural, no added preservatives.  Just the oil has been extracted leaving the peanut butter in a powder form. I add 1 TBSP to my morning shake, and it's awesome.  I have also hydrated it with a little water, and it's just delicious.  200 calories for 2 TBSP of regular p-butter or 45 calories for 2 TBSP of PB2.  You know what I'm picking.  Try it you'll love it.

review/summary: Amazing with smoothies , protein shakes
review/text: Having committed to a weight loss plan, I have relied more frequently on healthy smoothies and protein shakes as a quick and easy way to stick to the diet plan. The Bell Plantation PB2 powder has made me look forward to drinking the shakes - absolutely amazing! Before, I just gulped the shake down like it was bad medicine. Now, I can see that it is a factor in sticking to the plan - healthy choices can be quite tasty and delicious.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: The flavor is fantastic. I tend to like my peanut butter a little thicker, so I usually use a little less water. The richness of the oil which is no longer present in this product is certainly missed when the peanut butter is forced to compete with other flavors, such as in a sandwich... but as a light topping, this product is delicious.

review/summary: Perhaps My Favorite Food In The World!!
review/text: I made a decision years ago to eat healthier, and one of the things that I gave up was peanut butter cups.  However, I was overjoyed when I found PB2 with Premium Chocolate in my local grocery store (I'm also a big fan of the original PB2, btw).  It is in essence peanut butter with 85% less fat.<br /><br />The premise is that they roast the peanuts and then press out the majority of the oil before making the peanut powder.  When you go to use PB2, you add water for moisture to create a much lower fat version of peanut butter.  I find that I need to add a little more water than what the instructions call for in order to make it spreadable.<br /><br />While regular PB2 is good for anything you would use peanut butter for, PB2 with Premium Chocolate is great for sweet treats.  My favorite thing to do is to mix some up and have it with frozen yogurt - either plain vanilla or dark chocolate.  With dark chocolate frozen yogurt, I get something that is very close in flavor to Dryer's Chocolate Ice Cream with Peanut Butter Cups; however it has less than half the calories and only 13 calories from fat!  You can't beat it.<br /><br />The tradeoff you make is having to mix it up.  For me it is worth the effort.  I love this stuff.  In addition to frozen yogurt, it is also good as a topping for energy bars from KIND.  Get creative.  It is low cal, low fat, and it is also filling.  What you mix up is very dense with the majority of the fat removed.  I can't recommend this enough to anyone he is looking for a healthy alternative to satisfy their peanut butter and chocolate cravings.

review/summary: Yummy (even if not quite "chocolatey" enough)
review/text: This is a great, sweeter alternative to regular PB2 (which I also absolutely adore). It is not very chocolatey, though, so don't go expecting anything near Nutella flavor. Still, for it's nutritional stats it's irreplaceable and the flavor is still quite delicious--it's not overwhelmingly "peanutty" either, so it makes a great middle-of-the-road compromise to satisfy cravings for something different while still being healthy. I've been using this and regular PB2 for about 4 years now and I'll never go back to regular nut butters! It's just too perfect to argue with. WONDERFUL for baking to infuse a chocolate-peanut flavor, and so easy to prepare, not to mention the shelf life is extended without adding hydrogenated oils like most churned peanut butters do!

review/text: Until now, Weight Watchers has left me peanut butter deprived. Ok, so the texture is not exactly like peanut butter. What do you expect? It's 1 point per serving instead of 5! I am eating this twice a day! Got friends hooked on it, too. It tastes great, and I actually prefer it with apples over peanut butter as it's easier to dip into. Buy youself a Yonana to make "frozen yogurt" from frozen bananas, and stir in a little prepared PB2 with Chocolate for a guilt-free dessert.

review/summary: Great low-fat alternative to peanut butter
review/text: I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this product, but once you get used to the idea of mixing up your own peanut butter, it's really quite good. I have tried both the plain and the peanut/chocolate version, and I prefer the one with the chocolate for eating on rice cakes and such. However, I have been adding the plain to my chocolate protein shakes, and that works really well too. It's like drinking a candy bar. If I eat the plain one as peanut butter, I usually add some Truvia or honey, because it just doesn't seem sweet enough on it's own. If you order the peanut/chocolate version, I highly recommend sizing up, because it goes rather quickly, and you will wish you had more. You will also save on shipping.

review/summary: My Fave for Peanut Butter Cup Smoothies!
review/text: As a low carber, I am always trying to find products which have a "to die for" taste and also fit nicely into my diet.  This PB2 with chocolate fills the bill to a T!  It's great for baking...(hint mixed with some coconut flour, eggs, sweetener, etc and you have yourself a lovely peanut butter cookie - low carb style)...and perfect for my protein smoothies.  I make a pitcher of my Peanut Butter Cup smoothie because other members of my family have claimed this to be their fave as well.  Using this PB2 with chocolate, Silk Light chocolate soymilk, ice & water, a little bit of sweetener (I have a serious sweet tooth!), a pinch of salt, chocolate protein powder, and a little bit of real peanut butter, I get about 2 quarts of smoothie for cents per serving!  What's more is it's only 110 calories & 10+ grams of protein per 8 ounces!  That's awesome in my book!

review/summary: One WW point!
review/text: I heard about this product in my weight watchers meeting.  I ordered it from Amazon, not expecting much in the way of flavor.  Really, powdered peanut butter?  But a 2 tablespoon serving is only 45 calories (or 1 point in the world of WW), so I was willing to try it no matter how bad it tasted.  Well, I have gone through 4 jars (2 regular and 2 chocolate) and I just ordered the one-lb bag of chocolate.  The main thing I use it for is a Smoothie.  The middle of every afternoon I make a Smoothie with a banana, 2 TB of chocolate PB2, a half cup of fat free milk, and about 3/4 cup of ice.  Blend until smooth.  So, so good, and it is very filling and I don't get hungry again until dinner.  I also use it to make a dip for bananas and apple pieces. (Mix 2 TB with water until smooth.)  The regular flavor is good for this.  (I have used the regular flavor to make a peanut butter sandwich, but it does leave something to be desired used like that.)  I love love love this product.

review/summary: good, but doesn't taste exactly like peanut butter
review/text: I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that powdered peanut butter made with water is not as creamy or smooth as peanut butter made with oil. This product is yummy, and I do eat it, but I've found I eat more than I would if I were eating regular peanut butter because it's not as satisfying. It's not as easy to spread on bread, though it's fine for my celery and peanut butter afternoon snack. I bought both the peanut butter and peanut butter with chocolate and have also found the chocolate taste very subtle. Haven't decided whether I will buy this again.

I can actually just make up a couple tablespoons (50 calories, 1 wwpoint!) and eat it straight for a quick sweet treat! It's that good! Want to try something even better? Make up about 4 tablespoons in a bowl, put it in the freezer and....yum! It is a frozen ice cream-like treat! Really, try this and I am sure you will as pleased as I am....! By the way, Amazon was great....this came quickly...as all my Amazon purchases have....they are great!

review/summary: Peanut Butter Satisfaction
review/text: I love the taste of peanut butter but I just don't want the added calories or points.  This product is great if you like the peanut butter flavor it is a must try for a low cost.  I use it when making a low point strawberry & peanut butter smoothie.  It is the best, great taste, only 1 points-plus for 2 TBSP, and guilt free!  My taste buds are dancing with pleasure.  For my smoothie I use 1 cup of frozen strawberries (in place of ice), 2 Tbsp of PB2 powder, and 1 cup low fat milk just blend for 1 minute and enjoy. Buy this product another way to use it like a spread on wheat crackers (just add water slowly making the consistency you like & stir). Also I have added it to a plain 6oz yogurt & 1 TBSP of PB2 and dipped a banana - if you're following a healthy eating plan you have got to try this as a new snack or even a breakfast.  I think my next experiment will be with adding it to sugar free frozen yogurt or sugar free vanilla ice cream.  Yummy  : )  Thanks for reading my comment.

review/summary: Low fat, low sodium, great for baking or smoothies
review/text: I've used regular powdered peanut butter for baking in the past (not PB2 brand) and really liked it.  It stores well long-term without going rancid like the oils in regular peanut butter do.  It also adds a great peanuty flavor to cookies, cakes and pies.<br /><br />I was happy to find this chocolate flavor available here on Amazon.  It's a little expensive at $10.99 per pound, but with free SuperSaver shipping for orders over $25 I decided to try it.  And since most recipes would use 2-4 tablespoons of powder, a pound will last at least as long as a big jar of regular peanut butter.<br /><br />When my order arrived I was very happy to see that it is vacuum sealed in a thick mylar bag.  This keeps it fresh and dry for several years, if unopened.  I opened mine and followed the directions - 2 TBL powder, 1 TBL water, and mixed well.  It became a nice paste with a slightly grainy texture and delicious chocolate peanut flavor.  It was reminiscent of coffee, and not overly sweet.  It wouldn't be fair to compare it to full fat, mechanically mixed peanut butter, but I thought it was really tasty.<br /><br />The best thing about this product is the reduced fat and calories.  I compared labels from regular peanut butter and PB2 chocolate powdered peanut butter and these were the comparisons (regular PB on the left, PB2 on the right):<br /><br />Fat: 16 gm / 1 gm<br />Calories: 190 / 45<br />Carbs: 7 gm / 6 gm<br />Sodium: 150 mg / 70 mg<br />Protein: 7 gm / 4 gm<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this product and will definitely buy it again!

review/text: It's not often that I'm really impressed with a new product on the market.  In the world of nut butters, what could anyone expect that would really be new?  When I first heard about PB2 products on a food blog, I was skeptical to say the least.  When I showed it to my wife, she was even more skeptical.  But then I took a piece of freshly baked banana bread, reconstituted some chocolate PB2 and spread it on top.  We were both amazed.  While PB2 isn't exactly like peanut butter, it is plenty close for me.  The peanut flavor is true and tasty.  Considering the savings in calories, this is one of the best calorie saving products I've seen introduced in a very long time.  My only con is the cost.  The stuff is expensive.  As such, it will remain a product we don't indulge in as often as we like.  But when the mood strikes, it's good to know we can enjoy peanut butter and still manage to lose weight.  5 stars for product quality, flavor and ingenuity.  2 stars for price.  Perhaps that can improve as their customer base grows - I can only hope.  Regular PB2 and Chocolate PB2 both work great for me.  Some may not prefer the chocolate flavor, but that's as much personal taste as anything else.  The quality of the product is very good.

It's super easy to make too... just pour the powder, add water, and mix.  I would suggest adding the powder and mixing in the water bit by bit.  I haven't had peanut butter in years... I developed stomach issues and foods that are too heavy or very high in fat make my condition worse, but this takes me right back to the days I could eat peanut butter by the spoonful. I just ordered the 2 pack, and I can't wait for it to get here :)

review/summary: Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter
review/text: I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again "regular" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: As I said above, I LOVE this stuff. Yeah all capitals on love ;). I have been eating this product for almost a year now, and while I started with the regular peanut butter flavor, I tried the chocolate soon after and never looked back. I use this every morning in my homemade oatmeal. I use instant Quaker multigrain oats about 50 grams(much heartier & filling than regular quick oats), along with some dark brown sugar 6 grams, a sprinkle of Butter Buds season salt, a serving of Chocolate PB2, some kosher salt to taste don't know how much & about 11-12 grams of Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet chocolate chips (they're dark chocolate chips). Overall when I use 50g of instant oats,  it is about 295 calories according to My Fitness Pal calorie counting app on my phone. Using the serving size of 40g is about 262 calories. 40g is 1 serving according to the container I believe but I like just a little more.  I got the idea when I purchased the Quaker instant oatmeal in Chocolate Chip flavor for my kids. I was starting a diet and was eating as healthy as possible, and I thought hey, I can make this but in a healthier form. I have since been eating this and an apple daily for breakfast for about 9 months now and it's the only thing I look forward to eating every morning. That's amazing since I usually get sick of eating the same thing after awhile and need a break. Sometimes I never even crave that particular food again if I've really overeaten on it. I now often eat it as part of my dinner as well since I crave it so often. It's almost like a dessert when I use semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips. I have also used different types of chocolate chips (semi sweet, milk chocolate, Hershey's special dark choc, etc.) but usually go back to using the Ghirardelli due to the so called health benefits of eating small amounts of dark chocolate that is made of at least 60% cacoa. I have maintained my goal weight for the past 9 months and have not gained additional weight eating this, so for me it is not only healthy, but a somewhat guilt free indulgence at times when my body craves a sweet dessert. All good things in moderation though, if I ate this in larger quantities or more often in the day the carbs and sugar Would catch up to me and I would start to gain weight again, so just like everything else you need to be conscious of calories in and calories out if you want to add this to a healthy diet. Love it!!!

review/summary: Try it... it's pretty good!
review/text: Actually this stuff is pretty good! There's a 'no calorie' peanut spread being sold on here that you should avoid. I bought and have tried this and the regular PBS (non chocolate) and like and recommend both!

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I honestly couldn't taste even a hint of peanut butter or chocolate in this product.  Waste of money!  I'd rather not have peanut butter than attempt to substitute with an inferior product like this again.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I rate this 4 stars only because the chocolate flavor isn't as flavorful as it could be.  The chocolate could be more distinct.  That said, the PB2 product is wonderful.  The regular PB2 peanut butter is definitely a 5 star treat.  Quick and easy to mix and it blends well without clumping or lumping.  I've been using this product for the two years I've been on Weight Watchers and I don't miss regular peanut butter at all.

review/summary: Wonderful Peanut Butter
review/text: This was recommended by my nutritionist as I have a lap band & do not need extra fat & calories.  It has a great taste & satisfies my craving for desserts late at night.  I also put this in my yogurt breakfast shake with a banana.  Great treat & highly digestible.  Love this chocolate flavor & the regular peanut butter flavor. Very satisfied with price & fast delivery from Amazon.

review/summary: Great for what I needed it for!
review/text: I use this for my breakfast shakes in the morning.  It adds peanut taste and protein without the fat!  I have also hydrated it and had it on toast and it is pretty good but I do miss the oil consistency a little bit.

review/summary: PB2
review/text: I ordered both the PB2 plain, and the chocolate/peanut butter variety, and have been vastly pleased with both.  I have mixed both according to directions, eaten them with crackers, and mixed them with raisins and sunflower seeds.  My favorite use, however, is in the refrigerator porridge recipe.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: OK, but not for my taste
review/text: I like the regular PB2, the taste of this product is strange, doesn't seem to be a discernable chocolate taste. I'm not a smoothie person so if it doesn't taste good by itself right out of the jar, then I'm not going to be a fan. Again, not bad, but not for me, I won't be buying again, but have ordered the regular PB2 again, I luv that!

review/summary: PB2 Chocolate -- so good!
review/text: To help me with my Weight Watchers diet, I have been searching for a healthy peanut butter.  I found PB2 on Amazon and gave the regular flavor a try.  It is perfect for my needs.  When I saw the chocolate I had to give it a try.  It is wonderful!! I mix the powder to a peanut butter consistancy and spread over toast.  I mix the power in milk for a wonderful milk shake.  And it fits perfectly within my Weight Watchers diet, giving me lots of flavor for a minimum of points (you WW's know what I'm talking about.)  My daughter loves it, as do most of the people who have tasted it.<br /><br />Because it is a powder, it does not contain fat.  People expecting a rich peanut butter/chocolate taste may be disappointed.  However, after a few tries I find I like this much better than traditional peanut butter.  I like it so much I have ordered it 3 times, and will continue to order this delicious treat.

review/text: I really liked this product. For me, there's not much need to have a dry powder regularly on-hand, but it does make good shakes, so I'm glad that I tried it.

review/summary: Awesome Peanut Butter Alternative
review/text: This stuff is great! I love peanut butter, but can't afford the high calories and fat. This allows me to add a ton of peanut butter flavor to my protein shakes without all the calories or fat.

review/summary: Not as Flavorful as the regular PB2
review/text: I bought both the PB2 & the Chocolate PB2.  I am pretty disappointed in the chocolate.  It has neither a strong chocolate nor a strong peanut butter flavor.  Not worth the money.

review/summary: Great Product if Jiff is Excluded from One's Diet
review/text: In November of 2011, I downloaded the LiveStrong App and began making better choices in what I eat and began to control my caloric intake.  Limiting myself to 2,000 calories per day does not leave much room for peanut butter, or rather, sitting down in the living room in front of the television with a sleeve of crackers and my beloved jar of Jiff peanut butter and a butter knife.  Those days have long been over.  However, I still have the urges and I miss peanut butter badly.  I stumbled across PB2 when I was doing some research on a machine called Yonanas, a machine that turns frozen bananas into a creamy tasty soft serve.  I noticed in the machine reviews that some people were mixing chocolate PB2 with frozen bananas in their Yonanas machine.  I had to give this a try!  I ordered a regular PB2 and a chocolate PB2.  I must say that this stuff really really does taste wonderful considering its low calorie count.  I really love PB2.  It is giving me back something I have missed dearly.  The powder is very fine, but mixes pretty well and pretty quick.  I always start with a little less water than the directions say and work up to a little more if needed.  It is absolutely delicious to someone like me that has removed traditional peanut butter from his diet.  I highly recommend this product.  It is a pricy product, but worth every cent!  No regrets.
