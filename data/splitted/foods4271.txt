review/summary: It's SPLENDA FOR ME~~~~~YUM
review/text: I use Splenda any place I used to use sugar. It is made from sugar but has no calories. I have stopped drinking Pop and just buying the 20 cent unsweetened popular brand of kids drink mix. I add about 2/3 cup Splenda and it tastes great.<br /><br />It's great for baking and you use it measure for measure the same. I love it in my coffee.<br /><br />The other popular sweetener that I cannot say name has a lot of side effects for some people Me being one of them. I get no ill effects from Splenda and it leaves no unpleasant aftertaste.

review/summary: Great Sugar Substitute~That is Sugar.
review/text: I use this product almost everyday. I also use the Sun Crystals that are sold here at Amazon. When I want something really sweet I use Splenda. When I want to curb my cravings I use Sun Crystals. Both are great products made from real sugar and don't cause all the negative health problems that Nutrasweet does. You can not go wrong with Splenda.

review/summary: Sweet Freedom
review/text: I've been using Splenda since it first hit the market years ago. It's the absolute best no calorie sweetener I've ever tasted and causes me no side effects.<br />(Sweet n Low just tastes bad to me and Equal dries my eyes out.)<br />Though this version of Splenda is a challenge to bake with, it's not impossible. The sugar/Splenda blend is better for some baked goods, but this kind is fine for bar type cookies or the fudgier type.<br />My teenage son says Splenda has an after taste, I've never noticed one.<br />This type measures like sugar, but is "fluffier" and less dense.

review/summary: Our picky eater LOVES this!
review/text: We have a picky Abyssinian who had urinary crystals and needed either prescription food from the vet or canned food with a lot of extra moisture to keep the crystals from forming. A combination of this food and another 80%+ moisture high quality canned cat food has done this trick.<br /><br />  The salmon flavor of this type is his favorite. When he might normally walk away after eating less than half a small can of other foods, he will eat nearly an entire 3oz. can by himself given about 10 minutes. (He doesn't inhale his food like our two other Abys do. They will down this flavor in about 2 minutes flat.) All three Abys love the salmon in salmon consomme'. It is flaked salmon in plenty of moisture, a clear liquid "consomme'" with gravy-like consistency.<br /><br />  This is grain free and does not contain any poultry products (an allergy issue with our picky eater). We are very pleased with this AvoDerm product. We did not purchase it here online, as they were "out of stock" when I found it listed on Amazon.com. However, if it becomes available, I plan to purchase multiple cases.

review/text: My 10 year old, very picky Himalayan devoured this in minutes, as she did with the wild caught sardines in consomme and the chunky chicken (pink label)!  And I'm happy with the ingredients -- wild caught fish, chicken, and nothing else unacceptable.  I just bought a case (cheaper than my local pet store) along with a case of the chicken.  I understand it's wise to stay away from products with any kind of unidentified "ocean" fish in the ingredient list -- usually some kind of large fish, unfit for human consumption, presumably loaded with toxins.

review/summary: Not worth the price
review/text: I purchased a bag of this product which cost about $20 with shipping. The bag isn't quite as big as buying a bag of regular sugar,so in comparison, it's really expensive. That wouldn't bother me if I had been more pleased with it, but it really IS NOT just like sugar.. It's not as sweet at all and just doesn't work that great for baking, which is what I purchased it for. My husband is diabetic and really misses cookies, and we don't want to use any of the artificail sweetners on the market because of all the health hazards connected to them. But Just Like Sugar is not the answer. I made one batch of oatmeal cookies, one pan of brownies and one batch of no bake cookies with this one bag of product, so it cost almost $7 per batch for the sweetner!!! The oatmeal cookies were just so so.. not bad, but not great.. definatly not as sweet as they should have been and they had a different kind of texture.. I'm not quite sure how to describe it..Kind of grainy... The brownies, horrible!! A recipe that normally makes delicious brownies turned out flat and not very tasty. We ate one brownie each and threw the rest out. The no bake cookies were ok, probably the best out of the three recipes, but still not that great... My package of Just Like Sugar also included a small sample of the Just Like Brown Sugar.. I put it on my oatmeal but could barely tell there was any sugar on it..<br />All in all, I guess if you have no alternative it's better than nothing, but I won't ever purchase it again.. I'll stick to Stevia, which is also a natural product and is super duper sweet! I thought the Just Like Sugar would be more convenient because the makers of it claim you use the very same amount in recipes as real sugar, and with Stevia, there's a lot of conversion.. But the claims just aren't true... You'd need to use quite a bit more of the Just Like Sugar in order to have the same sweetness as sugar. Very dissapointing.. After all the hoopla about this product and supposed feedback from happy customers, it just simply doesn't live up to the claims.

review/text: The reason I bought this product to try and replace my Splenda usage when I drink coffee. It tastes sort of like sugar, but you need a LOT of it to have any effect. After I mixed in 10x the amount compared to my regular amount of two Splenda packets, my coffee tasted sweeter, but not in a good way, kind of acrid. I haven't tried baking with it yet, but I have a feeling it's going turn out about the same. I think I'll be sticking with less refined cane sugar for a while, at least until I try other alternatives such as Stevia, or Zsweet.

review/summary: False/Misleading advertising and a health conscious coffee drinker's perspective...
review/text: I started with the 1/2 tspn serving on the label for Just Like Sugar, and went up to about 10 times for sweet coffee.<br /><br />I drink coffee black most of the time, but when I use sweetener I expect it to be sweet with a reasonable amount in accordance with the serving size on the label.  This was not the case with Just Like Sugar (JLS).<br /><br />Based on my experience, which seems to be in accordance with some other reviewers here, instead of "330 servings" as listed on the 5.82 oz container, if you drink only one 6 oz cup of coffee a day, this product will last you anywhere from two weeks to a month and you will get 15-33 servings, if that is all you use it for.  I drink a small pot of coffee (5 cups) a day, so if I sweetened every cup, it would last me 3 - 6 days.  Fortunately I don't drink sweet coffee that often so I won't have to pay an extra $30 a month just for sweetener.<br /><br />Cost:  By Amazon's pricing, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002714IUI">N'JOY Pure Cane Sugar - 8/22 oz. Canisters</a> is .12 cents per ounce, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84">Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz</a> is $5.37 per ounce, and JLS is $1.80 per ounce (note that the $1.40 per ounce listed at this time by Amazon is also inaccurate) for the 5.82 oz container listed here at $10.49, however, the Stevia differs in strength.  Pure stevia extract is up to 300 times sweeter than sugar, and a 3.5 oz container contains 2381 servings.  JLS claims it is just as sweet as sugar, so by this statement you are paying more than ten times the amount of money you would for plain sugar.  Going by a .5 gram serving (as listed on the JLS label) and dividing each ounce by 56 (for .5 grams in each ounce), sugar is .002 cents per .5 g serving while JLS is .03 cents, and Pure Stevia Extract (PSE) is .008 cents per serving ($18.81 for 3.5 oz divided by 2381 servings).  Not only is this product almost 4 times more expensive than PSE, but the stevia extract is more potent per serving, and actually does sweeten an entire cup of coffee with just one serving.  Judging by the sweetness, you could probably go with just a half serving of stevia vice 10 times or more the recommended serving of JLS.  By this measure, JLS could be up to 80 times more expensive than stevia.<br /><br />I was introduced to this product in reading Dr. Blaylock's Wellness report, which I find helpful most of the time.  He says it is his favorite, so he may be simply enamored with a product that has no real proven adverse side effects and can be used as an alternative to sugar, which has many.  For those who happen to be Jewish, the product is apparently kosher, as the label also has the stamp of approval from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.<br /><br />Taking the recommended 1/4 teaspoon serving straight, JLS is light and fluffy, with a very slight crunchiness until it dissolves into a sticky texture.  There is little aftertaste, and it is relatively close enough to sugar to serve as an alternative, if you just ate sugar and didn't care about texture.  I have not found a sweetener yet that actually tastes the same as sugar, and even if it did, it probably would not have the same effects as scientific studies have shown sugar to have (opiate like).<br /><br />Conclusion:  While Just Like Sugar is probably better for your health than sugar, I believe Pure Stevia Extract is even better and may cost up to 80 times less per serving than JLS.  Of course, the healthiest option would be not using any sweetener whatsoever, but since you are here on a sweetener page, I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84">Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz</a> (PSEP) from Kal instead of this product.  Just remember, it is 300 times sweeter than sugar, so you don't have to use nearly as much.  There can be an aftertaste with stevia, but using the correct amount helps tremendously, and the aftertaste is sweet, not acrid.  The Kal PSEP product comes with a very tiny scoop, which I found more than enough (I could probably go with half that) to sweeten a full 9 oz mug of coffee.  Also, be sure to get "pure" stevia extract and verify that is the only ingredient on the nutrition label, as many other "stevia" products have fillers and chemically derived components of stevia.  Sweetleaf seems okay (I haven't tried it yet), as it's only other ingredient is inulin soluble fiber, which may be conducive to health, but it is much more expensive and much less potent.  Watch out for products like Truvia, which contains Erythritol (a sugar alcohol) as the main ingredient, rebiana (synthetically derived with chemical processes from stevia), and other "natural flavors" which can be just as bad, or even worse than some artifical flavoring (same chemicals, but can be unnaturally processed from natural sources).

review/summary: It's delicious!
review/text: I just made a batch of Nestle' Toll House Chocolate Chip Cookies with Just Like Sugar for Baking and I think they taste delicious!  I added 1/3 cup of Just Like Sugar to the recipe instead of 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar.  The chocolate chips are sweet too, so that helped.  I don't like a real sweet cookie, so if you like it real sweet, I'd add maybe 1/2-2/3 cup of Just like Sugar.  I did add a little more egg, and some milk, because the dough seemed a little dry.  You have to experiment with how much liquid and how much sweetner you need, since you are modifying the recipe, but I love this sweetner.  I would NEVER use Splenda, or Sweet and Low, because they are bad for your health.  I might mix a little Stevia with the Just Like Sugar, to keep the cost down.

review/text: This is another attempt at a sugar replacement that sadly doesn't taste like sugar at all. It is much less sweet than real sugar and actually tastes more like oranges than anything. Perhaps that's because it's mostly made from orange peel extract. If you like semi-sweet oranges, this is just the product for you. If you prefer real cane sugar, this will not cut it. I'd rather be a little less healthy and a little more happy. Pass me the sugar bowl...

review/summary: Just Like Sugar indeed - at least in brownies
review/text: I found the other reviews of Just Like Sugar on Amazon very interesting, as so few of them have shared my own experience.<br /><br />I swapped all the caster sugar (4oz) in my usual brownie recipe for the same weight in Just Like Sugar, and found that the only difference to my brownies was that they had a crunchier topping and outside than when I use sugar - otherwise they tasted exactly the same as when I make them with sugar: rich, sweet, moist and chewy. Nobody who ate them in a blind taste-test believed that they had no extra sugar. However, these brownies also contain 2oz dark chocolate, which covered up any difference in sweetness between Just Like Sugar and caster sugar. In a chocolate sponge cake, replacing all the caster sugar with Just Like Sugar produced a nice light sponge cake that was, however, slightly less sweet than the usual version.

review/text: It took some tweaking for me to get it down, but this has helped me cut sugar in recipes by 75% and maintain the same taste.  I have yet to find a sugar substitute you can use as a 1:1 ratio replacement for sugar/other natural sugar sweeteners (agave, etc..), but this is the best for reducing sugar without using chemicals and no bitter or weird aftertaste.  It's now a staple for me.

review/summary: Chemical smell/taste to JLS Brown
review/text: I used to use the JLS brown product quite a bit...and loved the distinct molasses smell and taste. Unfortunately, the last couple of bags I purchased (on three different occasions) had a highly chemical smell, and a very bitter taste. Contacted the company, but their customer service is 'over the top' bad. Had me send them the first bag that smelled bad, then never reimbursed me for the $20 bag or postage. Customer service rep wanted me to call his personal cell phone number and leave my credit card number for a reimbursement...when I refused and asked to speak to a supervisor, or to someone else about it, he hung up on me. Since ordered another bag and same problem with chemical smell and acrid taste. Maybe they changed the 'formula', not sure, but will not be using it ever again.

review/text: WARNING:  THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS CHICORY ROOT DIETARY FIBRE AS ITS FIRST INGREDIENT.  IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO CHICORY OR HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION WHICH PRECLUDES CHICORY, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!<br /><br />.........................................................................<br /><br />WHEN FIRST OPENING "JUST LIKE SUGAR", one is greeted with an over-whelming scent of orange.  This not unpleasant -- especially if one likes oranges.  And it is not surprising, since one of the ingredients, (the last one listed, strangely), is 'Natural Flavours from the Peel of the Orange."<br /><br />I was excited to taste this new sugar-substitute....especially since the e-mail ad for it stated that it was 100% natural.  (It is).  I also noticed, upon receiving it, that one ingredient, "Chicory Root Dietary Fibre", is, I believe, the same ingredient my grandmother had, when she had her COFFEE substitute...Postum.  Whether Postum contains "Chicory Root Dietary Fibre", or plain old chicory, I'm not sure, (haven't tried "Postum" yet)....but chicory is in "Just Like Sugar", in one form or another, sure enough!<br /><br />This product does taste like sugar...but it sure does take a lot of it to simulate the taste.  It is just slighly LESS sweet than sugar, in my estimation, (and that of my taste-buds!)  Also, as it is made from Orange peel, there is a slight stickyness to this product, which is much more apparent, (especially after finishing somethng sweetened by it), than there ever is with real sugar.  The taste is 90-95% "just like sugar" -- there is a very, (very), slight "heavy" feeling, and a very, very, slightly heavy taste here, that real sugar does not have.  However, on the plus side, there is no "cloying" sweetness, which an overuse of real sugar can sometimes add to drinks.  No matter how much "Just Like Sugar" you add, you will get only a sugary taste, never a "cloying" one.<br /><br />The inggredients in this product are:<br />  Chicory Root Dietary Fiber<br />  Calcium Vitamin C<br />  Natural Flavors from the Peel of the Orange.<br /><br />The label of "Just Like Sugar" proclaims it is "All Natural", has "No Aftertaste", "No Carbs, No Calories", is "Great for Baking", and "Tastes Just Like Sugar".  Whilst, (after looking at the ingredient list), I can happily agree with most of these claims, I have to say that, though there is, indeed, no real "after-taste", there IS a slight "after-stickiness", similar to what one sometimes experiences after eating an orange.  Not unpleasant, I guess...but quite unexpected.<br /><br />This product is obviously 100% natural -- just like sugar! Unlike SPLENDA -- an artificial sweetener actually made from sugar, (with one sugar molecule replaced by another), there is NO sugar here.  It isn't quite sweet enough for my own tastes, though...and I definitely feel that the suggested serving size listed on the bottle, (1/2 Teaspoon), is somewhat of a misnomer.  It's nice to be able to list 1/2 Teaspoon as a<br />serving size, because that allows the plastic bottle the "Just Like Sugar" comes in, to conain 330 servings, in its 5.82 ounces, (or 165 grams).  But...who uses just 1/2 teaspoon of sugar in their coffee, tea, or other drinks?  Not many people, I'd hazard to guess.<br /><br />This product is "Proudly Made In The USA" (hooray -- I try to use as many "Made In USA" products as I can, myself), and is also not only kosher, (as the manufacturer IS "Kosher Vitamins"), but also has an impressive seal on it's label, with beautiful Hebrew lettering. two leaves on either side of it, and what appears to be a suggestion of the outline of an Israeli city, (probably Jerusalem), above the lettering.  Below the Hebrew characters, is an inscription in English, just as impressive: "With the Approval of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel."  This product is obviously 100% Kosher, as well as 100% natural.  If you want a 100% natural product, don't mind the very slight heavyness in taste,  slight stickiness when you're finished eating or drinking whatever you prepare with it, and the cost, (it does seem higher in price...even in bulk...than most other sugar substitutes around today), I would say try it!  I guess the closest alternative would be "Agave Nectar"....also usually kosher, and also 100% natural, (it is made mainly from the cactus plant.)  Agave nectar doesn't taste quite as much like sugar as "Just Like Sugar", but it has a nice sweet taste of its own.<br /><br />As for me, I think I'll stick to (mainly) "Splenda" for the time being.  Yes, it's NOT as natural as "Just Like Sugar". but it is made from sugar, and certainly isn't, (in my opinion anyway), nearly as dangerous as "Equal", or "Sweet N Low".  Also, "Splenda" is a great deal less expensive than "Just Like Sugar", (but, to be fair, one must add that the more expensive price of "Just Like Sugar" -- just now -- may just be due to its being a very new product).  But "Splenda" has been granted the "OU" seal of the Orthodox Union of the USA -- meaning very, very, very, VERY Kosher, indeed, to anyone who knows anything at all about Kosher products.<br /><br />If you will not, (or cannot), sweeten your food with sugar, and must have something that is 100% natural, AND 100% kosher, you have a choice between "Just Like Sugar", and most brands of agave nectar.  So, I'd suggest you try "Just Like Sugar", (just one bottle), to test it out.  As for me, though I think I'll stick with "Splenda" most of the year...being raised as I have been raised, I might just get one or two bottles of "Just Like Sugar" for Passover.  It's not at all a bad product...just slightly sticky, and more than slightly expensive.<br /><br />P.S.: It also seems to have a sleep-inducing quality.  At least, I seem to be getting a bit sleepy now -- and a glass of lemonade, sweetened with<br />"Just Like Sugar" is the only thing I've eaten or drunk for at least the last 2 hours.  Hmmmmm.... (Zzzzzzzz....)

review/summary: This is the absolute Best Jerky Cure
review/text: I have been using this Cure as well as some other flavors from High Mountain for 8 years. This is by far the best cure. Sprinkle it on the meat per the directions, rub it in, place in frig for 24 hours. I then put the meat on a Brinkman charcoal smoker. I soak some hickory chips the night before, put 5-8 Kingsford charcoal briquets in the bottom of the smoker, add some hickory chips for the first hour and smoke the meat for about 6-7 hours total at 125-150 degrees. I add charcoal every 1/2 hour or so as needed to keep the tempature right. The meat comes out nicely dried with a hint of hickory flavoring. The pepper mix complement each other perfectly. I used to smoke alot of Flank Steak, but that got too expensive so I use a rump roast sliced to 1/4" or so. I have since been using up alot of Venison roasts and this works great although I have to cut down on the cooking time somewhat 4-5 hours beacuse the venison will get too dry since it is so lean.

I just used them more quickly and so far... no ill effects I'm pleased to say.  I am assuming the shipment passed through the daycare of the facility where the children had a time tossing the cans around!

I gave it three stars for the condition of the tins, not the quality of the product which is excellent.

review/text: I bought these last year for a friend at Christmas, and she loved them.<br /><br />When purchasing this product, be mindful from whom you buy it. This product is sold by several vendors, and I had some trouble with *The Natural Health Shoppe*. They didn't fulfill the order, and ignored my inquiries for days. Ultimately they canceled my order, saying I was rude to them, (I *did* become increasingly annoyed when they ignored me, but no profanity emanated from my keyboard) and claimed there was a problem with my address (I've been ordering through Amazon for YEARS and this is the first time that has happened). They might be ok as a general rule, but if you want something by a specific date, or if you want a prompt response to your inquiries, they're probably not to be relied upon.

European chocolate is not waxy in general, it melts in your mouth and the flavor is so much better. These truffles used to be European style and they were my absolute favorite, but now, THEY ARE WAXY!!!! What happened? Is it because they are being mass produced? Is it because they think Americans LIKE waxy chocolate?!!! Do not buy these truffles.

review/summary: Love the flavor and it makes my tummy feel good
review/text: I bought this tea because I read it was good for stomach bloating and just stomach discomfort in general. First I loved the flavor! Is on the sweet side and I just really like it. It does kind of settle my stomach. It doesn't make a huge difference but I feel like it helps. I usually drink a cup after I have a big meal or after I eat something that upsets my stomach or most of the time I just drink it because I really like it. I just bought my second box and I'm really happy with it. If you're looking for a sweet anise-like flavored tea you would really like fennel tea. The fact that it makes my stomach feel good is a plus because even if it didn't help at all I would still buy it just because I really enjoy the flavor. This is one of my favorite teas.

review/summary: Great for colic!
review/text: My newborn son was having issues with colic so a friend recommended for me to start drink fennel tea to help him.  It worked!  I drink 2 glasses a day and he hasn't had any issues since.  My husband doesn't like the smell, so when he makes it he throws a peppermint or blueberry tea bag in with it.  I like the taste of it plain as well though.  I tried another brand that has 'extra large' bags, but was not happy with them.  The fennel in these bags is crushed up so the tea is just as strong as the big bags (with whole fennel seeds inside) and much cheaper!

review/text: I bought this Fennel Seed Tea because it had more tea bags in it compared to the brand I usually bought on Amazon. I think the fennel seed tea is comparable from other leading brands in the market. I gave it four stars because I noticed that the tea bags tend to be rather fragile and some seeds do come through if you are not too careful. Nonetheless, overall this item is quite good.

review/text: According to Amazon's product description (as of 10/12/2011) this molasses has only one ingredient: dates. However, according to the label it is made from "concentrated date juice, sugar, water, citric acid" (see also the picture of the label with the ingredients that I uploaded). I did not want to buy a sugar sirup with some concentrated date juice in it, I wanted to buy a natural product made 100 % from dates. I will return this product.<br />PS: Once again I can only praise Amazon. The product is not returnable through the online system. But when I called and explained the situation I got immediately offered a refund. I love to buy from Amazon!

review/summary: I received "Concentrated Date Juice, Sugar..." ... tried again, got syrup
review/text: I was so excited to receive my order, considering the rave reviews. And I was so sad to read the labels on my jars -- which stated the ingredients as Concentrated Date Juice, Sugar, Water, Citric Acid." The web photo of the label says only "DATE." Apparently, the maker is sending Amazon a different product to substitute for the "pure natural" all-date one. This substitute is just a syrup. Other reviewers seem to love it, but I wanted pure date molasses. UPDATE: Since the customers who got lucky and got the all-date product loved it, I tried again. Sadly, this time, the "date molasses" didn't even taste like dates; compared to my first order, this batch looked light in color, had a more watered-down consistency, tasted to me like HFCS mixed with honey, and tasted to another person like pancake syrup. I wish the manufacturer would make a pure date molasses. They make a carob molasses, but I'm afraid to try it based on this experience.

review/text: On the two pictures that were taken, one with junk ingredients and one with just dates listed as the ingredient, I noticed the nutritional information remained the same....? If on jar one, sugar is the second ingredient and a serving has 12g of sugar then how can the date only jar still have the same 12g of sugar???  Also where is the fiber?  There are approximatly 1.2g of fiber per 2 dates. This seems like a very misleading product...

review/summary: What an amazingly sweet surprise
review/text: I purchased this on a suggestion from a trusted friend. I am not disappointed. This gives you the sweetness of dates without the pits. I use it in recipes calling for honey or even corn syrup. When used in banana bread it imparts a subtle flavor that really jazzes up the bread.<br /><br />I do not, however, suggest using it in cookies. it changes the way they flow out and set.<br /><br />The other great use is in fruit smoothies. Just a tablespoon of this added to your blender will pep up any fruit that is not absolutely juicy sweet. (And, speaking of smoothies, here is a little tip. Go purchase a small container of Soy Lecithin. In the presence of something like a banana in the blender, soy lecithin thickens the smoothie up and keeps it thick, even once it warms up to room temperature. Good trick!)<br /><br />On top of everything else, this 3-pack costs just a couple dollars over buying a single jar at one of our local specialty markets. Great deal and great taste!

review/text: What's to be said? It's a personal taste question. Add this to steal cut oats oatmeal and enjoy. Alternatively add the grape version. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4KVE">Alwadi Al Akhdar Grape Molasses, 24.75-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> The date molasses has a slightly stronger flavor than the grape. Both are less strong than sugar molasses and have to be better for you. Try one or both. Nix sugar and get some real flavor.<br /><br />UPDATE 2012<br />"Alwadi Al Akhdar Date Molasses" originally received 5 stars due to a pure date product with good flavor. Only foolish manufacturers deliberately deceive customers. Alwadi Al Akhdar apparently changed from a pure date product to concentrate with sugar, etc. without ensuring their customers would know of the change via requiring advertizing changes that reflect the new product being sold. This product is now 1 star in my opinion. If you want sugar, buy it as a granular bulk mixture and add water for a liquid form. The adverse health benefits will be intact.

I ordered it so my wife can make me a shoo-fly pie.  It is dark colored like blackstrap, but not quite as strong. Doesn't taste anything like dates. If you like the taste of a heavy syrup you would probably enjoy this product.  Just tell whoever packs it to tighten the lids before shipping.

review/summary: Great deal.
review/text: I eat a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast nearly every day. For me alone these 6 bags will last about a year.  These are prepared differently than I am used to, in the US rolled oats are the typical variety.<br /><br />For those not familiar, pinhead oats are the same as steel-cut oats, oats cut into small pieces rather than being crushed (rolled) in a mill and steamed.  The result is that they take longer to cook; rolled oats take about 10 minutes to get mushy all the way through, but steel cut oats can take up to 30 minutes to get soft and will probably never be as mushy as rolled oats.  This results in a different texture than rolled oats that a some people like.  Also of note, is that steel-cut oats are denser than rolled oats so the ratio of water to oats is closer to 4:1 rather than the 2:1 for rolled.<br /><br />All that being said, steel-cut oats have a lower Glycemic Index.  Plus they seem to retain a bit more oat flavor than typical rolled oats.  To help deal with the longer preparation time, I started making my oatmeal in batches for several days.  I use small containers, about 1 cup (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012DQ6S4">Rubbermaid 7J59 Easy Find Lid Square 1-1/4-Cup Food Storage Container</a>), and eat one every day for breakfast.

review/summary: Irish All the Way
review/text: Unlike McCann's, which has been processed here for the lucrative US market for quite a while now (I still have an old can saved from when it wasn't), all of Flahavan's products are actually imported from Eire. These oats are cut and so are a different texture from Scottish (and Macroom) pinhead oats, which are stone-ground. Flahavan's are more uniform in size and appearance and the mouthfeel is somewhat different as well--I personally have no preference. Differences from stone-ground aside, these are delicious oats with a sweet, robust aroma and chewy texture, even when cooked longer than called for in the cooking instructions.<br />If you've only had rolled oats, you owe it to yourself to give Flahavan's Pinhead Oatmeal a try. If the longer (20 minutes) cooking time is off-putting, try starting them off the night before. Using the instructions on the package and adjusting for the amount you want to make, bring the water to a boil, add the oats (no salt yet), and bring back to a boil, stirring. Turn off the heat, cover the pot, leave overnight, and then heat the next morning, adding a pinch of salt if you're so inclined (I dissolve it in a bit of water first). You might discover that your rolled oats seem a little tame by comparison! :)

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I lived in Ireland for 10 years, and really enjoyed having pinhead (steel-cut) oatmeal for breakfast.  The cost of such cereal in the U.S. is prohibitive, so I was glad to see it for sale on Amazon.com, and bought 12 bags!  Still has a great taste, and the expiration date is well in the future.

review/text: I love this product.  It is delicious and a great deal.  I saw on the package that I could add some milk with the water and I found it is even more delicious doing that.  These are the best oats.

review/text: It is chewy.  I like this better than old fashioned (rolled) oats.  I personally can not tell the difference between this and Mc Cain's Steel Cut Oatmeal.  Will definitely buy again.

review/summary: Best Apple Butter I have ever had!
review/text: As this is my first review, I'm delighted to be able give five stars to a worthy product. I was actually quite happy with a national brand, until I was given a jar from a friend.<br /><br />The difference is night and day. It's pretty difficult to describe how something tastes, but suffice it to say that McCutcheon's has really captured the essence of the apples. That is perhaps the biggest difference. The national brands seem to contain more molasses. But this brand is all about the fruit. As I said, it is simply the best I have ever had.<br /><br />I also like that it comes from a nice family business in Frederick, Maryland.

review/text: This is the best apple butter I have ever eaten. A friend brought me some back when he went to Maryland and I was hooked. I tried other brands but never found any this good. I was so excited when I found out I could order it nonline. I will be a regular customer.

review/summary: Best GF bread, IMO
review/text: I've tried other breads and by far the Tapioca Light is the best.  Definitely toasted, but much more palatable than the rice based breads.
