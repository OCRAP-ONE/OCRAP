review/summary: It's Amore!
review/text: My husband and I usually make our own sauce with certified San Marzano tomatoes. Really pleased to find a jar sauce that tastes homemade on those days when we just don't have the time to cook. We enjoyed the kick of peppery flavor with the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes. Love that it only has 2 grams of sugar per serving, 340mg sodium-not bad compared to many sauces that have 540 to 580mg. We also like that no paste or puree is added, the use of San Marzano plum tomatoes, Italian olive oil, Sea salt, fresh basil and produced in a green facility. We pay $8.99 for this at a neighborhood store.

review/summary: Not worth the price; too peppery
review/text: I really wanted to love this sauce, as pasta with marinara is my absolute favorite dish. My husband and I were excited to try this out, but sadly, we were very disappointed. The sauce tastes fresh, but it just doesn't taste that good. The sweetness of the tomatoes is completely overshadowed by excessive pepper -- so much so that the bitterness lasts in your mouth for a long time afterward, and our preschool-aged son (who loves pasta and sauce) couldn't eat it because it burned his tongue. Even my mother-in-law, who loves pepper, thought it was too much.<br /><br />Besides the pepper, the flavor is not amazing and seems lacking in herbs and seasonings. Also, the consistency is a bit too thin/runny. Our opinion: This sauce is not worth the money unless you are specifically seeking a pepper sauce. We give it 2 stars because it has good ingredients and the texture, while not great, is better than a lot of jarred sauces. (Side note: If you are considering this sauce because it seems similar to Rao's, beware! We LOVE Rao's, and this is nowhere near as good.)

review/text: I never liked tomato sauce on my pasta until I tried this cherry tomato sauce. It's naturally a little sweeter than most sauces, is quite peppery, and is, as the other commenter noted, very fresh tasting. It tastes almost as good as making a slow-cooked sauce yourself. I'm excited to find this sauce on Amazon, as my Costco no longer carries it.

review/text: At one time these bars were my favorite.  Tasty and soft.  Now they are suitable to be used as paving stones.  I have purchased from three or four different Amazon suppliers.  Each time the result has been the same - hard and unpleasant to chew.  I have stopped purchasing the Genisoy Chocolate Fudge Brownies and now purchase and eat Cliff Bars exclusively.  A shame, but life goes on.  Even without you Genisoy.

review/text: I have been searching for these bars in grocery stores for 3 years and finally realized that I should just check Amazon.  These bars are really yummy!  I used to cut them into 8 pieces each and refrigerate them before they disappeared from my grocery store.  They are the perfect little snack.  You could also eat a whole bar for breakfast-on-the-go.  They do dry your mouth out a little, so make sure you have a beverage handy.  My husband even likes them and he hates soy milk and other healthy foods.  If you've never eaten one before, beware: you'll become addicted to a healthy protein bar!

review/text: I went searching high and low for a replacement chocolate brownie bar when my taste for Clif chocolate brownie bar suddenly changed (I had no other food changes and the manufacturer swore they made no changes). I bought one of every type of chocolate protein bar and literally Genisoy was the last one I had to taste. I've had Luna bars and don't like their taste at all. My first byte into the Genisoy chocolate brownie had an after taste of vitamins, but after the first bar, that was gone. It was delicious and I love the fudgey texture. I had finally found my replacement protein chocolate bar after weeks of searching all the local organic markets.

review/text: I have been trying many different protein bars trying to match the taste of the P90X bars that are overpriced. Genisoy is my favorite (peanut butter fudge to be exact). it does not have the cardboard taste, has good texture, plenty of flavor with enough of a salty taste to compliment the chocolate. I'm sure these are much better for me than the P90X bars too. I wish there were 20g of protein instead of 14g, but still worth the purchase.

It does taste like soy but it is sweet enough to make you feel like you're eating a treat. The texture is similar to the original Power Bar but definitely tastes better.

review/text: I'm a ramyun addict and I have always loved ramyun since I was little.  It is the first thing I crave when I'm hungry and it's the only thing I can keep down when I'm hung-over. Ramyun has been and will always be my comfort food although I consider them very unhealthy. When I first spotted the Black Shin Ramyun on Amazon, I thought it was too expensive and didn't want to buy an entire box especially while I've been trying so hard to stay away from ramyun products to reduce my sodium and other toxic intakes. After many fruitless searches at nearby Asian markets to try a few packets, I ended up getting a case from Amazon after several months of hesitation; what can I say...I have to try all ramyun that I notice. Upon trying, I must say that I'm not disappointed at all and this is my new favorite ramen for the moment. The broth is thicker (from the beef bone extract powder) and has a bit of miso flavor very similar to the restaurant quality Japanese (non-instant) miso ramyun. It is definitely not as spicy as the regular Shin ramyun, but it has much more complex flavor and tastes more home-made with bigger chunks of mushrooms, hot peppers, etc. It is unbelievable that the product is MSG free with its play on all my taste buds, and I was very impressed that the product didn't make me feel as tired as most ramyun usually do after consumption. I'm very happy that I still have many packets left, and I'll savor them for all they're worth, which is actually much cheaper than comparable restaurant ramyun and home-made noodle soups.

review/summary: Taste is Great but...
review/text: I'm a noodle lover. Can't live without noodles at least once a day. I have more than a dozen different types of noodles stocked in my pantry & I love trying new ones too. I've a subscription to 30 packets of Nong Shim's Gourmet Spicy noodles & was expecting this to be much better. Really, the taste is great. Same type of noodles, texture, etc..same spicy flavor packet but there is another packet of soup seasoning included. There's no dried vegetables packet like the Gourmet Spicy flavor has. No dried vegetables flakes & no beef chunks like the description stated, thus false marketing. The price is too much for this. If this is the new & improved Gourmet Spicy noodles, I'd give it 4 stars. I took off 2 stars because of the unworthy price tag & another star because of the false marketing. I read a comment reply in another review here - A Korean reviewer... I agree entirely. Big hype & price tag but disappoints. I'll stick to the Gourmet Spicy if I were you. Worth the try but not 18 packets!<br /><br />Edit: Not false marketing since it seems like only the very first packet had no dried beef & vegetable so I changed the rating to a 3 star. However, the beef "chunks" are just flakes. Not enough flakes to notice. There are also dried mushrooms. Now, the mushroom pieces are bigger than the ones in the Spicy Gourmet vegetable sachet. Still, not impressed. 1/29/2012

review/text: I purchased several different Korean Noodle Soups but I prefer this "Black" bag version best. The product is a great soup with much flavor, some veggies, a nice spicy hot taste and lots of noodles. I modify the soup a little by adding some cut-up pieces of 3 or 4 green onions and some cut-up pieces of roasted chicken breast "after" making the soup to make it higher in protein. I usually have this and other Korean soups every day for a great "power lunch". Love this soup, fast and easy to make in a pot or by pre-heating the water in a microwave and then pouring it over the dry soup in a bowl.

review/text: Not enough pecan taste and a different kind of sweet than what you expect in a praline. The price was good but I didn't pay attention to the shipping. It was $10 so it almost doubled the price. Definitely not worth the price when you include the shipping.

review/summary: Smiles
review/text: This purchase brought many smiles for holiday gatherings;  not only is the cheese delicious but the lovely salt glaze crock which is reusable and dishwasher safe.  The crock can be filled with  any other cheese or veggie spreadable dips.  The only dissapontment is that this company encloses a small tag/card within the crock stating the "10 oz refill is available "  ( and this currently is NOT true as I contacted the company several times inquiring in regards to refill cheeses and there's no reply so you must keep buying more crocks.  Overall they ship fast & fresh and the crock is a keepsake item for hosting etc.

review/summary: CASE OF THE MISSING APRICOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: Received my 6 pack of "CERES 100% Apricot Juice" today and was shocked that it was "100% Ceres Fruit Juice Blend".  It was still warm but I could not wait to taste it, I absolutely love Apricot juice but, to my dismay this tasted like Pear juice. So I refrigerated it and when it cooled I tasted it again, again, Pear juice is all I could taste. I looked at the list of ingrediates to my surprise it read Pear juice first and Apricot puree next.  The puree I believe was supossedly for the color as it is not Apricot in color but very light orange. When ordered, it stated "100% Apricot juice", what I received was "100% Fruit Juice Blend" under that Apricot. To me this is very misleading as you can see by the picture it  states "100% Apricot Juice" and NOT "100% Fruit Juice Blend" which by the way tastes like "Pear juice".<br /><br />Save your money on this product and do more research first. Terrible, unless you like 'Pear Juice" which I do, but not when I expected "100% Apricot Juice".

review/summary: Better than CHEF RAVIOLI for sure!
review/text: I absolutely grew up on Chef Boyardee Ravioli. I have the clearest memories of sitting at granny's house, eating them for lunch, and just loving them. Well, I have kids now and have been giving them Chef Boyardee Ravioli for a while but every time I try them, they just are NOT as good. They are close, reminiscent enough, but just not like they used to be.  SOOooooOOo a few days ago I grabbed a can of Campbell's Raviolios as seen here, and dang!! I prefer them so much to the  Chef ones! Not only are they not so clumped together and they cooked up without falling apart, they really tasted a lot better. I ran out and got three more cans on  my next shopping trip!<br /><br />If you think Chef's lost his touch, give Campbelll's Raviolios a chance!<br /><br />Sheri Gill - writer

I can only find the small cans in my local market.<br /><br />This clam sauce is my favorite. It's so delicious on linguine or spaghetti. I always make a double batch of pasta so I can refrigerate the leftovers. The next day, the pasta and clam sauce is even tastier.<br /><br />I've tried all of the different brands of canned clam sauce and Progresso is the best.

review/text: Progresso White Clam Sauce is a staple in my pantry. Instead of the same old spaghetti and meat sauce try my easiest ever linguine and clam sauce. Empty one can of Progresso White Clam Sauce into a pot. Drain, then rinse, one can of baby clams SAVING the juices. Add the drained, rinsed clams to the pot containing the Progresso White Clam Sauce and heat on medium-low DO NOT BOIL for about 10 minutes until warmed through. Meanwhile cook your pasta noodles with one bottle of clam juice and the reserved clam juices added to the pasta water. Drain the cooked pasta into a big serving bowl, toss with olive oil and season with salt. Pour on the clam sauce, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and some chopped parsley. You will love this!

review/text: I bought this and the vegetarian bouillion, thinking that I was getting a mediocre price for 24 cubes of bouillon.  We use Maggi all the time, and wouldn't use any other brand.  Now, it looks as if we aren't going to have a choice, because this offer is for 24 BOXES of bouillion!  It's a fabulous price, but 24 boxes is one whole lot of bouillion.  Fortunately, it freezes (not strictly necessary due to the salt content), and our town's food pantry was thrilled to get such an uncommon donation.  One last thing, if you are going to make a donation to a food pantry, call ahead and ask what they would like. (besides boullion)  Ours is always looking for grape jelly, because so many people donate peanut butter.

review/summary: Teaposy
review/text: I had never seen a Teaposy tea blossom before so I really had no idea what to expect when I took it out of the package. It looked like a large, oddly shaped pellet of sorts that was rolled up tight with one end that was tightly tied with a strip of tea leaf. I placed it into the glass teapot (which was very pretty!) and poured in boiling water, as directed.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant about pouring boiling water into a glass vessel, especially one that looked as delicate as the Teaposy pot did. It held up quite nicely, however, and as mentioned on the company's website it is heat resistant.<br /><br />I did not notice an immediate change in the tea 'ball' and stepped out of the room for a moment to deal with a puppy who was terrorizing my house and when I returned a few minutes later a beautiful blossom was steeping in the tea pot!<br /><br />The only issue I had with the Teaposy pot was that I tried to take the lid off after steeping and the handle of the lid was rather hot. It is not necessary to take off the lid, I just wanted to stick my face in there and get a better view of the blossom! The handle to the pot itself stayed completely cool!<br /><br />I love that the blossoms are made from white tea which has very little caffeine and is very high in antioxidants. I am also thrilled that no artificial flavors are used in scenting the tea!<br /><br />If I could suggest one change to the company it would be to find a more ecologically friendly way to package their teas. Each one comes vacuum sealed in a plastic type envelope and I would love some kind of packaging that was biodegradable.<br /><br />Overall, I was thrilled with this product and highly recommend it for anyone who is a true fan of tea!<br /><br />Discaimer: I was provided with one Teaposy pot and a selection of teas in order to write my review. All opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone.

review/summary: Great tasting, portable, All Natural and I lost weight!
review/text: I have lots of reasons for trying True Lemon: number one is I didn't want to drink anything with chemicals in it.  True Lemon lets me enjoy my water, hot water or tea MUCH more without adding sugar or anything fake, and it tastes great. I drink so much more water now I have lost weight, probably eight pounds without doing anything else. (Always have TL and warm water before breakfast.)<br /><br />Second reason - I love to cook and don't always have fresh lemons around. I have made lemon poundcake, lemon biscotti and lemon tart and substituted TL in tons of recipes and no one knows the difference. Because it IS just real powered lemons.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V3SYCC">True Lemon Crystallized Fruit Wedge, 32 Pack</a><br /><br />Third reason: in the past I've had kidney stones and I need to keep my body acidic - adding Citrus does the trick and I have not had any further problems (the extra water TL lets me drink doesn't hurt either).  I have tried TL and True Lime, have not tried True Orange.  Also I read on their Facebook page they are adding TRUE PINK GRAPEFRUIT which will MAKE MY SUMMER!  I highly recommend this, as someone who cares about her health. My weight, health and skin is better! My store doesn't always have it but its easy to get online.

review/text: This is an easy way to add true citrus flavor to recipes and drinks with no calories and no need to store fresh fruit that invariably goes bad before use.  The frozen and bottled varieties don't retain that "fresh" flavor that I like so much, and so many of the powders are artificial or have lots of added sugar.  This is perfect for my needs.  I just wish they would offer it in jars instead of packets, so that I could do my own measuring and not have to tear open so many little packets.

review/summary: YUM!!!
review/text: After reading all the positive raves about these products, I decided to give them a try. Having fresh lemons and limes isn't always possible and these are excellent substitutes. I like them so much that I'll need to invest in the large shaker size for home use and save the packets for carrying in my purse. I've added these to water and various teas (both hot and cold) and for cooking. I really like the lemon sprinkled on fish. I haven't tried the grapefruit but I plan to buy some soon. I don't seem to tolerate acesulfame potassium and sucralose very well, so I've stayed away from the True Lemonade drinks.<br />The taste of the lemon, lime, and the orange are very subtle to whatever you add them to, they truly enhance everything. They don't overpower the taste like some flavorings do.<br /><br />What I found surprising is that one of the product claims on their website is that these are sugar free, yet "cane juice" is listed last in the ingredients on each packet. I guess that's what they mean by "no artificial sweetners".

review/text: I don't think anything can replace the flavor and smell of fresh citrus in your glass, however, True Lemon does a nice job on the first front when real fruit is too expensive and/or not available. I keep a couple of these packets in my gym bag to flavor my water a bit and at work when plain water just needs a bit of a kick.<br /><br />It's important to note that this is supposed to make your water have a taste that would be similar to a piece of lemon in your water -- it is not a powdered lemonade.  This company does make a powdered lemonade that is stronger in flavor than this particular product.<br /><br />Each 10 gram packet contains 25% of your vitamin C and only 5 calories.<br /><br />This product is manufactured in the United States.

review/text: Yes, I enjoy this product.  Have used all flavors and find its easy to carry a couple of packets in my purse so that I have some on hand.  Its a lot easier than trying to remember if I have a lemon on hand for water or not.  I didn't find it in the store until a month after I had received my shipment.  Plus I haven't seen it since.

review/text: I bought Real Lime & Real Lemon based on their claim that 1/4 tsp equals 1 Tbsp of juice. The actual package says 1/2 tsp. equals 1 Tbsp of juice. That's HALF the amount of juice as advertised. They need to change their advertising to match the actual product. Keep this in mind when you purchase - not such a bargain afterall.

review/summary: OK, but could be a lot better
review/text: I have tried the Jack Links Jerkey chew a few times, mainly as a way to have a little flavor in my mouth while working in hot/dusty conditions. This seems to be the only brand you can find stocked on convenience store shelves.<br /><br />In terms of the flavor, the "Original" is pretty mild. As noted by a previous reviewer, I also found the can didn't seem to have much in it. However, it only takes a small pinch at a time. For me, I thought it was a little too much on the dry/powdery side. Realistically, it's probably the "ground up" pieces that probably fall to the side when they are packaging their regular jerkey. It does highly resemble the "genuine" bacon bits that you buy at the grocery.<br /><br />For what it was, it was OK. I would like to see it a little more "shredded", so it packs better, and a little less ground up (like coffee grounds). I'd also like to see it a bit more moist, so it would pack better. As it stands, you have to be careful opening the can in a strong wind, or you might lose half of it. Finally, I think it would be interesting if they had a mildly nicotine-infused version, but that would restrict over-the-counter sales and bring on a whole new level of rules. Otherwise, I don't see where it would really help someone get over a dipping habit.<br /><br />One reviewer noted that this could easily be considered a "gateway" path for children to using real tobacco. To that, I would agree on some levels. Much like "Big League Chew" resembles a pouch of chewing tobacco, or "cancy cigarettes" resembles a real smoke. The important thing, if you are allowing your child to "eat" this, is that you convey the dangers of tobacco use and make clear that this is not the same thing. The packaging does not "make" the product something else.

Also, naturally, there is no nicotine so you won't get any of the stuff you are hooked on in the first place.  I don't know what else you'd use it for except as maybe a substitute for "bacon bits" on your salad or something as due to it's dryness it's tough to get out of the can.

review/summary: Not Sure the Point-Bad Packaging
review/text: CAREFUL!!  My nine year old stepson is around people that dip REAL tobacco in similar packaging.  Therefore, he idolizes this as a way to mock the older guys and their bad habit.  When he came for a visit he wanted some so we bought it.  Next thing we know, he was asking for a snack.  When we inquired about the jerky, he said it was not to eat but to "put in your mouth and suck the juice".  He even packed it like grown men do their tobacco chew.  Granted, a child will absorb what he sees around him but I feel the packaging makes it look too much like a child's version of adult chew; reminds me of the candy cigarettes. So, this product in my opinion is either for a child as a stepping stone to chewing tobacco or an adult's step down from it...otherwise, what's the point?

review/text: -- Taste without milk: 7/10 (kinda peanut buttery crunchy rounds)<br />-- Taste with milk: 1/10 (crunchy weird tasting things. BARELY hint of peanut butter)<br />-- Buy Again?: No<br /><br />-- Details:  We just got this at Vons last week because it was on sale for 2bucks, and I was having a peanut butter cereal craving and as usual, Reese's Puffs was absurdly priced (well, all cereals at vons usually are unless on sale :).  So we got it thinking it'd be *somewhat* similar.  Well it wasn't.  My hubby complained so much that it tasted weird and he just didn't like it (at first he thought the milk was rotten, and replaced that...but it wasn't a milk problem).  Then I had it, and thought, well, it was edible but just not great.<br /><br />I don't know how to describe the weirdness (it's not rotten or anything)...perhaps "PLAIN Cap'n Crunch cereal, with a Teensy bit of peanut butter just tossed in without reworking the whole package to make sure it works" ? And maybe the two just don't go together that easily? i.e. if they toss in peanut butter, they'll need to modify the base at least somewhat to make things taste ok at the end?  Or maybe all the peanut butter gets washed away when milk is added?  Regardless of the reason, the cereal just didn't work.  Unless of course you have different expectations, and DON'T expect it to be SOMEWHAT like Reese's Puffs :) And don't really care much about peanut butter anyway, plus have different taste buds than us (or just careless ones), then the cereal may be fantabulous for you! Who knows :)

review/summary: OUTSTANDING! A must have for raman or noodle fan!
review/text: I get these at Walmart (in the Asian food section) for .49 cents each. I absolutely LOAD UP on them. They are like any other raman noodle in that you boil water, add raman and cook for a min or two until your degree of doneness. Then you drain as much water as you prefer, which I personally drain most of it. I leave just enough to still have `soup' water after the noodles soak/cool. Every package also comes with three additions. One is a packet of paste, much like curry pastes if you use them. You have to cut an end off and really squish and squeeze the paste into your bowl of cooked noodles. Then the other packet has two sides. One is full of tasty spices and herbs. I use both of these packets and my noodles are plenty spicy. There is also a side packet of Chili powder if you like your food really hot. I have learned to leave this packet out because I enjoy the slightly spiciness (a slow warming of body temp, not a burning in your mouth) rather than full-blown heat. You can try it either way!<br /><br />The image on the front does have shrimp on it. Well, these have zero flavor of shrimp. It's more of a spicy heat and kind of fruity notes, and of course raman...quality raman by the way.<br /><br />I would give these a dozen stars.  A quick, easy meal with two packets or a snack with one. Loads of flavor, of course it's high in sodium. You could make the soup then drain all of the broth to get rid of some sodium.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />Sheri Gill

review/summary: My favorite instant noodles brand & flavor for over 20 years
review/text: When I run out of these, I don't buy whatever more conveniently available brand happens to be a 5-minute drive away.  No other instant noodles product compares to this, & I'll wait however long it takes to stock up again with this specific product, & regardless of how relatively inconvenient the access is for me to obtain this from the vendor who has stocked this product for the entire time I've been purchasing it, & enjoying it.<br /><br />With that being said, I have a definite affinity for the Pork flavor of this product, as well -- but when I stock up, I purchase both, & it doesn't end up being a 50-50 split.<br /><br />The taste of this product is unique, & the 'spice factor' is such that there is definitely a 'kick' (when I was a kid, I used to wonder how a close relative of mine could 'stand' spicy foods, especially when it made him sweat & sniffle -- well, now I 'get' it ;) ).<br /><br />It's worth noting that if one wishes to manipulate the spice intensity, making a more dilute soup will result in relatively less 'kick' -- however, one can pretty much count on experiencing 'something', spice-wise, with this, even if only in a ~cumulative sense (for me, as I work my way through a serving of this, there is less & less time between any given spoonful's ingestion & its spice-based 'impact' -- & I don't make it through an entire serving without having my nose start to run [a consequence/'side effect' I am willing to endure, given that it 'goes with the territory' of doing a tango with the spices that contribute to this flavor's amazing taste]).<br /><br />In addition to the taste of this being so interesting (& practically crave-inducing at times, if I haven't eaten it in a while), it makes for one of the only liquid-based anything -type of food item for which I ever use cauliflower -- the cauliflower ends up being infused with the spice-&-flavored liquid base, which results in it not only 'looking pretty', but also having a taste that meshes well with its having-been-cooked-with-the-noodles softened texture (I made this [& simply called it 'Thai noodles with cauliflower'] for a few relatives, who were hesitant when it came to instant noodles, but they loved it, & they loved how flavorful the cauliflower was).<br /><br />For years, the Mama brand of noodles, & the wonderful spice packets associated with the Tom Yum & Pork flavors, have provided me with the 'base' for a filling meal that includes a decent amount of specific vegetables being placed in with the noodles while they cook (often, I'll make 2 noodle packets at a time) -- & importantly, on many such occasions, involves vegetables that I simply do not make or eat at any other time (such as baby kohlrabi) -- the flavor of the Tom Yum & Pork varieties ends up making such meals a kind of 'vegetable & noodle party in a bowl', & infuses certain vegetables with the relevant Mama flavor in a way that ought to have both of the individual 'participants' high-fiving one another (that is, if vegetables & noodles could high-five anything :) ).<br /><br />I don't have a wide range of vegetables that I 'go to' for inclusion with the Mama Tom Yum & Pork flavor instant noodles -- it's basically restricted to the following (with one of more added on any given Mama-noodles-as-a-meal occasion) -- sliced baby carrots (the most frequent vegetable 'guest' [I usually halve or quarter the baby carrots (a size/thickness that allows for their cooking sufficiently during the relevant timeframe [I tend to place the carrots in first, to cook in the liquid until the water comes to a boil (the carrots then finish cooking during the brief time associated with the noodles cooking)])])... thin slices of celery (another vegetable that can readily absorb the Mama flavoring liquid base)... pieces of torn lettuce (not something I would have thought of on my own -- a Thai friend included lettuce when preparing some Mama noodles years ago, & I've done so on many occasions since -- the lettuce absorbs the flavor, & adds an interesting texture to each biteful of noodles [it's also an easy way to take in a 'small salad', so to speak (honestly, overall, this is one of my favorite ways to ingest vegetables -- via 'Mama transport' :) )])... Chinese Napa cabbage (this is stiffer than lettuce, has a pretty look to it, & is also something which I only eat when cooked with Mama noodles)... cauliflower (with Tom Yum flavor only, & cauliflower being cooked in the water before ultimately adding the noodles)... baby kohlrabi (sliced & then at times cut further / the dark green of this vegetable [as well as the light green of Napa cabbage], when combined with the orange of the sliced baby carrots, ends up making for a very colorful, & 'pretty' dish)... frozen sweet peas (added to the water before bringing it to a boil / is also a colorful component, & makes for a 'pretty' look to the resulting meal)... & at times, I've added uncooked spinach leaves (to the water before adding the noodles / this is also an easy way to take in a decent amount of spinach).<br /><br />The Mama Tom Yum spices can have your tongue begging for mercy at times, & have your sinuses thinking they've just had a sauna installed, but all in all, 'it's all good'... :)<br /><br />I love the Mama Tom Yum noodles, have been eating them for over 20 years now, & can honestly say I've never tasted anything like it.  The flavor is fantastic, interesting, & as I've found, if you go long enough without eating it, you'll end up missing it, & find yourself on the mop-side of the Swiffer commercials, with 'Baby Come Back' being played as the theme song... :)

Just before serving stir in some finely sliced fresh basil and garnish with sliced scallions or chives.

review/summary: awesome!
review/text: These noodles are by far the tastiest tomyum noodles ive tried. Theyre a bit spicy if you add all the chili powder but they taste fabulous.<br /><br />I'd go for a 60 pack if it were an option...

review/summary: Disappointing...
review/text: Contents consist of 3 flavor packets and somewhat stingy serving of ramen noodles. Flavor of broth dominated by taste of stale, fermented shrimp paste and an outrageous amount of salt; kinda boring otherwise. (29 packets to go, sigh...)

review/summary: Just Like Back in Thailand
review/text: I first had these while I was living in Thailand for 6 months. These are just like the ones I would get from the stores in Asia. I used to eat these almost everyday!! I would have to say the creamy shrimp tom yum is spicier than the regular tom yum, but I absolutely love both. I happened to find them in the Walmart in St. Louis where I go to school but they do not have them at the Walmart in New Jersey, where I live. So I'm glad I found them on here for when I go home on school breaks. I can't wait to have them again, I'm craving them soo bad.

review/summary: Love product - HATE MSG
review/text: This product is sooo tasty... but I was really sad to see that it has MSG in it.  While some would argue that this salt is harmless, there is plenty of evidence to point to harmful effects on the human body.  Particularly in being a catalyst for migraines and other headaches.  But so far as the taste... this product is a spicy wonderful soup that I crave frequently!
