review/summary: THE ONLY THING MY 3-YEAR-OLD WILL EAT FOR BREAKFAST!
review/text: Yes, these Toaster Pastries from Nature's Path are the only thing my 3-year-old will eat for her breakfast.  Thanksfully, they are fairly healthy.  Now her 2 older brothers are making it a staple for their breakfast also.  They are very tasty and toast well in the toaster.  The frosted strawberry and blueberry ones are equally as good - just depends on your taste preference.  We have not tried any of the UNfrosted ones though!

review/summary: Great "on the go" healthy snack....
review/text: Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box.

review/summary: Natural and Delicious
review/text: The grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly I've become weary reading labels. I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste "slightly" healthy, but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole-wheat flour.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice, organic apple juice concentrate, water, organic evaporated apples, vegetable glycerin, organic apple powder, organic corn startch, organic cinnamon, locust bean gum), organic whole-wheat flour, organic white flour, water, organic evaporated cane juice, organic palm oil, powdered organic eveaporated cane juice, organic invert syrup, salt, leavening, natural flavor, agar, tocopherols (for freshness).<br /><br />Unfortunately these do contain palm oil, although I don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. Makes me wonder what I'm really allergic to, as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic Palm Kernel Oil. Could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version. Could be.<br /><br />Each pastry is 190 Calories<br /><br />40 Calories from Fat<br /><br />They heat up fast in the toaster and are convenient for a snack.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: BEST TOASTER PASTRY
review/text: These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure.

review/text: Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!

review/summary: Great alternative to "PopTarts", but add more filling!
review/text: These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!

review/summary: A Sinful Treat... With A Little Less Sin
review/text: Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!

review/summary: Not health food, but far, far better than Pop-Tarts
review/text: Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet.

The pomegranite has just enough tartness to wake up your taste buds in the morning, and the breading is light and flaky.

review/summary: A healthier version of the popular breakfast pastry...
review/text: We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it.

review/summary: Tastes great, still like nearly candy but at least natural
review/text: I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of "food," is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more.

review/text: First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a "healthy" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation.

Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial "icks". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D

review/summary: Not the quantity I expected and expires soon
review/text: The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly.

review/summary: Incredibly Good; Puts Pop-Tarts to Shame
review/text: I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the "original"?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with "natural" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)

review/text: Once I stopped shopping in the regular grocery store, because I don't want to eat their chemical-laden crap, I had to find different things to give the kids for breakfast.  You can only eat so much cereal!  My kids had been big Pop Tart fans for years, so I wasn't sure if these would fly or not.  But, they loved them and never said a word about them being any different than the name brand.  They seemed happy and I was too knowing that there are no chemicals or high fructose corn syrup in them.<br /><br />They seemed to prefer the iced raspberry flavor.  Give them a try.  The price on Amazon is sooo much better than the natural markets.

review/text: For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad.  But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many.  I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic.

review/summary: Pop Tarts - Eat your heart out!!!
review/text: I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or "pomegran" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!

I include them in my daughter's lunch and also have them for snacks.  They are 210 calories apiece, which is a bit much for a snack, but you can always cut them in half.  A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up.

The flavor is a bit light. Not as much clove as I would like.

review/summary: Blue Diamond Brand tastes much better
review/text: I received the Blue Diamond brand version of these nuts as a gift and had to go find more because they were so delicious.  I found this brand at Target instead so I decided to try them out.  I was quite disappointed.  The Emerald brand nuts are sweetened with sucralose and have a funny fake sweetener taste that is unpleasant.  The Blue Diamond Almonds are sweetened with Stevia so they taste more natural and also have a richer chocolate flavor. I would not recommend the Emerald brand of this product.

review/summary: Handy, Healthy and Kinda Tasty When I Need A Quick Snack
review/text: I keep a container of these in the house at all times; first, because they are a convenient, healthy treat, and second, because they do have a slightly chocolate flavor. I do wish these had a richer, darker chocolate flavor, (I'm a fiend for dark chocolate) but the hint of chocolate is nice, especially without adding a bunch of additional calories. I like knowing that eating a few of these a day for a snack (about 1 oz) is giving me 6 grams of protein, 0mg of cholesterol, as well as only 1 g of sugars. (Please see my photo for more Nutrtition Facts information).<br /><br />Although this is a healthy treat, there are 150 calories per 1 ounce serving, so it's important to keep that in mind when eating these if you are keeping up with your caloric intake. I will often put some of these almonds in a small container if we are going to be out and about, so I can have a healthy snack with me when I start getting hungry.<br /><br />Because I'm usually the only one in my family that enjoys these (the rest of my family could take them or leave them)- one container lasts me at least a month, sometimes longer. I like these and plan on continuing to purchase them until they stop making them!

review/text: Someone offered these to me and I almost declined because I thought they were candy, but it's like eating regular almonds with a subtle dark chocolate flavor. I don't know how the cocoa is applied so finely as there is no mess and nothing comes off on your fingers. The flavor isn't bitter like some dark chocolates and the kids like them. And it seems the cocoa adds little to no additional calories compared to plain almonds. I first found these at Sam's club, but then couldn't find them so now I order several at a time from Amazon.

review/summary: tastes decent but why put artificial sugar in nuts?
review/text: These nuts taste alright. My main problem with it is that the fancy packaging makes no mention that it contains sucralose (aka Splenda - just google what artificial sugars do to your body) and modified food starch (contains glutamate/glutamatic acid like MSG). These junk ingredients do not make the nuts taste awesome enough to put this garbage into your body. You might as well just eat sugar free candy. It tastes a lot better.<br /><br />Emerald needs to realize that people eat nuts for a healthier diet; they don't want to eat the same artificial junk that you can find in a candy bar. Emerald is the only brand of nuts that has this garbage. All the other brands have more natural ingredients. Stay away from the Emerald brand.

review/text: I bought these elsewhere in the single-serving packs. They don't taste bad, and I feel good about eating them as opposed to other snacks. But when you crave a snack, you often crave either a sweet or salty snack, or a combo of both (like a chocolate covered pretzel.)  These aren't sweet OR salty, so they don't really satisfy my sweet or my salty tooth.

review/summary: AMAZING Results!
review/text: This is hands down the best dog food out there. I adopted an adult Samoyed that had been tied to a tree for the summer, which resulted in him having heartworm, a damaged coat, flaky skin, and he was extremely underweight. After his heartworm treatment, he came home with me and I started him on Orijen (originally started him on the fish flavor because it was a little easier on his weakened immune system). Literally within DAYS his coat began to shine, he started to gain muscle mass, and his energy level went up SIGNIFICANTLY. After I went through the first bag of the fish flavor I switched to the Regional Red (it smells much better than the fish!) It's been almost 4 months since he came home with me and people stop me on the street to tell me how "healthy" he looks.<br /><br />Because the quality of the food, you won't have to feed your dog as much (my now 55 pound samoyed gets about 1-1.5 cups twice a day depending on if I throw some fresh veggies in his bowl) so it doesn't end up costing as much in the long run. Since there are no fillers, they don't need to eat as much of the food to get the proper nutrition. My dog will gobble it up at first and then sometimes stop when he's almost done eating. My friend's Miniature Pincher does the same thing - it seems to actually make them FULL.<br /><br />I honestly don't have one bad thing to say about this product - definitely at least try it if you're considering it. It's well worth the money!

review/text: After Solid Gold changed their formula and compromised the product, I switched my dog to Orijen. This is the best food on the market right now in my oppinion. My dog loves it. Champion foods doesn't outsource their product which gives me peace of mind that my dog is actually eating what the label says is in the bag. The food is expensive, but the food is worth the cost. I suggest putting your dog on the Orijen rotational diet. Buy Orijen.

review/summary: Both dogs love this food!
review/text: I can't say anything negative about this brand of food! My dogs absolutely love it!  How do I know my dogs love it? Well in our house we don't hide the dog food, and it sits in plain sight to our dogs, in they past they have never touched the food that was not specifically put in in their plates but when we bought this food our little guy started trying to sneak some extra food.  He is usually picky and holds off on his food until he knows he isn't getting something from the kitchen but not with this food, he actually eats it on his own and before dinner!  We have a 2 year old Lhasa Apso and an 11 year old Great dane/lab/pit mix and both of them love it and neither has had any kind of negative reaction (our older dog has a sensitive stomach too).  This is twice the price of our last dog food but I think its worth it to not feed our dogs additives and fillers they do not need.  Highly recommend this food brand.

Is he is giving me his leftovers again?  Not sure why he thinks I should be happy with that.  I walk over and smell it.  Wow!  Its that scent again!  I love it!  He didn't just leave me the dry, sandy chunks, but rather a flavorful collection of tasty morsels.  I look at him before I dig in...he's looking back as if wondering if he can have some.  I dig in and before I know it I finished it all.  I want some more.<br /><br />Before I fall asleep that night I wonder why my person gave me the best parts and dream of the man in the big brown metallic moving box hunting for us.
