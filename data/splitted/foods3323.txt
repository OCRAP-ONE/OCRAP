review/summary: ohhhh...  world's BEST mustard!!!
review/text: ohhhh... this stuff is WONDEFUL!!!  Nothing else is quite like it.  The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you're eating.  Best mustard to go with prime beef.  Best mustard for sandwiches with lean meats, lettuce and fresh sprouts.  Best mustard with crackers and gourmet cheese (or, hey, just with crackers!).  A little goes a long way, and you feel coddled whenever you have some.<br /><br />We used to live near a gourmet food store where we could buy this whenever we ran out.  We got spoiled, and now it's VERY hard to find.  So great to see it on Amazon -- wow!!!!

review/summary: What Mustard is SUPPOSED to taste like
review/text: Absolutely delicious on a simple grilled sausage; critical in certain recipes.  This product bears no resemblance to the overprocessed, over-colored, over-sugared GLOP that passes for mustard in this country; the mustard seeds are whole and fill your mouth with flavor. Subtly different from Dijon mustard, which is made with white wine, Moutarde Meaux is made with vinegar and the added tang is just sublime...  No pantry should be without it, and you will never, ever go back to the yellow stuff.

review/summary: Perfect mustard
review/text: I love this mustard! It has a tangy flavor that enhances every food it is paired with. The appearance is unlike traditional yellow mustard, this mustard looks like tiny seeds with a small amount of clear liquid. The result is perfection - smooth with a bold flavor that is something like a "wasabi mustard." The thing is, it is REAL mustard, not a modern interpretation. I learned about this product at Costco one day on a sample table, and with Amazon's help I hope to always have this in my kitchen!

review/summary: Great in chicken piccata and other recipes
review/text: I don't use capers a lot, but when I do, this is the product that I normally use. One of my favorite chicken dishes is chicken piccata. I make it every month or two.<br /><br />With chicken piccata, you have basic ingredients to coat (flour, salt, and pepper) chicken breasts. You fry the breasts in olive oil. Then, remove chicken, add some lemon juice, chicken stock, and capers to the pan drippings, bringing to a boil. Return chicken to the pan and simmer. Remove chicken to the serving plate and pour the sauce over the top. Yummy. And the capers add a really nice touch (by the way, sometimes I add a bit of white wine to the lemon juice, capers, and stock).<br /><br />Anyhow, awfully tasty. The capers add a necessary touch to the entire process. I'm sure that one can easily replace this brand with another and have an equally successful dish. But this is what I use and I'm satisfied.

The only "bad" thing I can say about it is that it can be a little addictive :)<br /><br />Follow up: We usually like to use cream in our coffee as a treat on the weekends (half-nhalf - what's that??).  The other day we were out so I used the Santini condensed milk instead.  All I can say is, wow!  Actually enjoyed it more than cream - and then I compared the labels.  The condensed milk has considerably less saturated fat and cholesterol than cream.  We're never going back!

review/summary: okay product, not good packaging all dented
review/text: I bought this to make vietnamese coffee. It taste okay, I love that it's organic, but thats as far as it goes. Frankly, the only reason this item deserves 3 stars is because it's certified organic and taste like it should. The packaging is plain horrible.<br /><br />I bought a $10 can opener JUST for this item. The can opener is great, one of those swing-away or something openers that old-school people from the war eras swear by. My mom had a can opener 15 years ago and I vaguely recall using it in highschool when I still lived at home. I've managed to live for the past 10 years without one and I eat my fair share of canned goods. Even my cat's food doesn't need an opener and he gets 2 cans a day.<br /><br />Anyhow, 5 of these 6 cans were dented, but I checked and it seems edible/safe from botulism. None of the dents look like it was actually punctured. Still, the dents near the top made it impossible to open the can. So messy and sticky. Storing this thing is also a pain in the arse. Unless you plan to bake 5 pies and use the whole thing, the packaging is just plain horrible. It looks like it belongs in the 50s and is so outdated. It's not like it's a quarter or something extremely cheap, I don't understand why they can't update the packaging to make it more user friendly. Will buy a squeeze bottle next time. Actually I wanted to buy the squeeze bottle in the first place but the organicness made me think it was worth an entire extra $10 can opener purchase.<br /><br />If you want to use this for just coffee like me, stay away and get the squeeze bottle. If you are planning to bake 5 pies in one day, then awesome product for you (but they should then advertise it for only that use and I would have never made this purchase).

review/summary: Oh By Far The Best - Really Astonishing Difference
review/text: I've had a lot of sweetened condensed milk over the years, predominantly in Vietnamese style iced coffees.  It's the kind of product that I never gave any thought to - I figured they all tasted about the same, blaa blaa blaa.<br /><br />I ordered this particular one because I'd never seen sweetened condensed milk offered in the organic format, because organic milk tends to taste better.<br /><br />I couldn't believe it when I first used this.  It is way, WAY better than any other sweetened condensed milk I've ever tried.  It is thick and rich, but not gloopy or glue-like.  It has more of a syrupy or honey-like flow, and even the color is more appealing - sort of a golden cream tone.  There is no hint of can/tinny flavor, and the milk tastes very fresh and natural, even with the sweetness.  To me, it seems that this is a little less sweet than some others I've tried; but I'm sure it's still certainly sweet enough for whatever baking etc. you'd want to do with it.  It makes awesome iced coffees, I would never use anything else now.

Thus far, my favorites are Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee; Timothy's German Chocolate Cake; Van Houtte's Chocolate Raspberry Truffle and Spicy Mayan Chocolate.  The last one was my No. 1 favorite, so I was heartbroken to learn that it has been discontinued. I am currently rationing each precious K-Cup from my very last box of 24.<br /><br />Two days ago, I saw and purchased my first box of Folger's Vanilla Biscotti,  (Who knew that Folger's made K-cups?)  It's too soon to know for certain, but there is a good chance this flavor will make my list of favorites.  The good news is that Target sells it and other 18 count boxes of Folger K-Cups for $10.85.  That means you can buy 36 for $21.70.  Compare that to the greedy sellers on this page who get $48.46 and $43.04 (with shipping) respectively.

review/summary: Average columbian coffee, good but not great
review/text: Had hoped for a really good cup of columbian coffee, and columbian (preferably supremo) is among my very favorites. As I drink 8 cups a day, I've tasted lots of coffees and lots of beans from around the world.  While this is a decent coffee, probably 4 stars when compared to other non columbian coffees, it is not among the better columbian coffees. My guess is that they use a higer percentage of just average columbian beans, and not many supremo beans. The roast is medium, but it is a little more bitter than you might expect for columbian.  I would recommend millstone columbian supremo if you want a good cup of columbian coffee. Supremo is the grade of bean, so if you don't see that you know you are getting a cheaper bean.

review/summary: I have 6 favorites, this is one of them
review/text: This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.<br /><br />Regarding coffee, I like strong and smooth.  I don't like French roast as I find it too harsh, but I do like Italian roast.  Kona is great and I like Hazelnut, Vanilla and Chocolate flavors.<br />I drink my coffee with probably too much (at least 2-3 creamer containers worth to a 12 oz cup coffee) of evaporated milk in it or plain non-dairy creamer. No sugar.<br /><br />That being said...my favorite coffees are:<br /><br />Green Mountain Hazelnut Dark Roast Extra Bold<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee<br />Newman's Own Extra Bold<br />Tully's Coffee Kona Blend Extra Bold<br />Folger's Gourmet Vanilla Biscotti<br /><br />and a special mention for<br />Timothy's World Coffee German Chocolate Cake - It has an almost coco-nutty taste to it. Not the deep chocolate taste I was looking for, but the best I have found so far. Please if you can suggest a Dark Chocolate Flavor coffee to me; do so.<br /><br />Also since I have posted a review about a Senseo coffee and now clearly have switched to Keurig a bit about why... if you're interested..which why I put it last.  Feel free to ignore it.<br /><br />We decided to get a Keurig coffee maker after enjoying the Senseo system for over 3 years.<br />Please note, since we got the Senseo system essentially free, not much thought was put into it's purchase. However it did introduce us to single serving coffee systems.<br /><br />We switched to the Keurig system from the Senseo for several reasons.<br /><br />1. Local availability of coffee. For some reason the Senseo system was waning here at the Rochester NY grocery stores and what good is a coffee maker without coffee?  Yes, you can buy online, but sometimes when your planning isn't the best, you might run out. What coffee they did carry was limited and not our preferences.<br /><br />2. Online purchases of Senseo coffees  were either for 4 bags of 16-18 of one variety or 4 bags of a mix of coffees. Invariably there was a few you didn't like.  I never saw small quantities of 5 or so.<br /><br />3. The Senseo "duck" for filling  with your own coffee never worked for us.  I'm an engineer and my boyfriend is an inspector. We literally did controlled experiments to get this to work and never could. Maybe we had a faulty unit, but based on reviews here, we were in good company. I knew many that had luck with the Keurig system however and we did as well.<br /><br />4. Once you open a bag of Senseo pods, they are starting to go stale, by virtue of being open to air. The Keurig system's coffees remain sealed and you can have many flavors "open" at once. Yes for those of you that are "green" there is more plastic waste. However I'm being selfish here and am being more concerned with the green in my pocket and fresh coffee.

review/text: With all the fancy coffee names out there, leave it to one of the old originals to come up with a great k-cup coffee.  I remember when I was a kid at my grand parents watching them drink Folgers coffee.  It was the only kind they would drink.  The old red can.  When I saw this k-cup with the Folgers name on it, I bought it out of nostalgia, as much as anything.  After receiveing it, we loved it, too.  It has a very mild taste and flavor.  Not quite as much "vanilla" as some of the other vanilla flavored coffees out there, but just the right amount.  To re-use an old phrase, it is "good, to the last drop"!

review/text: Folgers Gourmet Selections, Lively Colombian Decaf, is good-tasting coffee, as far as decaffeinated coffee is concerned.  I find it is the perfect strength for me. It is between mild and strong. However, the boxes I received from Amazon expired in about a month.  Those I received from Keurig had 6 months expiration, so were a lot fresher.  For the price paid on Amazon, I feel the product should have had a later expiration date.

A few years ago I did try using folgers ground coffee in one of those <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a> and it just did not come out right. I have had no luck with the refillable K-Cup with any brand of coffee. I honestly believe that a lot of product testing goes into these K-cups. It's not as simple as fill it up and run water through it.<br /><br />Folgers Columbian  K-cups taste exactly like I made it way back when with my Mr. Coffee. Becuse you are able to adjust the amount of coffee used in the Drip brewers this may or may not be as perfect of a match for your tastes. The one constant is the all important aftertaste. The Extra-Bold Newman's own and Doughnut Shop K-cups have a long, strong aftertaste that I really enjoy but they give you strong coffee breath. By comparison This Folgers has less of a aftertaste which Is nice when you know you will be in conversation with someone.<br /><br />There are many Columbian coffee K-cup choices and in reality they are all good. If you loved Folgers in the past. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Update 8-7-2011<br />I have been drinking this now for well over 3 weeks now and I have to say it is now my new fav everyday coffee. Our 2 mainstays used to be Doughnut Shop by Coffee People <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> and Breakfast Blend by Green Mountain <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> Folgers has replaced Breakfast Blend which is the milder of the 2.  Sooo Good!

review/summary: Tales of a Coffee Snob
review/text: I'm what I refer to as a "middle-level" coffee snob; that is, I don't need a Barista to enjoy a good cup of coffee but I don't drink the plebeian brands (Maxwell House, Folgers, et al), either.  We were in Vermont for the weekend when the hostess of the B&B in which we were staying served a delicious coffee at breakfast.  Inquiring as to the brand, she told us it was Folgers Black Silk.  I couldn't believe that Folgers made such a rich, robust, yet smooth coffee.  As soon as we got home, I went out and bought a can of Black Silk, as well as ordered a box of K-cups from Amazon.  It's every bit as good at home as it was in Vermont.  The object lesson here: "Don't be such a snob; try new brands and varieties...some of them might pleasantly surprise you!"

review/summary: Meh
review/text: This review pertains to the Black Silk only. If you are thinking of skimping on your next K-Cup purchase, read this.<br /><br />No surprise, but you get what you pay for. While many of the other brands of K-Cups say "100% Arabica Coffee" on the side of the package, these merely say, "100% Coffee" - so you know there's gotta be some Robusta in there somewhere. I'd say the flavor is OK if you enjoy the free coffee at your local car dealership while waiting for a repair. Maybe even a step up to "diner coffee." Not terrible, but definitely leaves a burned aftertaste in your mouth. These were OK to try, but I would spend the extra pennies for better quality K-Cups in the future.

I'd recently bought some K-cups at the grocery store that tasted too weak and didn't have a great aroma, but the Black Silk is pretty good.  Yes, it's expensive, but so are all K-cups.  I'll definitely buy this product again.

review/text: For Folgers and this being a K-cup, it's not that bad for instant brew. But if you are looking for a bold cup of Vanilla coffee, this ain't it. It's mild in the coffee area and the flavor is like a mix of vanilla and butter toffee. While the taste is off a bit in the Vanilla area, it at least does not have that chemical taste of other vanilla k-cups I've tried.

A single pack of sweetener and I'm off to work.  I purchased 3 of these 36 count packs because it was cheaper than picking them up from Walmart ($10.87 + tax for 18 count)

If you can get the GM or CP brands for about the same price, you'd be crazy to buy these.

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty coffee at a nice price
review/text: Let's face it - "Folgers" isn't a name that usually springs to mind when you think of great coffee, but this isn't bad.  Nice aroma, a balanced blend that's not too strong, but still provides plenty of flavor.  Give it a try if you're tired of overpriced K-Cups that cost almost what a coffee shop would charge.  Mrs. Olsen would approve.<br /><br />UPDATE: my review was based on a purchase price that figured out to 46.5 cents per cup.  They were worth trying at that price.  The current price of 65 cents a cup puts them in the same price-range as gourmet brands like Green Mountain or Coffee People, and they're not even close to the same quality as those brands.  If you can find them for under fifty cents a cup, they're worth trying.  Otherwise, don't waste your money.

review/text: I am usually a coffee snob. I refused for the longest time to try Folger's k-cups. I thought the prices should never be equal to the gourmet brands. WRONG!! This Vanilla Biscotti is outstanding. Smooth, and delicious.  I love the new Starbucks k-cups,but trust me, Folgers is right up there with the best of them!

review/text: The Folgers Decaf was surprisingly very good!  I normally like a dark robust cup of coffee and have been unable to find a decaf that didn't have an aftertaste or was too bitter.  While this isn't a dark roast, it was still very very good.

review/text: All in all, this Folgers Lively Colombian coffee is a decent medium blend coffee.  It has a slight bite, but is highly drinkable and has no discernible aftertaste.<br /><br />For medium blend drinkers, if the price is right, it is a k-cup worth trying.

review/summary: Nice option, especially when you need to surve a variety of tastes in a hurry
review/text: My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Folgers Kcups - Messed up packaging
review/text: I got my most recent 3 pack product in April and two of the three boxes had kcups that had expanded - I mean that the bottom was round and puffed out.  When put in the Keurig, a couple of them popped at the top and spritzed/leaked coffee out of the keurig and onto my counter.  The others crumpled when used.  We pay a lot of money for kcups and I encourage you to check all three boxes when you get them to make sure they are normal.  I am wondering what kind of extremes the packages are subjected to in storage and/or transit.  One of the three boxes had all kcups as they should be (sealed tight, flat bottoms).  When I reorder, I will check each box and return any with the defective packaging.<br /><br />Folgers Black Silk Kcup coffee is smooth, flavorful and doesn't get buried when you add milk (latte) or cream.  Delicious!

review/text: It's mediocre. But it's not as smooth as other Folgers varieties. we like a mild to medium roast and that's what this is, for sure. But there's a touch of harshness that makes it less than desireable. But with coffee, opinions vary wildly! Give it a try. My wife and I wish Folgers would make the "Smooth as Silk" in a k-cup. (Not the black silk). It's available in cans and is soooooo good.

review/text: This is a very good coffee for everyday enjoyment. I occasionally enjoy a more bold coffee for that strong jolt in the morning or do get rid of the "3 o'clock 'blahs".  If you exclusively like bold coffees, you may want to look for other options.  However, this is a good medium blend coffee and is a pretty decent price (beats any coffee chain).  I still prefer the Vanilla Biscotti from Folgers to this one, but I know not everybody enjoys flavored coffee.

review/summary: Odd Flavor
review/text: There are plenty of tasty flavored K-cups out there.  Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The base notes of the coffee itself are fine, but the flavoring has a very odd taste to it- sort of plasticky.  It doesn't taste like other vanilla or dessert-flavored coffees I've had before, and I'm a fan of most flavored coffee.  I'll try the other Folgers flavors to see if they are better, but in the future I will be giving this one a miss.

review/text: I run trail races, and have been using the Honey Stinger gels for energy for those events.  This year I've done my first ultramarathons, and figured that the bars would be a nice bit of variety for the middle of the runs.  The Honey Stinger energy bars are a great solid food option; they're perfectly balanced with sweetness and texture, they sit well in my stomach and kept that uncomfortable empty-belly feeling at bay.  When you're sick of sucking down gels and you've got another hour or more before the next aid station, this can't be beat.

review/summary: Cupcake Bites
review/text: I bought these in-store so I can't say anything about shipping/etc. But I can vouch for taste. It tastes exactly like a frosted white cupcake, which, frosted white cupcakes are a bit much for me (I like minimal-to-none frosting on mine) so I can't eat too many of these [bites] at once. Not more than 5-6. They're very sugary. But, again, I rarely eat sugar, or even drink sugar (like soda), so if you consume it on a regular basis or frequently, these will just be normal(ly sweet) for you. They're very good & I recommend you at least try them.<br /><br />However, I have just found out they also have red velvet cupcake bites, so I kinda wish I had bought them (red velvet being my favorite cake, followed by chocolate absolutely with no frosting) instead of these, but, the store didn't have 'em & these are good too, I guess. :)

review/summary: Nice Snack Treat!
review/text: In June, my co-workers hosted a cupcake-themed birthday party for me. A co-worker who baked more than 50 cupcakes for my birthday party also gave me and every co-worker a box of Cupcake Bites. My boss ended up eating the whole box within a few hours. I've honestly haven't eaten much candy or cookies since June 2009 because of two traumas in 2009 that made my TMJ worse. So, I wouldn't know about the latest trends in candy or cookies. I mostly focus on drinks, cupcakes, jams/jellies/preserves, and soft foods (as you can tell by my Amazon reviews) because that's what people with TMJ and jaw problems can consume. Anyways, the Cupcake Bites are out-of-this-world delicious. Cupcake Bites are, I believe, one of the newest products from the makers of Cookie Dough Bites. I think Cupcake Bites were promoted around April 2011. Cupcake Bites are bite-sized cupcake morsels coated with sprinkles and white frosting. They're really soft and dissolve in your mouth - great for people with TMJ and jaw problems. They're from the makers of Cookie Dough Bites. Before 2009, when my jaw was in better shape, I used to like Cookie Dough Bites. Based from my memory - Cupcake Bites are way softer than Cookie Dough Bites, and they're so addictive and delicious. Cupcake Bites are by far the best product that the makers of Cookie Dough Bites have ever made. Cupcake Bites is one of the best inventions for cupcake fans and lovers. Your cravings for cupcakes are gone after eating these. And you don't have to deal with the mess of transporting cupcakes, especially in the sweltering summer heat. The downside though is that you need to refrigerate these treats during the summertime. Just like most candy during the summertime, it will melt. Anyways, you can buy boxes of these Cupcake Bites directly from the Cookie Dough Bites website. You can buy them from Amazon when available or physically in places such as the Dollar General Store. There's even a Facebook page for Cupcake Bites. In the end, if you like cupcakes, and haven't tried Cupcake Bites, I highly recommend you do so - you won't regret it!

review/summary: Versatile and tasty!
review/text: I love this stuff. I found out about it from some Endocrinologists and Dietitians that I work with. It adds so much flavor to things and so little calories/fat! You can even mix it with water to get a decent alternative...I'd say use less water and add more if needed - the ratio on the packaging seems to be a bit too runny for my taste. I only add liquid for small amounts, like a dip or something, because it does not go a long way. I have read some reviews where people were not pleased with that fact, but I'd say it is not meant to be only mixed with water. It goes a very long way in shakes/sauces/baking/etc!<br /><br />I don't feel that the chocolate flavor really tastes like chocolate, so I just buy the regular and add cocoa powder if I need chocolate. That way I also have more control over how much chocolate flavor I get.

review/summary: Heide vs. Jelly Belly Gummi Bears
review/text: Both Jelly Belly and Heide have established themselves as leaders in the American Gummi Bear market, in fact, Jelly Belly was the first to ever make an American Gummi Bear. Unlike their European counterparts, such as Haribo Gold Bears, American Gummi Bears are soft and have a more opaque look to them.<br /><br />My all-time favorite Gummi Bear has been Heide ever since elementary school, but I give Jelly Belly a lot of credit for putting up a great fight. Jelly Belly bears are smaller and less resembling of a bear, but they sure pack a punch in terms of flavor. Heide bears on the other hand are larger and more bear-like than their counterpart, but flavor is more subtle. Both come in five distinct flavors and both are difficult to find in your average grocery store candy aisle.<br /><br />On average, Jelly Belly bears appear to be more costly than Heide bears per ounce, but of course that doesn't mean you won't find amazing deals like the one on Amazon that turn the tables. In general you won't go wrong with either brand, but my vote still goes toward Heide for bringing back all the memories of my childhood.

review/summary: Sweet & Spicy -  Delicious & Easy
review/text: This is one of those items you will want to keep in your pantry for a fast and satisfying meal.  A thick soup that has a perfect blend of sweet and spicy (for a thinner version add a can of chicken broth).  Perfect for autumn...worked great for a tail-gate party!

review/summary: Yum!  Highly Recommended Soup (Base) & Brand
review/text: I discovered this particular brand in my search for a gluten free taco seasoning.  When I noticed they had soup; I decided to give this a try (since it was a personal "gold box" deal)!  The first time I made it, I put chicken broth instead of water, and added a little frozen corn (when it was almost cooked).  I also added a dollop of sour cream when I served it.  The second time I decided that instead of extra corn, I'd add a diced grilled chicken breast, onion, a mixture of chicken broth (what was left of the box.. about 2 cups), a cup of water, and also about a cup of milk (because I didn't want it too thick).  It was fantastic!!<br /><br />  In conclusion, Nueva Cocina mixes are very handy if you want a fast meal!  Don't be afraid to add ingredients you think you'd like.  If you're the sort of person that likes corn chowder, or even creamed corn- this is something you should definitely try!!  I also highly recommend the "Black Bean Chipotle Chile" soup mix, and the (taco) seasonings!!!

review/summary: Very nourishing, satisfying thick soup
review/text: This is super easy, just be careful to lower the heat after it comes to a boil, it will scorch easily. It's delicious, very rewarding on a cold day.<br />The suggestion to add more corn kernels is a good one; another addition could be sliced frankfurters or sausage.  The chiles are not at all too hot;<br />the soup would be too bland without them.
