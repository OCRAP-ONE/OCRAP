review/text: I am not a coconut oil aficionado but I can say this is easily as good as any other I have tasted.  Being Raw and Organic may be the reason.  It tastes great straight from the jar!  I originally bought coconut oil for making popcorn, Thai and Indian dishes.  No I am experimenting with a lot of other dishes.  Working my way through saute and roasted vegetables.  I used it to make grilled cheese sandwiches for the kids and they loved it. Plus it makes the house smell like coconuts!

review/summary: GREAT dog treat!!!!
review/text: These dog treats are great, especially if you have a larger dog who can chew any toy or treat to pieces in a minute.  This treats are tough, I have a pitbull and a boxer mix and they are strong and usually chew through a treat real quick but these last and last and they keep them entertained.  I highly recommend these for all dogs.  Plus the filling isn't gross sticky stuff that leaks out and gets on your carpet like some of those other filled dog treats.

review/text: These bones are my dog's absolute favorite.  He is a SUPER strong chewer, although he only weighs about 60 lbs and is otherwise completely gentle.  It's sometimes hard to find bones and toys for him since he always chews them to bits within 5 minutes.  These bones last him forever, at least 3-4 months at a time.  He loves the filling and will lick it for hours.  Would recommend these bones to any large dog owner.

Use your own judgement and decide if your dog could get his/her lower jaw through. I'm sticking to the longer filled bones from now on.

If I had found the Go Raw products before I bought the dehydrator, I would have not needed it!  The pumpkin and spirulina bars are rejuvenating.

review/text: I love these crackers/cookies because you really taste a good sesame flavor (which I love) with the taste of fresh ginger (tangy peppery flavor).  They come in one inch circles and a 3oz bag has 3 servings which is great.<br /><br />I love those crunchy sesame candies that you find in asian stores and this reminds me of those candies without being too crunchy and without all the unwanted sugars.<br /><br />These crackers have a nice crunch and have a sweet taste that give me the afternoon treat I like around 2pm at work.  I am trying to be more RAW and this is a great snack without going overboard with nuts/fats.<br /><br />Will try the other flavors soon.

It is nice to know you can have something really healthy that tastes great and is good for you. Thanks for making these available at such a great price. I'll have to see what other flavors they have.

I've been house-bound for health reasons for a year and have limited mobility, so being able to order this generous supply of a favorite tea is a blessing. I keep the extra boxes in plastic bags with as much air removed as possible. With 50 tea bags per box and 5 boxes, I am stocked for quite a while. Rosehip tea has a unique, slightly tart flavor which I find difficult to describe. It is packed with Vit. C and good for you. My favorite way to drink it is with some added fresh lemon juice and sweetened with organic honey. Just as wonderful as I remember.

review/summary: The best black tea
review/text: If you like a simple pot of black tea, this is the stuff. When you open the tin, the scent that rolls out is wonderful. And the fragrance from a fresh-brewed cup is perfect: bright and not bitter. Best with a little milk and sugar, but a beautiful color in a glass tea-cup, too. This is my absolute favorite daily tea, and if you get used to the loose leaf, brewed fresh, you wont even think about using dry old bags again. Sometimes this brand is hard to find in loose leaf locally, so I have bought 3 or 4 tins at a time online and it seems to store well (if you keep the metal tins sealed and away from other smells and light.) You wouldn't think there would be that much difference between one black tea and another but this very slight bergamot-tinged blend is addictive. (The green metal tins are also handy for other things, when the tea is gone.) This tea is the one item I ALWAYS want for Christmas!

review/text: This decaf is a tad anemic and has a bit of a burnt edge to it which may produce a slight aftertaste. If made in a press pot you may find you need to increase the amount of beans, or increase the steeping time to make it richer, elsewise it will may be rather pedestrian and thin. I would not describe this product as rich or robust, however it is not poor either. Experimenting with amount of beans (probably require a tad more than usual) and/or setting time (give it an extra minute or two) may make this a bit more satisfying cup.

A wonderful full flavor that will satisfy my coffee taste cravings for a long time to come. In addition it was gratifying to learn that Larry's Beans is implementing all types of energy saving and environmentally friendly methods of doing business from buying fair trade, solar applications and recycling. A great article appeared in the latest issue of Solar Today on their company. A coincidence? More like serendipity. I highly recommend doing business with Larry's Beans.

review/text: This honey is okay.  Though I am no connoisseur,  It's kind of like supermarket honey.  I use it when I make bread or put it in my coffee.  I think it is average honey.  Probably the worst thing about this honey is the cap.  No matter how careful I am, every time I put honey into my coffee, the honey drips from the side of the cap.  So I have to rinse it off so it doesn't make a sticky mess on the counter or in the cabinet.  Sometimes my husband uses this and I have to clean up a trail of mess.  The manufacturer should have put 10 more cents into making a better bottle.

We started with some pork baby backs in the oven with a simple marinade and rub for the first hour or so.  Then the real magic happened once we moved them to grill outside to do a light crust and char using the Sticky Stuff as a basting sauce.  It all came together at the dinner table when we started eating these delicious, 'shut my mouth' ribs.  Little was said and much was eaten.  Trust me, you will want the extra bottles in the six pack to share and have around for your own craving.

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: I can't believe I actually bought this stuff in the stores. They charge half as much for less than a quarter of the product.<br /><br />Because it was soo expensive, I started buying proprietary blends of "seasoning salts" from spice sites around the net. Most of them were good and were comparable in price, but none of them were exactly what they were trying to emulate: Lawry's.<br /><br />Finally, I decided to check back to Amazon to see what the real stuff cost. I was shocked to find out that I was paying the same or more for imitation products. I immediately bought it and have never looked back.<br /><br />If you've never had Lawry's, you're in for a real treat. Many recipes call for "seasoning salt." Well, they are generally referring to "Lawry's' without mentioning the name. You can pretty much sprinkle this stuff on anything. It is great on fries; I mix it with flour and bread crumbs to coat chicken, It could probably be substituted for poultry seasoning.

review/summary: Good raw unfiltered honey at a good price.
review/text: The price was good when I bought the honey from Amazon, and was even better because I chose to take advantage of Amazon's Subscribe & Save offer. (I've used it in the past and never had a problem canceling or changing a scheduled order, and therefore I never received an order I didn't need or want. Amazon sends an email before shipping an item you've subscribed to, giving you a chance to cancel or postpone it.)<br /><br />It's hard for me to find raw, unfiltered honey that is 100% a product of the US in local markets at anything close to what I'd consider a reasonable price (and that's if and when they have such honey in stock at all). I've tried a different brand of raw, unfiltered, produced in the US honey from Amazon, and while I like it and may buy it again in the future (e.g., for the sake of variety), I like the Ambrosia Honey better. I operated natural food stores in CA in the late 70's and early 80's, and the smell and taste of Ambrosia Honey reminds me of some of the good, pure honey we sold in bulk back then.<br /><br />The shipment of a 4-pack of 23 ounce plastic bottles (as pictured) arrived without any leaks or stickiness on the bottles at all, and I appreciate that each bottle has a pour-type cap (you just have to snip or cut the top of the spout off to the diameter you want), as opposed to honey containers that you have to use a spoon or honey dipper with. There are nice, simple instructions on the label about how to reliquify the Ambrosia Honey if and when necessary.<br /><br />I think anyone who appreciates really good quality pure, unfiltered honey will like this honey.

review/summary: Honey taste is wonderful, packaging leaves me dripping.
review/text: The honey is five stars if you enjoy a lighter-colored honey with a light to medium bodied taste.  This is near the middle, tending toward light. Excellent consistency, good flow, no trouble with crystallization. Unfortunately, the twist-on cap of two of my four bottles came loose and dripped while in transit. It was a small amount, nothing to return the package over. However, I notice that even after tightening the cap, putting pressure on the bottle to squeeze the honey has created drip. This honey is quite sticky on the hands. If you have another container to place it in, I would recommend using that if it has a tried-and-true lid on it. The plastic of these bottles is very, very pliable, which can make it difficult to get honey out when the level reaches about a quarter full.<br /><br />In all, I think I will continue to buy this product, but I will most likely salvage some other honey bottles to use with it instead to combat the drip and pressure problem.

review/summary: A nice flavorful honey.
review/text: Since this honey professes to be raw (actually, it is warmed/heated) and unfiltered (actually, they tell you on the label in small print that they filter it) I was prepared for little bits and floaters to be in it, but it is clear as a bell.  The flavor is a mild sort of wildflower flavor - but different - more mellow.  It's sweet, but not overly so and it's not as thick as many raw wildflower honeys can be.  Its color is a nice rich amber.<br /><br />The bottles are easy to handle but I get nervous about handling them with the pour spout when they are full as the cap isn't the most securely fitting thing in the world.  It just feels weak to me.  They arrived really well packed for transit so I didn't experience any messy losses due to shipping.<br /><br />The manufacturers might want to consider redoing their label as the information they provide is confusing:  Raw & Unfiltered verses the fine print stating that it is heated/warmed & filtered.  It matters a lot to some folks and is the only reason I docked a star.  Regardless, the honey rocks.

I was a little worried that the taste would be so different from the regular store bought that she would have trouble adjusting to it.  When it arrived, she popped one open and tasted it.  She didn't think honey could really taste all the different.  Boy was she surprised.  She immediately started raving about the taste.  I couldn't believe how wonderful it was.  I mean, it is still honey.  It still tasted like honey.  The difference can't even be described appropriately in words.  It is like taking a bath in just warm water, or taking a bubble bath in hot water with a glass of wine and candles along the sides.  it just makes you feel that much better.  Okay, that may have been a bit exaggerated, but the effect is the same.  It is so much better than the honey from the store.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Very questionable product
review/text: I've been buying raw & unfiltered honey for years, from local market, Trader Joe's, and Whole Food. I seriously doubt this is raw and unfiltered honey. The raw & unfiltered honey I bought elsewhere "ALL" looked whitish and murky. When I used it with coffee, you can see some oil floating to the surface of the coffee. The coffee cup always leaves a oily residue which is not easy to wash even with detergent. I don't get that with this product at all. In fact I don't even need detergent at all. Unfiltered raw honey should have pollen, propolis, wax, and live enzymes rich in nutrient. This honey taste like regular honey except it crytalizes way too easily. I recently took this product to a local farmer and I was told this is definitely not unfiltered raw honey. I also took this honey to a famous honey producer in Delaware and I was told the same thing.<br /><br />For those who wrote positive reviews for this product, please do some search to see what unfiltered raw honey should look like. Some of you got cheated and you don't even know it. Unfiltered raw honey should look like creamy lard, not dark amber liquid that crystalizes easily. This is what Trader Joe's told me.

review/summary: Absolutely awesome!
review/text: The package arrived in pristine condition, double packaged - in bubble wrap as well as a thick plastic wrapping. The bottles are not cracked or leaking etc. Kids (and us) love the taste of the honey. One downside (or upside?) is the expiration data is not very long, like store bought honey. Overall, very satisfied with the packaging as well as the honey.

review/summary: Wonderful- in nutrition and value!
review/text: As someone who uses honey regularly in baking and cooking as a replacement for traditional refined sugar, I was on the hunt for the best honey nutritionally at the best value. I am confident that this is it. Not only is the honey delicious and meets the criteria I was looking for (heated at a lower temp to preserve enzymes), but it is much cheaper when purchasing through Subscribe & Save than repeatedly buying raw/natural honey at a health food store. I am very pleased and highly recommend this buy!

review/text: this is first time trying Ambrosia Pure Honey from Colorado's W Slope, and my first implosion is great for the taste and price. However, I feel the honey is not really pure since the consistency is not as I expected when I purchased it. Overall, I like the taste and the kids do too.

review/text: My wife makes the best granola. Hands down. We have a couple local restaurants that are close.  If neither one of those are available, and I HAVE to resort to a package, these Pomegranate Walnut Granola Planks will totally do in a pinch.  I especially like the instructions on the package... microwave if you want it chewier; put in the toaster if you want it crunchier.  I also really liked the fact that it held together well so there was no mess.

review/summary: Not good alone
review/text: I would recommend trying this flavor and this product in the store before buying. The planks are chewy enough that they taste kind of stale just as a granola bar or snack by themselves. I suppose if you were hiking and really hungry they might taste better, but I bought them for a snack when I work the midnight shift at work.  They are acceptable with milk or yogurt, but I could just as easily buy regular granola and not have to break it up (they don't break easily). I wouldn't buy this again.

review/summary: Consistency of Stale Popcorn Balls
review/text: We love Earnest Bars!  We use about five boxes a month:  four Choco Peanut Butter Bars, and one Cran Lemon Zest.  I thought I would branch out and try something new.  Liked the idea of a bigger bar.  Ordered the Pomegranate Walnut Crisp.  I like pomegranate.  I like walnuts.  I like crispy things.  Can't lose, right?  WRONG!  I don't know if these were exposed to too much moisture or if they are actually supposed to have this consistency, but they are AWFUL!  My title says it all... instead of crisp, my bars (I had two - and ate them on different days - just to make sure the package wasn't faulty and to make sure I wasn't being overcritical).  The sunflower seeds are nice.  The almonds would be better toasted.  I don't actually see any walnuts... the fruit is flavorful.  But the overall taste is just kind of sweet and is lost to the off-putting consistency of chewy popcorn balls.  There is nothing crisp about this product.  :(

Each plank has 2 servings, 190 calories each. In other words, each plank is about 400 calories - too much for me. I won't be buying these again.

I searched all the local markets and online to find a place to buy another bottle with no results.  I was very pleased when I finally found this product on Amazon for about the same price I had paid at the local farmers market.<br /><br />I like basting my grilled chicken or shrimp with this sauce and adding to a salad for a quick meal.  Adds just the right amount of heat and sweetness for excellent flavor.

Also, instead of eating a doughnut or cookie with my morning coffee, I'll reach for these biscuits and it actually goes very well with coffee.

review/summary: Not my favorite flavor, but still tasty
review/text: I absolutely LOVE the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VBBSVI">Belvita Blueberry</a>, but when my local store was out of the Blueberry flavor recently, I decided to try the Apple Cinnamon.  Like the other "biscuits" (they are more breakfast cookies, really) in the belVita line, the Apple Cinnamon variety packs a surprisingly decent nutritional profile, with 4 grams of protein (could be better, but not bad), 3 grams of fiber, and 18 grams of whole grain. They are lower in sugar than most breakfast bars or even yogurts at 13 grams, and although the fat content is a bit high (8 grams), there is only a trace of saturated fat (.5 grams).<br /><br />But, the best part about these biscuits is the taste--they are quite yummy!  I as glad that the Apple Cinnamon shares the same crisp, buttery, cookie-like flavor as the Blueberry.  Unfortunately, unlike the Blueberry, which actually has little bits of berries and a distinct blueberry flavor, the Apple Cinnamon variety did not taste particularly apple-y to me at all, and I could not detect any pieces of fruit.  The base flavor was still good, but it was more like a plain butter cookie rather than the promised Apple Cinnamon.<br /><br />I will probably continue to buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VBBSVI">Belvita Blueberry</a> when available, but this might be an option for those who prefer a simpler flavor.
