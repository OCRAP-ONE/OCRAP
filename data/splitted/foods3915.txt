review/summary: Not the quality of the first time I ordered
review/text: This is the 2nd time I have ordered and these cookies arrived packed in the box, not in a plastic bag as the previous order.  The cookies were stale.  The first order was definitely fresh - this order was extremely disappointing.  I will probably go back and pay a little extra to pick up the 12 unit box at the local grocery - I am very disappointed in the quality and freshness of this product

review/text: Shipped very quick. However the US Mail "shoebox" the 96 were crammed into was crushed in delivery and many cookies were in pieces.  Upon taste, the cookies were stale and soft.  The "fortune" insert was not really a fortune or an inspirational saying but a quote that lost the point after it was translated.  Very disappointing.

review/text: My husband loves the fortune cookies and was looking forward to receiving these.  When they arrived the box was crushed on two sides destroying over 1/3 of the cookies.  The box was marked fragile but there was not packing inside to protect the cookies (basically just fortune cookies in a cardboard shipping box).  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Tasty Individually Wrapped Cookies
review/text: I bought these to make chocolate dipped cookies for Chinese New Year.  I chose these after reading the one review stating that they were only wrapped in one big bag in each box, but was disappointed to find them individually wrapped (though this will probably be good for everyone else).  If I had known that, I would have just bought the big 96-pack.<br /><br />Needing the cookies to be whole for dipping, here are my general comments:<br />- average &lt;1 per 12 pc box not folded shut enough to dip or had fortune falling out and couldn't be dipped<br />- average 1-2 per box were broken and could not be used<br /><br />As for freshness, these cookies are 3 months away from expiration and taste great!

Each one is approximately 30 calories, no cholesterol, no sodium, and if you ate an entire boxful you'd only be downing 5% of your daily fat value (based on a 2K cal a day diet). They satisfy the craving for sweets, without doing terrible dietary damage, and give us good advice. What other snackfood does that? Oh...and they're yummy!

review/text: I found a bottle of this at a discount store, but oh boy, was the flavor priceless. It is great for flavoring merengue, hot chocolate, or even add a dash to strawberries, when you mix them up for topping (strawberries just don't taste as good as they used to). My personal favorite is hot milk with some white-chocolate syrup and a dash of butter vanilla. Even my sister likes this flavoring and wanted to use it in her cupcakes she baked for church.<br /><br />Butter vanilla is my new must-have flavoring. It is a great addition to any baker's cupboard.

review/summary: Five Star Product, One Star Box...
review/text: Having used Beyond Gourmet unbleached parchment paper for years, I was unhappy when the price got so high and began purchasing the white parchment which our grocery store carries.  The white parchment was several inches wider than Beyond Gourmet so I often had more waste than when using the unbleached product.  Further, I wasn't particularly happy with it as it tended to scorch more easily than the unbleached, brown paper.  The last drawback for me was that the white paper was not as easy to "mold" into the shape of the pan.<br /><br />When I saw this four-pack of unbleached parchment paper, I decided to give it a try.  Even though each roll held the same square footage of paper, the cost was significantly less than Beyond Gourmet.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  The paper works very well; it is heavy enough to use several times, but flexible enough to be molded easily to the baking pan.  Product releases easily and the paper can be wiped off for more uses.<br /><br />Yes, the box is too flimsy and has no metal cutting edge, but that seems to be a drawback with all unbleached parchment papers.  So, "If You Care" receives five stars for the paper and one star for the box.

review/summary: Even more useful than regular parchment paper
review/text: I originally bought this just because it was cheaper than the regular parchment paper in the grocery store. I was therefore very pleasantly surprised to find out that it's actually much more useful than regular parchment paper.<br /><br />The silicone non-stick coating is no joke. Before I got this, I would often line pans with aluminum foil and spray them with oil to roast peppers, cook frozen samosas, etc. Now, I instead just lay the food on top of a piece of parchment paper, and the non-stick coating makes oil unnecessary. And, this paper is *much* cheaper than aluminum foil.<br /><br />Two things to note: at 13" wide, it's a couple of inches narrower than most regular parchment paper. Also, unlike most grocery store brands, it doesn't have a metal band to help you tear off sheets. (They claim that you can use the cardboard edge to do that, but it doesn't work.) But 13" is plenty for almost everything I do. And using scissors to cut the paper is a small price to pay given how well this paper works.

review/summary: For cooks who love to COOK!
review/text: About 5 years ago I discovered the "secret" to better baking -- parchment paper.  This little kitchen miracle worker makes baking so much easier and healthier.  No more having to grease cookie sheets or clean up the mess from a pecan pie that "bubbled over" when cooking.  A piece of parchment paper does the trick while keeping unecessary fats and calories out of your foods!<br /><br />The one problem with parchment paper is the variety you find in most stores is 1)  Expensive and 2)  bleached with chemicals.  "If You Care" has solved both of those problems in this 4-pack of parchment paper that your kitchen will love (hint:  it also makes a GREAT gift for a friend who is into cooking -- trust me!).  For the price you will pay for 4 boxes of this parchment paper you will get over 8 times as much as you would have gotten in the grocery store!  Plus you can rest easy knowing you aren't harming the environment by using paper that was bleached (can someone tell me what the purpose is to bleaching parchment paper -- it just seems silly!)<br /><br />I can't stop recommending this paper enough.  This is my 4th purchase from Amazon over the years of this exact same paper and while you may think that 4 boxes is a lot -- trust me, it will get used!  Once you discover how much easier it makes cooking you will be using it for everything!

review/summary: The best parchment paper
review/text: In recent years, parchment paper has become as essential to my cooking supplies as resealable bags and aluminum foil.  I use it to line the bottom of the pan for all kinds of baking - breads, cookies, pizzas, etc. - it's an essential item.  The typical grocery store parchment paper is usually too wide, so there is waste, it is bleached (ugh), and it is not silicon-coated. These other papers use quilon, which isn't as safe and doesn't withstand as high a heat because of the chrome in it (try baking hearth breads at low enough temps for that stuff).  'If You Care' parchment paper IS silicon-coated on both sides and can safely withstand temperatures used in baking hearth breads.  I also like that there is enough (70 square feet) parchment paper in a box of 'If You Care' (compared to 30 square feet of the other - and lots of it wasted, since it's too wide).  Buy the 4-box package of 'If You Care' from Amazon, and you'll save a bundle!<br /><br />So, if I like it so well, why do I give it only four stars?  It's because I have to get my scissors (or a knife) out to cut a piece of it.  The edge of the box (with no cutting strip) will maybe work one or two times for helping tear a straight edge - then it breaks down. Even folding a sharp crease along the tear-line doesn't yield a good tear.  I know the lack of a metal tear-strip is part of the recycling benefit of the packaging, but I wish there was an easier solution than cutting with scissors or a knife.  Still, the product itself is good enough for me to overlook this one flaw.  I wouldn't use anything else.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: This parchment paper is unlike any I have ever used before.  Previously, I hated using parchment paper--it seemed to get a funny smell in the oven (like a burned smell), baked goods still stuck to it, etc.  Normally I would use aluminum foil instead, but now try to avoid using aluminum foil for cooking in high heat.  This unbleached parchment paper has been an excellent substitute.  No weird smell, food slides off effortlessly, and as others mentioned, I can use it at least twice before I have to replace it, so less is wasted.  Plus since no chlorine is used, I can feel good about helping the environment in a small way.<br /><br />The only negative is that there is no easy way to tear it out of the box.  You can try to use the edge of the box to tear, but it's an imperfect solution.  I use scissors.  A small hassle overall, really.

review/summary: Great product and price with Subscribe and Save; If you need a cutter edge, simply replace this box with a used saran wrap box
review/text: I'm a BIG fan of parchment paper in general (based on all the scares about using commercial cooking sprays, non-stick sheet trays with coating that eventually peels away, microwaving in plastic or saran wrap etc.)and it actually works better than absolutely any other non stick methods out there (including the "non-stick foil"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BQ73UW">Teflon Non-Stick Foil Sheet, 16" X 24"</a>.  And with this brand, if the food you're cooking isn't too wet or messy (e.g., I used it on top of a cookie tray when baking bread), you can use the sheet quite a few times (I know, at .07 a sqr foot, you can splurge and use a fresh sheet each time). This brand of parchment paper also seems sturdier than most others (hence the ability to use a sheet more than once) and it has a slight silicone coating on it that makes it absolutely 100% stick proof.  I've also had no burning whatsoever on the bottom of the bread and I've stopped using commercial spray oils. The coating also makes this a good choice to make food cooking packets for wet foods without making a big mess (I wrap a piece of salmon with yellow and red peppers or a sprig of rosemary with lemon and then fold/seal the packet before cooking in the oven. Perfect! Some liquid does seep through onto the cooking dish, but not a lot. Clean up is a quick rinse with soap and water.<br /><br />Although the parchment paper in a roll form does roll up a bit (as opposed to using the pre-cut flat sheets), I don't really find that to be a big deal (or worth the extra money to buy the pre-cut sheets)....I simply fold about 1/3 of an inch of the paper around the bottom of the tray and it stays put. Also a lot of people complain about a cutter not being on the box...while I do agree it's a bit more work using a scissor or trying to tear the sheet using the cardboard box edge, I get around the problem by simply replacing the original box with a similar sized saran wrap box (or wax paper box etc.) that has the saw tooth cutter edge. Problem solved!

The only complaint I have is it's hard to cut, the teeth along the box is very dull; it curled up on you and it slided.  My trick is to dab a little of shortening here and there on the baking sheet before putting parchment paper on top.  It worked.

review/summary: Perfection!
review/text: My wife likes to bake cookies now and then, especially for parties and such. She's tried all kinds of ways to get cookies that don't stick to the baking tray. Nothing works completely. Then one day she read in the Martha Stewart Living Magazine, that parchment paper was the thing to use. Parchment paper? I'd never heard of such a thing. Neither had she. Well, I was dispatched to the local supermarket with the instructions to get some. First of all, I had no idea where to look or what to look for. I asked a couple clerks and it baffled them too. Finally. one knew. It was over with the waxed paper and occupied a tiny space on a top shelf. "If You Care" was the brand. "If You Care"? I might expect Betty Crocker or something like that. Anyhow, I brought a 70-foot roll home. My wife reported that it worked perfectly. Not a single cookie stuck. She'd never bake cookies again without parchment paper. That was almost four years ago.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Good product, good price
review/text: I was used to the bleached white parchment paper and wasn't sure how the unbleached stuff would perform. Turns out that it's a little heavier than the commercially available stuff, and also coated with silicon. I'm not sure it needs that, since I've never had any kind of sticking problem with plain parchment paper.<br />That said, you can use it several times, as long as it doesn't get oily from whatever you're baking. So it's economical -- I bake at least twice a week and it looks like the three pack will last a year or so.<br /><br />You can tear the paper using the box if you're careful to hold your thumb near the edge so you get a good rip started. It's worth two seconds of extra time to save that blade from going through the waste cycle.<br /><br />So far, I like it, recommend it and will purchase it again.

review/summary: Best way to bake stuff in the oven!
review/text: I don't cook much but I do love to bake my tofu and vegetables, especially when my hubby declares that he won't cook some nights. And I've learned from him not to use aluminum foil so much but to use parchment paper for oven cooking! This item was much cheaper in this packaging than any others at the store and it arrived very quickly. Also this is the best brand of parchment, and it makes cleanup after fact much easier too.

review/text: Just received this parchment paper and it is wonderful stuff.  The comments on the box being flimsy is true, but I saved an old parchment box and just transferred it.  I tried tearing the paper the way the directions said on the box and had no problem with it.  I think holding the box firmly and tearing the paper at the correct angle is the key.

review/summary: Good parchment
review/text: While I don't love the paper teeth to rip paper...I do like this parchment and the value for my money. I'm on my third box, and it lasts a good bit longer than Reynolds since you have more length. It's a little annoying to rip the paper, but it works best to tuck the flap inside the box and rip UP, rather than down like you do to tear foil.

review/summary: For baking AND decorating!
review/text: I have roasted, baked, and decorated with parchment paper.  I have a silpat mat too, but I find that parchment is so much more convenient for cleanup since I just throw it away afterwards.  I also prefer to bake my cookies using parchment instead of silpat for a chewy texture.  An extra plus is that the parchment can be reused if you have more than 1 batch of cookies to bake.<br /><br />This parchment is also great for decorating baked goods.  I've wrapped brownies and cookie bars with strips of this brown parchment paper and tied with twine for a rustic look.<br /><br />Like others have mentioned, there is no easy way to tear the parchment.  You have to use the sawtooth cardboard but otherwise this is what I was looking for at a great price.

review/summary: Super Parchment
review/text: I received this parchment just in time for some loaves I was about to bake. Talk about timing! The paper worked perfectly. I particularly like the fact that it is much more environmentally friendly than the grocery store paper I usually purchase. Who needs bleached parchment anyway? Not having a cutting edge on the box might seem inconvenient but we all should have some utility shears in our kitchen anyway. I think it makes the product better. If you have ever cut yourself on one of those boxes you know what I mean.<br /><br />In summary this is a great option for those of us that want a quality and economical product that happens to be a little bit better for the environment. I will purchase again.

review/summary: BEST parchment paper and eco-friendly, too!
review/text: I LOVE this parchment paper. It's so much better than  the typical Reynolds or whatever store brand kind that's white. First, it's longer, so it fits the baking sheets better. Second, it's eco-friendly, made of unbleached paper--who even knows what they put in that other stuff to make it white? Third, it's better at absorbing grease than the other kind. I highly recommend this if you're serious about baking--you won't go back to the el cheapo store brands again!

review/summary: Outperforms the Competition
review/text: This is by far the best parchment paper I have used. Previously I was using Reynolds, which is the only brand in most stores, and thought it was working well. It had a tendency to cook on the edges, especially if using it multiple times. While shopping in my coop I decided to splurge on this envrio friendly brand, being at double the cost. I am certainly glad I did because this product Outperforms the Competition in every way. It is even more non-stick, lasts through multiple cooking cycles, is even tougher. With the multiple uses I can make several batches of cookies on the same sheet. In the end I think it will likely end up being cheaper. My next purchase will be the muffins liners. By far and away you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Not What I'd Hoped For
review/text: I'd become a convert to baking with parchment paper a couple of years ago, and in that time period I've gone through a couple of different rolls - generally just whatever brand was available at the store, none of them being particularly better or worse than the other. Until I decided to try this brand one day. As someone who makes a point to try to shop local & eco-friendly whenever possible, I was really glad to find a more environmentally-friendly parchment paper and really didn't mind paying a little more for it than for the conventional brands. That is, until I used it for the first time. For starters, it's not sized to fit a standard cookie sheet, so to get coverage for a whole pan, you have to use one and a half or two sheets, where the other kinds I've used have just required one sheet to cover the entire pan. Lastly, there's no easy way to tear it - no handy jagged aluminum edge like on most kinds of parchment paper that makes it quick and easy to use. I have no complaints about the quality of the product itself (once I've finally got a patchwork cover made on my cookie sheets), but then I never had a complaint about the conventional brands, either. Really, for me, it's just not wort the hassle. In the future, I'm just going to save myself the frustration and annoyance and just go with the regular kind.

review/summary: Does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly
review/text: Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make "ladybug spots and antennae," which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug "heads") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.

Soy proteins or something has been added, you can't just drain the water off anymore. You have to rinse and rinse and when you done you have a miserable mess of NOT SOLID, NOT VERY WHITE tuna. This brand is not as bad as COS or STARKIST. I am going to try a natural Tongol tuna next time. A little more expensive but ......... hopefully better that this.

review/summary: Just do the math!
review/text: Same exact tuna that I buy in the store.  Even though it's labeled "solid white", sometimes when I open the can it looks more like chunk white, but that's a problem I have whether I buy cans from Amazon or my local supermarket, and whether I buy Bumble Bee or Starkist (although I find Bumble Bee is much better at delivering the stated "solid white" than Starkist).  So whether to buy online from Amazon is just simple math.<br /><br />When I bought on 5/18/12 these were the prices:<br />24 pack for $30.72 = $1.28 per can (and no sales tax).<br />Or with subscribe and save it's $26.11 = $1.09 per can (and no sales tax).<br /><br />Now I'm looking on 5/29/12 and the price has jumped:<br />24 pack for $35.76 = $1.49 per can (and no sales tax).<br />Or with subscribe and save it's $30.40 = $1.27 per can (and no sales tax).<br /><br />*Update, price on 7/9/12 down to $30.48 (or 25.91 with subscribe and save), but price on 8/2 went up to 35.76 (or 30.40 with subscribe and save). Price may fluctuate, so just got to watch it.<br /><br />I've ordered this twice from Amazon, both times at much cheaper prices then what I normally pay at the supermarket.  Both times, none of the cans came dented, all were in perfect condition, just like what I get at the store.<br /><br />My family eats a lot of tuna, and since tuna takes years to go bad, buying in bulk from Amazon can be a good deal as long as the price is cheaper than what I get at the local supermarkets (where I live, I typically see Bumble Bee Solid White for $1.55 to $1.89).<br /><br />Just do the math and you'll know if this is a good deal for you or not.

I had trouble touching it.  Bumble Bee should be made to mark this for what it is.  Check out Three Diamonds Solid and  you will see what solid tuna should look like.

review/summary: Bumblebee is gross.
review/text: Every time I've had Bumblebee tuna in the past, it's been pretty awful.  Lots of the 'mud line' (red muscle) included and very few *solid* chunks.  I went to the local grocery store and picked up a single can of this (Albacore) by Bumblebee thinking their Albacore should be better and it was the cheapest at the store.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Not only was there a large bone sitting right on top, another in the mix, and a complete fish scale, but the meat was ground to a pulp and was about 1/2 'mud line' and 1/2 white.  I gave it to my dog and had a PB&J instead.<br /><br />I wish Trader Joe's brand could be found at other grocery stores.  I haven't tried their Albacore, but the Tongol tuna is far superior in quality.

review/text: These chips were recommended by my nutritionist, as I am a pre-diabetic.  They are equal to 2 Weight Watchers points.  They are an excellent snack while on a diet. When you're dying for potato chips, these substitute very nicely without the calories.  They taste great also.  I order them about once a month.

review/text: I am furious that I put in my first order for something other than books, dvds and cds from an Amazon based Seller, Nutricity, and they sent the wrong order.  And, it's not that it's just the wrong order, but the title/headline on the product and the order itself specifically said DECAF!! I needed and wanted and ordered DECAF and, DECAFFEINATED is printed on the cans of the Product I was SUPPOSED to get and ordered - and they STILL sent me the wrong product with Caffeine.  Unbelievable.

review/summary: Melted!
review/text: The Andes mints themselves were quite tasty, as Andes mints always are. Five stars for the taste, definitely.<br /><br />That being said, these were shipped with NO protection against the heat, at ALL. If a seller doesn't warn that hey, a product might melt in transit, I typically assume that they're doing something to PREVENT that from happening. These, however, were merely tossed in the box with my other items, and arrived half-melted -- they all oozed into the cracks and crevices of their wrappers, making them both difficult and messy to unwrap. I'd be even MORE annoyed if I'd planned to use them for anything other than personal consumption, as they're in no condition to be handed out for any reason.<br /><br />In summary -- 5 stars for the Andes mints themselves, zero stars for the thought put into the item description (no warm weather warning)/shipping.

If you really want Andes Mints, and like me, you can't find them at any of the local stores around you, then take a shot.  As for the product itself, if you're searching for andes mints on Amazon, you are probably already aware of how great they are.  Definitely five stars for me for both the products and the shipping.

review/summary: Big difference from the raw almond butter
review/text: I tried this and have to return the two other jars to the store. It was mostly tasteless. Since the price was much less than the raw almond butter I previously tried, I hoped it would be at least comparable. No such luck! It has roasted rather than raw almonds and added sugar and palm oil. I guess that is why it is spreadable but it makes it difficult to use for dipping apple slices in which is how I like to eat it most often. I will not buy this product again because it lacked the fresh, sweet raw almond taste I enjoyed with other brands. I'd much rather have to stir my almond butter and have a superior product with little or no additions.

This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish. They never turn out wrong.

We have a standard air popper (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IUWA">Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper</a>) and other brands of popping corn have a much higher pop yield.  My wife greatly prefers the fresh flavor of the Orville Redenbacher to store-brand popping corn (stale taste) but she is not happy with the large quantity of unpopped kernels.<br /><br />We are going to try some other brands to see if we can find something as tasty as the Orville Redenbacher  but with a higher yield in our air popper.

One thing you should note is the oil in the packet becomes thick at room temperature and you might find it difficult to empty into the kettle. I find that putting the packet briefly in warm water make the oil much more liquid and it will empty easier. All in all a great product at a great price.

review/summary: Amazing Sauces!
review/text: The American Stockyard line is handcrafted using all-natural ingredients, premium spices, and no high fructose corn syrup, and it's gluten-free.<br /><br />KC Pitmaster- This sweet sauce has a heavy dose of dark brown cane sugar with a hint of tangy mustard and a touch of spice. Brush it on your ribs or drizzle it on your brisket in the last few minutes of cooking time and you will have your own secret BBQ weapon.<br /><br />Harvest Apple- This unique sauce is a creative blend of tart Washington apples, brown sugar and a special blend of spices, a perfect complement to any BBQ meal.<br /><br />Memphis Red- In Memphis and places further East, they prefer their sauce to be plenty tangy but also just a little sweet and spicy. This sauce combines apple cider vinegar, pure cane sugar and a special blend of spices to give you the right combination for your pulled pork or just about anything that goes on a BBQ grill.<br /><br />Red Raspberries- Sweet red raspberries from America's northwest, bbq spices, honey and a touch of smokey chipotle peppers to bring you this unique sauce that is perfect for chicken, beef or pork.<br /><br />Smoky Mustard- More than 250 years ago, German immigrants settled in present day South Carolina and introduced their version of BBQ sauce to a hungry nation. There are no tomatoes in this sauce. Instead you will find premium whole grain mustard, tangy yellow mustard, brown sugar and a touch of hickory smoke.
