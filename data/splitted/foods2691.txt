review/summary: Nowhere as good as Starbucks Sumatra.
review/text: Just bought a bag at a local Costco for only $16.59.  The green oval label on top says "Roasted from Certified Organic coffee beans."  I guess this is why it wasn't as flavorful as Starbucks (non-organic) Sumatra.  It wasn't sour at all like blacksmithgirl claims.  I guess her bag must have gone rancid.  But it's too mild and too bitter for my taste.  You get what you pay for.  The worst part of waking up is this crap in your cup!

When I opened the box, the plant looked like it was beginning to die, but that probably has to do with being in a box for at least a week.<br />It almost instantly regained its health after I took it out and watered it.<br />It moves (changes orientation based on sunlight) faster than any other plant I've ever seen! It seems to do fine with only being watered a couple times a week.<br />I love this plant.

I did manage to kill them because a ficus smothered them to death. as long as you give them bright light, and keep them moist they will thrive in your tank. I just didn't keep them in ideal settings that is why we had issues. I will use these in future projects in which i have the proper setting for them.

review/text: I have wanted a Baby's Tears plant for at least 30 years.  Before my parents divorced, my mom used to have a huge table of houseplants and her Baby's Tears plant and every other one was discarded when we had to move.  My grandmother had a Baby's Tears plant but after she died, all of her plants were discarded, too and I have forever been chagrined to have such a dysfunctional upbringing that even simple houseplants could not survive such abusive turmoil.  FINALLY, I discovered that Hirt's Plants sells their own Baby's Years plants and I literally frantically ordered one.  It arrived practically immediately (1 or 2 days at best) and it was packaged perfectly and was in perfect shape when I took it out of its carton.  I have since transplanted it into a ceramic planter and I am very, very happy with this plant and with Hirt's Plants for helping me finally have my own Baby's Tears plant after more than 30 years.  I simply have never seen one in person to buy one myself!  I am very happy.

I would buy all they had, (usually 3 boxes), of the Lime White Chocolate, and then hope I didn't run out before they got more.<br />I tried all of the flavors, they are all excellent, but the Key Lime White Chocolate was my favorite. This is a small sized (2 bite) crunchy cookie filled with white chocolate chips that your teeth slide thru during a crunchy bite.  The delicate flavor of Lime is just outstanding with the white chocolate.  The best cookies in the world, made with all natural ingredients. They freeze very well, so now I always have a good supply.

review/summary: Mount Hagen vs Taster's Choice
review/text: I like freshly-ground, brewed coffee, but sometimes I'm in a hurry and just want a reasonable facsimile that looks, smells, and tastes like it and delivers my morning "buzz". Generally, any instant can be made drinkable if you doctor it up with enough creamer and sugar. Many of the previous reviews heaped praise on this drink, so naturally I wanted to see if Mount Hagen is really that good.<br />To make this review a bit different, I decided conduct a coffee "throwdown" between Mount Hagen Organic Instant Freeze Dried Coffee and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W2DSO6">Nescafe Taster's Choice Instant Coffee, Regular, 0.49-Ounce Single Sticks, 7-Count Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>. I wasn't expecting the Nescafe to be better than the Mount Hagen; it's just that I do drink that brand and like it. For the review, I brewed a cup of each of the instants according to instructions. Here's what I found:<br /><br />Aroma- Neither of these brands has a rich aroma, but the Mt. Hagen had the edge here, mainly because it's a darker roast.<br /><br />Taste- Fairly close results; the Taster's Choice was not bitter and had a fairly clean finish (no undesirable aftertaste). It was pretty watery when brewed according to instructions, though. Mount Hagen chalks one up in the win column for richer flavor and a fuller body.<br /><br />Convenience/Affordability- Taster's Choice is more convenient but is not more affordable than Mt. Hagen (price/ounce). Nescafe scores here on convenience.<br /><br />Eco-friendliness- Mount Hagen would seem to win because it's an organically-grown product (not sure if it's Fair Trade, though). However, it may have a larger carbon footprint than the Nescafe, since it's imported from Germany. The 2 brands tie on this category.<br /><br />In the end, I would go with the Mt. Hagen for at-home use because of it's slightly richer flavor and it's organically grown. I wouldn't mind keeping a couple of tubes of the Taster's Choice around in a drawer or the glove compartment for a caffeine-based "emergency", though.

review/summary: Best instant coffee available in the USA.....period
review/text: Unlike Europe where instant coffee is a huge and diverse marketplace, with Nescafe, Krona, Douwe Egberts, Maxwell House and more having umpteen products available, here in the USA there is very little choice. I'm not going to get into the instant vs. real coffee debate here, and this is an instant, so don't expect a Starbucks red eye latte. For convenience and taste however, there is no comparison to Mount Hagen (which is made in Germany incidentally) - Nescafe Gourmet series probably comes in a close second, but flavor and aroma wise this is head and shoulders above Folgers and Community brands of instant coffee, or any others for that matter. More and more people are drinking less and less coffee (we're all trying to be healthy remember?) so if you don't want to have the coffee pot on the hot plate all day, and can't afford a one cup at a time Keurig, give this a try. My only complaint is it's a little pricey, but until we have some others available in the USA to compete, I'll pay it. 5 Stars.

review/text: OK, it's a bit more pricey than Maxwell. In fact, my husband was irritated that I would spend so much on organic instant coffee when I could pick up a generic brand at the grocery store. That was until he tasted it.<br />The taste is similar to a good fresh brewed. It's smooth and totally lacks that acidic bitterness that one often associates with instant coffee.  Some buyers, like me, will be attracted to it because it is organic. However, it is the taste that sets it apart from other instant coffees.

We also grind our own (imported Italian) beans and use a high end stainless steel coffee maker, and Mount Hagen Instant is the best shortcut to a good cup of coffee we've ever found. Just boil the water and mix in a teaspoon full. It's also great for stirring into hot cocoa, using for recipes and making a great Irish Coffee!

review/summary: Great compared to most (other instant coffees)
review/text: I won't bore you with what has already been said. This instant coffee is a pleasure to drink in comparsion with most instant or even regular drip coffees. It is smooth and creamy even if a little bland looking to the eye. Even the aftertaste is pleasant as it lingers in your mouth for quiet a while. I find that I have to use a double portion of the prescribed teaspoon of instant coffee to achieve a decent taste per cup. The price is reasonable and the taste good but let me share my reluctance.<br /><br />My only reluctance about this instant coffee is simply because I am a coffee snob. Starbucks VIA instant coffee is far better tasting instant with its only drawback being about $1 per cup. With a double portion of Mount Hagen instant coffee the price is about $0.25 a cup ($46 Amazon cost / 6 packs / 30 double servings per pack = ~$0.25) Furthermore, I wouldn't trade in my regular drip, french press, or chemex coffees for this instant as they are incomparable and an unfair comparsion.<br /><br />Now why would I dare to compare this instant to other ground coffees? Simply because other reviewers have posted saying Mount Hagen is as good as regular. Unless you're drinking Folgers, Maxwell House, or some other coffee made with ground tires and run through an old shoe, no, this instant is not as good. I would reach for a good coffee of drip coffee over this coffee any day of the week.<br /><br />But for what this instant is and the price, it is excellent. If you keep in mind that sometimes you only need one cup of coffee at night or on the go, you simply cannot lose with Mount Hagen's instant coffee. Again, it has an fantastic taste (for an instant) and won't break the bank. But don't expect this instant to knock your socks off either.

review/text: I'm also a grind-your-own bean type, and I adore this coffee.<br /><br />In addition to the other praises heaped above, I would also point out that it dissolves REALLY well, and is therefore excellent for iced - I put a couple of heaping table spoons in a quart jar (I like it strong), add about a half-cup of hot water, and then top off with cold water, milk, and agave nectar. Minimal fuss, and no energy wasted to heat water just to cool it down again.<br /><br />For a while I was religiously consuming a (12-ounce/three dollar!) bottle of organic flavored iced coffee every morning. When I realized I could recreate the same beverage for about thirty cents using my own organic spices, sweetener, and milk the cost for a jar of this stuff suddenly didn't seem so unreasonable.

review/summary: From burr grinder/french press coffee snob to instant - I'm a convert!
review/text: Over the years I had become a coffee snob.  Went from ground, to organic ground, to organic whole bean with blade grinder, to organic whole bean with burr grinder.  Went from paper filter to gold filter to french press.<br /><br />Then about a year ago I had my cholesterol tested - ouch.  I decided to skip the statin and change my diet.  Coffee is part of that equation.  Here's a quote from the Harvard School of Public Health:<br />"Coffee contains a substance called cafestol that is a potent stimulator of LDL cholesterol levels. Cafestol is found in the oily fraction of coffee, and when you brew coffee with a paper filter, the cafestol gets left behind in the filter. Other methods of coffee preparation, such as the boiled coffee common in Scandinavian countries, French press coffee, or Turkish coffee, are much higher in cafestol. So for people who have high cholesterol levels or who want to prevent having high cholesterol levels, it is better to choose paper filtered coffee or instant coffee..."<br /><br />So, I thought I'd give this a try  (I didn't want to give up the 'organic' snobbery...).  I'm so glad I did.  This coffee is wonderful.  Can I tell the difference with fresh brewed?  Certainly.  But I'd go as far to say I *prefer* this.  It has a 'hot chocolate-like smoothness' that is really appealing.  And it's a snap to make.<br /><br />Btw, a year later my cholesterol is down within normal limits too - all diet changes.  I'll drink to that!

review/summary: Best coffee ever.
review/text: I actually prefer this coffee over almost all brewed fresh coffee. There are a few exceptions when I would be out for brunch and would have an amazingly tasty cup of coffee that beat Mount Hagen's. I keep a jar of this at work and can make a truly delicious cup of coffee on demand with the electric tea kettle rather than running out to get a $2-3 cup elsewhere. I guess the trick with their coffee is in brewing really good coffee and freeze drying it. Simple concept, but others have failed to make any instant that is even in the same league. I probably get 30 normal coffee mug cups of coffee out of a jar. They say 60, but that's 8oz. cups, and maybe not a strong as I would like. So by that measure, it costs me about 25� a cup. If you're trying to save money, I don't know how you could do better.

review/summary: As Good As Brewed
review/text: I read the reviews here and bought a jaw of this at my local grocery. It was very good and I used it on occasions when I ran out of the real stuff or was in a hurry. Lately, I have gotten stale coffee beans from the last 2 really reputable roasters I use so, being ticked off, I decided to play with Mt Hagen's a bit further. I always grind my own beans.<br /><br />Well, I'm here to tell you I have gotten it so that it tastes as good, AND USUALLY BETTER, than any coffee I have tasted or made!!!........I'm serious!! I use the Presto 12 cup percolator , and when the beans are fresh, it makes the best coffee I have ever made ( I have done the French Press, cold brewed, one cup Melitto brewed and just about every thing in between).....mainly, I think, because it has that controlled 195 temperature setting, and does not just flush the grounds with boiling water (nasty!) as most other makers do.<br /><br />That could be the answer to why I now have Mt Hagen tasting so awesome (I do not foresee buying coffee beans in the near future!). Unfortunately, even Mt Hagen recommends using 'boiling water' when you mix their java but I used the water that was heated to just 195 degrees in my Presto (took the percolator stem out, of course....all you do is put the water in, plug it in, and then "PRESTO"...pun intended...perfect 195 degree water!). When I started mixing it this way, it has come out tasting so smooooooooooooth, medium bodied, fresh and downright delicious! Never, ever any aftertaste!!! Granted, it is not as full bodied as a "real" cup of coffee....for this reason, I am sure I will, from time to time, venture back to the real stuff.<br /><br />One other thing....this is strong, rich coffee and I noticed when I put too much instant in the cup, it can be "off" and a tad bit bitter. But, if you use spring or filtered water, get the temperature around 195 to 205 degrees (just off the boil for about 20 to 30 seconds), USE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF COFFEE, I am sure you will have yourself one fine cup of java......at a very cheap price, not to mention mucho convenience!<br /><br />An excellent side note: freeze dried preserves all the nutritional value of the coffee, and this is great news because recent studies have shown coffee to be healthful in so many areas....especially as an antioxidant and brain food.

review/text: I usually drink whole-bean, dark roast organic free-trade coffee, from companies who support their growers and prevent destruction of the habitat in which the coffee is grown. But as others have said, sometimes you are in a hurry, or travelling....I have been appalled at some of the coffees I have found in the complimentary coffee baskets in some hotels and resorts. No better than gas station coffee!<br />  Mount Hagen is organic and has good flavor for instant.<br />You might want to know that most instant coffee is a result from the BIG corporate coffee company's scrape and burn tactics in the rainforest regions, they plant as much coffee as they can, and it is the lowest grade arabica.<br />  This is my choice for instant coffee in a coffee emergency (camping, treavelling or having to dash) and not having to compromise taste or my integrity!

review/text: I have been drinking coffee for a long time. Years ago, I tried pretty much all the instant coffee brands available in the main stream stores. I didn't care for any of them. My husband is a serious coffee lover and would buy a variety of organic coffees: he would grind the beans in the morning, smell their rich aroma and make himself a cup of coffee. I tried all the brands he bought and was always dissatisfied with the slight bitterness that always lingered. He tried to reduce the amount of beans per cup all the way down to 11 grams. And still, I could taste that slight bitterness that I didn't care for.<br /><br />Eventually, I stopped drinking coffee altogether and switched to non caffeinated coffee substitutes made of roasted barley and chicory.<br /><br />Then we went on vacation this summer and my husband bought a jar of Mount Hagen Instant Coffee for convenience in a health food store. It was nothing short of a revelation. It was smooth, tasty and had none of the bitterness I have come to associate with coffee. I drink mine with raw milk and a little sugar and absolutely love it. It also dissolves easily in cold water if you like ice coffee. It is extremely convenient when travelling. As it is, my husband and I like it so much that he has decided to stop buying any other kind of coffee.<br /><br />I seriously doubt you can make 60 cups out of one jar and at $11.99/jar in the health food stores, it is quite pricey.  However, at $8.25/jar at Amazon if you buy the pack of 6, it is more than affordable if you value your coffee. And of course, it is organic coffee and it is the only brand of organic instant coffee available in the U.S. This brand also comes in a decaffeinated variety.

review/summary: Not your average instant coffee.
review/text: This is a huge step above other off the shelf brands. I like to mix a few teaspoons in warm water to dissolve, then add a few ice cubes. While the coffee is cooling, I'll blend a vanilla protein shake. When both are done, pour together with shake and wha-la... protein latte shake with solid coffee taste.<br /><br />The 6 pack ships well and is always packaged with plenty of bubble wrap. I've been using this for about a year and still enjoy the flavor.

review/summary: Delicious - changed the way I drink coffee
review/text: I cannot say enough good things about this coffee.  I was reluctant to switch because of the price, but with Subscribe and Save it comes out to just over $7/jar, which isn't terrible.  I'm now so spoiled that I can't go back to cheaper brands.  It has a rich, complex taste that is special for any coffee, not just instant.  Plus it's so easy to make iced coffee or "lattes" by simply using milk instead of water.  I now prefer the iced "lattes" I make with Mount Hagen to the $4 ones at the coffee shop, so in the end I might actually save money.<br /><br />Cons:  The one teaspoon per cup suggestion is a joke.  I need at least two teaspoons to get that delicious rich taste and to actually wake up.  That means there's more like 30 servings per jar, not 60.  Also, I wish it came in bigger jars.  These jars are tiny and I think we go through one a week.  I feel bad throwing away so many nice glass jars but haven't figured out a way to re-use them.<br /><br />Overall, I can't imagine going back to regular coffee, not just because of the convenience but also because of the taste.

review/text: I've tried all the other instant coffees in Health Food Stores and Mount Hagen Organic is the best.<br />When I serve guests Mount Hagen their comments are very favorable. One friend, who dislikes all instant coffees, after serving them a cup of Mount Hagen, without telling them what I was serving, thought it was one of the best cups of coffee they ever had.<br />The best feature of Mount Hagen is it is Organic as well as being good tasting.

review/text: Excellent coffee. With warmed milk tastes just like a very good Latte. Much better than Starbucks.<br />I have them deliver me a case every three months, a significant savings from retail and never have to fuss with a coffee maker again.<br />However at my first delivery I found one jar broken and the box awash in coffee bits. They cushioned the jars around but not above and below. Major bummer. Do better or I'll have to cancel my standing order.

review/summary: Tastes Freshly Brewed; Can't Beat Amazon's Subscribe & Save Price
review/text: This is a truly delicious Organic instant coffee that tastes as good as freshly brewed.  I drink mine strong, hot, and black, never masking it with sugar or milk, so my palate KNOWS good coffee when it tastes it.<br /><br />This is a VERY good German coffee; not too acidic, not too bland; very smooth.  And the best perk is that there's no perking* at all (*slang for percolating, for you youngsters out there).  Fix it a cup at a time, customized to your preferred strength.  I'd advise getting a little coffee scoop so you can measure precisely; I use a 7.5cc scoop (saved from some bulk powdered supplements)--I use 1-3/4 scoops for my 8 oz cup, while my husband prefers a single scoop for his 12 ounce mug. Have it as you like it.<br /><br />We've shared several cups with friends & visitors and EVERYONE wants to know where they can buy this coffee ("but it doesn't TASTE like instant...").<br /><br />The Decaf is superb, as well, but I sometimes need the "kick" of the real thing, so we buy both.<br /><br />Amazon's Subscribe & Save price is a great value; highly recommended!

review/summary: Great for instant iced coffee.
review/text: I like my coffee iced.  Cold brewing is okay, but takes time.  Instant coffee doesn't dissolve into cold liquid.  Hot brewed coffee can get bitter once it has cooled.  This is the most efficient, economical, and best tasting option I've found for instant iced coffee.  Roughly 16 cents per cup beats the 5 dollars I'd likely spend at a coffee house.  Since it dissolves so well, I may throw a teaspoon of this into my next batch of brownies.

review/summary: Good coffee but I agree with D. Hall!
review/text: The coffee is as good as everyone says but my first order of twelve jars showed up will all but four jars broken.  Amazon's distributer just put the glass jars in a tight cardboard box and shipped it.  I then spent several frustrating minutes on Amazon attempting to find a phone number to call to fix this problem.  I think Amazon tries to hide their number.  Don't believe me?  Try finding it.  My wife actually found it by accident after she asked me why I was swearing?  Once I got ahold of Amazon they could not have been more helpful.  My rep just said; I am sorry Sir.  We will overnight a replacement, no charge.  So the next day the coffee shows up and all but seven jars are broken.  No padding, just glass and box.  How a company that ships packages for a living does this I do not know.  Anyways, I ordered twelve, got eleven then called it a day.  So, good coffee, bad packaging and if you still can't find the number here it is:  1 206 266 2992  Good luck.

review/text: I gave up stove-top espresso making more than 3 years ago.  It was too inconsistent, messy and not particularly satisfying.  As an alternative I picked up Mount Hagen Organic Freeze Dried Instant Coffee while wandering through the organic food section at our local store.  To my surprise, it met my needs - it tasted great and was easy.<br /><br />Our local store was out of Mount Hagen for a long period of time and I tried the new Starbucks instant coffee (Columbian I think).  It was good, even superior to other "instant" coffees.  I even ended up preferring it to their fresh-brewed.  Ultimately though, it was overwhelming and the richness left me feeling queasy.  I realized that Mount Hagen was the only one for me.  I now order it online, making sure to have a well-stocked cupboard so I never run out.

What i didn't know and it doesn't write it anywhere on it's label is that the amount of caffeine in every organic coffee/tea is less than the regular one.

review/summary: If you need instant, give this a try!
review/text: I love coffee - I cold brew Toddy, freshly grind beans for my french press, and make espresso with my own home machine.  The problem is that when my husband and I go overnight hiking I need my daily cup. I've had bad experiences with instant coffee in the past but I decided to give it another try. I went to a local grocery store and picked out this brand, based on the fact that it had the highest price tag and was organic. It may be false logic but I figured if it was the costliest item in the "instant" category it couldn't be awful.  Well, it was way beyond my expectations!  I brew it very strong when hiking (water is precious) by adding a normal amount to an espresso-sized cup.  And it's not half bad!  I even make it at home once in a while by putting it in milk and adding ice to make it nice and cold. Not as good as my Toddy coffee but it works well in a pinch. My only complaint is that it is a bit one-dimensional.  A bit flat and smooth compared a fresh cup of joe.  However it is not unpleasant, and preferable to any other instant I have tried.  It comes sooooo close to the real thing, and I recommend it to anyone in need of instant coffee.

Weight - 3.53 oz....i would welcome a double size like 200 g or more, but, hopefully one day, soon the manufacturer will add a bigger jar! This size is great for simple transfers instead of small plastic zipper bags, coffee stays fresher and crispier. The most important aspect : THE TASTE with a Capital T :-), for me as a person suffering with gastro and acidity issues on a daily basis and stil can't give up on my cup of coffee, i am saying : You are more than welcome, you are my dialy Cup of Coffee Mr. Mount Hagen Organic Coffee!!!!Absolutely no any acidity, no bitter after taste at all, this coffee is very rich and smooth, hot or iced, latte or frapp, however you cut it, better than brewed coffee (my boyfriend cleaned up away even my CoffeeMaker....). Mount Hagen Organic freeze dried instant coffee - a very nice black color and dissolving, rich taste with our without milk, this is my coffee i will follow! Just to mention, i am addicted to my local Starbucks Coffee Shop, but at home or on the go or to share a special family moments and friends chit-chats, forget about Taster's Choice and all the other Supermarkets or Pharmacy Brands....no way! I tasted a lots of coffees, looking for the best ones....guess, i did find it! Actually will go ahead with my instinct :-) Go Mount Hagen!And thanks a lot to another reviewiers for posting their comments, its really very important to share your opinion! Cheers Coffee Lovers!

review/text: Your coffee will taste strong and bitter, but you can still add more water to dilute it to taste like a fresh brewed cup. So when the label of this 3.53 oz. jar says it makes 60 cups believe it. I'm used to whole bean organic coffee made fresh in my grind & brew coffee maker. Honestly if I were blindfolded and the stevia and milk were added, I doubt I'd be able to tell them apart. I'm really pleasantly surprised and grateful since I have 6 jars of this high quality freeze dried organic coffee that tastes GRRREAT! Also at my local organic store it's over 8 bucks a jar, so this is a deal. I bought it mainly for travel purposes and for when my area has hurricane season's electrical outages.

review/summary: There really isn't a better instant coffee
review/text: This coffee is very flavorful, and do not have bitter/acid after-taste. I've tried a least half a dozen different brands of instant coffee, and Mount Hagen is by far the best. This is better than average drip coffee in regular office. When I do not have time/space to make a French press or vacuum pot, this is my choice of coffee.

review/summary: Huh?
review/text: After reading many of the reviews for this instant coffee, I thought I'd try some.  It tastes exactly like every other instant coffee - no better, no worse.  I was expecting more based on the reviews.  I'll keep looking.

review/summary: Mount Hagen Organic Freeze Dried Instant Coffee
review/text: Instant coffee can be good tasting; Mount Hagen has misses the mark.  Mount Hagen tastes like freeze dried coffees of old.  Nescaf&eacute; makes a good tasting dark roast instant coffee, unfortunately it's not organic and won't be any time soon.  Such is life.

review/summary: Nothing Better for a Hot Dog
review/text: I love the Heinz Hot Dog relish.  My husband doesn't understand that it just isn't relish and mustard mixed together and since he doesn't like pickles, he won't try it.  My local stores (in my small town) stopped selling the hot dog relish.  I could not find it anywhere in nearby towns either.  So when I saw it listed on Amazon, I made an immediate purchase!  I had to buy 12 bottles but it won't go to waste.  It was a fantastic deal and worth every penny to me.

review/summary: Love these peanut chews since I was a little girl
review/text: Okay I ordered these directly from the manufacturer in Pa. and found I can get many more much cheaper thru Amazon, so that is what I do now. They are unfortunately very good and extremely habit forming. I am the only one in my household of 2 that eats them since my husband complains that they stick to his teeth. Doesn't matter. Where I go Peanut Chews go!!

review/summary: great asthma reliever
review/text: I purchased this product recently for my teenaged son's recurring asthma--imagine my delight and relief with finally finding something herbal that not only works but works rapidly!  This tea is quick and easy to prepare, relieves chest constriction, opens up the airways, and clears up my son's wheezing. Thank you, Traditional Medicinals, for keeping us out of the doctor's office and steroid free!
