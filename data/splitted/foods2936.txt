review/text: Nature's Path Organic Corn Puffs Cereal, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)<br /><br />This is a simple cereal with no additives, very low on calories and full of flavor, especially having it with fruit. I make a 'smoothie' with 8 oz of frozen fruit (peaches, mangos, strawberries etc.) put the fruit into a blender with 1/2-1 cup of milk, your choice or just a  cup of water. flavor with a packet or two (your preference)of Splenda blend and pour into a bowl of (I use 1 0z of the corn puff cereal) it is a very good breakfast to me. Also I use some sugarfree, calorie free flavored syrups (Torani brand) stawberry or raspberry for additional flavor.<br />So if you choose to you might enjoy this product as much as I do, try it,you just might like it and your body might like it too.

review/summary: Gluten Free, Sugar Free, Natural life!
review/text: Staying on a gluten free, sugar free diet isn't always easy.  These corn puffs aren't only great for breakfast cereal, they are a great snack.  When others are snacking on fatty and sugary foods, those of us who cannot tolerate those food types can pour out a portion of puffed corn and snack on it while watching or competing in the "big game" or taking in a movie or favorite TV program.  This whole grain tastes great by itself, and if you cannot tolerate milk, it has a great flavor "dry" or add your favorite fruit juice.

review/summary: HUGE Xylitol gum
review/text: I have bought a lot of Xylitol gum, usually needing 2 pieces to make 1 gram. This is big gum, 1 piece = 1 gram. Plus it tastes great!<br /><br />My grandson HAD ECC [Early Childhood Caries] all through his baby teeth, $3400 worth of dental work; his mom and I started him on Xylitol a year ago, now he has $300 worth. All of his little cavities have re-mineralized . Unfortunately, he does not "walk;" he bounces, he skips, he runs, jumps, AND TRIPS! He fell and broke his 4 upper front teeth, broke the roots - so they're being extracted!<br /><br />But the Xylitol cleaned up the rest of his teeth, and Xylitol Burst IS GREAT! And GREAT TASTE!

review/summary: Better Alternative to Spry
review/text: As others have noted, the intense flavor quickly fizzles.  However, if you're like me, you buy this gum for the xylitol, not the flavor.  You only need to chew it for about 5 minutes to absorb the xylitol, so it works for me.<br /><br />I made the switch over from Spry gum for one main reason: The XyloBurst did not list titanium dioxide in its ingredient list.  I was concerned about this ingredient after reading that it was potentially carcinogenic.  And Spry uses it for nothing more than a coloring agent.  Why bother with the risk?  Although, to be fair to Spry, I did not notice this ingredient in some of its other flavors/varieties.  I also like the fact that the XyloBurst has exactly 1 gram of xylitol per piece, making it easy to figure whether you've consumed the right amount per day (the Spry has 0.72 grams/piece).

review/summary: VERY strong flavor, but fades fast.
review/text: I just had my first piece of Xyloburst Fruit gum and it was like a flavor explosion, to the point I almost spit it out. It is VERY, very sweet and tastes a lot like one of those colorful gumballs that you can get out of a quarter machine, but the flavor disappears quickly (which is also reminiscent of 25-cent gumballs).<br /><br />If you must have a gum that contains Xylitol, I strongly suggest Trident (Watermelon is a good fruity flavor). I'm not looking forward to finishing off the next 99 pieces of this Xyloburst stuff.

review/text: Of the three flavors of the Big Train brand I have tried--French Vanilla, Hazelnut, and Irish Cream--this is the best. It has a good Irish cream flavor, and is relatively inexpensive in this 3-bottle pack.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Big Train is only slightly less expensive than competing brands, and in general other brands (e.g., Torani) seem to do a better job of producing consistently good flavors.<br /><br />But if your primary flavor of interest is Irish cream, and expense is a concern, I think you will be satisfied with Big Train Irish Cream.

review/summary: Used to be a great drink... Now it tastes like flat 7-UP!
review/text: What once came in a 12oz can, had 70% fruit juice and tasted uniquely refreshing has been unnecessarily transformed into an over-priced, 10.5oz can of flat 7-UP.  The only term I can think of that describes the new version of Knudsen's Mandarin Lime Spritzer is "Whooptie-Doo!"<br /><br />Just for archival purposes, since Knudsen's think they're doing us all a favor by ruining this drink, here's a list of differences between the old tasty drink and the new flat 7-UP version:<br /><br />OLD Mandarin Lime Spritzer Ingredients:<br /><br />* Sparkling Filtered Water<br />* 70% White Grape Juice Concentrate<br />* Natural Flavors<br />* Tangerine Oil<br />* 12oz Can<br /><br />NEW Mandarin Lime Spritzer Ingredients:<br /><br />* Sparkling Filtered Water<br />* 60% White Grape, Lime and Mandarin Juice Concentrates<br />* Natural Flavors<br />* 10.5oz Can<br /><br />For me, the biggest difference is the lack of Tangerine Oil that gave the original version a unique, fresh flavor.  The new version tastes like flat Sprite or Flat 7-UP and is absolutely boring.<br /><br />Additionally, what once came in a 6-pack now comes in an over-priced 4-pack.<br /><br />Less quality, less juice, less flavor and fewer cans for MORE money. What the heck is Knudsen doing?  Why change something like this that wasn't broken in the first place?<br /><br />Hopefully others will reward Knudsen for this kind of self-destructive behavior and stop buying their products.  After all, flat 7-UP is really cheap and easy to make - and still comes in 12oz can 6-packs.

review/summary: This is basically white grape juice with NO FIZZ
review/text: I was disappointed in this spritzer. I wanted a light fizzy citrus juice, not overpoweringly sweet. After I purchased this drink I discovered that the main juice ingredient was white grape, which was not indicated anywhere on the can except in the list of ingredients. I didn't intend to buy white grape juice so it was a bit of a letdown, but I was still willing to give it a chance. When I poured it into a glass over ice I was dismayed to find that there was NO fizz whatsoever. None. That was a deal breaker for me. When the label says spritzer I expect bubbles dammit!  The flavor was also not what I hoped for. I could definitely taste the white grape juice more than orange or lime. What I was wanting and expecting was something like a perrier or pellegrino mixed with orange juice and a little squeeze of lime for bite. This didn't fit the bill at all. This would be good for kids as an alternative to soda or straight juice. It has a flavor more suited to someone who typically drinks white grape or apple juice.

review/text: This is the first I've seen of this size packaging.  Compared to the smaller packaging, this is a better value.  I've purchased the 30 pound box before, which was a great value pricewise, but the candy was somewhat stale tasting to me.  Not the entire box, but some.  I kept it closed, too, to help maintain freshness.  I won't buy the big box again, but I will buy these 7-ounce packs.  Nothing wrong at all with the smaller packs, just a better price per ounce with the 7-oz packs.<br /><br />I know these candies aren't for everyone.  For me, they're perfect.  I have health issues currently that affect my taste buds.  Most everything tastes a little "off" to me and upsets my stomach.  Not these Wonka Chewy Spree, though.<br /><br />However!  There is another "Chewy Spree" product out there that is not made by Wonka, and to my taste buds they are really bad tasting.  The packages look similar, but slightly different, and of course don't say "wonka".

review/text: My daughter exclusively eats Earth's Best jarred baby food. My only complaint with most of the varieties is that the food's consistency is too thin. If I were to feed her the food straight from the jar it would be very messy because the food is just too runny. I usually empty the jar into a bowl, and add two scoops of Earth's Best cereal, mix well, heat in the microwave for fifteen seconds, and then feed it to her. I like the country dinner variety pack because it contains a beef variety, and a pastina flavor. However, I wish it were not more expensive than the regular dinner variety pack. All in all, the runny texture isn't enough to make me stop buying the product, but I do think it could be improved upon a bit.

review/text: Being a self proclaimed 'foodie,' I must admit when it was time for my little girl to start solids, I had done more then my fair share of educating myself on what was the best first food, particularly health wise, taste and nutritional value.  While most books and websites still promote the 'rice cereal' concept, I wanted to go outside of the "box" for her first food since we have been bombarded with info about how 'white foods' offer no substantial nutritional benefit and it just turns into sugars.  I was thrilled when I came across HappyBellies offerings of Oatmeal, Brown Rice Cereal and even a Multigrain version, instead of white rice cereal.  I eat Oatmeal as a daily part of my diet so I was especially thrilled to be able to offer this to my little one.  Not only does it have DHA and Priobiotics to help with her digestion, something the typical rice cereal does not offer, knowing her first types of solids not only provide her with something filling but is healthier and substantiated with vitamins, it truly was a perfect offering for one of my little girl's first foods.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSS7EO">HAPPYBELLIES Organic Baby Cereals, DHA, & Pre & Probiotics +Choline, Organic Oatmeal Cereal,  7-oz.

African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea, a gorgeous pumpkin color when brewed and since it's caffeine free I can drink myself silly before bedtime and it has not kept me up yet. The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.<br /><br />So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away. After a hectic day this is the best calming and tranquil beverage that is not only delicious but also so healthy!<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: Best tea on the market
review/text: My 3 year old has drank this tea since she was about 8 months old.  It's very difficult to find a green tea that is caffeine free and organic.  It's not a true tea since it's not from a tea plant so it's naturally caffeine free.  Numi's teas are high quality, organic, and don't leave all the "dust" in the bottom of your cup. They also make a beautiful "blooming" tea that is spectacular for special occasions.

review/summary: Herbal Alternative to Caffeinated Beverages, A Different Rooibos
review/text: *****<br /><br />Sweet African Green Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a delectable Numi tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and kosher and contains only green rooibos and honeybush. It is from South Africa, made from the same plant as Rooibos (Red Tea), but it is not sun-dried, and it has more anti-oxidants than green tea.  It is also rich in phytoestrogens.  It has a light, smooth, eathy-woody taste.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry.  If you just want a tasty, high-quality rooibos tea, this one does not disappoint.<br /><br />*****

review/text: I grew up on tea.  Mostly black teas and occasionally herbal teas.  I've recently rediscovered tea after many years of drinking coffee and other beverages.  This is my close second favorite, right after Numi Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea.  I can't believe that a beverage with so many health benefits can also taste so great.  I've tried many brands of green tea, and this is a wonderful alternative.  Even though this tea has the natural sweetness of honeybush, I usually add a little honey anyway.

review/summary: Healthy, flavorful tea
review/text: This tea is supposedly the most antioxidant rich you can buy- better than green, white, or regular "red" tea. The flavor is mild, slightly woodsy, and delicious. No need to add sugar or honey. Many in South Africa add milk and sweeten it, which is another option. Can be drunk hot or cold, and doesn't get better when steeped for a very long time. Great buy on Amazon, much cheaper than elsewhere and it's hard to find.

review/text: So I am trying to give up caffeinated beverages but really miss having a cup of green tea so I found myself experimenting with a number of herbal varieties trying to find something that would give me the feeling of a green tea without the caffeine.<br /><br />This has proven to be my favorite by far of all the various types I have tried. It feels very close to a traditional green tea but I know it is packed with more health benefits but more importantly, to me, it tastes like a green tea. This is always the one I reach for first :)

review/text: I don't usually like green tea, because of the grassy taste, but this is pretty good.The grassy taste is very light. It taste more like real tea than rooibos usually does.Matter of fact, I have to remind myself it isn't "real tea". It has a very slight peppery aftertaste. For something that taste like tea, and isn't tea, and isn't bitter like tea can be, this is a really good alternative.

I also added it into sugar cookies making them green tea as well.<br /><br />I ordered this on a Sunday and it was in my possession on Tuesday. I've never had anything ship quite this fast!<br /><br />The only thing is that you get such a small amount for a medium price. You only need to use a small amount at a time though. I think i used two-three tsp at a time.<br /><br />I love the stuff, but want to see if they have it at an Asian market around the burgh for a cheaper price before ordering again. But if not, or if it becomes incontinent i will definitely order from this company without blinking an eyelash.

review/text: I had never tried green tea powder before, but decided to get some after reading some reviews on smoothies and healthy drinks. Since I make about 4 to 5 smoothies a week, I thought this would be a great addition to my different recipes. I was a little surprised at how small the can was when I received it. I don't know why since it is only 1.4 oz which is a fairly small size. It is a bit pricey for the size, but worth the money if you really enjoy green tea or use it as a health enhancer.

These are truly superior in quality and you don't need near as much to get the desired color--which eliminates that bitter flavor you get when adding too much dark coloring to icing.<br /><br />I highly recommend these colors...you won't be disappointed.

The service was fast on delivery though and the company was great at giving me credit for the return of product and the shipping charges.  I rated this item low because of the chemical content.  I know that when the FDA wanted to remove red 3 because it was proven to cause cancer tumors, the Republicans in office would not let them do it.  It is still in our system today.  One of the poisons that the FDA won't remove.  When I asked why.... I kid you not!  A retired FDA person told me it was to control population.  So how many other dyes are out there that are dangerous?  I am sure their are a lot along with the Aspartame group and others I know.

review/summary: imposter product
review/text: My cats have been eating this for several years and up to now-have loved it.  I have purchased this product from pet shops and amazon.  This last shipment from amazon is not the same product as the label claims.  When the can is opened, it initially looks and smells like salmon, but underneath the 1/8 inch of a top layer of the real looking stuff, is something else.  It looks like a wee bit of the real product was sprayed over an imposter product, because it is not the same underneath, nor does it look or smell the same.  My cat vomited with the first feeding.  My cats don't like it now.  they eat the salmon coating and leave the rest.  I want to know where amazon got this batch of cans, because it is not Dick Van Pattens Natural Balance. Someone is duping us and we are paying a high price for a fraud. Identifiers on the bottom of the can are: NBSCP, best by Jan 13 15, the numbers below the sku on the box are: 723633004152.

review/summary: Cat loves it.
review/text: The beast loves this wet food. I was nervous about reordering after reading some of the quality issues in other reviews, so i switched to the Venison flavor. Big mistake. Its a different consistency, and he doesn't like it as much as the salmon. Since i put him on an all Natural Balance diet, his coat has been gorgeous, and he's a very happy boy. Worth the extra cost.

review/text: Have been using for years for multiple cats.  Great because it does not have any corn products.  Cats love the salmon flavor and the duck, chicken did not go over so well in house, and the venison was great at first and then they stopped eating it.  It is a staple in our house, we recommend over some Science Diet and other brands we have tried.

review/summary: Cat requiring limited diet loves this
review/text: I bought this after my vet recommended my cat go on a limited ingredient diet due to some health problems.  We first bought Wellness food from a local pet store.  The Wellness food was really expensive (something like double the price of this Natural Balance food) and my cat didn't even seem to like it much.  My cat is a sea food lover and used to get Fancy Feast seafood in gravy.  She wouldn't eat the pate type soft food at all.  But she seems to love this NB food, we started off giving her a mix of the new and old food and within a couple days she was picking out just the new food and leaving the Fancy Feast behind.  This food is softer looking than typical pate style cat food.  This is more expensive than Fancy Feast, but for my kitty it is now a must and it's less expensive than some of the other options my cat is allowed.  Now I just have to find limited ingredient treat that my cat will actually eat to reward her for taking her medicine.

review/summary: Beware, contains sulfites - not that they make it easy to find out...
review/text: I've been looking for an affordable source of sulfite-free lemon juice since Costco stopped carrying "Italian Volcano" brand locally.<br /><br />This looked like a possible alternative; the amazon price wasn't bad, and it was called "natural".  The ad above does NOT list the ingredients.  And I went to the Sadaf website which ALSO does not list the ingredients. So I wrote their website and asked nicely if it contained sulfites, and after a week I got back a terse reply that said "read the label".  They HAVE a label on their website, but it doesn't have ingredients on it.<br /><br />So I had to dig into googling for research, and I finally found a complaint against their firm (you can find it too, just google "Sadaf Lemon Sulfites") which accused them of falsely using the word "natural" despite the fact that their juice contains sulfites.<br /><br />So despite their being - seemingly - intentionally obscure about this, this product is full of sulfites, and should be avoided by those who are sulfite sensitive.<br /><br />The "Sadaf" people don't make it easy to find this out, and refused to answer me honestly.  My recommendation is to give this product a pass.

review/summary: Small pieces inside - potential hazard
review/text: I can confirm that these bones (by Cadet) have small pieces inside.<br /><br />The outside is fine, but the insides of the two our dog has had so far was composed of lots of narrow irregular strips about 1" wide and 3-6" long which the dog was able to pull out once she chewed through one end of the bone. This is exactly the size of chunk we hope to avoid by giving the dog hard pressed bones like this. Choking or bound intestines are a concern with these bones.<br /><br />On the plus side, the dog apparently LOVES the flavor of these bones. We will probably let her have all of the bones, but we won't leave one out while we're gone. We won't be buying this brand again.<br /><br />If your dog in a "serious chewer" that needs hard pressed bones instead of standard rawhide then these are a poor option.

He and our older lab get to chew these bones for 15-20 minutes every morning.  Each bone last five days.  Our older lab (age 8) finds these too tough to chew so the young one "breaks hers in" for her on day one of the new bone cycle.  I have had no digestive issues with these bones.

The citron and ginger is another great oil.  Wonderful on fish and pasta. These are by far the best I have tasted.  It is extremely hard to find in the USA and although Amazon shipping may be perceived by some as pricey, it is a whole lot cheaper than shipping directly from France!  I highly recommend the A l'Olivier products.  They have been perfecting them since 1822 and it shows!

This olive oil is so good, all of them with herbs, lemon, basil etc etc.. No cholesterol so good for salad, pastas, fishes, etc.. Unfortunately on the web the distributors send this expensive product in several boxes, each time the price of shipping double price. In NYC you find the product at Citarella for about $14. If you use the web the price is more than 100% with shipping. The product is superb, but I think the exclusif distribution take advantage of their position, I advise you not to buy on the web. Too expensive!

review/summary: Excellent AND healthy treat!
review/text: I love the Plato line of products as they allow me to just mindlessly pick from the line and know that I am feeding something good to my dog(s). As for "Smart Dog Snacks" with Ginkgo Biloba and DHA...I'd better watch out, because my dogs love these treats so much that the treats just may make them smart enough to figure out how to open the "treat cabinet" take the container down and unscrew the lid to help themselves!<br /><br />While the treats themselves look like beef jerky, they are made with all natural, organic ingredients. The dogs don't care what's in these treats, they just know they love them. As I am typing this they are both sitting at attention, staring at me and whimpering while trying to do the Jedi Mind Trick of "you want to give us more Smart Dog Snacks, pick up your hand from that keyboard and reach in the container and hand us more. Do it. Do it now."<br /><br />There's so much junk out there and plenty of junk food that claims to be natural (just like people food) but this stuff is the real deal. Much like the food that I feed to the humans in the family, I know what each of the ingredients are and love that the first two ingredients are duck and brown rice. There aren't cost cutting fillers in these treats; it's a straight up high quality product. As an aside, I've bought from the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet many times, and I am always impressed with the products they carry. Just as I know that I can trust the Plato brand, I know that if a product is being carried by The Whole Healthy Pet, then it is a high quality product and I feel like a good parent getting it for my dogs.

review/summary: No Information on Label :(
review/text: I'm giving three stars because when I snapped off a piece my rat terrier/chihuahua loved it...but then, she loves everything!  My spaniel/chihuahua, well, he ate it but not with any enthusiasm.  Kinda played with it a bit.  He's a fickle eater with a sensitive stomach. That's why I am here.  PLATO DID NOT PROVIDE SERVING SIZE INFORMATION ON THE PACKAGE!  Yes, they pat you on the back for taking the time to read their label.  But did they read it before printing?  Clearly you would give a small dog less than a large dog but how much?  I don't know how rich these are and if they'll upset my little ones stomach if I give him a 1/4, 1/2 stick a couple bites?  I have no clue! So I attempt to contact the manufacturer (don't even try to do it from their label because it only has a mailing address!  ARGH!).  This means going online to find them.  After finding a phone number and email address I call.  Ring...ring...ring..ring...ring...ring...no voicemail..no human! ARGH again!  So I resorted to email to ask them what the serving size is. Then receive a return email that it can take up to 3 days for a reply while they make great dog treats.  I believe this since they don't answer even their phones!  The whole office must be chipping in! Unfortunately, I had no choice but to return them not knowing any info on serving sizes.  Thankfully, my pet store will take it back even though it's opened.  If you need servings, contact them first.  All in all, my one dog gives them 5 stars (she's the one who loves it all!) and the other a mere 2 stars.  I give it 0 for not providing the owners the information they need to treat their dog without making them sick :(

review/text: Organic India Tulsi tea is, to me, the absolute best tea I've ever had...both in terms of taste and effects. I have tried several types and have found that I enjoy Chai Masala and India breakfast the most (I enjoy them separately, but also, 1 bag of India breakfast and 1 of bag of Chai Masala makes a perfect iced chai.)<br /><br />Black tea will give most anyone an energy boost, but Tulsi tea is unique to me in that it truly does (as the manufacturers claim) leave one feeling both energized and relaxed (perhaps "centered" or "focused" would be the best word). Tack onto that the purported health benefits of tulsi, and you've got yourself one fantastic tea!<br /><br />There are a number of non-tulsi teas I enjoy, but Organic India's Tulsi Tea is the only tea I purchase on a consistent basis and that I always have on hand. Also, it is the one type of tea I am frequently recommending to friends and family. Give it a try!

review/summary: coffee pods
review/text: For me, hands down the best coffee I ever had in my Senseo. A bit pricy but outstanding flavor. I am happy to have coffee in little filter pods and not plastic cups like other coffee makers.
