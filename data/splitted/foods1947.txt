review/summary: Just what I was looking for
review/text: I received the gum today and like it better than I had expected to.<br /><br />I only chew 1 piece at a time (the serving size on the box says "2 pieces" and many customers who have rated it under other listings on amazon have said they chew 2 pieces at once) but it is big enough for my purposes.<br /><br />Also, I chew it only for about 15 minutes and the flavor lasts with no problem at all.<br /><br />I mainly wanted this specific gum because of the high percentage of xylitol it contains (because xylitol is good for the health of teeth) and because of its LACK of other stuff (which is in almost all other types of gum) that I don't want like aspartame (nutrasweet), saccharin, sorbitol, mannitol, artificial flavors, artificial colors, etc.<br /><br />---<br />A few years ago I tried two brands of "natural" gum that didn't have any of those ingredients I'm trying to avoid, but they were awful - fell apart in the mouth, tasted bad, contained sugar, etc.<br /><br />So I grudgingly went back to chewing Orbit with xylitol because my dentist told me to chew gum for the sake of my teeth, even though in all other ways I scrupulously avoid aspartame etc.  I limited myself to one piece a day of Orbit because I didn't really want to be ingesting the unwanted stuff.<br /><br />Therefore, I'm really pleased to have found this gum this week.  Because it has the right blend of ingredients for me, even if the flavor had been nonexistent, I would have been happy with it, so I'm extra-pleased that there is a nice mint flavor and that it does last for at least 15 minutes (I only want to chew it for that length of time, so I didn't try it for longer).<br /><br />---<br />Note that this gum is manufactured in Finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood [also, it's non-GMO (not genetically modified)], which is not the case with some other up-and-coming brands of xylitol gum, which source their xylitol from China and/or from corn.<br /><br />---<br />Apparently if the mouth has 5 exposures to xylitol a day, its health improves greatly after only a few weeks.<br /><br />(My main concern is to reinforce the enamel of my teeth as much as possible, because they have been sensitive for years and the sensitivity is getting worse with age.)<br /><br />To that end, I'm going to order a 16-ounce package of xylitol crystals/powder soon (I found a cheaper offer on another site than I did here) and mix a little of the powder with water each day in a jar and swish the solution around my mouth a couple of times a day, so I can extend the lifespan of my stock of this expensive gum by chewing it just once or twice a day.<br /><br />If you want to avoid xylitol from China and/or from corn, also take care when purchasing the crystals/powder in either 16-ounce packages or small single-serving packages - I found very few brands that get their xylitol from birch.

review/text: Great item. No 'bad' ingredients. Other companies that try to be natural use "Titanium Dioxide" as a colorant.  Titanium Dioxide in powder form has been linked to lung cancer. Also this product in NOT made in China like other similiar competitors.<br /><br />Yes its expensive, but you have to pay for the good stuff! The cheap stuff is cheap for a reason!<br /><br />Buy and enjoy this quality item! I am buying my 3rd order right now.

review/summary: best xylitol gum I've tried
review/text: I've tried several brands of xylitol gum, because I do not want to chew other sugar free gums with all the additives.  While all the xylitol gums I've tried do not hold they're flavor as long as the sugar-free gums on the market, this brand holds it's flavor the longest.  It also does not get hard, it stays soft for a good while, too.  Actually, it starts to get too soft for me - that's when I toss it, hours later.  I usually chew 1 1/2 pieces; one piece seems too small and two pieces seem too big.  I am overall very happy with this gum.

review/summary: healthy, tasty, better than spry
review/text: I bought spry gum because it was cheaper. Well, it tasted okay, but it was nothing spectacular. The worst part, it was made in China and imported. I found Xylichew and ordered it. Wow! Xylichew has a much stronger, fresher taste that lasts longer. Xylichew does not get mushy and stringy after chewing for an extended period of time. Xylichew is not made in China. I feel that Xylichew is worth the extra money. I chew it faithfully after every meal and usually several times a day because I love the taste. I used subscribe and save and I have it sent to me monthly. Highly recommend Xylichew!!!!!

review/summary: Minty, Fresh, Last a Long Time
review/text: Xylichew Peppermint gum is a pretty outstanding gum--I keep one of the jars at work, and the other at home, often chewing them after snacks & meals, particularly when brushing is inconvenient.  The pieces are a good size (not overwhelmingly large) but manage to keep flavor for a long time--in part because of xylitol's cooling effects.  Most research indicates that chewing 4 or more pieces per day reduces the likelihood of cavities.

review/summary: not so natural, and not as much Xylitol
review/text: I was excited about it since it's from Finland, and they'va used Xylitol much longer than we did in the US. Well, actually native Americans used it too..., never mind ;). But, I was disappointed because:<br />1. it has glycerine, which is not good for teeth. google it if you want. other brands (I've tried 4 so far) don't have that.<br />2. a bit misleading labelling: they had the serving size = 2 gums, unlike other products. so, when you read 1.6 g of Xylitol, it's only 0.8 per gum. You can do better than that.<br /><br />I'm going back to another brand with higher Xylitol per gum, and no glycerine, for sure.

review/summary: Great tasting, high protein cereal
review/text: This cereal is all-natural, with no preservatives or transfats. And it tastes good! The protein comes mostly from soy. The main grains are corn and rice flour. I wish that it had brown rice flour instead, though. Here's the ingredient list:<br /><br />soy Protein Isolate, Yellow Corn Flour, Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Inulin, Pea Fiber, Natural Honey, Evaporated Cane Juice, Dehydrated Apple Pieces, Canola Oil, Cinnamon Powder, Vanilla Extract, Natural Flavoring, Baking Powder, Double-Acting Leavening Agents, Salt.<br /><br />I appreciate the fact that it is low in sugar. There's no high-fructose corn syrup, either. Here's the nutritional information:<br /><br />Serving Size  1 oz (Approx. 1/2 Cup)<br />Calories  100<br />Carbs  15g<br />Fat  1.5g<br />Fiber  3g<br />Sugar  3g<br />Protein  9g<br />Weight Watchers Points  1<br /><br />This is a very good cereal at a very good price, especially with the 20% off special. I think that you will enjoy Kay's Apple Cinnamon Protein Cereal. Especially if you are a cereal lover like I am. And even if your name isn't "Kay" like mine is!<br /><br />Recommend.

review/text: I love this cereal, and even my partner, who isn't much of a cereal eater, does too.  For breakfast I like to mix it with a cereal that isn't sweet at all because it's a little too sweet alone with milk.  It's perfect as a snack all by itself, though.  So many of the gluten-free cereals lack a solid amount of protein.  This one is an exception that also tastes fantastic.

I had a hard time trying to find chewies that were long lasting.  The bully sticks are great.  They last a very long time and she can't get big chunks so there is no risk of obstruction.  In Petsmart you will pay $14.99 for six of them.  Absolutely ridiculous!  So glad I found them here!  Oh, one small drawback...they are a little stinky.  They have a slight barn yard smell to them, kinda similar to the cow hooves.  But they keep her occupied for hours, so I can easily overlook that.

review/summary: AMAZING for LAB with Sensitive Digestive System
review/text: We have a Silver Lab who at 1 year old turned out to have a VERY sensitive digestive system -  like the dog version of IBS or Crohn's.  (perfectly health- except for this)  The ZEAL is a God-Send! All the symptoms vanished and our Labrador is his usual adorable,  playful, strong, smart self.  With our Vet's advice, we have had him on an elimination diet - as one would do for a human in the same circumstances.<br />We keep the food in a tight container and there is no fish smell. Of course there is slightly when you rehydrate it, because it's FISH based- LOL.  Better wild caught fish than chemicals and  unhealthy cheap food - for dogs or anyone.  I expect fish smell when I cook fish for us, so that's how it goes.<br /><br />Some pets (& humans) seem to have sensitivities and it is a great day when a PERFECT-4-US product/food plan  is found.  So this amazingly healthy food has our Labrador in Olympic-Good-Health. I give it every possible star. It is also good to know that the company has trial portions and you can phone them and ask for sample sizes  to see if your dog enjoys the food. That's how we started.

review/summary: AMAZING PRODUCT!
review/text: I started feeding my dog Zeal at the reco of my local pet store Maxwell Dog, and i just can not believe the difference in only a month.  His allergies are GONE.  His stomach problems that no vet could figure out, GONE.  He used to spend hours gnawing his paws, after a week on zeal he has completely stopped.  His coat is better than ever, and he's trimmed up and become more active.  I have now started my other dog on it as well, and she is also thriving on it.  Her coat is softer than ever.  They just LOVE this food, and i am just in complete shock at what a difference it has made in such a short time.  I really love how on the Honest Kitchen website they list every source for all ingredients.  Esp with all the chicken worries, it makes me feel safe knowing this company is so upfront and conscious.  Yes, it's pricey.  But for me, worth every penny.  Thanks for making such an excellent product for my babies :)

review/text: Mix this food with h20 and done.  I add hot water to the mix, place in refrigerator and it's ready within a couple of hours.  The dogs LOVE the fish flavor.  I was concerned my house would smell like fish, but once the bowls are licked clean, it really isn't bad.  My male has lost over 10 lbs eating this type of food.

review/summary: Best Food For Dogs with Sensitive Tummys
review/text: After trying multiple kibble over the past 7 years, multiple visits to the vet, thousands of dollars of tests, drugs and hospital visits, I think we FINALLY found a food my sensitive Keeshond can eat, love and thrive on.  Thank you for making this food available.  He LOVES this food.  Although his breath is very FISHY, it is a small cost to pay for eliminating the pain he had to suffer before.

review/summary: The Smell of the Fish
review/text: I had to write this because I was concerned about the smell others had been talking about. Well to my nose there is no smell ... at all! Well maybe a bit of something but it is all good. My dog loves it. And finally Honest Kitchen made the ziplock bag enclosure. Also, my Cairn Terrier has had skin problems forever, all his life and he is going on 14. Since being on HC the last few months with another of their products he is not itching. So do not be afraid to try the product because of the perceived fish smell. I feel so much better about feeding him this product instead of even the best quality kibble. I did the raw thing for years and he had itching then and the coat looked bad.

review/summary: Wonderful product, but reeks!
review/text: I have used honest kitchen for years and love it.  When the fish version came out I was excited to try it.  I am sure the product is just as wonderful as the other HK products, however the smell is VERY strong.  The dogs reek of fish, the closet where I keep the food INSIDE A SEALED BAG reeks of fish....not a good thing.  I regularly feed tripe, which has an incredibly strong odor however the odor is gone as soon as the food is eaten...not this product....the smell seems to stay forever and I purchased a 10 lb box which seems to be lasting forever &lt;grin>.<br /><br />My dogs love it and I am sure it is an incredible product....just brace yourself for the smell.

review/summary: Sauce not bad; noodles mushy
review/text: I decided to take a risk in ordering this product, since I've been wanting to stock my pantry with some of these kinds of foods both for emergency backup and in case I just don't feel like either cooking or going out.<br /><br />It's better than I anticipated.  I think that the sauce/seasonings are not bad, reminding me of the Stouffer's frozen dinner.  The noodles come out too mushy using the microwave method, so I will try the stovetop method to see if that gives a better result.<br /><br />You get a box with a can of sauce with beef; a packet of dry seasoning mix; and a packet of dry noodles.  Mix all together with water and some milk, and cook (microwave about 35 minutes; there is also a stovetop prep option).<br /><br />I believe you could substitute water for the milk if you didn't have any.  This product also lends itself to doctoring, for example adding a can of mushrooms, or some sour cream.  Another plus is that it doesn't taste overly salty.<br /><br />I plan to try making this with different noodles (I'll just keep the provided noodles for my emergency kit).

Coombs is the winner for us.  Brown Family's was good - but Coombs had a bit stronger of a maple flavor.  Taste is definitely personal - but comparing them side by side with the same pancakes - Coombs had more flavor and next to it, Brown Family didn't seem flavorful at all.  This is still better than all the 'fake' syrups though!  We will finish the bottle, but will be reordering Coombs.

review/text: I guess I'm in the minority in saying that I love the large size of this product :)  I normally would make 2 "servings" as described on box of oatmeal - or two packets from a box -- so this product is perfect sizing for me! 320 calories doesn't seem like an overly large calorie amount either.  Even if you were a smaller person and only consuming 1200 calories a day, this would only be 1/4 of your daily calorie needs, and a very healthy 1/4 of your calories it would be.<br /><br />This is lightweight and easy to throw in a bag and bring to work - just add boiling water, or add tap water and microwave and let steep.<br /><br />I like the occasional sweetness of the cranberries and the occasional crunch of the almonds.  It's pleasant without being too sweet.  It's also got 8 grams of fiber in a cup.<br /><br />If you're trying to decide between flavors, I found this tastier than the hot apple cinnamon variety cereal from McDougall.

I often slave over steel-cut varieties, because all of the instant stuff seems to be mushy and lacking in texture and taste.<br /><br />This is the exception. The oatmeal is thick and has a great texture, and it is chock-full of delicious, real cranberries.<br /><br />The only thing is there are over 300 calories per cup! I don't think that the ingredients of the oatmeal are to blame; it's because the portion it makes is pretty big! However, if you are not counting calories or if you need a filling breakfast, you'll love this.

review/text: I really like this hot cereal;it's not too sweet or mushy. It has dried cranberries and  3 or 4 almond slivers thrown in. My only complaint is the portion size. It seems like a ridiculous amount of food for one person. I usually eat half and end up throwing the other half away. It's a waste. I thought about saving it ,but that would defeat the whole purpose of a "convenient breakfast". I realize everyone has different appetites and caloric needs. perhaps a 6 foot tall man would find this portion perfect, but for a five and a half foot woman, it seems too much. I wish McDougall's would keep that in mind, and consider bringing back the small sizes as well, so we could have a choice.

I understand also that this is 3.1 ounces of organic oatmeal vs. the competitor's 1.9 ounces. Overall, I think you'll be satisfied with the taste of the mixture of dried cranberries and oats.

review/summary: Coconutty
review/text: So the aroma in dry form was a bit MEH ... it smelled like suntan lotion.<br />HOWEVER once prepared it is VERY good so just either get past the aroma or don't sniff it not that it easy to ignore any matcha smell as the powder sort of makes its way into the nose no matter what ya do!<br /><br />My daughter and I got distracted singing "Put the lime in the coconut ..." haha now you are all going to be singing that in your heads ....THE POINT however is in messing around I dumped the powder into my cup instead of my mixing bowl. YIKEs I thought I had made a huge mistake but I just went ahead and added straight milk to it - NO WATER!!!<br />Can you believe it - this stuff is GOOD! Coconut MILK hahah. I am sure you can pull this off with any milk product or almond, soy etc.. HEY maybe even COCONUT milk!<br />Oh and you know how I said sangria frothed up well?? WELL ... This frothed up SUPER easy! HUGE foam! I may have to try doing more of my matcha this way - just skipping the water all together! Now this is what I call a HAPPY accident!<br />SO SO SO YUMMY!

review/summary: A Tropical Dream
review/text: This matcha kind of snuck up on me. At first, I wasn't sure if it was very coconut-y, and I was just sipping away. At the end of the cup, I found myself wanting so much more. It is SO coconut-y, which is funny since I found myself kind of going "where's the coconut?" at first. It's not a toasted, bake-y coconut, but a fresh young coconut taste. If I didn't know better, I would swear this was made with coconut milk instead of water!<br /><br />This is really a tropical vacation in a cup. Sweet, creamy, super fresh coconut flavor! It is the perfect combination with matcha, one of my absolute favorite flavors so far.

review/summary: Coconut + Matcha = Delicious!
review/text: I love tea, and Matcha is one of my favorites.  It is not only delicious, but it is very healthy and I notice a significant surge of energy pumping through me after I drink it.  So, I love it when I find new and exciting flavors of Matcha - and Red Leaf Tea seems to be THE PLACE to get the newest and most exciting flavors available!<br /><br />This coconut matcha is really good.  I notice that my first couple of sips were not quite as enjoyable as my subsequent sips ... I guess my palate needed to acclimate to it ... but now that it has it is difficult to stop drinking it long enough to type in my thoughts about it.<br /><br />The coconut melds beautifully with the sweet flavor of the matcha.  Both are creamy, sweet flavors and together they create something that is beyond creamy and sweet ... it's absolutely scrumptious!

review/summary: Extremely Pleased
review/text: I got these as a gift for my birthday a year ago, being a total gummibear fanatic. When I got these gummibears, I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I felt how soft they were. I am not a big fan of Haribo because of the fact that their gummibears are rather chewy and tough, in my opinion, as well as the flavors tend to taste fake and do not have individual flavors. This being said, I am not a fan of Haribo, thus I am more likely to enjoy the Albanese.<br /><br />When I started eating the gummibears, it was like a dam broke. I entered Gummibear Fiend-dom. I do not know why people keep saying that they have a soapy flavor, or that their flavors are less intense than other gummies, I did not have that problem at all. The flavors are strong and bursting, and very individual per bear. The flavors also taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like, rather than the wax-y fake flavor most are used to.<br /><br />Another extreme bonus in my opinon, was the blue raspberry gummibear, seeing as my favorite flavor for candy is blue. Which became a huge hit with all of my friends, I had to start saying 'no' to sharing because of how much they loved them. Since then, I have bought them for myself just this year, and the only disappointment I've had, is that they've run out so quickly. Their addictiveness is apparent to me though. Since I've shared them, 2 of my friends have purchased the gummibears themselves, and several are talking about getting them. I cannot eat and enjoy any other type of gummibear and enjoy them since these.<br /><br />And I didn't even mention the price.

review/summary: Slightly disappointing compared to Haribo bears in flavor and consistency
review/text: I'd ordered the 9lbs of Albanese sour gummi worms before and liked them a lot, so I decided to try the Albanese gummi bears as well. I've been a die hard Haribo fan for a while, but the hardness and ease at which they go stale was getting to me. Thus, I was quite excited by the promise of Albanese!<br /><br />But, why just 3 stars? Flavor and consistency. Somehow the flavor isn't as juicy, and doesn't burst in your mouth the same way. Some of the 12 flavors are better at this than others, but I was overall mixed. The consistency was also *too* soft for my liking, it's similar to the off-brand gummi bears you can get at the supermarket. I want something in between; not the sticky hardness of Haribo that I always have to pick out of my teeth, and not the plush softness of Albanese.<br /><br />Somehow, Albanese are harder to eat in quantity too. I found myself getting overwhelmed after my first few handfuls by the sugary aftertaste, almost nauseatingly so. Maybe I just need to pace better, but I've never had a problem shoveling down Haribo.<br /><br />Anyway, it's back to Haribo for me. I unfortunately have to eat another 9lbs of Albanese first.

review/summary: Very Impressed
review/text: My first taste of gummi bears was while living in Germany. Black Forest were the only ones I knew until today.<br /><br />Admittedly, the price was what swayed me to order after having gotten a deal alert about Black Forest. I was a bit concerned about the negatives i'd read, but as with many other things, taste is subjective, so I went by the majority and so glad I did.<br /><br />My batch was delivered in 90 degree weather and they are still fresh, soft/chewie (which I, unlike some, enjoy), and fruity. I am able to tell each individual flavor. My favorite being the pineapple. While I see there is oil listed as an ingredient to keep them from sticking, I can't detect any greasy feel or flavor even after squeezing with a paper towel. There is no chemical aftertaste or smell that others say they experienced. The citric acid content may be a bit higher than Black Forest, but again, I like it. After eating a good sized handful, I'm left with the same kind of "mouth-feel" I would get from eating a good portion of pineapple, further enhancing the idea that i'm eating fruit and not just sugar candy.<br /><br />I will highly recommend these!

review/text: I was very interested in trying these gummi bears after seeing many great reviews and even some reviews saying that these were better than Haribo. Haribo is by far my favorite gummi bear and these Albanese gummis didn't compare favorably to me. I liked them just not as much as Haribo. The flavors are interesting and some of them really taste like the actual fruit. These gummis are priced well so they're defnitely worth trying out on your own, but I think I'll be sticking to Haribo.

review/text: These are about as good a gummi bear as you will get. The flavor is sweet and tart, the texture perfect. I'd give 5 stars but for the fact that Amazon offered these on my SUGAR FREE search, and I bought them without noticing that they are regular full sugar. They are "fat free" but all the gummi everythings are fat free. I ate and enjoyed them for days before I noticed my blood sugar was out of bounds... and a more careful read of the label shows they are NOT sugar free. No, the description never says hey are sugar free... it's my fault for trusting the results on my search here using keywords SUGAR FREE CANDY and not reading carefully.

review/text: It is true that there are 12 flavors, and it's true that they're cheaper than Haribo, and it's true that everyone's taste buds are different, but I wasn't satisfied by the taste and texture of these. You can really chomp on Haribo Gold Bears, and there's something about that fact that I find extremely satisfying. These are a cheaper alternative, but to me, they do taste cheaper.<br /><br />Honestly, though, they're not bad, so if you're tiring of your Gold Bears and you need an alternative, these are probably your bears. Though I'm guessing they'll most likely just convince you to stick to Haribo. Those Gold Bears really do earn their "Gold"-ness.

I admit that the soft, chewy texture is nice. However, the flavor is so off and artificial you almost feel as though you're eating a non-edible item, like a scented eraser.
