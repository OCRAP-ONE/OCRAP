review/summary: Delicious and satisfying
review/text: They come well packaged for shipping, and because they are individually wrapped they don't break and stay fresh for a long time.  The Cioccolati are my favorite for their delicate almondy taste and the rich dark chocolate coating.<br /><br />I've tried a LOT of biscotti from different places like Whole Foods, coffee houses, bakeries, and more.  This is by far the best, especially for dunking in coffee.  Unlike all other biscotti, I never have a problem with these rather large biscotti falling apart.  I can dunk and wait for the last drops to fall before taking a bite and I don't get the end of it falling off and plunking into my coffee to become a sodden mess.  And the coating becomes a delicious liquid chocolate.<br /><br />Compare these to the vanilla and almond biscotti at Starbucks, which always taste like they're weeks old despite being individually wrapped.  Nonni's does it right!

review/text: What a morning treat!  The best way to eat these is to dunk them in coffee.  Nonni is the Italian word for Grandmother.  These biscoti's are made just like in Italy.  They are twice baked to make them extra crunchy.  We like the plain, the cioccolati, and the carmel pecan ones.

review/summary: Sinful, delightful--a real treat
review/text: Eating a Nonni's Cioccolati Biscotti makes me feel as if I'm in a TV commercial. They are crunchy, tasty and best of all dark chocolaty; and, you don't feel like your teeth are going to break because they are tender at the same time having that delightful crunch.  Did I mention they are about twice the size of a regular biscotti?  Now my only problem is whether or not I can eat them all before they become stale!  Oh, yeh, that's why I buy that expensive Tassimo coffee!

review/summary: Okay but not Cake Mate
review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

Only gripes: the "partially-hydrogenated" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy-taste.  My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann

review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/text: I'm very pleased with the tea. It smells and tastes organic and pure.<br /><br />The only problem I have is with the packaging. When I received the product the box was banged up and appeared to be old. But what bothered me was that the tea bags themselves looked old and flimsy. The tea bags are individually wrapped but when you unwrap them they almost fall apart. The bag material is really thin and frail and it barely holds its content inside. The bag only broke in two or three instances out of fifty but I had to be careful with them. Other than that, I loved drinking this tea.

review/text: It always seems that when you find something you really like it soon will disappear off the market.  I bought this at Costco first and used it on grilled meats.  After the grilling season it was not carried anymore.  Then the next year it did not come back Weber had other spices but not the Six Pepper Fusion variety.  I searched the web but all sites where it was listed were sold out. I continued to search periodically until recently the item appeared on Amazon.  There were only three (3), left in packs of three (3).  So I ordered two (2), leaving one.  I am enjoying grilling with it again.  I guess I will have to reverse engineer the product and make it myself before I run out again.

Since returning to the United States, it has been IMPOSSIBLE to find! Yes, plenty of the poor tasting low-fat varieties are in every supermarket - but no full cream anywhere!<br /><br />Some months ago, PEAK Dry Whole Milk became available through internet suppliers. Four cans were ordered and enjoyed. The milk has the fine full taste of European dairy products.<br /><br />BEST USE: put powder directly in tea or coffee. Makes your morning brew rich and creamy!<br /><br />Hope Amazon will also offer the smaller cans which are more convenient for travel.

review/text: Powder mixes easily when shaken; I found adding more than the recommended 3 tablespoons per 8 ounce of water gave milk a "milkier" taste and helped disguise the dry powder milk flavor you often find in dry milk products.  Best powdered milk I've ever drunk.  When more powder is added to water than recommended on the label (maybe twice as much), and milk is allowed to chill, reconstituted milk tastes very similar to fresh milk, with minimal dry powder milk after-taste.  Highly recommend.  Though wish it were less expensive, would buy again. In disaster preparation and long term food storage, it's nice to have foods/beverages you actually enjoy eating/drinking, rather than just any old thing.

My first glass of this milk acted like a probiotic. Milk I had as a child which I had gotten away from.  My food settled down where it supposed to go after my first glass of this milk.  I was so happy with this powdered milk that I would recommend it to anyone. Throw out the lactose milk and get good quality milk. True, it is expensive, but it is worth the cost.  The feeling of not being bloated, not drinking milk with additives and preservatives, knowing that it is nutritious, that the milk comes from the best dairy country, thrills me greatly. I have wasted too many years in getting the best product from Amazon.  This product has my highest recommendations.

review/text: Frankly, I don't care if food is organic, or non-organic, or natural, or whatever. I like food that tastes good. And while I recognize that cookies aren't really "food", in the sense that they're a desert -- and certainly not something you turn to if you're looking for your basic nutrition, I find these particular cookies to be totally AWESOME. I like my oatmeal raisin cookies soft, and that's what these are. Soft, sweet, chewy, superb. I wouldn't mind if they were a smidgeon cheaper, but I would imagine making them organic adds to the cost -- so I blame you danged hippies with your granola-crunchy desire for kumbaya soul harmony when it comes to the sticker shock. Still, they're good enough they're worth it. They'll probably negatively impact my waistline, but as I'm not a believer in reincarnation, I figure I got one shot at existence. May as well take the time to stop and gorge on the cookies.<br /><br />The delicious, delicious cookies.

review/text: If you want a cookie that has that homemade, old-fashioned taste, Country Choice organic oatmeal raisin cookies will fit the bill.  They are rather pricey, but you do get what you pay for.  These cookies are individually wrapped and that makes it handy to put them in a lunchbox, backpack, or any portable bag.  They are quite soft so you can't expect them to be in one piece if you pack them with solid items like an apple.<br /><br />These cookies are small at just under 3" in diameter, so don't expect you are getting a box of giant sized cookies.  They are great for people who are trying to watch what they eat or are perfect for small hands.  I'll list the ingredients below for people who have special dietary needs or allergies.  All the nutritional facts for this product are on the company website.<br /><br />NOTE:  These cookies do contain egg, soy and coconut ingredients and are "Manufactured on shared equipment with milk, wheat, peanut and other tree nut containing products."<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Organic Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Organic Sugar, Organic Raisins, Organic Cane Syrup, Water, Organic Whole Grain Oat Flour, Organic High Oleic Sunflower and/or Safflower Oil, Organic Brown Rice Flour, Organic Honey, Organic Coconut, Organic Whole Eggs, Leavening (Baking Soda, Monocalcium Phosphate), Corn Starch, Sea Salt, Organic Vanilla Extract, Soy Lecithin, Guar Gum, Organic Cinnamon

Their prices are good, but I think Amazon has them beat for the Oatmeal Raisin cookies.<br /><br />These cookies are individually wrapped. One cookie is a serving, at about 100 cals.<br /><br />I like that the cookie is soft, and the raisins are soft and still moist.<br /><br />I really like that the ingredients are organic.<br /><br />They're good tasting to me, not too sweet, not too anything. Just right.<br /><br />Along with their Vanilla Wafers, and Trader Joes' Almond Windmill cookies (and lately, their Southern Style Pecan cookies), these are definitely in my Top 5 Cookie list.<br /><br />Give them a try by buying a single box locally ... then come back and get the mega pack from Amazon.

review/summary: The best yet!
review/text: These are the best organic oatmeal cookies I've been able to find.  I've been getting Mrs. Denson's for years, but they have raisins, without which I can do, and they're very good when they're not too crisp.  But I just saw these at Amazon, and decided to take a chance and give them a try.  I'm delighted with them.  They really are soft, not crunchy, they don't have any raisins, and they're packaged in individual sealed packets.  I've got a new standard cookie!

review/summary: Worst. Cookies. EVER.  *****review for Double Fudge Brownie flavor*****
review/text: I actually feel awful giving a bad review to a product manufactured by a company that might be a small, independent operation, but... dang, these are bad.  I checked the label before purchasing them b/c while I am all for the idea of organic, I did not want some crazy gluten-free, vegan, tasteless, saw dust biscuit.  These were neither gluten-free nor vegan, passing the test with real ingredients like whole eggs, flour and real chocolate.  I figured I was in for a treat.  WRONG.  Unfortunately, they are dry (even though they're "soft baked"), and flavorless.  They have that very specific, cardboard, non-flavor that you get with weirdo hippie-food.  (Nothing against weirdo hippies - they're great - it's just that sometimes their packaged food sucks.)<br /><br />Bottom line... if I'm going to indulge, I'd rather eat crappy cookies filed with unpronounceable sludge from some evil multinational.  Truth is, sometimes hydrogenated & high-fructose tastes better.<br /><br />P.S.  Despite the large photo on the large box, the cookies are quite small.  About 30% smaller than pictured.  Not cool.

review/summary: Finally!
review/text: I really like this cookie. First of all, there is nothing in the cookie that I don't feel comfortable eating. The majority of the ingredients are organic. The taste is sweet, but not overly done. I have the oatmeal chocolate chip and it really fits the bill as a good snack. At 100 calories - its just right.<br />Now, this isn't a meal replacement - it is kind of small so it won't fill you up. But the taste is really good and you can feel good eating it.  Not as sweet as many oatmeal cookies that you find, but you can definitely taste oatmeal and chocolate! I have these on SS. I think they are a good deal for the quality of the ingredients.<br /><br />Ingredient list:<br />Organic whole rolled oats, organic sugar, organic dark chocolate chips, water, organic high oleic sunflower oil, organic honey, organic brown rice flour, organic whole eggs, leavening, organic corn starch, sea salt, organic vanilla extract, guar gum, soy lecithin, organic cinnamon.<br /><br />100 calories<br />4 g fat<br />15 g carbohydrate<br />1 g fiber<br />8 g sugar<br />1 g protein

review/summary: BEST CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
review/text: In my opinion, these chocolate chip cookies are, by far, the best-tasting cookies I've ever eaten!  They're the only cookies I buy. I really like the soft texture of the cookies, the oatmeal flavor, and the melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness of the plentiful chocolate chips.  In addition, they're made with organic products and they are relatively low in calories (100 for a 23 gram cookie) and saturated fats (only 1 gram per cookie).  My suggestion is to try just one and see if you can resist having another  { : > )

review/summary: This is NOT smoked salt!
review/text: This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again. It is a 2 pound bag of white salt that has a fake hickory smell. It is small crystals, about the size of table salt crystals. My guess is that they tried to infuse flavor into the salt rather than smoking it. The hickory flavor is very faint, and very fake tasting. You are much better off buying real smoked salt, such as Gourmet Hickory Smoked Sea Salt by The Spice Lab Inc. I am not in any way affiliated with The Spice Lab - I bought their salt simultaneously with Faerie's Finest in order to compare the two. Not only is it inferior to The Spice Lab, but Faerie's Finest is the worst smoked salt I have tasted.

review/summary: Endangered Species Zebra, Organic Dark (70%) Chocolate Tangerine Essence
review/text: Its now changed to orange essence and you can really taste the orange, it over powers the dark chocolate flavor making the combination not so great.  One small bite is ok, but a whole bar just makes me sick, even just eating a little square is too stronge for me, but then again thats me.  I love orange and chocolate, they go so great together but this one is just overpowering and doesnt work for me.  My favorite by The endangered species bars is the dark chocolate deep forest mint, that is the best so I would go with that one but stay clear from this one unless you like a very strong orange flavor that overpowers the dark chocolate.  I like just a little bit of essence of fruit or some other flavor in my chocolate but this one just doesnt please my taste buds.

review/text: First let me say I am a huge fan of endangered species chocolate.  This is my first time however trying this particular mixture.  I love orange and chocolate as a combination but this one definitely falls short.  Unfortunately from what I can gather and the type of bitterness it is I am guessing they add too much of the pith while creating the orange oil.  It has a smooth delightful start but the more you eat the more pronounced the bitter taste becomes.  I am disappointed by the purchase and will not order this type again.

Considering this is direct from the manufacturer themselves, you'd think the price would be something reasonable.<br /><br />As for the juice, it's quite delicious, and I try to have several glasses a week.

review/text: Born in Italy - my parents drank this often after dinner. I do not like black licorice, but like this drink. It's smooth and does burn a bit going down but gives your belly a nice warm feeling after the first, second, etc. Haha. A great (and Italian) way to drink it is to get coffee beans and put 1-2 in with the shot, light it on fire, blow it out (essential part here! LOL) then drink the shot and chew the coffee beans. It tames the liquor flavor and puts a bit of coffee flavor into the drink and your mouth. Have had Romana Sambucca as well but this is our family's favorite!

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: This has all kinds of goodies in it, and I was excited to try it.  I learned quickly that it *needs* a sweetener.  I'll eat plain oatmeal, but all the cocoa in this stuff is pretty awful without something sweet.  I eat this at work, so I cheated and used a flavored coffee creamer, which instantly made any quantity of the stuff pretty yummy.<br /><br />It's good.  It tastes good, it's made of good stuff, and I'm pretty happy with it.<br /><br />It has "WHEAT-FREE" in all caps on the front (along with VEGAN, SUPERFOOD, and some other marketing words), but notes that it's made in a facility that also processes wheat.  I'm not as sensitive as some and more sensitive than others, but I didn't die or explode, so that's good.<br /><br />My big complaint about the stuff is that the nuts and oils seem a little stale.  I hate rancid oil and can pick it out a mile away, so I'm pickier about that than some people would be.  My parents are older now and eat all kinds of things I consider past their prime.  The expiration date on my can of chocolate hot cereal (let's call it what it is:  it's oatmeal with lots of other fun stuff mixed in) is over a year into the future and I've always stored it sensibly, but I'm just not crazy about the quality of the ingredients.  I know the ingredient list is awesome, but they've really suffered from bad storage, old age, or maybe just getting a sub-par crop mixed in.<br /><br />My review is based on only one can of the stuff, so perhaps my experience is unusual.  It's impossible to tell without buying a second can, and based on the too-far-gone smell of this one, I'm not sure that's going to happen any time soon.  If you're familiar with rancid oil or nuts that are past their prime and have a different experience with your own batch of this stuff as you get toward the end of your can, I'd love to hear about it.  This is the kind of food I really *want* to like, as it's convenient for work breakfasts and full of ingredients that should be healthy and delicious.

She's so not a fan of her special renal diet foods that I try to give her commercial brands (the ones she can keep down) from time to time just to liven things up for her.  Senior foods are best, because they tend to have lower phosphorus and less protein, with the protein included being of higher quality.  This is great quality food, but it seems to be not very palatable.  Mary-Kate's very finicky these days.  I guess if I had to risk tasting everything twice I would be, too.

Also because it's organic, I know I won't be drinking unneeded chemicals to prolong shelf life. I'm fairly certain all drinks (at least juices) need to be pasteurized if bottled. This is the next best thing to pressing the pomegranate juice in your own home. The taste was delicious and I still drank in the antioxidants and nutrients found in pomegranate. Because I do not have the time or instruments to press the pomegranate myself, this is convenient for me to just pour and go. Although it is a little pricey, I figure my well being is worth it.

The blend of Chili & Garlic is a wonderful flavor combination for stir-fries etc. You can also use it as a condiment, although it is not as fine and blended as a condiment sauce. While Sriracha is a great condiment I find that it's not that great for cooking use - the flavor seems to change due to heat. The Chili Garlic sauce is much better for cooking use.<br />I hope you find this helpful!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Received this about a week ago and I have already used it in tacos, black beans and rice, salsa and Chinese stir fried chicken and vegetables. The primary ingredients are chili, salt, garlic and distilled vinegar. It does contain preservatives, namely potassium sulfate and sodium bisulfite so if you are allergic to sulfites you might want to avoid this sauce. Be forewarned that it is very potent so a little goes a long way. As with any spice, just add a little at a time until you reach the amount of heat that is right for you. I can't wait to mix a bit in with my pizza sauce. It is a five star sauce but I deducted a star because I think it is rather pricey.

review/text: I purchased this at my local grocery store.  I have had the Sriracha hot sauce(Rooster sauce) and like so I thought I would see how this was.  It tastes similar to Sriracha sauce BUT HAS MUCH MORE FLAVOR AND MUCH MORE VERSATILITY.  Don't hesitate to order this, except you should get the larger size.  The 8 oz size only lasted two weeks.  It's now my newest favorite sauce.

Amazing flavor, and trust me, this stuff<br />is hot. About a 7 on a scale of 10. Tremendous garlic and hot chili flavor, will<br />make you discover cooking all over again! This will perk up any Chinese takeout,<br />and its even good in Hot n' Sour Soup! Its very thick, almost like a paste so a<br />little bit goes a long way. Sells locally here for around $3. 5 Pods

review/summary: Best Chili Sauce for cooking
review/text: There are a lot of Chili Sauces that I like, and it really depends on what I want to use it for, but when it comes to cooking, this is the stuff. I add it to any meat to make stir-fry, chili con carne, Thai dishes, burritos, etc. It's wonderfully versatile and can be used anywhere that garlic and chilies are appropriate. One of the reasons it's so perfect for cooking is because it's not all heat. You can add a good tablespoon of this to a dish and really mix it in without killing it. With, say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBFTC6">Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper</a> sauce you get lots of heat in a few drops, which can lead to uneven flavor in the dish.

So the price here is more than double.  Two stars deducted for the overprice; five stars for the sauce itself.

review/text: The description on the product page is really spot on. It has a kind of nuttier taste than normal semolina or egg noodles, and is definitely far less starchy. You can overcook it a bit without it getting mushy eaither, which is nice if you lose track of time a little bit. I cant speak to it actually being gluten free. There seems to be some debate as to the accuracy of that, but it isnt a factor for me, so i havent really researched it. One other note is that the artichoke flour in question is actually Jerusalem Artichoke, which is different than the one people are familiar with, and in fact makes a great substitute for potatoes in its natural form. Anyway, this pasta is definitely a worthwhile purchase. Please be advised though....10 pounds of pasta is a large amount. Have something you can seal to store it in if you dont eat pasta every day. It will definitely stay fresh for longer that way.

review/text: We have had problems with our cat and her food in the past. She was having a few health issues so with some advice from the vet we decided to go with a more natural food than Science Diet. Like humans natural foods are better because they contain more of the vitamins and nutrients that the body needs. Our cat loves this food. She doesn't get ear infections or have feline acne anymore. She also have more energy and overall happier. The only downfall with it is that it is quite a bit more expensive than Science Diet or the like. However, I would much rather spend a little more for food than pay hundreds at the vet for preventable issues.

review/summary: Is there mocha flavor in this?
review/text: Got the Peppermint Mocha for Christmas and it was pretty good.  The mocha was not overwhelmed by the peppermint and I enjoyed all 32 oz of it. When it was about gone I checked the company's website for info and saw this one.  Peppermint Mocha is seasonal, but still I am looking for Mocha flavor.  White Chocolate Mocha...At the store where I got it they only had the 32oz.  Pulled it out of the cooler and checked the expiration date.  As soon as I got home I put it in the coffee and as I lifted the cup I got a waft of coconut, like I was on a hot sunny beach. The taste also gave me the impression I just took a sip of suntan lotion.  Not enough mocha like the Peppermint Mocha.  The ingredients have palm oil and I checked the Peppermint Mocha and it does too, but I never noticed it.  Not sure if I can finish the other 31.5 oz of this White Chocolate Mocha. One bad post mentions the taste another becauses of shipping, this IMO is another bad for the taste promoted as White Chocolate Mocha on the label. Should have checked the reviews here first...update...tried a little more.  Shook the bottle well. It's better than the first cup.  Still what I taste is a sweetened coconut with a little white chocolate, not the mocha punch that's in Peppermint Mocha.  I'll bump it up a star for the slightly less coconut, slightly more mocha(?) from the first impression.

review/text: My wife is a flavored-creamer junkie, so I have tried a LOT of different creamers, so when I say that this is probably the WORST coffee creamer I have ever tasted, I know what I'm talking about. The chemical aftertaste is so strong, it's impossible to determine what the underlying flavor is. I honestly thought I had gotten a bad batch, but after reading all the reviews here, I realized that is how it is supposed to taste. Several of the other International Delight flavors have a slight aftertaste, but nothing like this!<br /><br />I'm not sure who they had taste-test this flavor, but whoever it is should be tested for brain damage, or maybe they just lost their sense of taste completely.

I use 1/2 of a tub to a cup of coffee, any more and it's too sweet for me. Until I got the combination right (1/2 tub, 1 packet of Splenda), I didn't care for these. After experimenting some, they are pretty good.  I hope these eventually are offered with dark chocolate instead of white. The more chocolately flavor, the better!

review/summary: Did i burn my coffee? Nope, it's just the creamer...
review/text: Awful, awful, awful. After the first sip I thought I somehow screwed up the coffee without knowing it. I kept sipping, and with each swallow, I realized that it wasn't getting any better. This is the most disgusting creamer I have ever tasted. What a disappointment! The taste reminded me of burnt popcorn covered in moldy chocolate. Gross!

review/summary: never purchase this again
review/text: When I received this order, the outside of the box was wet from the leaking contents inside. The creamers were just thrown in the box and were not even in a plastic bag. It was a mess. I had to wash the few remaining creamers that were still in tact because everything was sticky and dirty.  I will not be ordering this item again.
