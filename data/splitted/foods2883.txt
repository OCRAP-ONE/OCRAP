review/summary: New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good
review/text: This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it.

review/summary: Great dog food.
review/text: I've tried different foods with my puppies. This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price.

review/text: We have some of the smallest chihuahuas and a larger outdoor dog, and both sizes can eat it easily.  The dogs like it, and they seem to know when it arrives.  The only problem I have is that it takes about a week to get here, and I need to remember to order early.

review/summary: CHANGE IN FORMULA MAKES DOGS SICK!!!!!
review/text: If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the "customer service representative" if you can call her that, simply said "if you don't like it then don't buy it." And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any "stickers" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it.

review/summary: Despite Title- this item is NOT Beef and Ocean Fish Formula
review/text: Upon receiving my order for the Canidae Beef and Ocean Fish Formula 30 lbs I found I instead received ANOTHER formula (the original formula with chicken, turkey, etc.).  If you look at the picture and ingredients you'll see that Amazon has a picture AND the ingredients for the formula I received.  The bag I received was 35 lbs and not 30.  Clearly Amazon made a boo-boo here somewhere.  My dogs have eaten this formula and I believe Canidae is a pretty good and nutritious formula so I'm not sending it back.  However, for folks who must have the beef and ocean fish formula may not be happy.  I've ordered from Amazon for 10++ years- never a problem.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to notify Amazon of this without returning the item, hence the review.  Many folks are critical of Canidae's big mistake of changing their formula a couple years ago without going public with the change and have skewed their reviews to reflect their dissatisfaction with the product.  I've found it good palatable food for the money, and I'd bet Canidae won't make the mistake of a secret formula change again.

review/summary: serious diarrhea - I would like to rate even lower
review/text: I am very involved with dog rescue - in fact I am a founding board member of a large and active rescue group that adopts 500 or more dogs per year while keeping very high standards with the placement standards.  We (as a dog rescue) have used Canidae for years and recommended it to many adopters, but recently we (personally) have seen problems with our dogs', as well as dogs throughout the rescue, stools.  We have had many cases of serious diarrhea, and when talking to local Veterinarians we use, have found that many have seen recent issues with Canidae causing their client's dogs to have similar diarrhea as we have experienced.  I know Canidae has in the past changed their formula causing problems and it appears to have happened again.  It is a shame because we have had good success with the food, but we (both personally and as a dog rescue) will no longer use this product.

review/summary: Company sold out. No different from regular grocery dog food.
review/text: I was a huge fan of canidae, but beginning about a month ago, the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials, smaller bags, and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes, the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past). Please do a search on google/consumeraffairs.com. I will not be giving my dog this brand anymore. It's the same mass produced garbage as is iams, eureka, etc.

review/summary: Great Food!!!!
review/text: I bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies. I researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular brand. I'm glad I did get this brand. My dogs absolutely love it. Before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits brand. They were "healthy", but their poop smelled horrible and I knew there was much healthier food out there for them. I gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did, I attempted to try and feed him his last bit of "junk" food he had left and he would not touch it. The only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too. I read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good. My dogs are healthier than ever, they haven't had any diarrhea, vomitting, weightloss, unhealthy weight gain, or anything that I have read on the other reviews, but my dogs also have no allerges that I know of either. Another plus is that their poop doesn't smell as bad either, I mean in still stinks but nothing like before. I started feeding them canidae on Thursday July 26, 2012 and two months later they are healthier than ever with no adverse effects and my veterinarian likes it too.

review/summary: Bland Thai food? - that's just wrong!
review/text: I was disappointed in this mix. It is quite bland and boring. I made this with coconut milk (which is sweet) and was surprised to find it had little flavor. I added a large amount of brown sugar and salt. I would rate it mild, so there was not much spice or aromatics. Needs lots of red chilis, which should be included in the mix. The Red Curry mix is much better - that one has a nice bite. And the Peanut Sauce mix is amazing. Too bad I now have a dozen of these yellow curry packs. Thai yellow curry is my favorite at restaurants.

review/text: This Yellow Curry is our very favorite!! It is very rare, and no grocery store in our area carries it. Walmart, City Market, Natural Grocery Shops, nobody!<br />I've started buying this over the internet a few years ago, I still haven't found it in a store. I am afraid that they might not produce it anymore??!!<br />It is indeed yellow, very fragrant, and not spicy at all. Paired with the coconut milk, it is pure goodness. This product is SO SO very different than all the other curries made by "A TASTE OF THAT". It is hard to describe, but I will tell you this: We are addicted to the taste. Sometimes, after we make this dish, if there is still some left in the refrigerator, I wake up at night and go and have a little taste of it:)

review/text: Used to use another brand, but this is so much better!  Has a very pleasing, mild, not too spicy, just right, taste.  It is a little too salty though, if you like to use a fair amount to "spice it up".  We wish it had a lower sodium content.  While, made from scratch with fresh ingredients is always better; this is the next best thing!  Really good with or on baked white fish fillets like cod/haddock/pollack.  Tried it with chicken, shrimp, imitation crab/lobster meat, pork and sauteed tofu, all mixed with stir-fried veggies---simply wonderful!  Quick and easy to make good-for-you meals.  We don't like the packaging and wish it were in a jar, but other than that and the sodium content, we like it.  Will buy again!

review/summary: Unusual taste for cocktail sauce
review/text: I did not like the taste. I've never had cocktail sauce mention specifically that it was made with horse radish on the label before. Cocktail sauce should be spicy, but this stuff really tasted weird. I wouldn't say it was all that spicy either. Just kinda funky, not sure if it went bad or thats just the normal taste. If you are looking for the typical cocktail sauce taste look elsewhere. If you are looking for something unusual, this fits the bill. Maybe I should return it......<br /><br />update:<br /><br />I looked up some cocktail recipes and found out horseradish is perfectly normal ingredient. Later, I got amazon to replace it, and the next batch was much better, like what cocktail sauce is supposed to taste like. Somehow I just got a bad batch. I opened several jars and they all were the same, maybe it got left in the heat for a while... sped up the spoilage process; it wasn't expired though. So if anyone wants to, go ahead and try it out. It should be OK and amazon replaced it for me at no cost.

review/summary: Best Tasting Salt AND So Incredibly Good For You
review/text: This is the best tasting salt I've ever had.  I learned about this after starting a "raw" diet and I was obsessed about having everything raw.  I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur.  However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it.  This really does enhance almost every dish I eat.  In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.  Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt.

review/summary: Excellent flavor
review/text: I do a lot of Cajun cooking. I have been making my own seasoning combinations for a while.. I try to keep MSG and sugar out of my diet. I decided to give this a try. I made a pot of chilly. The only change I made this time was this salt. It was AMAZING!! My only regret now is that I only ordered a pound. Next time it will be more.<br /><br />This salt is also a great for exfoliation in the bath!<br /><br />One note: do be sure to add several grains of uncooked rice to the package as soon as you open it. It does start to clump rather quickly.

review/summary: Product not as described
review/text: Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.  The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt.  I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it.  If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.  This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled "finely ground".<br /><br />I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.  The three stars are only because the salt was not what I would consider finely ground.

review/summary: Delicious Nutritious Non-nuclear Salt at a Great Price
review/text: I love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range.<br /><br />This salt, I think, may be the same as that sold by David Wolfe's LongevityWarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price.  Not only are the descriptions similar, but comparing the salts side-by-side, they have the exact same color, flavor, texture, grind, fragrance, etc in my opinion.<br /><br />Himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the Fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the Pacific Ocean last year if not before.  Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.  If the sea salt wasn't harvested before Fukushima started dumping nuclear waste, it is just too risky to ingest.<br /><br />This salt is from the Himalayas which may be just as far from Fukushima's dumping ground as you can get!

review/summary: SALTY  SALT I HAVE EVER TASTED
review/text: This salt is pink in colour and upon recieveing it I used a tooth pick and dampened the end of the tooth pick and stuck the tip, JUST THE TIP, of the tooth pick into the pink looking salt and tasted it, and WOW! The salt taste about knocked me off my feet! The 2 pounds of this salt will last a very long time! I can use a lot less to salt whatever I want to have a salted flavour. It takes very little sprinkled on food or when cooking to obtain the desired salt flavour. It is great salt and it will last much longer than normal every day salt from the grocery store down town that I usualy buy for 78 cents to a dollar something. I recomend all people give this salt a try. As far as Iodine as a nessary nutriant, just eat potatoes ever so often and you will get the nessary iodine that you need in your diet, so no worries there. I can not wait to try this Himalayan Salt on Popcorn. I have been very un-satisfied with the normal every day salt from the store for a long time. Even sea salt has no "punch" to it like this salt. This is salt as it was meant to be and taste. (my opinion)

review/summary: good salt, good price, but not fine!
review/text: I got this to hold us over because our usual supplier was sold out right when we needed more Himalayan salt. The quality is good, but the salt is most certainly NOT finely ground. The crystals are the same size as previous Himalayan salt that we purchased in the past, which is coarser than regular table salt. When described as finely ground, I was expecting smaller sized crystals. Our usual supplier is in stock again, so I probably won't be purchasing this brand again if not necessary. But the price is pretty good and the quality seems fine, so I would recommend this to people who are looking to try Himalayan salt.

review/summary: Very pretty, but would not buy again
review/text: I bought this as an alternative to the sea salts that I normally purchase.  I find that the salt does not dissolve fully - it leaves a gritty residue behind, whether in sauces, soups, pickles or pasta water.  The flavor is fine, and when cooked in dishes the grit doesn't seem to be an issue, but I like my salts to be versatile, and this one doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I've got a Himalayan pink salt cooking plate, and I'm quite satisfied with that, but I don't use any liquid when cooking with it.

review/text: I went to the Sunflower Market in Dallas and got a bag of Real salt from Utah. It is way better in flavor than chemical salt however the dirt and sand are off putting! You see, I add salt to all my drinking water and right away noticed real salt was leaving a sand-looking substance at the bottom of the bottle so I could only drink 80% of the water before re-filling. Real salt is the laziest company I know for not using an evaporation/filtering process to remove the dirt and sand!<br /><br />I am now the happy new owner of 4 lbs of Himalayan salt and it's not only clean unlike real salt, it tastes 10 levels better too! The company also has something like 200 different salts for your salt tasting pleasure! I will be ordering much more and sending as a gift to all my friends and family! This stuff is the "real" deal unlike Real LOL. Real salt should use as their motto "Hey, just tryin' to keep it real"<br />LOL ...losers

review/summary: Couldn't be more pleased!
review/text: One reviewer  described The spice Lab Finely Ground Himalayan Salt  grains as being too  being large.  Not mine.  Mine  is finer than course kosher salt.<br /> I ordered a small package first to check it out and now I am ready to spring for a big one.<br /> It seems to take less salt,  it's easy to control with your "pinches", and it tastes great!<br /><br /> I love the consistency of this Himalayan.  It is in no way as fine as table salt but somewhere in between table and Kosher - leaning more to the Kosher.  Maybe half as fine as course Kosher.<br />  Some salts I have bought have just been too fine for me to predict how much salt I'm really adding.  I'm not good with really finely ground salts and end up over salting or under salting.<br /> I like to see each individual grain of salt if you will...and I can with this  Himalayan.<br /><br />I couldn't be more pleased and the price is good too.  Came in great shape nicely packaged...

They neglected to tell me that the lid neither screws or snaps on. That's right, it just sits there. I brought my oatmeal home with my coffee and dumped half of it out in my lap when I lifted the oatmeal up in one hand with my coffee in my other hand. I got to eat about 1/4 of it. So, the oatmeal was expensive - nice stains all over my front seat, which I have no idea how I'll get out.

review/summary: No Teeth?  No Problem With These Treats!!!!
review/text: I don't normally write reviews (this is my first one on Amazon!) but this product is a-maz-ing!<br /><br />I have a 17 year old dog with a whole list of health problems... least of all is the fact that she has five teeth.  She's now on a steady diet of canned soft dog food and tons of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILEIUE">Blue Dog Bakery Natural Soft Dog Treats, Peanut Butter Flavor Softies, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  After a LONG search for a treat that was actually soft (we had gotten into the habit of grinding other "soft" treats in the food processor because they weren't quite soft enough) we found these.  These treats are fabulous.<br /><br />First of all, my dog LOVES them.  She may be blind and deaf, but she knows her way to her treat plate and gets up to check it about once every 30 minutes just to make sure we didn't leave any happy surprises for her.  She can't get enough of these treats.<br /><br />The reason why I love these treats, though, is because I no longer have to drag out the food processor to grind up other brand's so called "soft" treats!  They easily break apart with your fingers and are soft enough for my dog to eat, probably even whole (she's a 17 lb dog, though, so we'll continue to break them up with our fingers!).  Think fig newton.  That soft.  Think no longer having to wash the food processor.  THAT HAPPY.  :)  Plus, they're much cheaper on amazon than at my local petsmart and I'm not spending any money on gas!<br /><br />I guess the one "complaint" I have with these treats is that they look like real "people" food!  When we first got these, my dad saw them in the (new) glass treat container and thought they were for people.  However, he didn't think they were quite as delicious as my dog thinks they are... He said they were "a little chalky."  I guess they weren't baked with his palate in mind!

review/text: I have a young, healthy, athletic Boxer and he had diarrhea so bad he had accidents in the house 3 times and moped around for a whole day after I gave him some of these cut up in his Kong treat puzzle toy. Boxers can have touchy stomachs and he has had a touch of diarrhea before with a new treat but never anything like this. Even the time he got hold of some chicken wings it wasn't this bad. I recently purchased a carpet cleaner and was never so happy to have one on hand, I used it 2 times that night and once again in the morning. If your dog has any sensitivity introduce these slowly or just pass them up, there must be something in them that takes some getting used to.

review/text: I can't believe all the high ratings on these. Like one of the previous reviewers, my dog hates them. I'm not sure I would eat them either if I were her as they don't smell like Peanut Butter at all - though I wasn't willing to taste them myself due to the horrible smell.  My dog's willing to eat anything I've ever given her, food or treats, but with these she takes it from my hand and then spits it out on the floor.  For the first box, she would come back and eat it an hour later (while looking up at you thinking "you've got to be kidding me").  After that, she said "no more" - she just left them there and never game them another thought.

review/text: Our dog just loves these treats! We originally purchased them at Trader Joe's when he was a puppy, and were disappointed when TJ's stopped carrying them.  We were delighted to find them on Amazon, and the 6-box per package allows us to re-order less often.  It's also a very reasonable price for an all-natural treat. Once the box is open however, it is a good idea to put the treats in a sealed container or plastic ziploc, as they will dry out if left open. It has been five years since we discovered these softies and our "canine-kid" still adores them!

review/summary: USE WITH CAUTION on small dogs
review/text: First off, the dogs like these...apparently they taste really good!!<br /><br />But, I have toy dogs (Yorkies) and, if your dog has the tendency to 'inhale' their treats/food and not chew properly, then the soft texture of these could cause a problem.<br /><br />I had one of my dogs choke on a 'piece' of this cookie (I had broken it up in anticipation, but, apparently not small enough). Thankfully I'm well versed in canine care and was able to dislodge the piece, but it sure did scare the bejezus out of me.<br /><br />I give these out for special occasions and make sure to crumble it in tiny pieces.<br /><br />So, end result is: Tastes good, but be cautious with smaller breeds.<br /><br />p.s. My German Shepherd LOVES these...he has NO problem eating them.

They come from a good manufacturer, you won't have to worry about any recall of Blue Dog Bakery Products...I highly recommend them.  Try them, your Dog will Thank You!

review/summary: Natural Soft Dog Treats
review/text: We like this product for our dog because the softness allows us to hide his little pill in it so he thinks he's getting a treat every morning without knowing he's getting medicine. It has worked very well for this. And we also like it because of all the good, healthy natural ingredients.<br />For us it's a great product.<br />Dawn
