review/summary: Crazy for Cretors Popcorn
review/text: Love Cretors Popcorn.  I had never had it before until my brother brought me a bag.  I then ordered a 12 pack through Amazon.  Best snack ever.  If you haven't  tried Cretors Popcorn you don't know what you are missing.  Chedder and Carmel Corn is my favorite!!

review/summary: delicious & different flavor combo, plus GMO-free!
review/text: We had the pleasure of sampling all of the G.H. Cretors' popcorn varieties. The Chicago Mix was by far the favorite with both adults and kids. I never would have thought to pair sweet caramel corn with tangy cheese, but it's a winning combination. My kids became quickly obsessed with this one, and I was so glad to find a GMO-free treat. Added bonus for the inclusion of lower-glycemic brown rice syrup.

review/summary: quite good
review/text: This popcorn is definitely really tasty.  I am knocking off ONE star for the relatively small quantity in the bag (open it and it appears almost halfway empty, which is probably a good thing because it's delicious and I tend to eat the whole bag in a couple hours).  I agree that it seems heavier on the caramel corn, and I'd prefer a bit more cheddar corn.  Overall a delicious product though.  Tastes very fresh, and few hulls.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!!
review/text: I just bought some today from World Market because I was craving popcorn. My favorite popcorn happens to be cheddar and caramel. I really like how it is all natural and instead of using corn syrup for the caramel popcorn they use brown rice syrup. Its a very tasty snack and is highly addicting! I recommend buying this you wont be disappointed! I just wish more stores where I lived carried the other flavors too.

review/text: I ordered this popcorn after falling in love with Garrett's Popcorn in Chicago/NYC.  While this popcorn isn't quite the same, its still really, really good.  The caramel corn does tend to sink to the bottom but it's so well packaged that almost every kernel was perfect.  I was shocked that popcorn could look so nice after shipping.  If you're a fan of Chicago style popcorn and have any type of self control, order some of this right now.  If you don't have self control you should still order it but make sure you subscribe and save!

review/summary: Better than Garret's | Excellent Value for Price | NOT Greasy | BEST popcorn ever
review/text: I never write reviews, but this popcorn left me speechless.<br /><br />I'm actually don't like popcorn, and have it at the movies in limited quantities. Then, I tried Garret's chicago mix and have been craving it for a while now. I almost ordered from Garret's online but the cost with shipping was ludicrous. So I searched Amazon and found this gift from popcorn heaven.<br /><br />Why I liked it?<br />- Excellent quality: Takes garret's recipe and makes it 100x better.<br />- Low Price: I know it's 30 bucks, but it's worth it. But you get 12 huge popcorn bags!<br />- Not greasy: No grease, no bad odor, and man they look good.<br /><br />Thank you G.H Cretors and Amazon...made me realize popcorn heaven is for real.

review/summary: Best premade popcorn I've had
review/text: I snagged a bag of this at Fresh Market and was so absolutely hooked from the first bite that it wasn't even funny.  I have had popcorn this good before when I was in Chicago and had it freshly made, but it's never as good after a couple of hours. This popcorn is cheesy without being salty and has just enough of the sweet with the caramel to mix it up in your mouth.  I have ordered a case of this and a case of the Just the Cheese to store for our monthly family movie nights.  A few bags aren't going to make it because I can't stop sneaking some for me.

review/text: I brought a bag home with me one day. After eating some of it, I knew that it would have to fill the Christmas stocking of my entire family. Everyone loves it! I have sent other popcorn items in the past, from "Moose Munch" on down and nothing beats this.  If you like a sweet and salty corn with few hulls and large fluffy kernels, then this is the product for you.<br />The only con is that it disappears so fast! Glad Amazon sells it in a case of 12 bags.

review/text: LOVE ... LOVE ... LOVE THIS POPCORN!  So sad Costco stopped carrying it, but I understand from Cretors they will start again in September '11.  A little hint, shake the bag up everytime you go to eat some.  The caramel corn sinks to the bottom as it sits and this mixes it back up.  I find the best ratio is 2 cheese to 1 caramel.  It's addicting ....<br /><br />Marilyn

The carmel corn is to die for, sweet, crunchy but not too heavy.  The cheese corn melts in your mouth and is a great savory compliment to the sweet caramel corn taste.  It is a new combination of classic flavors!

review/text: Tried a sample at Costco before buying a bag.  Opened bag at home, and have found through a few 2-cup servings, that the mix is rather heavy on the sweet and lighter on the cheddar (I would prefer the opposite mix - more cheddar corn, please).  Also, these kernels have plentiful hulls.  Don't think I'll buy this again.

review/text: I eat these in salads.  They are pretty plain all by themselves but when you mix them in with a great salad, with a good salad dressing, they really do the trick. It's impossible to find any stuffed grape leaves in any of the grocery stores in my area.  I had to travel to another state, although only a half hour away, to get them, but then they changed the brand they carried to a different one. I didn't like them at all.  So I was very happy to see that I could purchase them on Amazon.  Amazon is now my favorite place to shop...I buy so much stuff here that I never knew they had.

It saves so much money making lattes from home, I highly recommend this to any coffee lover (I don't use it for anything else) And the box lasts so much longer than any can!

review/text: I'm on at least my 4th box of this awesome stuff.  I used to own a coffee shop, and we never used anything but this for our mochas.  It has no chemical taste like the other brand's white chocolate "goo" does.  Always mixes perfectly with nothing left at the bottom.  Shipping is super-fast, and the price is right!

review/summary: Better then starbucks white mocha
review/text: I have been using this stuff for over 12 years now. Used to be able to get it locally around Seattle when I lived there. Living in central Ohio now(I hate Seattle), I cant find it anywhere so I have to order it online(not a big deal though, still worth it). Why spend 5$ for a white mocha at Starbucks which in my opinion doesn't even taste as good as the ones I make at home with this white chocolate powder? you do the math. I have tried the Ghirardelli white chocolate sauce but I still like the powder more.<br /><br />I don't know if the Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Beverage Mix, White Mocha is the same as this white chocolate powder or not. I saw one reviewer say they were different. If anyone knows, let me know.<br /><br />This with smuckers caramel syrup 2.50$ and the 40$ Mr Coffee espresso maker and 20$ Mr coffee grinder(optional). You're set.

review/text: I have searched high and low for cotton candy flavoring to make cotton candy ice cream.  well I happened upon this product and ordered it.  When it finally arrived I tried it out in some vanilla ice cream and vanilla yogurt.  It tastes nothing like cotton candy and doesn't even have a candy like flavor to it...more of a strawberry.  It is horrible and I am very upset since there is no returns on grocery items.  If you are looking for cotton candy flavoring that tastes like real cotton candy or cold stone ice cream this is not the product, it is a big let down!!

review/summary: Awesome Mushrooms, Great Price!
review/text: These are the same mushrooms that come sliced in soup and other dishes when you order Chinese take-out.  They are delicious.  These mushrooms rehydrate very quickly, have a more neutral taste than other mushrooms so they won't overpower your dishes, and the water left over from the re-hydration process can go into soup for extra flavor.  Nothing is wasted here.  Also, these are not little pieces.  They are the whole mushroom.  These are $13.95 for 3 ounces where I shop in a little cellophane bag.  I won't pay that, so when I saw these at this price for a whole pound, I ordered 8 bags.  They come well sealed in a heavy plastic bag, so they will keep well.  I like them in omelets.  It's a steal of a price.  Go Amazon!

review/summary: If you do not want expired product, DO NOT ORDER FROM BURBANK :"OTTOS (EUROPEAN) FOOD STORE".
review/text: The item arrived in January 2012, with expiration date of NOVEMBER 2011. After few emails with dismissive statements like :"the chocolates are still good for several months after the sell by expiration dates", I decided to accept 50% discount. I have suspicion that this was not a innocent mistake, because the bottoms of all 10 packages look like rubbed off so that the expiration dates were very faint. I was not happy with how the matter was handled and did not appreciate the attitude of representative, which I did expressed in my "Sellers feedback". Today I received 2 PHONE CALLS - first to me, but after I refused to discuss anything by phone, my husband , who picked up second call minutes later (which I see as harassment !!!), had to listen the threat that if i would not remove my review, they will set the lawyer on me !!! I do have my phone companies record for that. I never heard of so offensive handling of complaint !!! I do not want anything from this company &lt;&lt;Otto's Euopean Import Store>>> and will not buy from them in the future. All of a sudden the page here has different seller.

review/text: I usually love Yogurette, but these bars arrived only one month before the expiration date printed on the packaging.  Whether because it was getting old or because it had been slightly melted at some point, the filling was dry and crumbly rather than creamy as usual.  Not bad enough for me to go through the fuss of trying to return it, especially since it was officially within the expiration time, but bad enough for me to think twice about ordering it another time.<br /><br />On the other hand Parthenon Foods shipped it very quickly after receiving my order.

review/text: I love Ghirardelli chocolates: for eating, baking and now for drinking.  This product is an intense, creamy, chocolatey powder mix that you can make using hot water for a rich chocolate drink, or make it with milk for an extra creamy taste.  It's great to take with you when you're away from home (it also comes in pre-measured packets that you can mix into 8oz of hot water), or keep it at work, or in your dorm room for that quick chocolate break.<br /><br />The 32oz packages are very cost-effective.  I keep the powder in a canister on the counter next to my Keurig beverage machine, and it's been hit hard this cold, blustery winter!<br /><br />PLEASE BE ADVISED, if you're expecting this item to contain ground chocolate and cocoa, you need to be looking at the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019SE6M0">Ghirardelli Chocolate Sweet Ground Chocolate & Cocoa, 3 Pound Can</a> product instead.

review/text: UPDATE:<br />The review below was written in May of '09. We are still big fans of Barn Burner, but the price increase (to more than $6.20 per jar) and the frequent unavailability of the product have sent us searching again. No change in the star rating - it's great stuff - but value and availability can be deal-breakers.<br /><br />So we're looking to Pico Planet products. They're a solid company, use first-rate, locally sourced and/or fair trade ingredients, are priced a bit below Barn Burner's new pricing, and are locally available in stores.<br /><br />Oh, well. It was good while it lasted ...<br /><br />******<br /><br />Original 5/'09 review:<br /><br />Few things are worse for lovers of hot peppers than bottled "hot sauce" or salsa that's laced with oleoresin capsicum (basically, MACE, the liquid in pepper spray canisters for self defense.) They have all the irritants, but no flavor.<br /><br />This carefully conceived salsa is savory, spicy, HOT, flavorful, and is in all ways the real deal. We've been enjoying this salsa side-by-side with two or three others we often buy, and this one stands above the rest. We'll be shipping some to friends.

review/summary: Good & Spicy Hot
review/text: I just finished my first serving of this salsa and was inspired to sit and write this review. This salsa is nicely hot and spicy thanks to the habanero and jalapeno peppers.  It also has good tomato flavor, not over-run by the heat.  It has no unnecessary sugars or sweet flavor, and is perfect for those of us who want a robust, spicy salsa.  Keep a cold drink nearby when you eat this salsa!!

review/summary: Finally, some flavor!
review/text: I've been on the hunt for several months now for a salsa full of flavor and exhilerating heat -- but it had to be something my wife could purchase on a regular trip to the grocery store.  So far, trying various 'boutique' salsas have left me disappointed.  Well, my wife brought home Barn Burner yesterday she picked up at Kroger and I tried some.  Wow!  Back in the saddle!  The flavor is amazing and the heat is intense enough to make eating it require 'strategic dipping' to stay in the 'hot zone' and not get into trouble.  But, the heat is nothing worse than the next-to-hottest wing sauce you typically encounter at buffalo wing places.<br />This salsa is not watery like many others, nor is it 'all hot and no flavor'.  This stuff is good like the secret salsas many Mexican food places will serve you by request.<br />The price is a little high at $5 or so for 16oz, but I quickly realized that 16oz of this stuff will ignite more chips with good hot flavor than other jars in the $3 range.  So, I think the total value is good.

review/summary: HOT HOT HOT
review/text: The title of the bottle tells it - screaming hot. If you like burning hot salsa, this is the one for you. I am looking for very hot salsa for a long time. I've tried different brands of salsa on the market, but most of them are too mild for me. This one sure is the hottest I have ever tried. And it is not just plain hot, but also has rich flavors.<br />Be careful it really burns. (If you are not very used to extreme hot flavor)

review/summary: Tasty but not as hot as described
review/text: I ordered this for my husband because we are unable to find salsas hot enough for him in the store. The reviews seemed promising. He says that it's packed with flavor, but doesn't have as much burn as he'd like. Now, before you think this salsa is mild, please note that my husband likes to eat fresh habaneros, serranos and jalepenos in vinegar just for the fun of it. All hot sauces used here are habanero. He likes things hotter than your avg person. For me, this stuff was beyond my threshold. Overall, all good buy!

review/text: The salsa tastes good as noted in other reviews but after phrases such as "barn burner", "call 911 screaming hot" and "remember the Alamo" I expected something really really hot. Ends up I can eat it with a soup spoon. Compared to Jose Madrid crazy hot salsa this is cat nip.

review/summary: Very Hot & Flavorful
review/text: I just wanted to add that this is a very tasty salsa.  Now some people I've let try this say it is way too hot.  However, even if it is too hot theoretically speaking, you could just add it to things like sauces or other salsas to pep them up.  Quality ingredients also...three different types of hot peppers in one jar.  Much more flavorful than the standard salsas in the store that are usually jalapeno based only.  I'm giving this 5/5 no question.

review/summary: A nice spicy salsa
review/text: I'm giving this 5 stars because this is exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />Really enjoying this salsa!  It is quite spicy, but also quite flavorful, with strong tomato and pepper flavors.  I really enjoy it on my burritos.<br /><br />One of the best salsas I've ever enjoyed.  I spent a long time looking for something with kick, but which was not composed entirely of vinegar.  No vinegar taste here!<br /><br />Regarding spiciness level - it is far from the hottest thing I've ever tried, but it is plenty hot for eating with food or with chips.  This is a very personal decision; make your own choice here.  It IS spicy, but not overwhelmingly so.  I can slather quite a lot on my burritos, and not have any serious issues.  As with many hot sauces, I occasionally have some mild pain as it makes its way through the digestive tract - but it's worth it for the wonderful flavor going down!

review/summary: OK for something different
review/text: I became acquainted with smoked marlin when I was working in the Republic of Mauritius.  This has a somewhat milder flavor.  The teriyaki flavor is OK, but I would rate the overall flavor somewhat lower than other products available, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPIT8">SeaBear Smoked Salmon Jerky, 1.25-Ounce Units  (Pack of 4)</a>.  It's all a matter of personal preference.  They are products that pack a lot of food value in a relatively low weight, and are convenient to carry in a day pack.  They are also something that you can keep around for a quick snack.

review/summary: Nope
review/text: Did not like this.  I threw 95% of it away.  It is very thin slices of marlin covered in sugar and soy sauce.  All I was tasting was sugar and soy sauce masking the marlin flavor.  The jerky also had so much sugar that it was sticking together in the package.  Will not order again, a waste of money because I'm left still with no definitive taste of marlin.

review/text: The teriyaki flavor marlin fish jerky is very, very good.  If I'm hiking, sometimes I'll just take a bag of this jerky, water, and fruit, and that's all I'll have for the day.  One bag (whole thing) has 800 calories, 2.5g fat, 10g sugar, 180g protein.  Of the three flavors, this is the best.<br /><br />But, at the stores here in Hawai'i, it sells for like $8 a bag.  $17 seems like a lot of markup.

review/summary: Best marinade for grilling Shrimp and Chicken
review/text: When I lived in Florida I used to buy this dressing (the Oil based Paul Newman Caesar) to marinate my shrimp and chicken before grilling them.  Since I have moved to the mountains of NC I haven't been able to find a store that has this exact dressing.  I just thought to try Amazon.  I don't know why I didn't think of it sooner.<br /><br />FYI: Marinate the shrimp and/or cubes of chicken for 2+ hours making sure all sides get seasoned.  Cut up veggies (onions, bell peppers are best) and marinade them too.  Make kabobs and grill. Everyone loves them!!!<br /><br />BTW  Paul Newman was awesome.  Great earth friendly products.  I buy his products as often as I can.  All proceeds go to Charities.

I suggest you try these!

review/text: I grew up in Seattle, home of Krusteaz which made Zoom as well as pancake mixes breads, etc, so I have eaten this wonderful cereal all my life.  When I left home I tried lots of different cereals and eventually returned to Zoom as my favorite; nothing else measures up.  Recently I left the West Coast to live in Middle America where there is NO ZOOM.  After working myself through everything available I just gave up and ordered a 6 box pack to make it through the winter--it gets COLD here and I miss my cereal  Give it a try - you'll love it if you don't like bland, mushy cereals.  Great with addition of nuts, will hold you all day with the bonus of being very good for you as well.
