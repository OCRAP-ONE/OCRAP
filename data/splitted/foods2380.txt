review/text: Yoshida's is great on any meat and most cooked vegetables.  I even like it on potatoes.  It is not in all Costco and Sam's, which is a crime.  I can get it in Columbus, OH and Honolulu but not KC?  Strange.  But it is my wife's "secret" ingredient in many dishes that get rave reviews at pot lucks.

review/summary: Wonderful for vanilla milk
review/text: I loved this vanilla flavoring, as I used it in my daughters goat milk to make it vanilla flavored. She loves it like that. I use to be able to get it at wal-mart for just under $5 a bottle. Now of course, because Wal-mart sucks, and constantly discontinues the sale of products after you get use to using them for so long and I can not longer find it there or in any store where I live.  But this is great for coffee or added to milk, milk shakes, or in baking cakes etc. it is rather expensive here on amazon though.

review/summary: Oooohhhhhhhh, yummy!
review/text: OMG, the soup this makes is just unbelievably delicious.  I found these packets of seasonings a week ago at Wal-Mart and prepared the soup yesterday.  It was so good, I totally pigged-out.<br />At least, it was nutritious--besides chicken, there's beans, tomatoes, and fresh spinach.  Went back to Wal-Mart this morning for sole purpose of stocking up on this stuff--but couldn't find it again (typical of Wal-Mart!).  I don't mind ordering 12 at a time.  I know I will use them.  The price here is also comparable to Wal-Mart, as I recall.<br /><br />An easy-to-remove recipe card is included.  So you could easily make the soup again by buying everything separately.  But, honestly, it's SO convenient to have the spices pre-measured, plus I can't imagine you would save any money buying all these different spices...<br /><br />I am ordering this as soon as I have the money, which will be another week.  I may try it with shrimp, rather than chicken.  I am also looking forward to trying some of the other McCormick spice packs, also sold by Amazon.

review/summary: Good Tea Bad Price
review/text: This is a really good tea with a sweet clean green tea flavor and no weird tangy after taste like some other bottled teas. I regularly purchase the gallon size at the store but since I purchased this 12 pk from Amazon in June 2012 the price has more than doubled. I don't really know what's behind that but I always figured that purchasing in bulk should be cheaper than purchasing individually but at this price ($24 at the time of this review)it isn't. I'm giving this 4 stars for the fact that its a good product with one off for the price. I would purchase this again from amazon if the price came back down to something reasonable.

review/summary: Unusual disappointment for Ener-G
review/text: I've tried several brands of gluten-free pizza crusts, I bought the Ener-G as my latest product exploration.  Being a huge fan of many of Ener-G products, I thought this one would be a slam dunk hit.  How wrong I was.  The Ener-G pizza crusts are too thin, dense, and heavy, with very little taste.  You would think "thin" and "heavy" would be contradictory, but that's what I really mean to say.  By contrast, the Kinnikinnick pizza crusts are light and fluffy, with such an outstanding declicious flavor.  I would strongly suggest buying a single package of the Ener-G pizza crusts from your local health food store first.  I made a mistake trusting Ener-G on this product before I bought a whole case of it.  It was an expensive lesson.  But, nonetheless, a huge thanks to Amazon for offering so many gluten-free products.  Here in the US, we are just starting to become familiar with how many people are affected by gluten.

review/text: I like these.  They are quick and easy to make.  If you follow the directions they come out about half way between crispy and chewy.  Kinda remind me of the bisquik crusts my Mom used to make.  The only thing I don't like is that there is no edge, so you have to be careful piling on the ingredients...They have a tendency to fall off near the edge of the shell.  Overall these are good shells to keep on hand.

review/summary: Not the best Monin product
review/text: Monin usually makes some great products. This is not one of them. My first experience with Monin was a bottle of their apricot syrup which I picked up at a gourmet market in NYC. It was bright, sweet and tasted like it was made from natural ingredients. I can't compare it to fresh apricot juice, but it made a nice soda.<br /><br />Their blood orange syrup does not meet the high bar they've set for other products. It tastes 100% artificial -- like it belongs in a Slurpee machine. It's tart, no doubt from the addition of copious amounts of citric acid. It has a very unnatural, neon orange color. I thought I might be able to use this to add a sour kick to some cocktails, but the dye here makes them look like something poured directly from a Mad Dog 20/20 bottle. Yikes.<br /><br />If you're someone who likes Kool Aid and Tang, you'll probably enjoy this. If you're more of an Orangina drinker, you may be able to tolerate this. If you prefer fresh orange juice, stay away.

review/summary: Very tasty and quite the find
review/text: I like trying different salts, so when i saw this, i had to snag a jar for myself. It actually arrived early, which was nice.<br />The taste is quite bright, and is a great finisher. I just tried it with chicken, and it really made the flavor pop. I plan to try it on a chocolate mousse next.<br />An interesting by product is that since it is made in part from lava rock, it actually leaves a residue on your hands when you handle it.<br />Anyway, pretty neat and quite inexpensive. As long as you arent copiously coating all your food with it, this jar should last a while.<br /><br />Update: I've been using this salt on a variety of things, including eggs, various meats, fresh tomatoes (from my garden), as well as the aforementioned chocolate mousse (which i had been planning when i wrote the review initially) and chicken. It has continued to be a wonderful addition to my kitchen, and the tomatoes and chocolate mousse in particular stood out as bar none winners.

review/text: I'm from Hawaii and was hesitant to get this product but of course, I had to try it as I like food and new interesting things for the kitchen. When I first received it, I thought I was looking at just black Lava Rock. I had a taste with my girl friend and was pleasantly surprised on the flavor of this salt. It is sort of salty, smokey, and just the right hint of bitters with a good crunch to it. I have tried it as a finishing to salmon and steak so far and they turned out fantastic. I can't think of too much more that I would like to use this salt on... It does give an interesting look (as it's black) and crunch to the finish of the two items. For the price it is good but I wouldn't use it everyday as it could prove to be expensive if you are on a budget like myself.

review/summary: Great flavor, not strong
review/text: This salt tastes great. Yes, it's salty, but there's almost a hint of sweetness to it. The black coloring made me think it would be smoky or strong, but that's absolutely not the case. They crystals are fairly large, like pretzel salt, and you don't need a lot of it to dress up your food. One warning though: the color will come off on your fingers if they're wet (and other things, too), so don't get it on your clothes. I've managed to not wear any, so I don't know if it stains fabrics permanently, but take care. A little bit of this finishing salt goes a long way, so the price isn't as steep as it may seem. And the container is plastic with a plastic lid, so it won't rust from the salt.

review/text: All salts are not created equal, and this product certainly proves it.  Obviously not to be used as a "cooking" salt, but rather as a sparingly applied finishing salt.  Just a few grains add a slightly earthy flavor and a wonderful crunch to meats and vegetables (cooked and raw).  Try it on pan seared fresh green beans or on cold sliced radishes.  Wonderful on fish.  A little goes a long way, since it's a bit saltier than table salt.  A container this size will last quite a long time.  Not only tasty, but a beautiful and eye-catching addition atop your favorite foods.

review/summary: Just "Salt" (that's nothing special)
review/text: Despite what some reviewers think, "Black Lava Salt," while being "black" and being "salt" has nothing to do with lava. It is sea salt from any of many places around the world that is colored black with activated charcoal. Largely a decorative item. You could take Kosher salt and make this stuff yourself, I suppose. As a geologist, this current paroxysm about different salts seem inexplicable. NaCl is NaCl (or the mineral halite). Your taste buds are attuned to it in a very restrictive sense, regardless of the presence or absence of trace amounts of coloring stuff--it all tastes virtually the same--your tongue sees to that. Spend you gourmet $$ some more useful way!<br /><br />By the way, a pinkish-orange coloring in NaCl may be KCl (commercially, "nosalt"), known as the mineral silvite. It has a distinctively bitter bite. (Another tongue taste option.) Maybe some folks like their salt on the bitter side, but most gourmets would probably cringe at the thought of tossing bitter salt on good food.

review/summary: Beautiful black salt
review/text: I bought two of these containers to give as gifts so I cannot comment on flavor.  The containers themselves are very attractive and sturdy and the black salt is very striking.  I didn't give 5 stars because there is some empty space in the container (about half in inch from the top).  It makes it look like it wasn't filled properly.  I weighed it and the salt with the container is 193g (6 oz is equal to 170g) so it's definitely full.  I realize I'm just being nit-picky but appearances mattered to me since I'm presenting it to someone else as a gift.

review/text: I purchased 3 of the black sea salts as gifts for Christmas. I got a confirmation email stating my order would arrive in time for Christmas. In fact it said it would get here on the 23rd of December. Today, on the 23rd I received an email stating they were out of stock. Couldn't they have told me that when I placed my order, not when I was supposed to receive the items?

review/summary: Interesting product, but not highly recommended
review/text: The black salt seems a little bit mouisture.  When you are seasoning in you dish or pan, the black colour may spread over.<br /><br />"Although not as popular as the traditional red alaea salt, hawaiian black sea salt, or lava salt, is a dramatic, glossy black sea salt.  The unique color comes from lava, which adds minerals and activated charcoal which results in a sulfuric aroma and earthy flavor.<br /><br />hawaiian black sea salt is used both as a finishing salt and a roasting salt.  It is often used as a coating on fish to help preserve both flavor and moisture as it bakes.<br /><br />suggested uses:<br /><br />Delicious on all types of seafoods, especially shellfish such as clams, mussels or scallops." - By www.faeriesfinest.com

review/summary: Good Smooth Coffee
review/text: As with any of the K-Cups, if you want it 'strong' always select the smallest cup size (5 oz I believe) if you have that option on your machine. A really decent cup of coffee, that most people wouldn't expect from a single cup machine. I love these for work, they hold up to half and half well. None of these compare to a good strong americano or cafe creme on the ol' espresso machine at home, but at work... I never buy coffee anymore. (Not sure how it is with sugar - never drink coffee/espresso with flavors or sugars, just cream.)

review/summary: One of the best K-Cup bold coffees
review/text: Most of the K-Cup strong brews really aren't very strong when you compare them to Starbucks, and some of them are even rather weak. The Lake & Lodge brew is actually quite good for a  bold K-Cup coffee. I've tried the Timothy's brand but I think this is better. I'm basing this on a 6 ounce serving since some of the Keurig coffee makers can make different sized cups of coffee. Enjoy!

review/summary: Smooth and Strong
review/text: I love this coffee!  I lived in Germany for many years and really came to appreciate good coffee.  This is a very good coffee that is smooth while still being strong.  Smells great and makes a strong cup of coffee at the 7.5 oz size and would make a cup of German coffee at the 5 oz size.  My other favorites are Nantucket Blend and Midnight Magic Extra Bold.  The Midnight Magic will make something close to German coffee strength at 7.5 oz and will make a serious cup of German coffee at the 5 oz size.  The Vermont Country Blend is too weak at 7.5 oz in case you wanted to hear it from me.

review/text: I love this coffee.  In the past I have usually not gone for the darker roasts because they seemed overpowering to me but this coffee is great.  It is not weak nor too strong and tastes great.  Actually, I originally purchased this because I liked the name 'Lake & Lodge' which reminded me of sitting at a lakehouse out front on the porch in the morning with a good cup of coffee in my hand.  Glad I tried it.  This in addition to the French Roast coffee by Green Mountain are my absolute favorites.

review/summary: Good coffee!
review/text: This is the best cup of dark roasted coffee you're ever going to get from a non- Extra Bold K Cup.  It is not bold, and if you are looking for bold, this isn't for you.  If you are looking for a bold cup of coffee from a K Cup, I recommend Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold Special Blend, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2) or Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count Boxes (Pack of 2) for that.  If you are looking here for a medium type roast that has the taste of a bolder roast, this is your coffee.  I think that if you brewed the ground Lake & Lodge in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reuseable Coffee Filter</a> it would be a great, strong cup of coffee.  Nevertheless, this is a good, non-bold cup of coffee.

review/text: I ordered the lake and lodge because the description sounded as if it would be very flavorful. It is not  bad but doesn't taste as it is described.  At times it tastes like burned coffee. It is not my first choice of all the Green Mountain coffees. I prefer the Nantucket.

review/summary: A dark, bold roast that is a welcome start to the day
review/text: Noted as a "West Coast Favorite" this dark roast conjures up a scent of pine needles for me as it brews, a subliminal association perhaps tied more to the blend's name than the actual aromatics, which are pleasantly thick, sweet and strong enough to lift me from a groggy morning.<br /><br />I am still partial to Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, a recent purchase that knocked my socks off. Still, I would place Lake & Lodge a mere notch (star) beneath the Nantucket Blend. The Green Mountain website offers a fantastic description for Lake & Lodge: "This particular blend is very versatile, yet elegant. It makes a great espresso, partners well with cream, and is delicious iced. The flavors of this rich, darker roast blend reflect hearty West Coast style roasts. Dark roasted Indonesian coffees offer bountiful sweetness and syrupy notes. A touch of East African beans adds an element of berry-hued brightness to the blend's bold flavor foundations."<br /><br />I read that the blend's name has a peculiar history, first called "Tapestry Blend Dark" the blend was originally developed for a New York City shop called "The Coffee Station."<br /><br />Lake & Lodge is a better name, a blend that invokes ski resorts and campsites and sleepy mornings when a dark, bold roast is a welcome start to the day.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: Here's my other recent K-cup coffee reviews for Amazon:<br /><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004743O08">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast</a><br />5 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003C4YIFE">Green Mountain Coffee Vermont Country Blend</a><br />4 stars: Green Mountain Coffee Wild Mountain Blueberry<br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL68Y">Tully's Coffee Kona Blend</a><br />4 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KKS">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend</a><br />3 stars: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00390VIQI">Green Mountain Coffee Fair Trade Gingerbread</a>

review/summary: Goes a Long Way!
review/text: My entire family enjoys all the ITO En Teas we have tried so far,which includes the Green White, Rose and Jasmine.<br />Specifically on the green white tea we all find it "easier" than brewing a cup of tea.<br />I've been able to substitute it for my morning coffee,and don't get the heart palpitations. For people who have not yet given up sugar and processed foods,this may seem too bitter.<br /> For those others, it has a pleasant "little bite".<br />  3 of us find it "too activating" straight up,and therefore it can go a long way because we dilute it with water and get 3-4 cups more.I don't see any caffeine listed,but I am not able to drink later in the day and go to sleep at a normal time.<br />  Take the warning seriously about refrigeration after open. I left a bottle out for 3 days and it began to grow something that looked like a mushroom,however I take this as a positive sign as most medicines originally come from plants.<br />  I would like to try ALL the ITO EN TEAS!<br /><br />  Also, I use auto-ship which brings down the price more,and you can always change the frequency at which it's delivered.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017T6S2M">Ito En Teas' Tea Green White, Pure Roasted Green Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Same Old David Seeds
review/text: David seeds used to be really good. The seeds were big and fresh and roasted just right. Sometime in the last 10 years they started being over-roasted and the seeds got smaller. I stopped buying them from my local grocery store because they were usually out of date and tasted rancid.<br /><br />When I saw the David Original Jumbo seeds on Amazon I was hopeful that they would be better. Unfortunately, it was just marketing. The shells may be a bit bigger but the seeds are still small. And though they weren't out of date they're still not very good. And because I had to buy a big box of them I've now got lots of them.<br /><br />In the future I will be buying Giants brand seeds. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P5CSDW">GIANTS Salted Sunflower Seeds (24 - 5.75 oz. Bags)</a> They're much, much better.

review/summary: Best Tasting Mix of Nuts Granola & Berries
review/text: I purchased a can of Planter's Digestive Health Mix because I was looking for a healthy bag/can of mixed nuts/berries/etc. All of the other products on the shelf have carmel coating, cheesy coating, covered in salt, etc. I wanted something that was natural, had almonds, and hopefully some type of decent tasting berries. I am HOOKED! I buy one to two cans a week - they are about $4.50-$6 at my local grocery stores. I wasn't interested in the "digestive health" label and didn't think it would help. I usually "go" every other day or so...well let's just say I have been "going" everyday with ease. Forget painful laxatives or crazy cleansers...this product will help your own body to naturally do what it's suppose to. If you love the taste of healthy granola cereals, you will love the granola clusters in this mix. There are also delicious green pistacios. The cranberries are not too hard, not too soft, and taste great. If you aren't interested in your health, eating better, and you still prefer cheese puffs and coca-cola all day, you may not like this product. If you are like my family and I (seen members have heart attacks, diabetes, and learned junk food just isn't worth it anymore), then you will love this product. As you know, almonds are a great source of the healthy fats your heart needs. The berries contain anti-oxidants that your body needs. I would not suggest eating the whole can the 1st time you buy this product...you will spend the next day in the "office". I suggest eating an ounce or so as a daily snack. I am a 32 year old SAHM that has become a health nut. :o)

review/text: My only beef is that with shipping included, this product is way more expensive on Amazon than at the grocery store.  This is unusual as Amazon is usually a great buy, but not in this case.  I won't buy it again here.  I cannot believe the person that gave this product one star.  Maybe he got a bad batch.  In that kind of scenario, you contact Planter's and tell them why you didn't like the given product.  Usually, they welcome feedback such as this and are more than glad to compensate for any product shortcomings.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5DLA">Planters NUT-rition Digestive Health Mix, 9-Ounce Cans</a><br /><br />Let me begin by qualifying my credentials: I have been suffering from severe, chronic mid-low back pain since 2002 following the degeneration of the discs of my thoracolumbar spines after a bad landing while rappelling during Army training in 1985. Following the original injury, the on-site field medic diagnosed a muscle strain and had the troop clinic had me eating 800 mg Ibuprofen capsules up to 4x a day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the true nature of the injury included damage to the L1 vertebra as well as the supporting disc at L1-L2. Needless to say, I've been taking morphine-based opioids since the late 1990's and have suffered the permanent damage to my upper intestines because of the chronic, severe digestive problems that I've been battling ever since regular exercise became more difficult to perform; the addition of the opioids only made the problem even worse and led to unintentional losses of weight of 25-50 lbs. at a time due to cyclic vomiting of bile and other reasons that prevented a regular diet.<br /><br />This does not even BEGIN to describe the loss of dignity this represents to any one who has to work full-time, frequent doctor visits, surgical interventions for fissures and hemorrhoids, ER visits to break up impacted fecal matter, et al...(I was retired 2 weeks after my 45th birthday, unfortunately); however, I was not able to do my job as I once could and I missed it terribly for many years after the forced disability retirement.)<br /><br />Fast Forward: My beautiful, super-intelligent wife was inspired and brought home some of this stuff to supplement our regular, high-fiber meals at home made just for me (the kids would be malnourished if they consumed the amount of fiber I did!). Within 7-10 days of adding this stuff to my diet, several medical issues were "bridged" and the pain, bleeding, and spasms associated with my irregular habits were largely solved though I must admit that it requires a great deal of experimentation and working with your medical professionals to help this elevate one's Quality of Life above and beyond the normal expected outcome!!!<br /><br />I now know how best to use this tasty, crunchy, versatile mix that includes whole dried cherries (SUPER YUM!) along with "regular" granola and dried fruit mixes...in any event: yum in the tum, wonderful & reliable relief from the opioid effects on the intestines, and a great supplement to the diet on a regular basis. The key is finding some at a comparative price and using coupons is ALWAYS recommended.<br /><br />Best of Luck, particularly if you're suffering from chronic debilitating conditions that require simple, relatively inexpensive yet tasty and easy-to-find alternatives to your meals and snacks.

review/summary: Totally delicious. Some bites taste like cherry pie!
review/text: It's pretty random for me to post an Amazon review, on a nut mix no less, but I'm sitting here at my desk at work eating this and love it. I bought this recently just because it looked good and has pistachios. I tried if for the first time a few minutes ago and YUM! If you get a bite with a plump dried cherry and a nugget of granola, it's like little morsel of cherry pie.<br /><br />The mix also has almonds and some pistachios - definitely fewer pistachios than almonds, though - plus a lot of dried cranberries.<br /><br />All in all, really tasty. And yes, the nuts are hard because, well, they're nuts.<br /><br />As for the digestive claims, not sure yet. But I'm mowing this down with abandon as I type, so I guess I'll find out soon.

It's tastier than a�ai, healthier than maraschino, and though its aphrodisiac qualities have been exaggerated it's more efficacious than rhinoceros horn. If Madame Josserand, in &Eacute;mile Zola's novel Pot-bouille, had had lingon concentrate to mix in her ersatz cassis, rather than cheap plum jam, she might have trapped husbands for her two daughters with half the trouble. You could, of course, use it as it was intended, with sparkling water and ice, "italiensk stil".<br /><br />There are longitudinal statistics which show that the more lingon you consume, the more chance you have of being Swedish. Note, however, that the cost of shipping this product along the Amazon doubles the price.

It's definitely not subtle, but the strong flavor and (I'm assuming) high caffeine content makes a delicious beverage much less shocking than coffee from a stimulant perspective.

review/text: I bought this product because I am suffering from hormonal acne. I researched about this tea and found out that it can aid in hormonal acne. I didn't want to take spironolactone that my dermatologist had prescribed within few seconds of seeing me.(I HAVE VERY MILD ACNE). What kind dermatologist does that?.I actually went to the derm to get advice on anti-aging and blackheads.(I am 27). I want to start my anti-aging regimen now but he prescribed me a hormonal medication (spiro) along with doxycycline(antibiotics). I was not comfortable taking a medication for something that was not so severe to begin with so while researching about natural alternatives I came across pure spearmint tea's similar properties(anti-androgen). I have been using this tea for about a week now and it seems to work wonderfully on my acne. I haven't had flare ups. I am also taking new chapter food based zinc(60mg) and vitamin d3 and b complex. That could have improved my skin too but I don't know. So far I am loving this tea but lets see how it turns out. I also avoid dairy and sugar.

We would snip the plant off half way down, and mom would brew tea from the fresh snips, or we would dry the snips, put them in a gallon jar and have spearmint tea in the middle of winter. Davidson's have a great product if you like spearmint tea. When brewed and the liquid tea is in a glass it looks, smell, and taste just the tea I we had so many years ago.<br />Thanks Davidson's and Amazon for this great product.
