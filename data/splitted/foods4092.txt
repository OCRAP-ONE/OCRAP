review/summary: Very tasty- what you'd expect
review/text: These are very good.  If you like pickled sausage, these are tasty and what you'd expect out of such a snack.  I was looking for the bottled kind but bought these based on the good reviews.  They taste the same as the ones I bought in the jar, but they are very conveniently packed and don't need to be refrigerated.  I'll buy these again.

review/text: These red hots are decent, but not very hot actually. I found them to be a bit on the salty side although not too bad. They have a better texture than many of the individual packaged products and for the cost, not a bad choice if you prefer a milder type of red hot.<br /><br />The service was very prompt and they also sent a free beef jerky sampler. "Their beef jerky is unsurpassed in quality and I would have to highly recommend trying it as I know you won't be disappointed!"

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: Extremely disappointed in the quality of meat.  More the texture of dog food in my opinion, and I have bought pickled sausages from around the country since 1972.  Whoever wrote the review touting the quality of meat must either work there or own stock in the company.  Whomever, I have a few cans of rib eye steak in a can that I will sell you for a good price.

review/summary: A rubber eraser tastes better...
review/text: High rating left me with high hopes. A case of these things arrived and I was giddy to say the least. Tearing into the package, I took a bite. It was horrible. Tasted like card board. Figured maybe it was a dud, I later tried another. Again, same taste.<br /><br />While at work, my roommate who is a huge fan of pickled sausages wanted to try it. I told him to try it and give it a 1 - 10 rating. He rated it a zero, and said it tasted like dog food.<br /><br />My sister wanted to try it, so I let her try it. She spit it out and threw the thing away, saying it tasted god awful.<br /><br />I had my mother try it. She took a bite, leaned out the window and spit it out. I threw away that one too. She said it tasted like rubber.<br /><br />Out of four pickled sausages I have had, I rate these the lowest. Its simple horrible. I'm not sure what to do with the remaining case. If no one likes them, I don't see how I can get rid of them without just tossing them, and I hate wasting food like that. Maybe the cats under my house will eat it...<br /><br />Maybe the whole thing is a dud. Maybe these things are 50 years old and near expiration. I don't know. Maybe its just that our family and friends have our own taste. Whatever it is, its horrible.

review/text: These are good.  I just wish they were bigger and hotter.  The size and heat are a preference thing.  I'm used to pickled sausages being hotter.  These almost don't register heat-wise for me, but I do like spicy things.  I find my self usly eating two at a time.  I'm not saying they don't give you your moneys worth.  The package has alot of sausages in it, and the price works out to be about 60 cents each.  They are just smaller then most.

review/summary: It's a quality product, but...
review/text: After finding out that what we THOUGHT were the best brands (Science Diet, Iams) were chock-full of fillers and by-products, we decided to upgrade our kitty's diet.  After doing some research, we decided to give several brands a try, and this was the first.  Despite quality ingredients, Caesar would not touch this stuff!  Even when mixing it in with a brand that he liked, he completely avoided the bowl altogether.  Talking to several clerks and cat owners, Wellness has a high rejection rate among cats.  Some love it, but many just turn their nose up at it.<br />I'd normally give it one star, but the quality of ingredients in here is quite good, so that earns it an extra star.  But what good are quality ingredients if they never leave the bowl?

review/summary: Healthiest canned food option!
review/text: There is no other canned cat food that I would give to my cat.  If you've done research into the ingredients of cat food and into the digestive system of cats, you will know that there are only a few brands which are safe and healthy for cats.  As I do not have time to prepare cat food fresh from animal meat, this is the best alternative.  One can lasts my guy four days (fed 1/8 of can twice a day along with high quality dry food recommended on catinfo.org).  In response to a comment received on this review, I'd like to be clear in saying that I'm not advocating dry food.  I realize that feeding only this Wellness canned food would be the healthiest option -- or a similar quality canned food.

review/summary: Tuffy's dog toys are superb!
review/text: I have at least 10 "Tuffy" toys and they are all sizes and shapes, with some have squeekers.  I have 5 dogs, 3 labs and 2 misc. mixed breeds.  These dog toys are so great, the only thing my dogs have been able to do is unravel a small area, which did not affect the toy as they are repeatedly reinforced. Every other toy I have purchased and wasted money on, my dogs have destroyed.  These are expensive, but are well worth the money, because they last!  Remember, I have had 3 rescued (unstable) Labs!!!!<br />I would stick with the ones that have a lot of black stitching (octopus, alligator, boomerang) and not so much animals with filling lamb, bull,etc), as the material they use for the  first ones, the body and seams is very strong.  They also have a rating of strength, if you want to look that up, 1-10, 10 being the toughest.

review/text: My just-turned-two-year-old lab loves these toys! She does eventually bite through all the layers and rip out the stuffing, but she then enjoys the carcasses just as much. She loves to play tug, fetch, and keep away with them, and just chews them for quiet time, too. I like that they are pretty hardy, but something soft to give her mouth a break from the REALLY hard plastic bones that she also chews.

review/summary: My dogs FAVORITE toy!
review/text: I have a 4 month old Doberman puppy, and as you know, a teething puppy needs alot to chew on.  He has many toys, including a tuffy pig, but this alligator is his absolute favorite.  He likes to basically "hug" it while chewing its head.  Like some other posts had already warned, he did manage to make a hole in the top of the toys mouth, which, now is a stuffing dispenser.  But none the less, he love, love, loves it!  His joy is such that picking up the stuffing is worth the trouble to me.  After all, once he got most of it out of the head, the mess slowed down considerably.  It took him about a month to make the hole(and extract the squeeker as well) but even with this damage though, it is still very useable and I expect it to last another couple months.  When the time comes I will definately replace this toy.  Though it is not absolutely indestructable, it is still a good buy compared to other toys on the market.

review/summary: Tuff Toys
review/text: I'm so glad I found this Tuffy line of dog toys. I have two boxers who love soft toys...but until now, I haven't been able to indulge them because they destroy most stuffed toys within a few minutes.  Not these Tuffy's - I purchased several of them, all with ratings between 7-10, and after two months of daily chewing and play, my dogs have been unable to tear a seam, rip off a limb, or destroy these toys.  The only signs of wear and tear appear on the sea creature alligator where one of my dogs has been methodically targeting the decorative "scales" along the top of the toys back.  Still, while a little frayed, this toy is holding up well to the abuse.  I finally just trimmed the stringy parts with a pair of scissors and the toy is back in business.<br /><br />My dogs prefer the animal/creature shapes to the gears and rings. I'm just happy to have stuffed toys to give my dogs to play with -- a nice departure from nyabones and kongs.  I still supervise my dogs while playing with these toys. But I'm so impressed by the durability that I've actually started leaving one of the mega tuffys in my dogs crates when I have to run out for quick errands (an hour or two).  Make sure you check the durability rating to find what's suitable for your dog.  I couldn't be more pleased...highly recommend.

review/summary: Strong Chewers Rip It Apart, Pull Out Stuffing
review/text: My dog swung this around and "killed it" several times then proceeded to find the weak spots (around mouth, sewing on back, etc.)and ripped it open. He then pulled the stuffing out. I just kept throwing the stuffing out. I tried resewing it, but this didn't last long. He has had great fun tearing the empty cover/skin apart piece by piece. The whole disemboweling and tearing to shreds has taken awhile and he had fun doing it. Thus the 2 stars. I do think that an alledgedly "tuff" product should last longer than it did. The first tears happened within minutes. There are far too many weak spots.

review/summary: 5 on the "Tuff scale" and still going strong!
review/text: My 45 pound pup's relationship with stuffed toys (Kong wubba & Hartz tuff stuff) used to be:  I give her the toy.  she tears open a small hole and meticulously removes most of the stuffing. She'd then  bring me the newly limp toy when she gets to the squeaker. I'd remove the squeaker, hand it back so she can finish the job. We'd then play with the toy as rope, or a fairly tough scrap of material until it finally would fall apart completely about a month or so later.<br /><br />Then... I discovered this Alligator. I doubted that the 5 out of 10 rating would be high enough with her destuffing history, but I didn't want to pay SO much money for the higher numbers if they were just going to be the same deal. Also some of the higher tough rating toys can get a bit heavy. This is the perfect size for my dalmatian-sized dog to flip around, wrestle with and carry around. It's been months- at least 6 now- and my pup has only managed to take a small bit out of Alligator's forehead.  I am amazed.  I am on Amazon right now to get her another... not because this one is failing, but because she has this toybox sitting here with her old gross toys looking so ratty compared to the Alligator... :)<br /><br />I do with they would put the "tuff scale" in their description so I wouldn't have to keep flipping back and forth through their site, though.

review/summary: Dissappointed
review/text: I recently order a gary gator tuffy toy for my dog. I am very disappointed and annoyed with this toy! While the body of the gator is pretty indestructible and can withstand tug-a-war, the mouth (which is not reenforced with stitching and is composed of cheap material) is completely destructible.  After 2 tug-a-war sessions, the stitching and fabric on the sides of the mouth have come apart. Luckily my dog was not able to get the squeaker out of the gators mouth, but some of the stuffing did come out. And now I have an expensive toy that has the body intact, but because the mouth is ripped apart and there is stuffing coming out everywhere, I can no longer use it.  I am extremely disappointed, especially because this toy costs so much. What a waste of $20 dollars! The other Tuffy may be better because they don't have open mouths, but DON"T BUY THIS ONE! I sent the company an email to see if they will refund or send me a different Tuffy, I'll keep you updated to see if they are willing to resolve the matter, since a believe in buying merchandise from companies that are ethical and you may too:)

review/summary: Really IS a tough toy!
review/text: We have a boxer and a border collie.  The boxer in particular is a very tough on toys, and truly enjoys ripping and de-stuffing them.  Normally we are left with "pelts" from plush toys in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />We bought the Tuffies lobster and alligator last year for Christmas for the dogs.  We did not expect them to last so long!  Both toys are 11 months old now.  The lobster has nearly reached the point to be thrown away - all the legs are gone, but the body is still intact.  The alligator is only missing the very tip of his tail.<br /><br />The best part about these toys is that since the dogs have learned they cannot destroy them, they have become a more interactive toy for tugging and fetching.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toy for dogs that like to destroy their toys - this is the first plush toy we have had to last more than a week - its going strong after 11 months and still a favorite!

My dog is not a chewer, but he does like to shake his toys while he's playing with them.  This one lasted less than 10 minutes before his front canine tooth went right through one of the legs.  It was all over after that.  I have to say though, the stitching does seem to be very good around the edges and if you have a dog that likes to chew the arms and legs, ears and noses off of his toys, this may hold up for a little while.  However, when a company uses words like 'extreme durability' and 'world's tuffest dog toy', I base my purchases on those descriptions- especially when buying on the Internet.  I just wish this toy had lived up to those descriptions.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:16 Mins<br /><br /></span>u didn't guess is quite an enthusiastic guy when it comes to play time. Since Teddy is so playful it's hard for him to find toys that will be able to stand up to all the wear and tear. So.... if you have a dog and are looking for toys that can stand up to even the toughest dogs I recommend these (especially the aligator - the company who makes these tests them on lions! Yes LIONS so I'm thinking if it can stand up to that it'll most likely be able to withstand a dog.) PS check out the "tuff scale" rating to see how durable each VIP toy is.

review/text: I was a little worried about ordering chocolate online, especially through amazon and not directly from the Godiva website, but I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />The shipping was fast and I was very pleased with the way Godiva packaged their product so that the chocolate wouldn't melt (I ordered in the summer). And apparently they were VERY delicious since I gave it as a gift for my boyfriend's mother... She really liked the box and everything about it - right down to the taste and the unique pieces. I would definitely order from Amazon Godiva again!

review/summary: Full bodied to the max - just great coffee
review/text: I have also just reviewed the French Roast. Both are fabulous for grinding for espresso. Very full bodied, very carefully roasted to eliminate bitterness or that "industrial" taste of some of the better known domestic coffee suppliers. when we ran out of Weavers at the office, that's when the real conversations began, like ... "what was that coffee you had - it was really different and great!" (My opinion for both French Roast and Espresso Roast is based on whole bean which we grind just before using.)

review/text: I'm trying to find coffee I can order over the internet for a reasonable price.  The cost for shipping is usually the problem, so added it on to another order to get it shipped free.  The other order came in good time.  It took the coffee close to a month before it arrived.  It tasted like it'd been sitting in a warehouse the whole time; definitely not fresh.  The roast was also not dark enough for espresso.  Poor delivery, poor product.  This was not my usual Amazon experience.

review/summary: OMG!!!!  Solves that craving!!
review/text: Oh, YUMMM!!<br />These are THE best chips I have tasted in years.  I am allergic to lactose, gluten, soy, mint and grapes, which has made it hard to go through these past several years craving soda crackers or something akin to them, and even trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with a workable recipe I can make for myself.  Now I have found them!  These are my newest comfort food.  Wonderful with a chilled glass of Diamond Almond Milk, and I am that little kid back in the kitchen sitting with my milk and crackers.  The texture and tender-crisp "bite-factor" (to me) is so close to that of good, old fashioned crackers - - and the flavor is just deeply satisfying.  I will be up in the middle of the night snacking on these for sure.  I cannot rave enough about them, but I see that others agree with me in the quality and "yummy-ness" quotient of these wonderful chips!  To me they taste closer to crackers than tortilla chips and that is SOOOO yummy!<br />Thank you AMZ for putting these on S&S!!!  Come next payday I will need to be getting a whole case, maybe 2!!

review/text: My two year old son and I have Celiac Disease. We can't have gluten, because it makes us very sick. We also both happen to have issues with dairy too. It is very nice that there are AFFORDABLE, delicious snacks like this that we can eat and enjoy. My son loves them, and so do I. The multi-grain are the only flavor we have tried, and we are sold! They are so good. I am so happy to have found these!<br /><br />Most gluten free food is very expensive. Like, Betty Crocker's (albeit delicious) gluten free chocolate cake mix is $3.50 a box, and you get half the amount of a regular Betty Crocker cake mix at 98 cents! It is nice when I find great products that taste good and are inexpensive that we can eat. I am so happy that more companies are finally making gluten free foods!

I loved it instant hit with me I would definitly buy these anytime i seen them in a local grocery or back on amazon someday . I think they are unique  and something as I said a different pace and taste definitly worth getting others interested in trying.

review/summary: Good. Different. Not too strong. Could maybe be stronger.
review/text: I'm a pros and cons gal. I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting. Straight up, here's the pros and cons:<br />PROS: Super fresh. Nice portion size, especially because you'll want more than one portion. Attractive on a plate, unlike traditional tortilla chips. Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of "chip-lets" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste. Several people felt it was strong enough. They are definitely worth trying.

review/text: Firstly, these chips look better than how they are depicted on on the bag. With that being said, it's a corn chip that has olive flavor. There are specks of olive in the chip, but being it's a corn chip to start with, it's hard to recognize them. The taste is distinctly "olive" and the salt content is just about right for my taste. I tend to like my chips a bit on the salty side. They have a good amount of "crunch".<br /><br />I can't say whether I'd purchase them again. I suppose if the price was right I would. However, I have issues paying a premium for junk food. You can dress it up in a nice bag, put a great name on it, but it's still junk food- it's a corn chip. I'm much more likely to purchase the better known simple brands carried by my local grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty & healthier substitute for junk-food chips
review/text: Are you the type of person that always needs a side bag of chips to accompany their lunchtime sandwich but then feels pangs of guilt afterward for consuming  that extra 120-200 trans-fat laden empty calories?  If so, FoodShouldTasteGood's line of nutritious tortilla chips strikes an effective balance between satisfying your junk food cravings while providing some nutritional benefit by way of high quality ingredients and a few grams of fiber to boot.<br /><br />The most important factor though is that with their 'Olive' line of tortilla chips (think of a white corn tortilla chip with flavor profiles of black and green olives and a hit of garlic) the taste itself is good enough to convince the staunchest junk-food addicts to reach into that bag for yet another bite.  These chips go well with everything from sandwiches to soups as well as served plain by itself.  These chips are tasty enough with the right crisp texture you've come to know and expect from your standard snack tortilla morsel.  Great product all around.

review/summary: Interesting twist on tortilla chips
review/text: Olives and tortilla chips...who ever though such a combo would be so good? No trans fats, not overly salty, nothing artifical (like the label says...) makes for something a bit different that your typical tortilla chip.<br /><br />You don't need any salsa or cheese on top of them -- the flavor is perfect (if you like the taste of green olives, that is.) You'll be asking for more as the 1 oz. bag will not be enough!

review/summary: they are good and natural
review/text: these are very good tasting and I like that they are all natural no artificial anything. They are more like a tortilla chip. I thought they had a tiny bit of an off flavor and just a bit too much salt but they are good and if you are looking for a natural snack then this would be great with dips.

review/summary: Tasty and Wholesome
review/text: When looking for snack products, I tend to look for those with the fewest artificial ingredients or no artificial ingredients, if possible.  On this count, chips from Food Should Taste Good easily qualify.  All the ingredients are pronounceable and identifiable (quinoa, pronounced keen-wa, is a South American grain).  I have now tried three of the seven flavors, Chocolate, Sweet Potato, and Multigrain, and they all, well, taste good as the brand name implies they should.  The Multigrain chips have a wholesome nuttiness that would go well with a variety of dips (although I'm eating them plain).<br /><br />Best of all, they're kosher, gluten-free, and vegan.  How can one go wrong?

review/summary: Very good tortilla chips
review/text: The taste of these is right between Tostitos Multigrain chips and Original Sun Chips, and that's pretty nice place to be. A little sweeter corn flavor then the Tostitos, but not as much as the Sun Chips.<br /><br />They company/brand/motto of FoodShouldTasteGood lives up to its promise. Even though tastes vary greatly I think most people who like tortilla chips or even thin crackers like Wheat Thins will find these very enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing I thought was funny was that the mini bag seems to be just a scaled down version of the large bag since the picture which they claim is "Enlarged to show texture and detail" is really a bit smaller than actual size (which is about a 2" x 1.5" hexagon).

Love the very subtle hint of garlic but I just don't quite notice the taste of olives. I don't buy the same chips every time I go to stores,  but this is good enough that I will certainly pick up a bag from time to time.

review/summary: Delish!
review/text: These were absolutely delicious.  They came very nicely packaged, with a thick and smooth exterior plastic packaging.  I was a little disappointed that the package was mainly air- there were only about 15 chips in the 1 oz. bag.  However, each chip was delicious and wholesome.<br /><br />They were perfectly seasoned- not too salty, but just enough to bring out the flavor.  The sesame and flax seeds were very evident, and a nice addition.  The ingredients list the chips as being partially made from corn, but frankly, they tasted mainly like whole wheat.<br /><br />I ate them plain, and they were excellent.  I think eating them with salsa would be a waste!

review/summary: Tasty chips
review/text: I love tortilla chips, just good ol' fashioned corn chips with salt on them.  I was curious as to how these fancy tortilla chips would fare.<br /><br />Before even tasting these chips, the bag shows that the company is serious about freshness.  It's tough and a little slippery; I almost couldn't open it by hand.  The chips are little hexagons about 1" in diameter, with the various seeds clearly visible in the chips.  While the corn flavor is dominant, the various other elements of these chips really blend well to give them a unique flavor.  They're not overly salty - indeed, if I had any quibble, it's that a little more salt would be appreciated.<br /><br />These chips would be an excellent choice for finger foods for a higher end dinner party, a date, or just an evening when you want to treat yourself.

review/summary: Pretty tasty chips with no weird ingredients
review/text: These multigrain chips are more like those vegetable/organic/seed crackers than a tortilla chip.  It does taste a bit like a tortilla chip, but most of the flavor comes from the seeds in it.  I don't think they're too salty and the flavor is pretty well balanced.  The thickness and crunchiness is comparable to that of a Wheat Thin.  I only had one chip broken in half in the last bag that I ate.<br /><br />The ingredients list is pretty interesting in that there aren't any long chemical names: stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flour, flax seeds, turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.  Take a look at the gallery above for a picture of the back of the bag.<br /><br />Each bag is 140 calories and contains 7 grams of fat so they make a pretty good snack.

I pulled the chips out and thought they were going to be just a bland chip, but they are very tasty...not too spicy or too strongly flavored either - just right.  I like the thin texture too and at less than a buck a bag, not too pricey as products like these tend to be.

review/text: This product is a perfect size for a lunch-box or a quick snack.  I find it to be hearty and quite filling.  The whole grains are entirely satisfying and work well with most traditional accompaniments for chips.  They are a nice break from the same-old corn chips and all of my guests who have tasted this product find them to be tasty and interesting.  Many have gone on to buy and enjoy this product themselves.  Just like the olive-flavored chips, virtually all the chips are whole and unbroken, which is a nice change of pace from what one gets with most similar products.

review/summary: Tasty, goes well with most dips
review/text: These chips are a nice break from the carbon copy corn-chips that we are all used to.  They have a nice, but not overwhelming, flavor of olive that is really quite delightful and that even people who dislike olives might enjoy.  They go well with guacamole, salsa, one of my favorite spinach dips, vegetable pate and just about any other dip that one might care to eat with it.  They have a hearty taste and texture that is quite satisfying and almost all the chips are whole.  The size is right for a lunch.  Frankly, I cannot imagine anybody not finding these chips enjoyable.<br /><br />I suppose that the only caveat is that if you specifically want the same-old corn chip, then this is probably not for you.

review/text: ...but I guess a little more like a tortilla chip.  I found these tasty and satisying, not quite as salty as the grocery store type tortilla and corn chips (a plus for me).  I didn't taste anything that hinted of olives, though.  Devotees of all-natural foods might be attracted by the lack of GMO ingredients, artificial colors/flavors, preservatives, etc. - that's not a selling point for me, though.  At my age I need all the preservatives I can get!

review/summary: Great taste,all natural ingredients,"iffy" texture
review/text: I'm always in search for good, healthy, whole grain products. When I saw these chips, I jumped at the chance to try something new.<br /><br />The ingredients are superb: it has a corn base, uses non-hydrogenated canola oil, brown rice flour, Turbinado cane sugar, oat fiber, flax seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, Quinoa and sea salt. They are not overly salty like most other tortilla chips, which is a nice surprise.<br /><br />They are hearty chips and hold salsa well without breaking. They have a very good taste - corn, nutty, slight hint of salt, and hearty.<br /><br />My main complaint is with the texture. They're crunchy, but have too much of a cardboard texture for my liking.<br /><br />Overall, they're deliciously healthy chips, if you can get past the texture.

review/summary: Crackertilla
review/text: CRACKERTILLA is a word I came up with because this snack is both a thin, round cracker and tortilla chip all in one.  It is light, crispy, and quite tasty. We strongly sense the company really believes that, "Food Should Taste Good."<br /><br />Although we were skeptical at first, the unique olive flavor attracted us to this product. In addition, there are NO artificial colors, flavors, or GMOs in the ingredients.<br /><br />After opening the bag, we observed an attractive sight and scent and . This product is not like average chips, it has the aroma of real-food. The taste is also unlike any other, not only because of the olive flavor, but because of the marriage between the cracker and tortilla chip. The crispness is just right, and the Olive flavor is included without dominating other ingredients. The one-ounce serving size is just right and allows one to easily travel or pack this with a lunch.<br /><br />Overall, this healthy snack is recommended for both kids and adults.

review/summary: Good snack
review/text: I've tried 2 types of FoodShouldTasteGood chips - the Multigrain and these. I must say, I'm impressed with both. Most snack foods go out of their way to hit you over the head with their flavors. Not so here. The tastes are subtle and interesting. Gourmet snacks, if you like.<br /><br />In character and consistency, I think the best way way to describe these is to say that they are mid way between a regular corn Tortilla chip and a Wheat Thins cracker (though there is, in fact, no wheat in the ingredients). Lightly salted with just a hint of Olive and Garlic. Very tasty and very snack-able.<br /><br />The one-ounce bags, though they may at first glance seem packaging intensive, are a good idea. If you had a big bag of these in front of you, it would take significant will power to stop after just one ounce. The small bags are a crutch for those of us who lack self-control.<br /><br />Another plus: the bag proclaims in bold type, "No Trans Fat, No Cholesterol, No Preservatives, No GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) Ingredients, No Artificial Colors and No Artificial Flavors". 10% of your daily fiber and just 3% of your sodium too! I had them with a cold beer and felt like I was eating an oxymoron.<br /><br />These are a delicious but natural snack. Well worth the 140 calories they cost. But a few words must be devoted to their monetary price. For about 18 bucks you'll get 24 ounces of these - about 75 cents per ounce. Last week, I bought a 17.5 ounce bag of Ruffles for $3.49 - about 20 cents per ounce. That's quite a differential. Whether you're willing to shell out the extra cash for a non-essential snack will depend on your tastes, your priorities and your pocketbook.

review/summary: An All Natural Winner
review/text: Though I like to try and use all natural foods, I will not sacrifice flavor just to "go natural". From the 1st mini-chip to the last in one of the 1 oz snack-sized bags, I was entirely satisfied and will definitely buy these. I started eating the chips plain and, from the 1st bite, found the multigrain flavor satisfingly strong with a just a hint of sweetness that took the edge off the grain flavor. The size and shape of the chips (more like crackers than larger tortilla chips) was good for snacking, plus the thickness provided just the right texture and "crunch" factor.<br /><br />Later I finished the chips with a pesto dip and the complementary flavors worked perfectly: the chip didn't over power the dip, but neither did it roll over and die. I am sure I would enjoy these tortilla chips with other dips.<br /><br />Finally a last observation is how well these mini-chips kept their original shape. Out of the entire (albeit small) bag, only 1-2 chips were broken.<br /><br />An all natural winner that will have a permanent spot on my households snack-food roster.

If you like a very crispy thin chip packed with wonderful olivey goodness and subtle garlic then try these they are awsome! I first tried this companies products from Costco where I purchased their multi grain chips. I was hooked from the first bite and like them even better then the olive ones but they are both excellent chips. They are not too salty either which is another reason I love them. The grainy taste is nutty and a little sweet and addictive. The little bags were not enough I was left wanting more but on the other hand the little bags are safer to have around! You will love these I promise!

I found the chips to be tasty but a little dry and lacking the olive flavor I had expected. I THOUGHT I tasted an olive experience in the first bite but did not taste it again. By saying I thought it was dry may have been the thought that the product may have been a little old OR had the same sensation in my mouth as stale varieties I have bitten into in the past. Was pleasing enougha but I can't honestly say I would purchase again.

review/summary: Excellent, natural chip
review/text: You won't find any MSG, hydrogenated oils, or various things that most people can't pronounce and have no idea what it actually is in these chips.  What you WILL find, however, is a very flavorful chip that has enough flavor for eating plain, but not too much flavor for dipping.<br /><br />While I couldn't really taste a true "olive" flavor, I think that the olives mixed with the garlic salt provides a very subtle flavor that is more robust than plain salted chips.  Of course, not having an overpowering flavor is a good thing...<br /><br />Texture is important with the foods I eat, and these had a nice firm crispness to them.  Other various natural tortilla chips I've tried (including "store brand" Whole Foods chips) have an off-texture (not quite crisp, not quite stale) that have prevented me from repeated buys.  Not the case with these ones.

review/summary: Pretty good, more cracker like than chip
review/text: These are like a cross between a cracker and a tortilla chip.  Its tastes pretty good but has a sort of a little cardboard like texture.  It would work really well as a dip cracker.  For snacking, I prefer the jalape&ntilde;o chips of this brand, they are pretty tasty.

review/summary: Very good chip!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised with this chip.  It is thick and flavorful.  Good amount of salt, with a hint of other seasonings.  Not olive flavored really, just tastes like a tortilla chip with a little extra flavor.

review/summary: you can actually taste the olives . .very unique
review/text: I like these chips just a bit better than I liked the multigrain version.  The flavor here is unique in that you can actually taste the green and black olives - I think they hit just the right balance here, as well, not too much, not too little.  Salt level is good - I don't care for overly salty chips so these are good for me.  Very textured and multi-level flavor in that you can taste the individual ingredients.  I think they'd go well with a mild guacamole or a smooth cheese and some fruit; nothing should compete with the flavor of these chips.

review/summary: DELICIOUS
review/text: I love these chips.  Wonderfully pristine and interesting ingredients.  1-ounce bag, which is perfect to take to work as an emergency snack if there's no time for a lunch break, has 140 calories, 3 grams of fiber, zero trans fats, 7 grams of total fat (a little high but the truth is sometimes higher fat content equals more filling) and a nice and low 2 grams of sugar and equally nice and low 80 mg of sodium.  I will save the bags and recycle with http://www.terracycle.net/ with my energy bar wrappers.  I rarely eat chips because of weight considerations.  These are definitely worth the calories.  But they could be addictive so I've gotta watch it.  Bottom line:  absolutely delicious and crunchy.

review/summary: super yummy crunchy
review/text: These were surprisingly delicious. Excellent texture, like a hearty tortilla chip, yet very crisp. The perfect chip for a hearty dip, and perfect by itself--just enough salt. I don't even like olives, but I loved the flavor of this chip.

review/summary: good
review/text: I love olives and think the taste was slightly more subtle then I would like, but they are still very good chips.  Light and crispy, but very sturdy and can be used for dipping.  Not salty at all.  Seems like a very healthy snack.  I'm really curious to try other flavors as well of this brand.  This is a quality product you will enjoy.

review/summary: Excellent chip!
review/text: These tortilla chips are excellent. Great flavor, good ingredients and nutrition for what it is (low saturated fat, low sodium, HIGH fiber per serving). What a wonderful find for the health conscious consumer. OF course moderation is needed when consuming such a product as it is caloric. But if you are feeling the need for some tortilla chips, reach for these: You won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Tasty chips/crackers
review/text: These get an extra star for being reasonably healthy. They're as tasty as the average corn chip, if not slightly more so (the flavor is more complex), without the same guilt.

review/summary: Yum.
review/text: I really like the flavor of these chips/crackers. The sesame seed flavor really pops after a few bites and they aren't dry in your mouth like some other multigrain products. They are a tad stale feeling, but I think that's intended and it doesn't mean they're old. With that said, I enjoyed my first bag. If I see these in a local store I will buy them again.
