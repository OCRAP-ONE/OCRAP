review/summary: Not as Minty as I'm used too...
review/text: I'm a FOOL! I got sidetracked by the words "Moroccan Mint," and forgot the green tea aspect. For me, this tea, although decent, has a green tea after taste. Well, duh, it has green tea in it! I was thinking it would be like Stash's Morcorran Mint, and that tea I LOVE.

review/summary: Starbucks coffee Blond Veranda Blend
review/text: Call me a wimp, but this is the first Starbucks coffee I can drink straight without adding an ounce of chocolate powder.  It is smooth, mellow, and after about 6 cups on a foggy day at the computer, your teeth are not grinding and you are not shouting at everybody in the house.  Since I am now single (might still be married if I had drank this) I think it is great.  My former wife like really strong coffee, one cup and thats it - I like to drink it all day long.  With this I can drink all day and when I walk to the gym, police no longer watch me and I no longer stand in the street and shout at drivers who irritate me.  Love it, and it does not taste like it was burned (I think most Starbucks is too strong and over roasted).  For mellow, this is it.

review/summary: Great help for on a difficult problem
review/text: We ordered some Starbucks coffee from this organization.  When we received it on Friday, from the post office, the package had been opened and the item was removed.  The post office delivered the package and marked "opened and no contents inside".  I contacted the company and they promptly responded requesting a picture of the package so they could approach the post office and attempt to resolve the issue.  I indicated that my dear wife is a neat freak and had already removed the labels from the package and shredded them and thrown the package in the dumpster.  The company indicated that this would be no problem and sent us a replacement order.  Not often we get to deal with reputable individuals and companies these day.  Thanks.

review/text: This is great coffee. It's smooth and definitely not for those who prefer strong coffee. But i wanted to let everyone know that Starbucks stores are now offering free taste testing of the bold, medium and blonde flavors of coffee. Also they are giving away samples of ground blond coffee (8-10 cup packs). So hit all the Starbucks in town and score some free coffee! I don't know how long the promotion is going on but I am sure there are more details on their website. Happy Coffee Drinking!

review/summary: The best grits ever
review/text: I have tried different brands of grits and find this one to be the very best. Even though they are quick cooking grits, you can cook them as long as you need to. Their flavor is also better. I would buy again. My favorite recipe is: Creamy Grits-2tbs salted butter or 2tbs unsalted butter +1/4 tsp salt. 2 cups water,1/2 c stone ground grits. 1-2 c milk, half n half or stock.Drop the butter into water,bring to boil.Stir in grits, return to boil & reduce heat. cook 10 min. or until thick,stirring to prevent sticking.Add about 1/2 cup milk or cream, simmer 10 min. As the liquid evaporates add more milk until its the consistency you want. Can cook up to an hour. Wonderful. recipe from hoppin' John's low country cooking.

review/text: I did read the disclaimer, but was still a bit surprised when the package arrived.  The boxes of grits were nothing like the description.  The photo used in the ad is apparently a stock photo of some kind?  While that was only annoying, what ruined it for me was the fact that these are quick grits.  Please, don't call them Southern Style, if they are quick or instant grits.  I certainly would not have purchased quick grits had that been stated somewhere in the description.

review/summary: Sweet, sweet nectar
review/text: Yuzu is a Japanese citrus fruit, eaten during the winter, sometimes translated as "citron."  It has a very unique and luxurious taste.  I have one cookbook that attempts to replicate the flavor by combining grapefruit, lemon and lime juice, but it just doesn't work.<br /><br />I got addicted to cooking with yuzu when I lived in Japan, as it adds a special touch to many dishes.  The juice isn't used as often as the aromatic peel, but even just splashing some of grilled fish adds a really nice layer.<br /><br />The fruit is ubiquitous and cheap in Japan, costing no more than lemons and considerably less than limes.  There are some growers in California, but the fruit is still too obscure to show up even at specialty grocery stores.  Because of that, even this small bottle of juice is going to cost quite a bit of cash.  I have seen it sell for somewhat cheaper at local Asian specialty stores, but if this is your only access to the product at least it is available!<br /><br />You can get the yuzu flavor in the peppery pesto-like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012X1MJ2">Yuzu Kosho</a>, which is a must in my kitchen.  The yuzu flavored soy-sauce <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIBELG">ponzu</a> is also available for less than the pure juice. (Although check the label. Sometimes ponzu is flavored with another Japanese fruit, sudachi, rather than yuzu.)<br /><br />But be careful.  Once you go yuzu, you won't be going back.

review/summary: Go Raw Granola Rocks this house!
review/text: I have been raw for over 3 months now and I am always looking for creative ways to satisfy my crunchy sweet tooth. Go Raw Chocolate Granola really fulfills my need for chocolate and crunchy cravings! All the ingredients are organic and the seeds/nuts are sprouted to help maintain essential enzymes. Is it really crunchy? Yes. To hard to chew, No. (Well not for me. I always let me granola soak in my nut milk for a few minutes anyways.  I found the agave/chocolate ratio was just right as this granola is not to sweet or chocolaty, it is just about right.<br /><br />I usually have two ounces at a serving which gives me eight servings for the entire bag which comes to about $1.25 per serving for the two-package 16 oz bag combo. For raw food, that is really a decent price.  And I love the fact I get free shipping with Amazon Prime.<br /><br />The fact that it is Gluten free is awesome as I am always trying to avoid gluten.<br /><br />I have tried the Apple Cinnamon Go Raw Granola and really prefer the Chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Happy Raw Eating!

review/summary: Wholesome Product, Convenient, Good Taste, OK Price.
review/text: I am for the most part a health nut.  I am always looking for very healthy food, that is also convenient.  Taste unfortunately has to take a lower priority, and I generally expect to pay more ('you get what you pay for' even applies to food and health; low quality food = low quality health).  I consider this product to satisfy all overall fairly well.  The taste is good considering it is raw and wholesome, however, taste is subjective, you may not agree.  It can be a bit hard, so when I can, I put it in a bowl and soak it in a little water for a few minutes and eat it like cereal.  I think it takes better that way too.<br />Lastly, we'd all like everything cheaper including this product, but I at least like the extra discount I get from the subscribe and save.  It makes a difference.

review/text: I love this product and have been using it regularly for 2 years. Originally, I bought it when I was trying to eat mostly raw food and wanted to make some blender drinks to take with me to work. While I have moved away from the mostly raw food diet, I still use this product several times a week. I put it in a Blendtec blender with chocolate flavored coconut milk or chocolate flavored whole grain rice milk and in 20 seconds I have a very healthy and great tasting breakfast drink that I consume on my way to work. I cannot comment on how it tastes when consumed in other manners, however, I think it tastes great when mixed in a blender with a healthy chocolate flavored milk. I really like the fact I can get this from Amazon on their autoship program as it saved me 30% - 40% off the local health food store price and it gets delivered to my door every month.

This granola is not really comparable to your typical "granola" but it's a nice snack on it's own. It has a subtle cocoa taste, and a nice crunch! But, I did get a little stone in my bag, so be careful eating it. Might not be a good cereal to give kids. I really love that all the grains are sprouted, for better digestability. Plus, my son and I are gluten sensitive, so it's to have another cereal option beside rice chex and all the other gluten free natural cereals out there. Plus I love buckwheat!

Also, it seems like a good snack for kids. However, sometimes there is an unpleasant flavor with the "Tropical Fruit" flavor. It is not pleasant when you get a bad piece of dried fruit in your mouth. I also tried the "Organic Strawberries" and like those better, probably giving them a 4 out of 5. The strawberries are good to eat with dark chocolate.

review/summary: don't buy for travels
review/text: I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food.  However, they are a decidedly poor alternative for travels, since most of the outer coating of the fruit turns into very messy powder.  The strawberry flavor is slightly less of an ordeal in that regards but still messy.  They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.  I've bumped it up from two stars to three, however, after considering how they keep the enzymes intact and don't add sulfites.

review/text: These are very good, but too messy to eat alone as a snack.  The blueberries stained my fingers and mouth.  They are very good mixed with yogurt or in muffins.  Normally, they are a little pricey, but with the instant rebate, they are well worth the cost.

Wether it is blueberries, strawberries, lychees or any other fruit, you will have a bit of a mess from the product. Get over it! Wash your hands, brush your teeth. Now for the item at hand, Blueberries. Typical freeze dried berries with good taste and that wonderful powder! Can not be improved.

review/summary: Really good - little powdery but good
review/text: These taste wonderful.  They are a little powdery, which is to be expected since they are freeze dried, so don't breathe in as you're eating.  Fresh blueberries are better, but these are very good.  I saw a few reviews that mentioned everything arriving as powder, but mine arrived in good shape.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that the only ingredient is blueberries.  There's no sulfur (which I'm allergic to) or corn syrup.  These are good in cereal and as a snack, though you might want to have some water on hand in case you breathe in some blueberry dust.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I don't usually buy these kinds of things, but couldn't pass it up when it was on sale a while back. These tasty, healthy treats are perfect for on the go! I snack on them while I am at school. Some fruits have more flavor than others. Raspberries are probably my favorite. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about them. My only complaint is the price is a little pricey. My girlfriend however doesn't like the tastey treat. May not be for everyone. Taste testing them somewhere could be advised, although I am not sure where you could test them out.

review/text: Taste. A very natural taste. A taste that only God could develop. This is a taste of the promised land (and tastes great with milk & honey). For Weight Watchers folks like me, you'll be happy to know that it's only 2 points / bag. If you're going to a festive occasion, or on a big date, or thinking of using it for your lunch break, stick with Sensible Foods Cherry Berries. But if you're at home, or somewhere where you wont mind getting a little messy, try this. The price is well worth it.

review/summary: Best of the freeze dried, and my whole families favorite flavor
review/text: I started buying these as a "to go" snack for my baby/toddler who is allergic to a lot of stuff.  He loved fresh mangos so I selected this flavor.  Now he loves these so much, he seems to object to fresh mangos.  Now the whole family loves them.  We buy all the other flavors (except blueberries, tried them once -- they'd be okay for baking with, but not a great snack).  I've tried 2 other brands of freeze dried foods and I'd say Crunchies brand is the best -- size of pieces, texture/look of pieces, flavor.  Only improvement would be for it to come in a large cannister size too, and even the 1.5 ounce would be better if it was in a hard sided container like "Just ___________" brand (also okay, but more shrivled up, less like airy).<br /><br />Good Job Crunchies!

review/summary: Low Calorie, Nutritious and DELICIOUS...what more could you want?
review/text: I was at Costco one fine Saturday afternoon when they were handing out samples of the Mixed Fruit Crunchies. I was immediately struck by how flavorful they are! Crunchy, and crisp, not leathery like most dried fruit. On their own they are a fun snack for kids and adults alike. I've also discovered that they make great flavoring agents for frostings, truffles, cakes, etc. I used a mortar and pestle to turn, for example, the strawberry Crunchies into a powder, then used that for the Triple Berry tea loaves and the Strawberries & Cream truffles I made during the holidays. The intense, refreshing, true fruit flavor is what I love about these. And the crunch, but then I'm a texture person!<br />p.s. the other reviewer: It's the banana crunchies you think aren't good, I would bet money on it. My daughter doesn't like them either.

review/summary: Stale and Poorly Packaged - No Reply from Manufacturer
review/text: I've bought these pineapple Crunchies in my local grocery store and they were good (though very expensive at about 6 bucks per serving). So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply. I think the Crunchies people are selling Amazon bad batches. Avoid these at all cost!

review/text: Crunchies Blueberries are my new favorite snack. Mine arrived whole and in good condition. There was some blueberry powder at the bottom of the bags, but this is only a problem if you love them as much as I do and insist on sifting through the powder to ensure you get every last blueberry. I haven't tried rehydrating them, as I like them crunchy, but my experience with other freeze-dried items is that they rehydrate well. Incidentally, freeze-dried blueberries are a lot cheaper than dried blueberries, but they retain almost all of their nutrients unlike regular dried fruit.

review/text: I bought these for my 3 year old.  He looked at them and was very dubious of the square little pieces.  So, I ended up trying them.  They are phenomenal!!!  I was holding my 6 months old (who has so far refused all forms of baby food and has only agreed to try the gerber puffies) and he grabbed one off the table and shoved it in his mouth.  It melted in his mouth and he was hooked.  He ended up eating 7 pieces before I cut him off for fear of giving him too much of something he's never had before.  But they kept him very happy for a while.

review/text: Because of the bulk price and the main image on amazon, I thought the packages would be larger, like a bag of Jerky. Turns out that the image you see is not the packaging that you get, the bags are shorter and smaller (see my customer image). At over $4 a bag ($25/6), I'd be better off buying freeze-dried fruit at the local nutrition shop. Plus the fruit pieces are fairly small; good for kids but I like bigger chunks.

review/text: I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added.  I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?

review/text: Ok, so I have never had freeze dried pineapple before, so I am not sure if they are "good" compared to other freeze dried pineapple. But I found them weird. I mean, they taste like pineapple, but they were not crispy-crunchy like freeze dried strawberries, corn, peaches, and other fruit I have had. The texture of these are not like anything I've had before. As first bite, they crunch a little. Then as your teeth sink in, they are kinda hard-chewy, like those hard caramels. I guess they are just not what I was expecting, based on my other experiences so I was disappointed.<br />I don't think they were damaged in shipment, as it wasn't melted together in one big clump. They were still all individual pineapple chunk pieces.

review/summary: CRUNCHIES IS DISAPPOINTING
review/text: I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there. This snack says it's made in the USA, while most others are imported.  One 1.5 ounce package has 150 calories, which makes it about average on the calorie scale.  "Crunchies" freeze-dried pineapple snacks are not chips, like other freeze-dried pineapple snacks.  "Crunchies" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store.  The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy.  But to me, the flavor was a little bit off.  I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple.  The package states that the only ingredient is "pineapple," so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off.  I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.  A third package was the same.  I will not be buying this product again.  If you are looking for a tasty freeze-dried pineapple snack, I recommend "Funky Monkey" or "Crunchy N Yummy" which are both sold by Amazon.

review/summary: Unique mix of crunchy dried fruit
review/text: Unlike the usual 'leathery' dried fruit, these freeze dried fruits are crispy.  All have excellent flavor, and are great for diabetic meal plans.  Some of the fruit is very fragile, and becomes powdery- however, the majority keep their shape.  Excellent, healthy snack :)<br /><br />Update:  For Pears...  (my review of the mixed fruit came up for this, so have to add, not do an individual review)<br /><br />The pears are good- but not as crispy as the other flavors. There are only 20 calories per package, so fit into a diabetic meal plan quite nicely.  They also have a gram of fiber per package (good for a 20 calorie item).  The pear flavor isn't really strong 'pear', but they're good. I can see reordering them again.

review/summary: Awesome healthy snack!
review/text: I like these so much I enrolled in the Subscribe & Save over a year ago.  It is not the cheapest snack, but I save money by ordering these in bulk through Amazon rather than buying these from my local grocery store.  There are no artificial ingredients or added sugars; this is just fruit.  Yet, this is a great portable snack that will not go bad sitting in your car, or your child's backpack.  I usually keep a supply in my car to satisfy my huger while driving home from work.<br /><br />I completely disagree with the serving size listed on the package.  It claims five servings per bag.  But, if you're eating these as a snack, you'll only get one serving out of a package, maybe two servings if it's for a child.  If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.  You can happily crunch them like potato chips, or to make them last longer, eat one at a time, and let them slowly dissolve in your mouth, like a sugar cube.  Sweet without the guilt.

review/text: I've tried all of the Crunchies fruits, and these are even better than the strawberries -- which is what attracted me to the brand in the first place. No negatives (even the price is decent), though I'd love to see more fruits in their line-up, such as pears and peaches -- and citrus if they come out well from the process. Highly recommended.

review/text: These used to come as small cubes, they were delicious and the kids loved them. They now come as dry mango slices, the kids still love them. Ok, I eat them too. I think the previous formulation was slightly sweeter, and you could put it in cereal and the like, whereas the slices now are larger so you couldn't do that.<br /><br />Not quite sure why they reformulated them - they appear to have been out of stock for quite a while, and then when they were back in stock they are different. However, still good and still worth purchasing as a healthy snack.

review/summary: Freeze dried
review/text: I purchased these because I was curious to what all the different fruits would taste freeze-dried.  I realized that I'm not such a big fan of it because of the sudden transition from crunch to mush in the mouth.  I would rather have actual fruit that retain the crunchiness for me to enjoy as a snack.  However, I think these would be really good to mix into your morning cereal, both dry and with liquid, hot or cold.<br /><br />Half of these packages had a considerable amount of powder at the bottom...so I'm thinking I lost about 10% of the 1.5 oz of product.

review/summary: Real Turkey- Can you imagine purchasing it on AMAZON :/ GREAT STUFF!
review/text: Well, all I have to say is after the 1st purchase I had to purchase more the 2nd time!!! (25)  I did purchase a small amount for a road trip with my kids.  They worked GREAT!!!!  My children have immune system problems and eating real food on a road trip is, well impossible!! We never eat out, and I only eat grassfed, organic, and pastured products, which means I should be living on a farm, but don't!  We eat basically, 80% raw foods mostly vegetables, herbs, and fruit.  Little to never any grains.  Yet, these turkey snack sticks were great for protein on the go, and my family and I never had problems digesting these AT ALL!!  Actually, they are so good, you get full on eating a package, actually stuffed.  So, I know these are the REAL DEAL!  Great for food on the go!! Boy Scouts, Girls Scouts, friends house, even dinners at the in-laws house, and the obvious road trips :-)  Yes, these are great and my kids think they are the best tasting meat snacks they've tasted in years, and I mean years!!!<br /><br />Thanks so much for making these turkey snacks available for the public to purchase!!!! They TASTE GREAT!!!!!  Not too salty, or chewy, and they aren't greasy either.  They're just plain perfect!<br />Thanks Again

But hey, better to spend my money in real food than in doctor bills!<br />Nick's sticks are the best grass fed and free range jerky on the market!<br /><br />These are soft, seasoning is just perfect not only for adults but also for kids. Not bland, not too spicy! The bag is easy to open even for the little ones. Our whole family eats a paleo diet, so finding a healthy alternative for a clean protein snack for the whole family was awesome! And seeing my son's face when I told him I had them specially made for him with his name "Nick"... it was funny! :)<br />Now, if you get addicted to those like our family is, and start buying bulk orders (which becomes a better deal) I recommend you take a look at their own website where you can mix turkey/beef sticks on orders of 6, 12, 24, 50, or 100. Price is about the same as on Amazon if you buy bulk, but with that advantage. And they also have a "club" where you can have monthly delivery set up. Worth it a visit even if just to know who the heck Nick is!<br />[...]

I had expected to receive 24 individually wrap units, then wrapped in a larger Cadbury bag. Unfortunately I can't ship these back because they were a gift to a group of people for today so I am 2 short. :-/<br /><br />The shipping package included cool packs to ensure they would not melt which is great for the summer months! The individual flake bars were all intact.<br /><br />The wrappers are international marked with writing in lots of different languages, I've seen similar wrappers at airports around the world.

He said they tasted exactly like the one he ate growing up. Thank you Amazon! And fyi - they have a dry, brittle texture to them which made me think they were stale when I first opened it but my hubby said they were fresh, not stale, but that's just the way they are, dry and brittle. They kind of flake apart which is where I guess the name comes from.

( We are cadbury flake regulars!), even though the sell by date was not reached. They must be for the Arab world as they had the Arabic writing on  the items. I had used this same seller I thought in the past and got a proper yellow box with the correct number inside. Anyway not the end of the world. I will try to be sure of the supplier next time I order flakes.  I should have sent them back but could not be bothered.

I was expecting layers of honeycomb mixed with layers of chocolate. Not a bad bar, just not what I expected and be be honest not that special either. I wouldn't order them again, there are better candy bars available in the states, much better.

Be sure to put the frosting on while it's warm and let it melt a bit, because the cakes are very delicate. I sprinkle them with colored sprinkles, too.

review/summary: An awesome way to have GF cake on hand anytime.
review/text: We bought this mix because our 7 year old son is gluten intolerant and we hated that he sometimes gets left out of sharing in cake when a celebration comes up and we don't have time to bake something specifically for him.  This has been wonderful to have on hand.  It is very simple and quick to prepare.  You just dump in the pre-measured dry mix, add water with the provided measuring cup, mix, and microwave for a few minutes.  You instantly have a generously portioned single serve cake.<br /><br />The cake turns out with a great consistency, very light and fluffy.  So fluffy, in fact, that it probably wouldn't hold up to anything but the smoothest of frosting.  (I haven't actually tried frosting one myself as we don't normally have that on hand unexpectedly but a topping of sprinkles works great.)  As for taste, it seemed a bit bland to me and not so sweet when compared to regular chocolate cake but my son had no complaints and never failed to finish it all off.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this mix if you might ever have the need for a single serving of GF cake.
