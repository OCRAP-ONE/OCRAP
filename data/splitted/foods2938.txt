review/summary: TASTY AND PLEASING
review/text: I finally found a coffee brand with no bitterness associated.  I would have liked it a little bolder; but for this first time customer of the Caribou brand, I was extremely happy with the flavor and again, no bitterness.  There is no way I can write a 75 word review.  Recommend you try at least one box.  I'm finished with my review.

review/summary: Caribou Blend is Simply THE BEST!
review/text: I bought my Keurig coffee maker back in 2007 before anyone had ever even heard of a Keurig.  I've had plenty of time to sample just about every kind of K-cup out there and have finally settled on Caribou as the absolute best.  It is smooth, not bitter, and has a touch of sweet.  Once I found this coffee I don't even bother ordering other varieties any more because they just don't measure up.  Caribou really has it down!  This coffee is not too weak (like many of the Green Mountain flavored coffees) nor too strong (like some of the dark roast varieties) and tastes absolutely divine with cream and some sweetener.  I usually drink it with half n half and a sugar-free sweetener but it is also great with Coffee Mate Italian Cream non-dairy creamer.  If you haven't tried this coffee yet, you will not be disappointed!

These are NOT the same flavor; they're OK but nothing like Barnum's. I'm giving most away.

review/summary: I know the other reviewers really liked this, but I didn't...
review/text: I like a fairly strong cup of coffee.  Since it's French Roast, and labeled as Bold, I assumed that Tully's version would be.  Unfortunately, to me, at least, it's pretty weak stuff.  It may be better if your Keurig can be set to brew a small cup size...ours is fixed at roughly 8 oz.<br /><br />I personally prefer:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBW">Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso Extra-Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>,<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFT88">Coffee People Extra Bold French Roast Decaf for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> and<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVAO">Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> for decaf coffee.<br /><br />For caffeinated, I like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>],<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ220I">Coffee People Santa's Buzz K-Cup for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups</a> (when it's available), or<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM">Emeril's Big Easy Bold Coffee for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />I think all six have much better flavor than Tully's French Roast.

review/summary: Tully's decaffeinated coffee
review/text: Having tasted numerous coffees in the "K" cup design and suffered through diluted, bitter tasteless coffee, this French Roast  from Tully is really hard to distinguish from non-decaf coffee.  I drink between 6-8 cups a day, and I'm pretty finicky as to what I drink.  Frankly, I could drink this all the time and not suspect it's decaf. I like the aroma as it's brewing and the taste which calls for two cups instead of one!!  You can't go wrong trying this coffee and I think you will like it.

review/summary: A decaf that's really good!
review/text: I'm a fan of Tully's in my Keurig, and coming up with an evening brew has rounded out the single cup beauty of the machine.  If you like the "medium roast" type of coffees, this one will please, as you hardly notice any difference in flavor except that you know that only the caffeine is missing.  It's really nice to enjoy a late night brew without the fear of a sleepless night.  Good, smooth, bold flavor, one of the best I have tried so far.  Amazon service is great as always.  The double pack saves money, and stocks the shelf as well.  I'll reorder when the first box is gone, its that good.

review/summary: The best decaf
review/text: Almost a year ago now I suffered from 4-5 debilitating cluster migraines a week that were killing me.  Then I read some article online that lead me to believe the migraines might have been triggered by caffein.  So I completely stopped drinking caffein about a year ago.  It was very hard to stop drinking caffeinated coffee (and soda) but it was worth it because it successfully reduced my migraines from several a week to about ten in a year (and two of those migraines were caused by drinking unlabeled Amish root beer which must have caffeine in it).  But, I still missed the comfort and taste of morning coffee and holding a warm mug in my hand while sitting on the porch wrapped in a blanket and the smell or going to coffee shops.  After no coffee for several months, I tired decaf for the first time and experienced no headaches, but the taste was so bland that it wasn't worth the calories.  I experimented with many different decaf brands, including Starbucks.  This past weekend, I visited my cousin who insisted I try this brand.  And, hellooooo!  This is what I remember coffee tasting like!!!  It's smooth, bold, strong without making you spit it out, it has flavor!  It doesn't leave a gross taste in your mouth!  I didn't believer her that it was decaf, but I did not get a migraine!  So here I am on Amazon to buy myself some of this, although I'd prefer to purchase a bag of these beans rather than the K-cups, which I find wasteful.  Unfortunately the bags of the coffee are currently unavailable.  I highly recommend this brand and blend of coffee.

review/summary: Rich flavor, no bitterness
review/text: I choose French roast coffee, as in my opinion, lighter roasts become weaker flavored if one selects the larger cup size. This coffee tastes rich and smoky whether served hot or cold, and for connoisseurs of satisfying, truly flavorful coffee, this will not dissapoint. The extra bold flavor stands up well to the addition of cream, so chilled coffee beverages are delightfully flavorful.

review/text: Strong coffee is enjoyable to me, but Tully's Decaf French Roast has an acrid, burnt taste that I don't enjoy.  I can choke it down by adding lots of creamer. Timothy's Rainforest Expresso Decaf makes a strong cup with a smoother taste.  I understand that the French Roasts have a stronger taste. I've used Starbucks French Roast in the past in my drip coffee maker and was pleased with it.  This variety is almost undrinkable!

And it is just as fresh and tasty. (all well before their printed expiry dates)<br /><br />Both were at a cost of roughly 60-70 cents a cup. Pretty reasonable. I was able to find it at the same price in a local store, but if you cannot the Amazon price is very fair!<br /><br />I usually enjoy Starbucks or Newmans-Own brand dark/bold roasts. But I will now add Tully's brand to that list.

review/summary: one month of use made a nonbeliever out of me
review/text: In reading all the reviews of different decaf k-cups, the opinion I came away with was that Tully's was where I should go to get a really bold, dark roasted flavor similar to Starbucks' coffee. It does get closer to Starbucks than any of the other decaf k-cups I have tried. But in a way it goes too far and results in a somewhat strange and overpowering taste.<br /><br />I had tried Timothy's decaf and Newman's Own decaf, with the latter vastly superior to the former. I would say Tully's beats Timothy's (which is just brown water), but probably not Newman's. I also tried Donut Shop decaf simultaneously with Tully's (I had Donut Shop at work and Tully's at home). For the first few days, I thought Donut Shop was a little weak and I liked Tully's better for its bolder flavor. But after a couple of weeks I grew tired and a little sick of Tully's strong taste - it's not just strong like a normal cup of Starbucks, it's strong almost like they added some kind of artificial chemical to it to make it taste darker or more burned than it really is. After one month I was long done with the Donut Shop and was just slowly getting through the Tully's (diluted with lots of milk).<br /><br />When I reordered, I only considered Newman's or Donut Shop. I couldn't bring myself to drink another cup of Tully's. It's a shame because they definitely took a step in the right direction with their stronger flavor, but it was a misstep that makes the coffee a poor choice for long-term consumption.<br /><br />Perhaps a good strategy for a newcomer would be to order Tully's AND another brand or two like Newman's and Donut Shop, and trade off which one they drink. That might make Tully's flavor less grating over time

review/summary: The Absolute Best - No Exceptions!
review/text: First a comment on the Natural Flavor - As many other reviewers have noted, the natural popcorn is absolutely unique and delicious, coming out of the microwave crisp and staying that way, even if stored overnight in a Ziploc bag. Unlike air popped corn it is not at all dry and even somehow manages, for me anyway, a light butter flavor. It is lightly salted which is perfect for me. My husband adds salt to his.<br /><br />As others have noted with all flavors of this popcorn, microwave timing can be a bit tricky. -Keep it in there long enough and nearly every kernel pops but you might wind up with a few on the extra crispy side.<br /><br />My reason for mentioning the natural flavor first is that it will always be my all time biggie favorite and is the basis for this product. Right now however, I am loving the "Sweet & Salty". It has the same attributes of the natural flavor with just a hint of sweetness that is very pleasant and satisfying.<br /><br />Man do I love this stuff - I think the family is planning an intervention based on stash I keep in pantry to ensure there is always some on hand.

review/summary: Great Product for Protein
review/text: I was instructed to increase my amount of protein daily and I am not a real meat eater.  I tried different protein drinks and was not satisfied because they made me feel full and I was not trying to suppress my appetite, plus many of them had ingredients that didn't appear natural or had added flavoring and sugar and I am trying to stick with natural products.  I was already eating egg white straight from the egg but was getting tired of that and decided to give this product a try.  I now use this everyday, I put it in my freshly juiced vegetable juices, I add it to my freshly juiced smoothies and it is great.  I even put it in my oatmeal and bake it for a real treat adding agave nectar as a sweetner. I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone trying to increase their protein intake and not trying to suppress their appetite.  I would also recommend it for anyone just looking for a cleaner way to crack an egg and use just the egg whites.

review/summary: Expensive and hard to use
review/text: This product is far more expensive than just buying fresh eggs and throwing away the yolk.  They are hard to mix well, which makes them unsuitable for direct cooking, as in an omlette, or in situations where the whites must be well beaten before using.<br /><br />In addition, the extremely "fluffy" nature of the powder as it is packed makes it very difficult to measure properly.  Do you measure it packed or loose?  The extreme imprecision of the lousy volume-based directions makes it a tough sell for tricky baked goods, like airy cakes.<br /><br />There are other egg white powders out there that do a far better job for far less money.

I could just separate eggs and it would actually be a little cheaper, but I hate to waste the yolks or force myself to make something that calls for the yolks, like flan, which I don't eat as often.  The only thing you really need to know is that you do have to wisk them well so that you don't have lumps which bake up as small white rubbery blobs that is not pretty and feels like trying to chew a rubber band.  This is a must have in the pantry if you bake as much as I do.

I use 1 tablespoon in a blender along with skim milk, fruit such as banana, 1 scoop of a dry greens product, and 1 tablespoon of a nut butter.

review/summary: Freakishly Sticky
review/text: I rarely buy eggs and when I do I have to think of ways to use the leftovers before they spoil.  So I bought a container of Just Whites to keep conveniently in the cabinet.  I thought it would be great to have around anytime I wanted to make something and not have to go to the store to buy eggs or worry about having more than I needed, but I don't like using this product.  The powder is ridiculously sticky, making it difficult to use.  When mixing with water like the instructions say the powder simply sticks to the fork or whisk in clumps and won't combine with the liquid.  It has replaced egg whites in some baked goods I've used it for but Just Whites has been more of an annoyance than a convenience.

review/summary: Delicious source of antioxidants
review/text: Those who are tea lovers will undoubtedly find this product quite delightful. Unlike most decaffeinated teas, the flavour is rich and aromatic. It does not taste at all like espresso coffee (which I'll admit I found initially disappointing), but is an exceptionally flavourful tea.<br /><br />I prepared the tea in three ways - in a stove top espresso pot, then in a French press, then with an infuser in a teapot. Though the last manner isn't recommended by the instructions, it worked very well, and flavour with the brewed espresso pot was very fine as well. The only drawback was in using the French press, though the flavour remained excellent. The grind of the tea is too fine for the press, and I found that it made using the plunger very difficult - I was fortunate that the pot was of stainless steel, because a glass press may have been damaged in the process.

review/summary: Heerlik! A User's Review
review/text: I'm very, VERY pleased to have the opportunity to help bring this product to the attention of American consumers because I've been enjoying it for the past two years (a friend brings it from South Africa when he goes home between semesters). My review will try to supply some background on both rooibos and the product itself, after which I'll provide what I hope are some helpful tips for enjoying and appreciating red espresso.<br />Rooibos (literally "red bush" in Afrikaans, pronounced more or less "ROY'-bawss") is a shrub that grows in South Africa which tea-deprived Afrikaaners discovered made a not-too-shabby substitute for tea when dried and oxidized. It turned out to have been a fortuitous discovery because research seems to support claims indicating that rooibos contains lots of healthful elements and provides a high level of antioxidants without caffeine. It  has a pleasant, sweetish taste (nothing to which I can compare it--sorry) and though most folks prefer it sweetened (a spot of agave nectar is the perfect complement), with or without a splash of milk, it's quite nice straight up as well. It also blends beautifully with spices and makes a fabulous chai (check out Rishi--they have excellent rooibos-based chai blends).<br />Interestingly enough, red espresso also came into being as the result of desperation. It seems the founder of the company was jonesing for an espresso and, finding the cupboard bare, it occurred to him that perhaps substituting the rooibos he DID have on hand would provide a temporary fix. Lo and behold, his espresso maker produced a deep brew that actually had a crema! Seeds sewn, he began to experiment with different grades of rooibos and then with different cuts in an attempt to develop the best-tasting, most robust rooibos possible--one that would hold up to espresso brewing. Red espresso was born!<br />Red espresso is a much heavier brew than other rooibosses I've tried, even when prepared by drip method (you can use a Chemex or other some such for this). You can also, I imagine, use a French press. However, the best way to prepare it is in a stovetop espresso maker such as a Bialetti Brikka. The last time I checked, red espresso wasn't completely approved for espresso makers but that might have changed by now--it's been two years since I read that. Simply use the same routine used for coffee: fill the tray with red espresso, fill the pot to the correct water level, and heat until you hear the "pop." You're now ready to have fun with your red espresso shot (I've read on coffee sites that the two-cup stovetop makers produce better results than the four-cup models that are most often available here in the States--shop around).<br />The company's Web site has some wonderful recipes and suggestions for red espresso; have a look: http://redespresso.com/ (hit the link for "red drinks"). It's delicious  (and beautiful) in shakes and smoothies, and there's a really nice recipe that floats red espresso on apple juice, although it tastes better with a natural, "cloudy" apple juice than with a clear one. Get creative!<br />I e-mailed the red espresso team two years ago after first trying it (I'd stumbled onto the Web site and asked my friend to bring me some) and they actually called me to chat! When they e-mailed me a few months ago to announce that Amazon would be carrying it, I replied that I suspected it would turn up in Vine, in which case I'd be able to review it and they wrote back that it was indeed slated for Vine and that they were eager for my review. I've been holding my breath ever since, especially since it didn't show up last month. I've been hoping ever since that not only would red espresso take off in a big way internationally (it's apparently very popular in South Africa), but that I'd have easier access to it. With any luck and Amazon's help, fulfillment on both counts is looking good!  :)<br />If you have any interest in brewed beverages and want to experience something that's healthful, delicious, and novel (stovetop espresso makers are fun to use), by all means, give red espresso a "shot," especially if you already have an espresso maker of some sort that doesn't involve pods (feh). You can always try it with the drip method to see if you want to make the small investment required for a stovetop pot.

review/summary: Stong Red Tea -- Not a coffee substitute
review/text: I don't drink coffee but drink several high-end varieties of teas.  In other words, I gave up Lipton years ago.  My normal teas are Oolong, Organic gold bud, Genmai Cha, jasmine and white.  Redespresso does not taste like any other tea I drink but it is very tasty.  I used to make my tea stronger but over time have become used to milder tea flavors.  This tea calls for 12 grams/double shot or about 1/2 an ounce in imperial measurements.  That's about 10 times as much as I'm used to.  If I use what I consider to be a normal amount - say 1 teaspoon to 2 cups of water, I get an excellent cup of tea.  I think the manufacturer is trying to pass good tea off as coffee.  No amout of tea will make a coffee substitute.  So be what you are and call yourself red tea.  Yes, I would imagine at the overdose amounts of tea the instuctions call fot that it would be higher in anti-oxidants.  I also belive I could achieve the same results with just about any other tea -- particularly Oolong.

review/summary: Coffee-brewed Rooibos (Updated)
review/text: The first impression on opening the bag is that it smells very strongly of moist hay.  It is very dusty, reddish-brown in color, and the texture is very fine.  The leaves do not curl like tea leaves.<br /><br />I made the rooibos in both a stovetop espresso maker and in a regular drip coffee maker but I don't have a french press or an electric espresso machine.  I also did not try it brewed loose in a pot because that is not suggested.<br /><br />Compared to normal steeped rooibos, it is a bit stronger and has more body, presumably due to the finer grind.  The stovetop method makes a stronger brew than the drip maker and this presumably has to do with the filter in the drip maker and the higher water temperature and pressure from conversion to steam in the espresso method.  The strength of the prepared beverage is also determined by how much rooibos you use.<br /><br />After each method of preparation, i tasted it plain, with raw sugar, and then with both raw sugar and milk.  I did not try to froth the milk or add anything else because I don't take coffee or tea that way, drinking them plain most of the time, occasionally with milk and sugar, and very rarely with sugar only.  I didn't try it with honey because I did not think the honey flavor would go well with it although I frequently use honey in tea, more often than sugar.  I prefer the stovetop espresso method taken with sugar only.<br /><br />The prepared beverage certainly has a beautiful, rich color, quite remarkable, like old cherry or mahogany.  The flavor is similar to the smell, a bit like green tea with a strong moist or even musty hay- or grass-like flavor that lingers on the tongue for a very long time, over an hour.  It is a quite complex flavor, definitely not one-note.  I don't particularly care for the taste, I must confess, but I am rating it on quality, not on my personal preferences in hot beverages.  I wouldn't hesitate to offer it to guests, especially if they had never had rooibos.<br /><br />I am not impressed with it as a substitute for coffee or tea as a way to avoid caffeine because decaffeinated versions of both coffee and tea are readily available.  The health appeal doesn't seduce me, either, because I know of no reliable independent research clearly demonstrating favorable health outcomes in humans from drinking rooibos.  Because of the price, I would experiment with regular loose-leaf rooibos and run it through a coffee grinder or food processor or even a blender if I decided that this were something I wanted to drink on a regular basis and that achieving a fine grind was important to the final product.<br /><br />The novelty of preparing rooibos with coffee equipment and the stronger than average brew that lends itself to fancy methods of presentation should appeal to many and from that viewpoint I can give it a favorable rating.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />What a mess!  I just made another pot with an electric drip machine and this time the filter completely clogged up and the brew overflowed all over the counter and clean floor (mopped it yesterday) and even got into the heating element of the Mr. Coffee.  Make sure if you use an electric drip machine that you don't leave it alone while brewing.  Better yet, use a different method of brewing.<br /><br />It is interesting that I actually used less of the rooibos this morning than I did during the original test.  I use standard paper filters.

review/summary: Very good sipping beverage.
review/text: I am a coffee drinker who usually uses Keurig machines and pod coffeemakers as I really don't like coffee that's been sitting in a pot for a while.  I got this product to try as I had read good things about the antioxidants and wanted to see how I liked it.  I don't like green tea at all and have been struggling to force myself to drink it now and again for health reasons.<br /><br />When I first got the product, I was like, now what??  I don't have an espresso machine although I do have a French Press.  I took it to work with me and after a few cups of coffee decided it was time to try it out.  We have a Melitta One pod machine there and one of the guys bought some Melitta FilterPads so we could make our own pods.  I filled a pod with the Red Espresso, tossed it into the One machine, and fired it up.  A few minutes later I had a cup of dark red liquid.  After adding creamer, the beverage was an interesting dark brownish red color.  It smelled good and the first sip was very pleasant.  The flavor is very mild with very subtle flavors.  It didn't taste like tea or coffee, and while the flavor is very mild, it doesn't taste watery either.  I liked it very much and can't really say why.  I felt good after drinking it.  I had a few more cups that day and liked it better each time.<br /><br />I stopped on the way home and bought a mini stovetop espresso maker. This made an even stronger, redder drink.  I also tried it in my Keurig reusable filter.  I got good results with this too, but actually liked the drink I got from the pod coffeemaker the best.<br /><br />I have begun adding a touch of cinnamon which is very nice, and will try adding some chai spices when I make it in the french press.  I think that will be outstanding.

review/summary: Flavorful Tea Uniquely Strong But Not Bitter
review/text: Espresso tea is quite obviously strong tea. I do not particularly like strong tea because it is almost always bitter. The redespresso tea is smooth and richly nuanced -- yes, I said nuanced. There are layers of flavor and all are pleasant -- no cloying fruity flavors -- it is decidely tea, and absolutely delicious. I drank it hot, but it will make wonderful ice tea -- and a little fresh mint would be perfect in the glass. As soon as I tasted it, I knew it would be great as an ingredient in jelly, cookies, sorbet and even chili (where I would normally add a little cocoa for depth.)<br /><br />So why four stars instead of five? I made the mistake of brewing the tea in my automatic coffee maker. The package indicated this was an acceptable method (or you can use an espresso maker or coffee press.) And, although I followed the instructions on the package to the letter, the tea swelled up and impeded the water from passing through to the pot. I ended up with 2/3 of a pot of delicious espresso tea and the rest of the water and tea were splattered all over the coffee maker and counter. Next time I'll just use my coffee press.

review/text: This review is only based on the espresso brewing method. I used a Racillio Silvia espresso machine. I've tried making both hot (Red Lattes, Red Cappuccinos, Red Americano) and cold (Iced Red, Red Fresh) drinks with good results. My favourite so far is the Iced Red.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Tastes great.<br />- Naturally caffeine free.<br />- Health benefits.<br />- Vibrant red/orange colour.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Can be pricey.<br /><br />Tips:<br />- Do not tamp. Just level.<br />- Pre-infuse by wetting the grounds and wait ~15 seconds before brewing.

review/text: This tea has a storng medicinal flavor. I can not drink it without adding a LOT of lime. I will never buy it again and could not recommend it to anyone else.
