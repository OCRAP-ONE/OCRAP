review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I have been drinking Tully's Kona for the past 2 years, but with the price increase of kona, I needed to find something less expensive. After trying numerous kcups, this Mahogany is just as good as the Kona, with a full coffee flavor, and a hint of caramel. I am happily converted.

review/summary: Yummy coffee
review/text: I enjoyed this because of the full taste I get out of it without it being too bold or having a burnt taste.  To me it is a bit above the medium blend.  I do take creamer with my coffee so the boldness may be tamed down. I will definitely order more of this when I'm am out.

review/text: Of all the coffees I've tried -- and I've tried A BUNCH -- this is hands-down my favorite.  Great bold taste but no bitter aftertaste.  I drink coffee all day, and I like it strong and fresh.  It can be difficult to find a stronger tasting coffee that's really great without cream or sugar, I drink my coffee black.  I've not yet found anything I like better.  Yum...

review/summary: Nice smooth flavor - but not strong enough for me
review/text: Too mild for me... I like a strong flavor. My wife likes this coffee. Has enough flavor and boldness to keep it enjoyable and not feeling like water downed coffee. If you like strong, bold coffee, you will be disappointed. For a mild coffee, I found this good, but not good enough to warrant the higher cost over many of the other brands.<br /><br />I will not be re-ordering Caribou Mahogany. My wife prefers Donut Shop brand over this. Again, not strong enough for me, but still makes a good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Best K-Cup to Date
review/text: If you're a fan of full-bodied coffees, give this one a shot.<br /><br />For my taste, the vast majority of k-cups are too watery and weak (even on the small cup setting), so I gravitate towards the extra-bold varieties.  I had previously been enjoying Newman's Own Extra Bold and GM Dark Magic.  After reading some favorable comparisons between those and Mahogany, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />I find that it's slightly less bitter (not that bitter is bad) than Newman's EB or Dark Magic, and a little smoother.  I also think it's more full bodied without any burned bean flavor.  I've tried the Mahogany on the larger cup setting and actually still liked it -- something I've never said before.

I received a sample and it sat in the fridge for a good week before I was brave enough to give it a taste.<br /><br />At first sip, it was much sweeter than I expected it to be. I could certainly taste the pineapple, but the coconut flavor was much more pronounced than I thought it would be. It was good! I very much enjoyed the taste of the drink. It was exotic and refreshing. It was much fuller in weight, as I was thinking it would be watery with a mild flavor.<br /><br />The box reminded me of those chocolate milks that I buy for my kids, but it didn't detract from the flavor.

Also, I have had no problems with delivery.<br /><br />Unfortunately, IPROZON has just lost my business.  I didn't mind paying $15.00 for a case of 12.  I will not, however, pay $39.95 for a case of 12.  That is robbery.  I can walk into Fred Meyer Grocery and buy a case of 12 for $17.88.  Plus there are other sites still selling it for $15.00 per case.  I noticed IPROZON is still selling the other flavors of ONE coconut water for $15.00 for a case of 12.  So what on earth are they thinking.<br /><br />I am quite unhappy with having to trust one of these other sites with my credit card information, but I am willing to do that versus paying nearly $40 for a case of 12.  Quite ridiculous.

review/summary: If you're looking for something a little more "Pina Colada" this is it
review/text: I was exhausted, hot, and dehydrated when I spotted this in a concourse store at JFK airport.  I was about to get on a 6 hour flight and water sounded too unsatisfying - but juice sounded too heavy.<br />I'd heard the rumblings about coconut water so I looked to see if I liked any of the flavor options - I can't stand mango and just about everyone adds it. I was relieved to see the O.N.E. coconut water with a "splash of pineapple" so I figured I'd give it a go.<br />The woman at the counter said "are you sure you want that? It's $4." Steep! But it's an airport, what can you do? By that point I was so wanting to try it I said sure.  After all, it would've been $3 for a sticky sweet soda.<br />I was so happy with it that I kept the empty tetra pack with me the whole time I traveled so I would know which one it was.  It doesn't taste heavy (in case the pina colada reference made it sound that way) but the pineapple takes the edge off the green coconut water.  It's amazing.<br />I was happy to find it on Amazon - as I'm definitely hooked.<br />Since I have Prime shipping, it gets to me in 2 days (if I order it right, that is!) which saves me a trip to various local stores trying to see who still has it in stock.<br />I'm totally thrilled with this stuff.

I know this isn't the "healthiest" coconut water on the market (it does have cane sugar), but it's the best one for those who are new to coconut water, or just don't prefer something as natural as pure coconut water. My brother hates coconut water,but loves this stuff. This drink is not too sweet,and has the perfect balance of pureed pineapple and natural coconut water subtly mixed together. I like vita coco's fruit infused waters as well, but find that this drink is a lot smoother in texture, and slightly more refreshing on a hot summer day.

review/text: I saw this item in my local grocery store, and I thought I would give it a try.<br /><br />I have to admit, I was very surprised about how much I enjoyed this item.  I found it refreshing, and I felt that I had a bit more energy. I would happily purchase this product again and again.<br /><br />A word of advice to people complaining that it doesn't taste "coconutty" enough.  Coconut water and coconut milk are two very different things.  Coconut water comes from a green, immature coconut, while the milk comes from what we all think of when we think of a coconut...a hard, brown, fiber covered shell.  Just like a green banana and a ripe banana taste different, the same can be said of coconut.  If you don't think of this as a coconut drink or a pina colada, you will probably enjoy it even more.

review/summary: THE BEST drink on earth!!!!!!!
review/text: This is the best drink out there!  I've always had adult acne and no matter what I took or what the dermatologist prescribed for me, it has always been so difficult to treat my acne.  I started drinking coconut water for the electrolyte benefits after my intense spinning classes but I noticed within several weeks that my face started to clear up and actually looked smoother!  Besides keeping me hydrated and my electrolytes in balance, it has improved the quality of my skin tone!  LOVE IT!!!!!!

review/summary: Not a sports drink
review/text: I started drinking coconut water when it was suggested to me by a friend.  I never really loved the taste of it, but I spend a great deal of time in the desert and I just can't seem to suck down enough water without getting waterlogged, so I was excited when I found flavors.  I know that recently it's become trendy and much harder for me to find, but my friends have been drinking it for years, as has my yoga instructor, and they highly recommend it for drinking not only for sports, but also to keep hydrated.  Plus, it's done wonders for my always dry skin.<br /><br />If nothing else it's a great avoid a hangover cure if drunk before going to bed, and if your partied too much to avoid being sick it seems to work much better than Pedialyte to get your electrolytes back in balance.

review/text: I admit that I fully expected to dislike this product, and approached it with a dismissive attitude - something that's this trendy can't be any good, right? well, I was wrong. The ONE coconut water is refreshing, delicious, and just barely sweet. Really wonderful stuff. The hint of pineapple adds a little bit of acidity that enhances the basic taste of the water. i bet this would make a great summer drink too, but I only had one so I didn't get tot try that. My problem now is that it's been out of stock, so I can't get more.

review/summary: Good Taste but Not for Everyone
review/text: I decided to try this although I am not a big fan of flavored waters.  It is quite refreshing and the flavors are quite vibrant and not weak as in some concoctions.  I happen to like both coconut and pineapple so there is no problem with the basic idea and both can be distinguished in the mix.  The one drawback for some is because pineapple is a rather strong addition, even a splash puts it up front and center.  This added to the coconut may make it far too sweet for some.  It would certainly be a good pick me up after a workout or, in my case, after shoeveling the snow that seems to be deposited regularly this winter in the Northeast.

review/summary: Lots of flavor, but not too sweet
review/text: Coconut Water with a splash of Pineapple<br /><br />This is refreshing!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The coconut flavor isn't pronounced, and the pineapple isn't so overpowering that it tastes like syrup.  It's clean tasting.  According to the packaging, "it has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives."  There's a smidge of fiber, 0.8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars.  I suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple, but "cane juice" is one of the ingredients, too. The 8.5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories.<br /><br />If you sign up for subscribe & save, it's less than $1 per carton.  Actually, the carton is the only thing I don't like about this drink.  It's sort of hard to drink directly from because there isn't any air getting let in when you drink, which makes a vacuum.  This was solved by pouring it into a glass.  *whew*<br /><br />This was good.  I will definitely get more, and I highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice.

review/text: To me, this tastes more like pineapple juice than coconut.  There is an underlying hint of coconut, I know the water isn't strongly flavored, but I wasn't expecting so much pineapple.  This is tangy and sweet.  It is alright.  Package is smaller, but I don't think I could handle too much more of it in one sitting.  I am not thrilled with their unflavored coconut water, it is too tangy/sour to me, so with the pineapple it helps cover up that funkiness for me.  Not sure I'd buy this again.  Still in search of the one I first tried and fell in love with, but so far not finding anything as light and fresh tasting.

review/summary: If You REALLY Like Sweet...
review/text: ...Then O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is the drink for you.  I found this drink to be almost overpoweringly sweet as a standalone beverage.  According to the package, O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE contains natural coconut water, natural pineapple juice, cane juice, vitamin C, and natural fruit flavor.  Personally, with the coconut and the pineapple, I think they could have left out the sugar cane.<br /><br />However, when I paired O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE with a light snack of cheese and crackers, it became a very tasty, refreshing drink.  I, apparently, needed a little salt and/or savory to make O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE completely palatable.  With the afore mentioned snack, the O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is really delightful.  I can also see it being very invigorating on a hot summer today (not so much with the cold winter weather).<br /><br />O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE comes in a handy 8.5 oz box with a place to punch a straw through.  This type of packaging is nice if you are on the go or have kids.  Just throw it in your bag and go.<br /><br />Prior to this experience, I had not heard of coconut water.  On the packaging it says "O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE is a blend of the natural water from inside a young, green coconut and sweet, golden pineapple juice. It has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives."  Huh...who knew you could drink a green coconut?  Educational and a good source of potassium.  Being allergic to bananas, it is always good to have another source.<br /><br />Overall, I would not drink O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE by itself in the middle of winter.  But together with non-sugary snack or in the high heat of summer, I would definitely give O.N.E. COCONUT WATER WITH A SPLASH OF PINEAPPLE another try.

review/summary: Smaller-than-usual package size, overly-sweet taste
review/text: My top line advice: If you want coconut water with a touch of pineapple, get the Vita Coco, not this one.<br /><br />Size: The size is 8.5 fl oz per package. I didn't pay close attention when ordering, and expected the larger, 11.5 oz size. Not a big deal, and was my fault, but it's a little too small to be useful.<br /><br />Taste: Ick. I love coconut water. I love pineapple juice. I love lightly flavored coconut water. This tastes like none of the above. The flavor is sickly sweet (ingredients included added sugar), and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters I've tried. Might as well be a processed kids drink.<br /><br />Alternatives: While I actually prefer O.N.E.'s regular, unflavored coconut water over other brands, the Vita Coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one. It comes in a larger package, doesn't have added sugar, has more vitamins and nutrients (this one is diluted with sugar water), and tastes like you're drinking it fresh on the beach. This one is just...not great.

review/text: I wanted to try this juice as I'm a big fan of coconut flavoured products.  Given that it claims to have a "splash of pineapple", I was expecting a light pina-colada flavour.<br /><br />On opening the package, I could smell the hint of pineapple, and I'd say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water.  Probably because I've mostly tasted coconut milk and not water, I'd say this was nothing like what I expected.  It's not bad for thirst quenching, but it wasn't my favourite drink in terms of taste.

review/text: This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.<br /><br />Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.<br /><br />It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars.

It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any "Natural Fruit flavor".<br /><br />To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how "healthy" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.<br /><br />And as a "thirst quencher", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade. I feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst.

review/summary: Pineapple flavored coconut water from Indonesia... there's something we really need!
review/text: Coconut water with a hint of pineapple, shipped to the US from Indonesia, packaged in (usually) non-recyclable, disposable containers, and catering to the... sports drink market ("good source of electrolytes")?<br /><br />I took a  8.5 ounce container and poured 6 servings, for 4 teenagers and 2 adults.  First impression?  The teens (serious athletes) were not told what the drink was, but I did mention that it was being marketed as a potential sports drink.<br /><br />The result?  No negative votes, but no one would choose it over existing drinks.  Everyone recognized the pineapple flavor instantly.  "It leaves a strange feeling in my mouth," one teen said.  This was probably the coconut water; it had a residual flavor and feel.<br /><br />There was no straw included with the package, so the opening and pouring needed the assistance of a fork or knife.  It's mostly (cane) sugar water, so why bother?<br /><br />But the biggest issue is the waste.  Coconut sugar water from Indonesia?  What's the carbon footprint of this product?  And the container has 2 "recycle" symbols on it, but, like milk cartons, it is difficult to find a community that will actually keep them out of the landfill.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It's not that tasty, being little more than sugar water, and the transport and packaging waste really don't fit into a culture (for me) focusing on sustainability.

review/summary: Healthy Alternative to Kibble, Canned or Raw Diets
review/text: Actually, Sojo's strongly recommends that the meat you add to their mixes be raw, but it an be cooked as I choose to do.  My dog arrived with coccidia and giardia as a puppy.  Through veterinary mismanagement, he was never completely healthy for the first 2 1/2 years of his life.  After watching him get sicker on an aggressive course of antibiotics and prednisone for his Inflammatory Bowel Disease, I took him to a holistic veterinarian.  Part of his treatment has been a homemade diet of Sojo's and meat plus no medications.  I'm extremely pleased to report he has had no GI episodes in over 6 months and has reached a point where I consider him healthy.  His coat is glossy and much fluffier than before he's finally at a good weight.  I have before and after photos that show a dramatic improvement,much of which I credit to Sojo's.<br /><br />It does take some extra time to prepare as opposed to kibble, but I make 4 days worth at a time. This takes me about 30 - 40 minutes total which includes down time while the meat is cooking and cleaning up after.  To be completely honest, I'm not thrilled about cooking for my dog but I am thrilled with the results.  If I was able to feed him raw (perhaps down the road, when our vet gives the ok), preparation time would  be almost nothing.

review/summary: picky puppy...
review/text: I have a now 8 month old male Shih Tzu.  When I brought him home from the breeder, I kept him on the 'Pro Plan Puppy' tiny dry kibble until the bag was almost finished.  There was about 2 cups left in the bag and he began walking away from his bowl as soon as I put it down.  As a test, I rolled a few morsels across the tile floor in the kitchen to see what would happen...he'd eat about 10 pieces and go bring me one of his squeaker toys to play with. (Which I was happy with, as I don't want to 'play' with his food as a game to get him to eat).  I went and got him Blue Buffalo dry puppy food (lamb and oatmeal formula), which had bigger size kibbles.  It seemed that he liked the bigger sized items to chew on and the harder antioxidant bits, since he was teething and chewing on his dentabones, venison antler, lamb lung chips for comfort.  Again when I got down to about a quarter of food left in the bag, he would walk away from the bowl---this went on for almost 3 days.  He was still having small bowel movements, urinating, drinking water and playing, running and continuing his successful training exercises; called the vet and they wanted to give me wet venison formula by Science Diet/Veterinarian's Diet after the exam, which showed nothing physically wrong.  The one vet tech said that Shih Tzu's tend to be picky eaters.  I didn't pick up the food at their check out counter, left and began some of my own research into the breed itself and a more natural diet.  I know from some of our outdoor excursions that he's attracted to road kill (he'll sniff the air, and want to lunge for it and would probably eat it if left to his own devices...but I won't allow it).  I remember being a kid in the late 60's early 70's and all my friends who had dogs fed them 1 of 2 choices available back then: Gravy Train or Alpo and they mixed meat or the drippings from the meat; they ate bones, etc and all lived into their late teens.  One of my friends small mutt lived to be 24 years old!!!  I never saw these dogs itching or digging at themselves other than the usual ears or if their was a flea problem, since I grew up in a rural area and most often that was a common occurrance.  Well, I read up on the more natural diets and decided to get the Sojos and ground beef and some boneless chicken thighs/breasts.  My Weston isn't a big fan of totally raw meat, but when browned (I put it in the toaster oven and add 1/4 tsp of 'Missing Link' to the meat portion) with the soaked Sojos Original, he eats with gusto!!!  From his early days, I would play with and take his food away, so he's not food aggressive.  He eats the recommended portion for his size and walks away when done.  Weston then wants to play hard, train hard, take a nice walk and nap.  His coat is soft and easy to keep brushed and groomed.  The droppings are nice sized and easy to clean up.  I just had him neutered 2 days ago and he ate this Sojos mix with the same gusto (even with the e-collar to challenge him).  So I am a fan and we are finished with the second 2.5 lb bag and I just ordered another one.  Hope this helps someone with a picky eater; I know another reviewer mentioned their Shih Tzu not liking it, but this shows you that dogs have certain tastes different from each other, much like us humans.

review/summary: My Dogs are Wild About These Treats!
review/text: I was introduced to these very small doggie bones at my Vet.  My 14 year old Springer who has never been much into doggie bones LOVES these things!!  They make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and motivation.  My old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one wiff of one of these bones does miracles.  I have a younger Springer who also loves the bones but she doesn't need much motivation to do anything, ha, but they are also great training aids.  I also sent home a handful of these bones with a painter I had at my home for his 3 dogs and he said they loved them too....so I guess that's antidotal but that's 5 dogs that really love the things!  Oh, the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your Vet, about twice as much per pound, so this is a great buy.  Buy a nice food safe container from Home Depot and fill it up.  You won't run out of bones for a while and that's a good thing!

review/summary: Decent Light Roast Organic
review/text: It seems most of the organic/shade grown/fair trade coffee is medium or dark roasted, so I've been having a hard time finding something that I like.  While this doesn't wow me like some other coffees, it's priced cheaper than those coffees and it's a good brew for when I'm not really paying attention to what I'm drinking (like when I'm working).<br /><br />I'm definitely going to keep this one around, and just switch to the expensive (better) coffees that I've found when I can really enjoy them.<br /><br />Compared to other coffee that's not organic/shade grown/fair trade, this is an average light roast.  Good, but nothing to get excited over.  It's worth purchasing over those coffees because of the growing practices.

review/summary: "Yep--it's a diet !!!"
review/text: This peach flavored diet tea by Snapple is extremely refreshing after a long summer's day! It's truly a diet tea--there are zero calories. It's best served chilled; and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right. Snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves; there's also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring. They use filtered water as well. This tea is sweetened somewhat with Aspartame; but Snapple adds in just the right amount so that it's not excessively sweet. If you want really tea that is rather sweet, you'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener. It also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you.<br /><br />If you have other questions, the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is perfect for a hot summer's day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle. I highly recommend this product.

review/text: Mrs. May's pumpkin crunch is a great snack. For those of you watching calories and intake, be aware that the 2oz portions are two servings. Most of Mrs. May's products are great, but with the fat at 11g per serving, i find it's not a complete guilt free snack. However, the pumpkin seed crunch has 9gms of protein per serving vs. the usual 4gms in their other snacks. So if you're monitoring your intake and want to indulge in these now and then, the pumpkin seed crunch is the healthiest option of the bunch.<br /><br />That said, they are all tasty and certainly not bad for you, just a little high in fat if you're watching your weight.

review/text: I normally bake from scratch but when I saw this pink lemonade cake mix with matching frosting I just had to try them both. This cake can be made two ways: with or without egg yolks. I recommend with as the cake will be nice and moist as a result. This cake would also be just as good with plain white icing or just a dusting of powdered sugar. You can make it as a layer, bundt, or sheet cake, or as cupcakes. I picked it up at the grocery store recently for about $1.80 per box, the frosting was about the same price per can. I ended up going back and purchasing more for later as I believe this is just a seasonal flavor and Pillsbury will pull it from the market at some point. If they do I hope they bring it back every spring. Until then I'll be stocking up.

Purchasing in bulk through amazon.com is a dependable alternative. Bayer 2-in-1 in granular form feeds roses and flowers while protecting them with a systemic insecticide for up to 6 weeks, but you'll need a separate fungicidal/disease treatment, and the systemic would not be something one would apply to anything edible. Bayer assures me the product is safe for pollinators and earthworms.

This product really helps with the pests and diseases that roses tend to acquire.  Though it does not stop all pests (cane borers) it stops the major ones that cause serious damage and spread disease.  I treat all my plants on the same monthly regiment and make sure to do it every four to six weeks making a note on my calendar.  Like one other reviewer said you will not see immediate results with this since it is systemic.  For the best results make sure to read the package and work the granules  into the soil and water in.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: I have been plagued by white flies for over a year. Neither chemical nor natural treatment has gotten rid of them completely. I decided to try this as it's made by a respected international brand & I thought a systemic product might work.<br />A week after the first application there was no reduction in infestation but by the second week I started to notice less & less of the little vermin. By the time I was ready to do a third application there was not even one white fly or any other insect on any of my roses or any other shrub. I had even used it on potted plants which were also infested & it worked on everything.<br />Remember, the product is systemic and is absorbed gradually into the plant so you will not see an immediate improvement but it works wonderfully.  Also if like me, you don't always remember to spray regularly or get the underneaths of the leaves, then something which you can sprinkle at the base of the plant every 6-8 weeks is certainly a lot easier to use.

You'll only learn that if you read their Q & A on their website. I studied the labels and opened the back label and it's never mentioned you can't use it on potted plants. Thanks Bayer...now I have to go back to the store to return it. I guess a lot of people have wondered why their potted flowers or roses died, not knowing it's because of this product. If you see your bees dwindle and disappear, then this is the reason. Will systemic products affect your fragrance of your flowers? After 3-4 years of use, they will not have a fragrance. Got earthworms? You wouldn't know unless you thoroughly dug through your dirt. AVOID THIS!

review/summary: Best. Mustard. Ever.
review/text: Great with bratwurst, breakfast sausages, salami, cheddar cheese, sandwiches, etc., even though it is a bit exotic/expensive to use with sandwiches where it tends to fade into the background, it's best to keep it simple and let it stand out.

review/summary: Hot
review/text: It arrived on time and was packaged well.  This was my first try of this mustard.  It was unique, similar to many other hot mustards, but I favored it over the others I have because of the balance of flavors.  It's almost as hot as English (Coleman's) mustard, but a little sweeter and maybe a slight vinegar essence in it. The tube and a bag of pretzels lasted me one or two evenings.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: The Lobster Bisque is absolutely delicious. Nice lobster flavor; I cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup. Just open, heat and enjoy. I've become such a fan of the Baxter's line that I can't wait to try them all.

review/summary: Delicious low cal treat
review/text: Baxters soups are usually very nice, but the lobster bisque is especially good. It tastes authentic, it has a good flavour, is creamy, and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting. Add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant.<br /><br />It's also surprisingly low calorie. Though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz, the label actually says 120 calories, so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories.

review/summary: Tastes ok but has bits of shells
review/text: The taste is good, but I found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable. This made me not want to finish my bowl of soup.

review/summary: Unlisted ingredient of Baxter Lobster Bisque
review/text: This soup is very good tasting if you like seafood, like I do. I am finally finishing my case of cans, because it is good food. However, I do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra: bits and pieces of chitinous shell, mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster. They are small pieces, which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything, and don't eat the last spoonful. I find six to eight pieces of this debris in each can. Like I said before, I am finishing the case, because it is food and pretty good at that. But I just don't appreciate having to be that careful with my soup.

review/summary: Too watery
review/text: It is ok soup, but I expected more, as I love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places. This one is very watery and I could not find any lobster there. I guess it is ok for the price, but I would NEVER buy this brand of the lobster bisque again.

review/summary: Baxter's canned soups rule!
review/text: This was actually a gift to my daughter (along with 3 cases of other Baxter's soups). She's of the opinion that Baxter's is absolutely the BEST canned soup on the Planet (of the soups she's tasted, which include the major American brands - she doesn't cook much). The Lobster Bisque rated just below Baxter's Scottish Smoked Salmon (which she rated the BEST EVER). (From my own perspective, and usually cooking my own food, I have to admit that the Baxter's soup line, for canned soup, is superior).

review/summary: It's good for canned soup.
review/text: For canned soup, it hits the spot decently.  There's definitely some lobster flavor and small chunks in it.  However, the whole thing tastes a little on the fishy side.  If I was served this in a restaraunt I think I'd walk out.

review/summary: Disgusting, nasty, inedible
review/text: I gave this product a one because zero wasn't an option.  This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it.  The only lobster in the soup was some shell.  It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible.  Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry.
