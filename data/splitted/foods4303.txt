review/summary: Delicious Chocolate Cake
review/text: This product tasted very close to many regular flour cakes I've tried. It wasn't real sweet, which my family liked. We topped it with whipped cream and raspberries. I didn't follow the instructions, though. I used a regular cake mixing method - creaming the butter (in my case, Earth Balance). Then adding eggs one at a time with the butter. Combined all other liquids together and added them alternately with the cake mix to the egg mixture. Rose very well in my 8" cake pans. I definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I baked a cake for our Christmas dinner today using the Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Chocolate Cake Mix, and as my daughter said, you would never know it is gluten free.  It was really delicious.  One bag of the mix makes a 2-layer cake.  I iced it with a pecan coconut frosting and drizzled a melted chocolate chip mixture over the top and down the sides.  I had given up on a gluten free cake mix being light and tasty, but this one really was light and tasty.  I read the directions too late, after I had already started mixing the ingredients and it still turned out great.  I see there is no rice flour used in the ingredients and I'm sure this makes for a lighter better tasting (not grainy) cake.  I have tried Arrowhead Mills gluten free vanilla cake mix and didn't care for it at all - it was very grainy and didn't taste good.  I have been leery of trying another GF cake mix - I'm sure glad I decided to give Bob's Red Mill a try.

review/summary: Much Better Than Some Other Gluten Free Cake Mix Out There
review/text: I've tried a few other gluten free cake mix out there and this has to be the best so far.  One bag is would make two 8" round cakes, which is wonderful.  The cake is not as spongie as the others.  I was a little worried at first but it turned out to be a hit, my husband and kids loved it.

review/text: This cake mix is very good.<br />I added a scant 2 Tablespoons of olive oil as well as the cube of real butter, 2 teaspoons of organic cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of organic nutmeg and organic ginger, as well. Heavenly indulgence!! Frost with rich, creamy fudge icing, or a layer of thick mint icing and then the fudge icing for a decadent treat that will make you fell richly satisfied.<br />My neighbor also liked it.

review/summary: Chocolate Cake Balls a Decadent Gluten Free Dessert
review/text: I made this cake mix, baked it, let it sit 10 min. and then crumbled it in a big bowl.  Then I made Cherrybrook Kitchen Chocolate Frosting Mix (which is also Gluten Free) and mixed it together.  Let it chill in the freezer and shaped with a melon-baller into small balls.  Chilled again in the freezer.  Then I put a toothpick in each ball and dipped the balls into Wax Orchards Classic Fudge (Fat Free, Fruit-Sweetened Dark Chocolate Sauce...also gluten free).  Then I froze overnite.  I served with fresh strawberries and pecans.  It was awesome, so delicious, and everyone loved.  No one would think this was gluten free.  It could be dairy free too but I'm allergic to soy and didn't find a dairy free butter or margarine that didn't have soy so I used goat butter in the cake, butter and ghee in the frosting and rice milk in both.

review/text: This is a perfect cake!  Gluten free, low starch and high protein, great taste that all my friends love.  Make sure you follow the instructions to a T, all the way down to the adding of 1/4 cup boiling hot water at the end.  If you modify the instruction even a little, the outcome can be disappointing.  It is also a very heavy cake, almost brownie density, which might not be a preference for some people.  I would very much like to find more flavors than just chocolate.  My family is getting tired of having the same cake for every gathering.

review/text: For cats who like saucy foods, the fancy feast grilled range is a good bet. Our cat is pretty fussy, but he'll eat most of the grilled varieties. His favourite, by far, is grilled salmon, and judging by the fact that it's never in stock at the pet food store, it's a favourite of many other pussies too. Tuna is his next favourite, but he likes grilled chicken for a change now and then. Lots of sauce, convenient small cans for cats who don't eat a lot in one sitting, and pretty decent ingredients and smell. Three whiskers.

It's sort of comparable to "Beer Nuts" but with a light coconut-cream flavor to them, not excessively sweet, and no salt/sugar/oil residue all over your fingers like other peanut snacks. I've found these locally at a nearby Asian grocery store (these are imported) for a price that's lower than or comparable to other big name peanut snacks.<br /><br />From their nutrition label:<br />Serving size:  30 grams (1.05 oz)<br />Calories:  160<br />Total Fat:  10 grams (Saturated Fat 3.5 grams, Trans Fats 0)<br />Cholesterol:  0 mg<br />Total Carbs:  13 grams<br />Dietary Fiber: &lt;1 gram<br />Sugars:  3 grams<br />Protein:  6 grams<br /><br />Looking at the above numbers, as peanut snacks go, it not terribly bad - just don't eat the entire can at one sitting.

review/summary: Excellent teas
review/text: If you haven't tried Zhena's Gypsy Teas yet, this sampler is a great way to start.  I'm a tea aficionado who has at least two cups every morning. I've sampled Irish teas in Ireland, the best British teas in England, not to mention great American brands like Stash.  But the brand I've been buying and using regularly is Zhena's Gypsy Teas.  Earl Grey is my favorite tea generally, and the raspberry shes adds to the Earl Grey is a distinctive and pleasant addition. The coconut chai is great on a cold morning-- brew it in your cup filled only half-way with water; then add warm milk to fill the cup (I add two teaspoons of raw sugar, but use your own preferred sweetener)-- it will sooth your soul and make any task at work manageable.  It is a moment of zen in a teacup.<br /><br />At first, I found the flavor of the rose tea a little odd, but I've grown to like it and now it's one of my favorites.  I also like her raspberry earl grey; in fact this morning, I ran out of her earl grey and used another brand marketed by a famous chef- it doesn't compare.<br /><br />If you're concerned about the waste of the attractive metal cans, instructions are on the container for purchasing the tea in bulk and reusing the containers. And once you've tasted them, you can buy the tins which contain only the flavors you prefer.<br /><br />All in all-- great tea.

review/summary: It really is a Sampler... mixing great and mediocre
review/text: The great: the coconut chai and the gypsy rose black tea. The mediocre (or worse): the peach ginger and the raspberry earl grey. So... the coconut chai is strong and spicy. The coconut scent is heavenly, and the flavors are complex and energizing. BUT, it's not for people who don't like the kick of some real spice. Next, the gypsy rose is just addictive. I'm not sure whether it's the scent, or the way the scent affects the taste, but it's a tea I just keep wanting to have again. The flavor is relatively mild, but the rose... whatever... more than compensates.<br /><br />Sadly, the peach ginger is one of the worst versions of peach ginger tea I've ever tried. It tastes kind of like... nothing. This *can* be a wonderful flavor for tea -- if you're intrigued, try Revolution's Sweet Ginger Peach instead. And the raspberry earl grey... sigh. Like the peach ginger it's just blah. You'd find much better taste in a $3 box of teabags at any mainstream supermarket.<br /><br />So, it is what is says it is: a sampler. I loved two of the teas, and hated two of them. I bought more of the flavors I loved, and will finish off the other two some desperate day when everything better runs out.<br /><br />Oh, and also in the great column: the tin itself, which consists of four separate small metal containers that nest together. I expected one tin with some dividers, but this is terrific. It completely keeps the teas apart (which in some cases could really affect flavor), and will certainly be repurposed for something once it's empty.

review/text: This is definitely cheaper than if you bought it at some tea places that sell them. The container is very ingenius, because it keeps the flavor, I still have some after a year and they're still good. I don't drink that much tea, but when  I do, I go for Zhena's. :-) It's true.

review/text: My dog loves these because they are moist and soft-chewy (not hard and brittle like most jerky) and I love them because they are made from natural salmon, easy to break off or cut into small bits throughout the day as high-value treats.  I have no problems with recall when these are in my pocket.<br /><br />Highly recommended as a high-value treat for dogs that like fish and/or soft treats. Also good to cut into tiny pieces for training.

review/summary: Superb quality flax seeds
review/text: I bought this item based on health reasons, reviews of the product here and all the great information on the internet about the benefits of adding flax seeds to my daily diet.  I also bought a mini coffee grinder just for this product.  At first I tried to chew it, ugh... it takes a lot of hard work, I felt like a cow chewing cud and the flavor is extremely, uh... earthy.  So instead I ground it up in my new coffee grinder and added it to yogurt, YUM... the earthy flavor is gone and a nutty wholesomeness is added to my yogurt.  I add it to everything and it makes a great addition to my healthy diet.  The seeds look fresh, clean and healthy.  They almost looked too perfect with a nice shiny shell.  The freshly ground meal smells very clean and definitely has a nice nutty bite.  There is about more or less a year on the expiration date on the package that I received.  I would recommend this specific product to anyone who wants to add a bit of health to their daily diet.  I'll more likely than not be ordering more of this stuff in the near future at the rate that I've been chowing down on it.

review/summary: Great fun for the taste buds
review/text: These tins contain two flavors of small spherical hard candies.  Most tins seem to have about twice as many Kiwi (?) candies as they do Pomegranate (?) ones.  I wish they came in equal proportions, as my favorite combination is to put one of each into my mouth at the same time - they are wonderful complementary flavors.  However, the fun of this tin is the variety - you can try two different single flavors, or the combo from one part of the day to another.  A tad expensive, but worth it in these days of ever-fewer hard candy flavor choices.

She loves the taste and I am so pleased to have found this product because I have to watch her diet so carefully as she is prone to calcium oxalate crystals in her urine which can form bladder stones.  She is on special food and is restricted in treats and I always have my vet approve any treats that I give her for calcium content, and Fruitables were definitely approved. They must be very flavorful to taste because they even smell good when I open the container to give some to my dog. I will always keep a good supply of Fruitables on hand.

review/text: My husband and I love the Kenco coffee! At first, we had trouble finding a coffee for Tassimo that we liked. We do not like Starbuck's as we are not fans of the dark roasted coffees. We did not like the Gevalia flavored coffees.....they taste artificial and have a sort of chemical aftertaste to them. Gross! We really like Nabob and we were consistently drinking that for awhile....then along came Kenco! It is a medium roast, delicious coffee. We are hooked, and now Kenco is all we drink!

I wish I could buy this locally, but with Amazon Prime I get my coffee in no time whenever I run out. If you are looking for a great, smooth, yummy coffee to get your morning going, give Kenco a try. I bet you won't be disappointed. :)

review/text: I've been trying out different coffees for my Tassimo and came accross this one on Amazon. I love this coffee. It's just a regular cup of coffee. I add lots of cream and sugar. It's not too mild or strong. I'm not very picky about my coffee though. I have this on hand for those days that I don't want a latte or cappuccino and just want a regular cup. I've never been a fan of flavored coffees. I always use flavored creamers instead so this is just right for me.

review/summary: Totally Dissatisfied
review/text: All I wanted was a cup of coffee from my Tassimo coffee maker. I bought this product because it looked like it could do that.  The packaging says that it makes a 170ml cup of coffee (large mug).  But the Tassimo machine cuts off after about 1/3rd of the cup is full.  So when I push  the manual override to finish the brewing cycle, I get a watered down cup of coffee.  The Tassimo machine is supposed to adjust based on the cartidge.  Clearly that is not happening with this product.<br /><br />If you want a tiny cup of coffee or a big watered down cup of coffee might be OK.  Otherwise stay away.

When I found this product at Amazon, I thought I would like to give it a try, knowing that the product is original Made in Japan, and I cannot find this Myojo noodle in Asian grocery store around here. Cooking time is only 5 minutes in boiling water - then you need to blanch it with cold water - sauce and mustard is provided in the package. The result? Very delicious Hiyashi Chuka, restaurant quality: good texture of noodle, rich sauce taste. Highly recommended. I will buy regularly from Amazon - good job Amazon!

The noodles are a lot like ramen, but a little lighter than Maruchan/Top. The seasoning is hard to describe. The sesame sauce is not sweet like in Chinese food. It's a savory sesame sauce and the sesame is not overpowering. The hot mustard pack that comes with it is essential to the complete flavor. The spice is not strong (I'm a wimp, trust me. It's not strong.) but the flavor addition is essential to the overall taste of this variety. These are my absolute favorite noodles! :) Great with some added ingredients like sliced cucumber and ham bits, even a cooked egg, but also great alone.

When it comes to making ramen at home, I think Myojo Chukazanmai makes the best instant ramen.  Their noodles are not fried, and their soup base is yummy.  In the summer, we enjoy their cold noodles with sesame sauce.  If you can't fly to Tokyo to eat at a little ramen stall, this is the next best thing, very satisfying.

I don't think it was the honey flavor that was bothersome- actually the Tulsi just seemed at odds with the chamomile.  It actually tastes a bit like basil, which I hadn't experienced with the peppermint, I guess because the tastes meshed so well together.  In this cup, I actually felt like I was drinking Basil-Chamomile tea.<br /><br />I can say I've never tasted the anise flavor that people find prevalent in Tulsi teas.

review/summary: This Dog Food Is The Best Ever
review/text: I have a 3 lb. Chihuahua that is 9 years old.  I have tried just about every type of dry dog food there is and my dog would not eat any of them.  I ordered a sample of this food from Entirely Pets thinking I would get the same results.<br /><br />When I opened up the sample bag...I let my dog sniff the food first. I was stunned when he started pawing at the bag.  I put a few of the kibbles in my hand and to my surprise he ate all of it and wanted more.<br /><br />I will continue to buy this dog food and I would advise anyone else who has a finicky eater or just wants a good quality food for their pet to purchase this dog food....You will not regret it!!!

review/text: This is the first time we ordered a fruitcake from the Trappist Abbey Monastery. Our family is a rarity in that we usually love fruitcake! As a suprise, I ordered 3 different fruit cakes only one of which we had eaten previously. Well the surprise didn't go over well because no one liked this cake. It is a dense, over-spiced block of dried cake. Actually, it was the worst fruit cake I've ever eaten and we were very disappointed because we had heard so much about it. We wanted to support the work of the Trappist monks by ordering a cake but will find another way to support their wor in the future.

For $15.00, it was definitley not worth it, due to the miniscule size.  It was about 3" X 3", and the photo did not show how very tiny it was.<br />It was well made, very moist, wonderfully delicious, but way over priced for the very tiny amount of cake delivered.  I was frankly shocked that clergy and people who supposedly are honest and God fearing would do such a scam.

review/text: This 10-grain hot cereal is really tasty and easy to prepare. I usually don't even like hot cereal and really hate oatmeal but this is pretty darn good. It takes just 3 minutes in the microwave with some water, so it's super easy to make. After I microwave it with the minimum amount of water, I take it out and add some honey and then pour on whole milk. I will also add Chia seeds and creamed coconut to further enhance the flavor and health benefits. The chia gives a little bit of crunch texture.

review/summary: Grain Free Doesn't Mean it's Better
review/text: I was able to let my cat try Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Grain Free Adult Cat Food for free through BzzAgent.  She's now consumed all of it, an did so quite happily.<br /><br />We nicknamed this cat food, "Kitty Crack" due to its addictive properties.  Our cat was ravenous for it from day one.  It took her a fraction of a second to gobble down every bite.  She sometimes has reservations with some food shapes, but the round, small, flat shape of this food gave her no issues.<br /><br />The grain free pet food seems to really be catching on.  Hill's has joined this hype and honestly, that's what it is in my opinion.  They've removed corn, wheat, barley, soy, etc and replaced it mainly with potatoes.  The potatoes don't really provide anything for cats, just a substance to bind the other ingredients to in order to form it into kibble.<br /><br />They've also added veggies and fruits for natural sources of vitamins.  That's a great concept, but to really get usable vitamins from the veggies and fruits, you'd need a lot.  And they've added carrots, which in cat food, is practically a waste.  Cats cannot convert beta-carotene (plant source of vitamin A) into the vitamin A the body uses, they must get it from animal sources.<br /><br />While my cat was eating Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Grain Free Adult Cat Food, her stool volume increased, as did the foul odor.  I was careful to measure the amount she was to get every day, and feed her multiple times from only that amount, so I know I wasn't overfeeding.  I just feel the food is too full of material and more wasteful.<br /><br />The food has a strong odor, more than any other dry cat food I've ever sniffed.  Smells vaguely like a meat-covered baked potato.<br /><br />I think this food could be ideal for a cat who needs to put on weight (it's high in fat), has certain ingredient sensitivities or allergies, or to try giving to a picky eater.  But if your cat is none of those, I feel it's kind of a waste of money, as it is expensive.

They were also excited to eat dry food, which doesn't happen with most brands of dry cat food.  I like the fact that it doesn't contain corn, wheat or soy, but I wish the first three ingredients were all animal proteins.  The food is rather pricey, but at least my cats enjoy it and eat every single bite.  Their coats are also soft and silky since I started feeding them grain free foods six months ago.

review/summary: Good product, BPA fears no longer an issue
review/text: ****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.

review/text: I love these variety packs.  My only complaint is that you can get them cheaper at BRU (I found them for $9.99 for a 12 pack, regular price). That's the only reason I gave them 3 stars. But as far as the actual baby food goes, I don't feel like I could be buying anything better for my baby.  I make all of his fruit and vegetable baby food myself but I was a little overwhelmed at trying to do the meat ones.  I wanted to buy all organic but I live in a very small town and didn't want to mess with trying to find the closest place to get organic/hormone free/antibiotic free meat.  Not to mention the price and all the work to make it.  The ingredients in this baby food are all real, whole, organic foods.  No preservatives, nothing extra.  So easy!

review/text: So far this has been my favorite baby food to serve my 10 month old.  We do a lot of homemade baby food, but being a busy mom of 2 I also buy a lot of jars now.  Will only do organic brands, and really like Earths Best brand because of their good combos and I like that they come in a glass jar.  I really like the gourmet meals pack, my baby liked all of the ones in this pack right from the start, even though he didn't love some of the plainer vegetable or meat dinners.  So I've been willing to pay slightly more to get the gourmet meals set.  Good way to get good protein sources into babies too.

review/summary: Weird mixes, baby didn't like a lot of these
review/text: I'm not sure what I expected with canned finely ground beef in the first place, but my 9 mo didn't like most of these mixes. I had to blend with other things and she still barely ate it. Tried it myself and it tasted awful, won't be buying again
