review/summary: Green Chai a big hit!!
review/text: I have not been able locally to find the Chai Tea in the Green, only black and mixed black and green. This is light but very aromatic and flavorful with just a hint of sweet. At zero calories, it is the perfect snack to get me over a craving, and decadent enough to feel like a treat. I love this tea and will definitely order more. If you want to add steamed milk, I would recommend you stick with the black chai tea- it is a bit too much for the green.

review/text: I always buy Bigelow's green tea (which aside from the need to use two teabags per cup due to weakness, is satisfactory). Still, I thought I'd give Stash's a go. I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as "grassy"? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one.

review/text: Im not sure what everyone else on here thinks green tea is supposed to taste like, but this is not it. I go through about half a gallon of green tea a day, so Im always willing to try new flavors, brands, etc. This is the only one that I have had to literally choke down. This tea is bitter, but thats not the real reason its so bad. The taste is cheap, overpowering, and unpleasant.<br /><br />I think either Stash has its employees writing reviews, or amazonians are being suckered in by the snazzy/hip box and packets of this truly awful tea.

review/text: Since I drink between eight and ten cups of green tea a day, I am very fussy about the taste.  It must be pure green tea, I don't care for added flavors.  I LOVE this tea. Recently, I ordered green tea in a restaurant and was served Bigelow, which is a good brand.  I put the Bigelow tea bag in the cup of hot water and then took a Stash green tea bag out of my purse and put it into the glass decanter of hot water.  This was a good comparison...the Bigelow tea was brownish in color, the Stash tea a beautiful, clear GREEN.  My husband commented, "that is why it is called green tea!"

review/summary: My favorite Green Tea
review/text: I used to drive to an out of the way grocery store for Stash Moroccan Mint.  When they stopped carrying it I  was so upset!  It did a hard core internet search and finally found out I could order from Amazon in bulk.  Yay! I drink green tea for the health benefits, and have been drinking various kinds for about ten years now.  Before I found this kind, I would choke down regular green (which tastes like hay!) and tried all of the flavored kinds.  Most of the teas would hurt my stomach if I drank them in the morning on an empty stomach.  Moroccon mint doesn't bother my tummy at all.  In fact, If I have an upset stomach or feel really full, this tea actually calms it.  I drink two talls of this tea a day.  I am thirty years old, but I hear everyday that I look like I am in my early 20's.  People quite literally don't believe that I am 30.  I really think a lot of this has to do with the powerful health benefits.  Beyond this, I am around children all the time as I nanny for a side job, and am never sick.  I would highly recommend this tea, and I have tried them all! But please don't order a bunch because I don't want it to be out of stock!  ha ha! One more thing, I replaced green tea with coffee and it was not a difficult switch.  If I can do it, you can too!

review/summary: Very nice green tea blend, fine flavor, great value
review/text: ****<br /><br />This tea is good---it is a meld of green and white teas: White tea, Japanese green tea, Chinese green tea, Assam green tea, Darjeeling green tea, and organic green tea from Sri Lanka. It has a mild and interesting taste, and doesn't appear to be as strong in its caffeine effects as some other green or white teas.<br /><br />I went to Stash's website to find out more about Fusion Green and White and it says that white tea is a very rare and healthful tea, even more so than green tea, containing powerful antioxidants; it is thought that white tea may have the strongest anti-carcinogenic effects of all teas.  White tea is not oxidized, but withered and dried by steaming. It is not clear exactly how much white tea is present in this tea compared to all of the greens---I'm thinking there might be far more green than white. Still, it is a fine tea nonetheless.<br /><br />For a basic green tea, with some extra-healthful white tea added, it is a not-overly-exciting but certainly tasty tea. I would especially recommend it for people new to tea drinking who want to branch out from orange pekoe to something different, and are looking for a gentle introduction to the wide world of teas.<br /><br />Note that this review is for the bulk packaging of six tea boxes, for an incredible Amazon price break!<br /><br />****

review/summary: Very good for what it is
review/text: We've been "product testing" a variety of green teas in our office. So far the Stash green has been the most favorably received, just ahead of the Yamamoto-yama "Sushi Bar" tea. Stash won out due to the fact that it's got a distinctive green tea "taste" and seems resistant to bitterness from oversteeping. "Sushi Bar"-like some others-tended to be a little weak. Other rejected greens veered to the other end of the spectrum were overly bitter if you so much as looked at them wrong.<br /><br />As described, it is slightly sweet and nutty. The description also states that this green tea is imported from Brazil. That might be a bit off-putting at first. However, it's idiot-proof and, like the title alludes to, this is teabag tea and for that, the Stash is very good stuff.

review/text: This tea sounded great. I lived in the middle east and love the real moroccan mint tea. The real tea includes spearmint and green tea only. Honey is typically added. In this case all you can taste is lemon grass and the only hint of mint is peppermint, not spearmint. I really regret buying a whole case of this stuff. I would highly recommend buying Twinnings green tea with mint. It doesn't have "Moroccan mint" as a title, but it is a lot closer to the original namesake. Stash has a little bit of false advertising going on here. It should really be called lemon grass green tea with a picture of lemon grass on the box. It is anything but Moroccan.

review/summary: Soft, Lovely Tea
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea has a fragrant bouquet, and an unusual taste that comes from the blend of red tea and white tea. The red tea taste is more dominant, the white tea taste subtle. I have to say that I like the red and white blend more than the red alone. I still probably prefer white tea more, but this blend is lovely, and lower in caffeine (the red tea has no caffeine, the white tea a bit). This tea contains only South African rooibos (another word for red tea) and white tea.<br /><br />The package says that it contains a hint of sweetness, and I'd agree, although the taste is very hard to describe (if you've had red tea before then you understand). The package also says that this tea is full of "potent antioxidants", which of course is very healthy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea unless you do not care for rooibos or white tea; otherwise you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />*****

The study suggested that green tea was also good for weight loss, but not as good as white.

And the price is quite reasonable for such a refreshing beverage, especially if you use Amazon's Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />As the weather warms up, this versatile tea is well-suited to both hot and iced brewing. I would recommend it over any other bagged tea.

Hint... set it up as a subscription and you will pay less than most grocery stores and you will have it delivered to your door.

review/summary: Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor
review/text: I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar.  Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.  Finally, the small amount of caffeine in the green tea makes Stash Chai Green Tea a great pick-me-up at any time of the day--highly recommended!

review/summary: very tasty but bags leak the very finely crushed leaves
review/text: Before trying this tea I'd been drinking the packets my husband brought home from Japan. The stash had the same nutty flavor of the good japanese green tea but the bags were fragile and leaked tea leaf into the cup. Just a personal pet peeve. I bought the Stash green tea based on a review I read in Men's Health magazine that rated Stash as having the highest level of anti oxidents (and Caffeine) in those tested.

review/summary: Nice mild minty tea, actually makes an enjoyable cup.
review/text: I've been tasting along several green tea's trying to find one that I liked.<br />I was beginning to feel a little like goldilocks. One would be too strong, the other too bland.<br />I think the spearmint in this tea adds an really nice note with the peppermint and lemongrass, making it actually enjoyable rather than a necessary evil.<br />I found the mint to be nicely pronounced, and the lemongrass to be only barely detectable, with a little bit of honey it's really good.<br />So if you're looking for a way to incorporate green tea into your daily routine, and like me you like it mildly paired with mint. Then give this tea a shot.<br />(I do agree that maybe you should try with a single box first, so that you're not stuck with 6 if your palate is more refined than mine)

review/summary: Very mild green tea
review/text: I am not a very big fan of green tea. I have always found the flavor to be a bit strong. I have had real Moroccan mint tea and found that to be a bit strong as well (in the mint direction). This tea was the perfect mild blend of both for me. And because it is all natural (no artificial or "natural" flavorings) I have been able to drink it every other day on my detox.<br /><br />Please Note: I did not purchase through Amazon. I purchased a box at Target. I would recommend trying it before investing in 6 boxes. I do plan to order this offer thru Amazon once my current box is depleted.

This one is a favorite as it had a strong Pomegranate and Raspberry flavor I love. By mixing these flavors in with green tea it makes green tea less bitter. The ingredients in this tea include: green tea, chamomile, hibiscus, orange peel, pomegranate flavor, raspberry flavor and Japanese matcha.

review/text: Had this been labeled "green tea with a touch of pomegranate and raspberry essence" I might have rated this higher.  However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors.  The overall taste is mild and muddled.  I except a greater sweetness.  The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence.  While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas.

review/summary: Exquisite Tea
review/text: I do not find this tea to be overly sweet and I take it hot or cold without any sweetener. I prefer it hot I find, but have tried it iced and found it to be quite pleasant.  This tea has a lightly fruity taste.  There are many ingredients, which I have found to be true of all of Stash's herbal teas.  To fear the ingredients, they are all top quality and marry well.  I wondered what "goji berry flavor" was and contacted the company.  Here is a transcript:<br /><br />Email reply from Stash when asked about goji berry flavor:<br /><br />Unfortunately it's proprietary information with our suppliers; however we do require natural statements from our suppliers. We use the Code of Federal Regulations as far as our definition of natural<br /><br />According to the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), the term natural flavor means "the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive,  protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juices, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible years, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in t food is flavoring rather than nutritional."<br /><br />There you have it, essential oil of goji berry.  Not so mysterious after all.  I recommend getting the superfruit sampler where you get to try this flavor and five others.  I have found them all to be outstanding and go back for more all the time.

review/summary: Clean and subtle rather than grassy, a stand-out flavor in a crowded field
review/text: I drink STASH PREMIUM MOROCCAN MINT GREEN TEA all day with no adverse "overdose" effects from caffeine.  The flavor is not grassy like some green teas, but very clean.  I don't normally like mint taste in anything other than gum or toothpaste, but this mint is subtle and goes great with the clean taste of the tea.  Besides green tea, the ingredients are spearmint, lemongrass, and peppermint.  Lemongrass is another ingredient that can be overwhelming, but if it's truly in there, I can't taste it.  So as I write this, I am realizing it contains a lot of flavors that shouldn't work for me, but they do!  In fact, I enjoy it so much, I get a little anxious if I let myself run low.  It's a great thing to be able to order it in bulk from Amazon.<br /><br />I do want to note that the tea can get a little bitter if steeped too long.  I try to go no longer than five minutes, but I often forget about it at work.  For me, it's drinkable but noticeable.  On the other hand, I'm not an aficionado.  I don't worry about the temperature of the water I use to brew the tea.  At home, I use the hot water that comes out of my Keurig coffee maker; at work, I use the hot water out of the filtered water dispenser.  As evidenced by the amount I consume, the flavor comes out great!

review/summary: Hot water
review/text: I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed.

review/summary: Stash Premium Fusion Red, White & Blueberry Tea
review/text: Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable. Stash truly hit the mark on this one and hopefully they don't discontinue it - because the day they do discontinue it, I will be a very very sad man :(

The caffeine content is not as high as the one of coffee, or even regular green tea, which makes this a good beverage choice at all times of the day.

The only thing I have to say that's negative would be the box design makes it difficult to grab the packets from the little like half circle opening, just open up the back otherwise they get all messed up and you have to push your fingers and root around trying to grab one of them and then pull them out etc.  Really good tea for a really nice price.  Even though I just bought 6 boxes, I would buy this again for sure (me and my family have already gone through three, and I gave one away as a gift).

I have tried other mint teas and I thought they were too weak, I couldn't taste the mint, but this tea is just right! Do try for you are in for a treat!

review/summary: Great caffeine laden tea
review/text: I've been drinking this Stash jasmine blossom green tea for the past 5 years because it's loaded with an unexpected kick of caffeine.  It's a good afternoon energy boost if you're not into coffee past 12PM, like me.  Give it a try.  The taste is decent too, make sure to drink it while it's very hot.

review/text: I really like this tea.  I tried all the stash Fushion ones and liked this one best.  To get the full flavor you have to steep it for a long time. This tea also makes a great ice tea.  I make it like regular and then put it in the fridge when it cools down. You can use 2 tea bags in a standard tea pot and it makes a great strength of tea.  The listing says only 5 left, nearly out of stock, does this mean it's being discontinued? I am frustrated with Stash coming out with new flavors left and right and stores can only stock so many. Every time I find one I like, the stores stop carrying. I hope this continues to be available from Amazon.

review/summary: Another "healthy" chocolate bar....
review/text: I didn't mind the taste of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OV6X6Q">Pure Natural Bars, Chocolate Almond, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>, but I expected a lot more of the chocolate almond taste that the label promotes.  I read the ingredients, which look reasonably healthy-a few more than a LaraBar, but nothing scary or unfamiliar.  The texture is like a typical healthy bar-chewy and sticky-but these bars taste pretty good (if you are used to eating these type of bars).  However, the taste of chocolate and almonds is lacking in this product.  It doesn't taste bad, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  This is NOT a candy bar, but it certainly has enough sugar.  While the sugars in this bar come from dates and agave, this isn't a diet bar-17 grams of sugar just don't let it be something that can be eaten daily.<br /><br />I would certainly choose these bars over a candy bar loaded with high fructose corn syrup and other unfamiliar ingredients.  These is a reasonable amount of protein, potassium and fiber (5 grams!), so this bar makes my OKAY to eat on occasion or after a workout list, but just don't expect a candy bar taste.

review/text: I really enjoyed these and found that I had to "cut myself off" after I was pining for a third... uh oh!  That said, my wife was not into them at all.  At first blush, you might think these are chocolate bars--they are not.  On second blush, you might think they are "granola bars" or the like--they are not.  They are soft, chewy, fudgy and very tasty.  There are not many almonds, however, and there is not much crunch or texture.  These remind me of a product from my youth: Big League Chew made a fudge bar that was amazing, and this brings back that texture and flavor.  Yum!

I didn't expect them to be so delicious; usually bars of this type taste more like cardboard.  Not, PURE NATURAL CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS.  They are moist, crunchy with almonds and dates, sweetened with agave nectar and rich with dark cocoa.  I love them.  With only 180 calories per generous bar, they are perfect for those dieting or searching for only nutritious snacks for children and adults.  I will buy more to settle that chocolate beast who arises in me hunkering for a candy bar that adds unwanted pounds.<br /><br />PURE NATURAL CHOCOLATE ALMOND BARS impressed me and being the chocolate connoisseur that I am that is saying a mouthful!!!!

review/summary: Pretty Good
review/text: I am a vegetarian that would like to go vegan sometime soon.  I LOVE chocolate and was afraid that vegan chocolate would not be as good as milk chocolate.  After trying soy chocolate ice cream and Amy's chocolate cake, I was very happy that being vegan didn't mean having to give up good chocolate.  I ordered the Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bars because I wanted to try to some more vegan chocolate, and they were pretty good!  The texture is kind of like a brownie, and the chocolaty flavor did not disappoint.  They do have a lot of calories in them for such a small bar (190 a bar), but they also have 7 grams of protein, so that is a plus.  They are also gluten-free!  I would for sure recommend these!

review/summary: They may be natural, and the bad thing is- it tastes that way.
review/text: Chocolate and healthy just doesn't mix well. These bars are no different. And at 190 calories for one bar (and the bar is actually way smaller than the wrapper)  it's just not worth it, especially if it doesn't even taste all that great. These bars have a consistency of the fake, Little Debbie brownies, mixed with an earthy, dirt texture, and just a hint of bird food. The actual chocolate flavor is very masked and the almonds are completely tasteless.  There is almost no redeaming quality for them, aside from the fact that I've actually eaten far worse chocolate bars. There are FAR better, healthy alternatives for chocolate lovers who actually want something good out of their indulgence. South Beach Living Fiber Fit Mocha Granola Bars are pretty much the best one's I've eaten in the healthy category. At least they actually taste delicious AND have fiber. However, for the vegans and vegetarians in the world out there, these Pure Bars are certainly edible and like I said, better than some I've had. For the other population that actually want a good tasting snack alternative, buy something else.

review/summary: He Likes It. He Likes It.
review/text: After looking at the product wrapper, I expected a mass of nuts and chocolate when I ripped off the wrapper only to see a smooth, thin, sticky mass that somewhat resembles a chocolate brownie. There are no chocolate chunks to be seen, and the small bits of nuts can only be found within the pure natural chocolate almond bar which mostly consists of dates or a date puree.<br /><br />That being said, I actually like the taste and texture of this bar quite a bit. The chocolate flavor dominates and only the label indicates to me the predominance of date content, certainly not the taste. There is some moderate crunch to the smooth texture, and the eater's fingers will get a little sticky while eating this soft bar.<br /><br />The box of bars arrived at my house on a day of near 100 degree heat, a little warm but basically unharmed. The bar has 190 calories, 70 of which are from fat, so keep that in mind. Five grams of fiber and 7 grams of protein are an added bonus for these gluten free, vegan bars.

review/text: Love this product because it has a rich dark cocoa and not the standard overly sweet American chocolate most sweets have.  Its 70% protein and 5g Fiber, and is gluten free and has the U kosher symbol. 190 calories means this is not something you want to eat more than once a day as part of a whole healthy diet.<br /><br />Tastes like a French chocolate treat and I love how they made the dates and almonds blend into a delicious mini crunch. Not a heavy crunch but akin to a lovely moist grown up French brownie.  Will be buying these to keep on hand.

review/text: Since these are touted as a "healthy" snack, I didn't really expect them to be amazing.  Sometimes you're pleasantly surprised with items in the "healthy" and "organic" categories, but this one was kind of on the fence.  They tasted decent, but the chocolate flavor was subpar and left a weird aftertaste in my mouth.  Not bad if you're into these kinds of products, but for what it was, it's a little pricey and could use some improvement.

review/summary: TERRIFIC taste, wish they were smaller!
review/text: I was expecting a chocolate tasting granola type of bar, and these are more like a super fudgy, soft chocolate brownie than anything. They have about twice as many calories as I allow for a snack though- 190 and I try to stick to 100. I felt like the bars were large, and could easily be halved and packaged seperately to fit with many weight loss programs. The thing I like the MOST about the bars though is the fact that they are gluten free and vegan. It is very difficult to find reasonable yummy snacks that fit in either of those catagories. It is especially hard to find gluten free baked goods that are tasty. So after I ate one, and my daughter ate one, and we liked them, my husband, who is NOT into health food at ALL, but is majorly into brownies, ate all the rest and loved them! So if they pleased him, that is saying a lot for the taste. Or perhaps I have just not baked him anything in far too long!

review/summary: Gluten free, vegan and Kosher... doesn't get any cleaner.
review/text: I will start off this review by stating that this product is gluten free, kosher and vegan.  For my unhealthy eat bagged and processed junk ways this little bar surprisingly hit all the right notes.  When you first open it, you will see that it is a smidgen smaller than a Snickers bar.  Yes... Yes... I do see the irony of including an unhealthy candybar in my review of a good for you alternative.  Now onto the flavor:  It is laced with crushed almonds throughout and has a very strong molasses taste. The bar is a tad sweet but in a natural way.  It isn't the same as diet products in respect to the flavor.  The chocolate almond flavor is very dark and looks like a tight moist brownie.  The smell is very reminiscent of a dark coffee.  From it's wrapper claims it is chock full of protein and a healthy alternative to all those other bars filled with preservatives and filler.  At the end of the day I not only loved the bar but so did my family.  The box was gone in 2 days.  No one else complained about the molasses flavored sweetness that would have me reaching for a drink after 3 bites.  The sweetness does satisfy a sweet tooth though!  Highly recommend to families and individuals that are looking for that healthy alternative that is PURE.. awesome find for those that have dietary restrictions.  For us I find them to be a bit steep in price considering our house of five goes through them at lightening speed.

review/summary: Adequate taste, serves the purpose, travels well
review/text: The Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bars were average. They were dense and chewy like an undercooked brownie but with a fruity aftertaste. When I need nutrition on the go it serves the purpose quite well. I don't find myself craving them or having to hold myself back from attacking the box in the pantry however. As far carrying them around in the purse or in the backpace, they do that quite well as the dense texture keeps them in one piece and from getting banged up and broken. I don't like taking out the granola bar I packed in the morning to find it in a million pieces and having to shake the package into my mouth to eat it.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'll buy these in the future, but I won't have any issues finishing what I already have. They serve the purpose of a traveling snack pretty well with a middle of the road taste. I like the chocolate, not so much the fruity note. The almonds were good and a bit sparse.

review/text: I'm giving this product three stars by grading on a sort of curve. Or maybe it's more of an averaging. I hated these bars. Truly hated them. I don't think I've ever stopped eating something with chocolate in it before but I only managed to eat half of one bar.<br /><br />  On the other hand, the two people who tried them with me loved them. They said that the bar was moist and chewy and delicious. I agree they are moist and chewy. I think if this had been advertised as a protein bar or a healthy product I may not have had such high hopes and been disappointed so severely.<br /><br />  So, try them but don't think chocolate while you do. Think vitamins, think good for you...

review/summary: Average Natural Bars with Stong Cooca
review/text: First note that the bars themselves do not resemble what you see on the box or package -- that image is of chocolate and large almonds.  The bars themselves reminded me of no-bake cookies formed a rectangle with a deep, black color.  The almonds are pieces within the dense and surprisingly moist bar itself.<br /><br />While nutritionally this is good, in terms of taste the best I can say is that the cocoa is strong.  Beyond that this reminds me very much of the "natural" or "sugar free" bars and cookies that were just coming out two decades ago. This does not have that sickly sweet taste nor the unmistakable prune taste -- if I wanted prunes, I'd eat them -- but it is also not much of an improvement for two decades of development in the food industry.  Thus I could only honestly give this 3 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />You do however get 12 bars in a pack and compared to many granola or cereal bars out there, this is a lot for your money. My best advice is to try one before you buy an entire box.

review/summary: Won't Replace Hershey's with Almonds
review/text: Disclaimer: A free sample of these bars were received from Amazon Vine in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The Pure Natural bars are gluten free protein snack bars. I sampled the Chocolate Almond flavor. I did not really care for the first bar but have since eaten a couple more and have raised my opinion to "okay." I don't eat protein bars generally, finding the ones that taste decent to be high in carbs or sugar or both-- if I'm going to eat something with that much carb or sugar I might as well "sin lustfully" and grab a Hershey bar.<br /><br />That being said, these bars are chewy with a fruity flavor. They do not taste very chocolatey, nor can you really taste, or even find, the almonds. However, they also do not have a strong bran or "dog food" taste as I find with many other protein bars.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy these on my own, and I'm not even sure if I will finish the package, but if you have gluten problems and you like protein bars, you may find you like these.

review/summary: Kids didn't go for it.
review/text: I was really hoping the kids would take to these so I'd have a new product to add to their school lunches, but, they didn't care much for them at all.  (15, 11, and 5 years old)  The bars are dense and chewy with a few almonds tossed in. While they are supposed to be chocolate, they have a tangy, slightly sour taste that tends to be the first thing I notice.  The kids and I are gluten-sensitive, and on the box it clearly states that they are gluten free, but also that they are "produced in a facility that also processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, sesame, tree nuts".  I'm extremely sensitive and often react to slight cross contamination, but I had no problem with these bars.  All in all, I might buy this flavor for myself as an occasional switch from my usual Larabar.

review/summary: Not Chocolate
review/text: This did not taste like a chocolate bar at all. I can't describe how it tastes as I haven't encountered something like this before. I know that is is suppose to be better for you and it's all natural but honestly, I've had slim fast bars that tasted better than this. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this as it went into the garbage.

review/summary: Really Grew on Me
review/text: I was looking for a less-unhealthy-than-usual breakfast or snack that I could carry with me and eat on the go or at my desk, and so I gave these a try.  I have nothing to compare them to as far as similar bars are concerned.  I am not a health fanatic - - the words "chocolate" and "almonds" appeal to me much more than any health claims.  I want the good stuff, and I want it now.  I like rich tasting foods, but dislike sweet foods.  As you've probably guessed by now, I will not be reviewing these bars based on grams of this or that or energy levels or any such, just taste.<br /><br />Before I ate my first Pure Naturals bar, I had no idea what to expect.  I found the dense texture a little surprising and the taste okay, nothing great but certainly not bad -- definitely not sweet.  Then the next day, I ate a bar for breakfast with a cup of tea.  After that I started craving them and have had one most mornings since then.  I find them a good alternative to other on-the-go breakfasts and very satisfying.  I really enjoy them now and would recommend that people give them a chance.<br /><br />I might add that I find a full bar good for a light breakfast, but a full bar is too much for an afternoon snack at my desk.  I cut them in half for a snack and save the second half for the next day.

review/summary: Ugh
review/text: Over the years I have eaten MANY "health" bars, fiber bars, protein bars, etc.  I usually eat a protein bar a day, and I am very used to the chalky texture and taste of protein bars and have learned to overcome them.  The Pure Natural Chocolate Almond bar is not a protein bar, but tastes almost as bad as that. Correction, it tastes, worse than a protein bar.  There is no real chocolate taste to it at all, and the protein chunks that are in it taste like these cheap almond pieces they used to shove into candy bars 30 years ago, way too small to offer any real taste.  Actually, they taste just like the nuts you get in brownies. I love almonds, but hated the taste of these. I forced myself to eat three of these bars so I could give them an accurate review, and that was extremely difficult.<br /><br />The selling point of Pure Bars are that they are made with natural, whole ingredients and are vegetarian and gluten-free.  As someone who is trying to avoid High Fructose Corn Syrup and added sugar, I like that, however it doesn't do me any good if I can't enjoy the product enough to consume it.  I know some reviews have claimed that these are "health bars" and that they have too much sugar, but they are not marketed as a "health bar."  Too many people confuse the ideas of "whole" and "natural" foods as "health" foods, which is entirely not the case. The idea is that these bars are for people who don't want additives and a lot of over-processing in their food, it's just unfortunately that they taste so bad.  If you're looking for a better-tasting alternative, I'd suggestion the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00199KYSO">-  Kashi Go Lean Crunchy Variety Bars (All Natural) - 24 ct. (meal Replacement Bars)</a> or maybe the Clif Builders Bars.

review/summary: No seconds
review/text: I received this product through the vine program. I generally consume one or two protein bars per day, so I was excited to try ths product.  The excitement ended after the first bite.  It was dry, chalky, and not very chocolatey, not mention that I didn't detect any almonds in the bar.  It wasn't terrible, but also just wasn't very good.  If these bars were just stacked with proteins and vitamins, I might buy more. However, there are better tasting alternatives out there that have superior nutritional value.<br /><br />I would pass on these.

review/summary: Great if you love the taste of almonds and chocolate
review/text: PROS<br /><br />- you get a generous package of 12 bars per box<br />- very chocolatey flavor if you like chocolate<br />- very strong almond flavor if you like almonds<br />- very moist, chewy snack bar<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- the bar size is very small, so it's not a meal replacement; you would need to pair it with more food for an adequate meal<br />- I personally prefer a crunchy snack or granola bar, and if you don't like a bar to have a moist, chewy texture, you might not like this bar<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />This is a good value for the price. I personally dislike the strong almond flavor with the chocolate. Pecans or peanuts would be more flavorful, but if you love almonds with chocolate you might like this bar. I has a much stronger almond flavor than an Almond Joy candy bar, but without the coconut to offset it.

review/summary: Didn't care of it too much
review/text: I think this is one of those types of food products where you will either really like it or not care for it.<br /><br />I am a chocolate fan and I love chocolate and almonds, so I figured this was a natural fit for me.<br /><br />Upon opening the first bar it seems like any other bar of it's type. However, once that first bite was in my mouth it's evident it was not. The chocolate in these bards over powers the taste of anything else. Like I said, I'm a chocolate fan but this was just too potent of chocolate for my tastes.<br /><br />Since there were a dozen in the box I decided to let a few others try them. It was a mixed bag of results there too. One person took one bite and would have no more. One said they were okay with coffee. One person ate an entire bar before deeming it "not very good". The last person really liked them and said he would buy them in a store. So, basically 1 out of 5 people in my highly unscientific research liked them.<br /><br />I guess if you are a dark chocolate person these may be something you'll like. But if you're not stay clear of these.

review/summary: Vegan Chocolate Treat
review/text: I really like that these Pure Natural Bars are vegan and gluten free.  They have a good chocolate flavor and seven grams of protein.<br /><br />I'm currently pregnant and need to take snacks with me to keep my blood sugar steady and these work great for throwing in my purse.  They wouldn't hold up well in the car right now though with the heat we've been having.  The box that I received was a bit banged up and it was clear that some of the bars had melted a bit in transit.<br /><br />The only negative for me is the texture wasn't quite what I was expecting.  I thought the bars would have a candy bar type texture or maybe even a granola bar type texture but these are a bit more like a brownie bar.  I'm not crazy about the texture but overall these are a good snack to have on hand.

review/summary: Tasty Brownie-Like Bar
review/text: This is a pretty decent bar to snack on.  It has a sort of brownie-like consistency and taste.  The primary ingredient in this bar is dates which seems to be a pretty common one in the natural/vegan realm of sweats.  In turn, it has a pretty distinctive taste.  It is pretty tasty with a cocoa (not a rich chocolate) and almond flavor.  Quite moist which is nice.  My only complaint is that each bar is pretty small at 1.7 oz.  While golfing, I often eat bars like Odwalla or Cliff that are 2+ oz.<br /><br />On a sort of side note, it would be nice if Amazon posted the Nutritional Facts and Ingredients for all the food products they sell.
