review/text: All of Blairs products are Great Quality. These are by far the hottest Ive tried & I am about the only one I  know who can eat them. What makes these so good is that the heat is ALL there but there is tons of flavor too! The Parmesean & Cajun are also quite good with a bit less heat! I have bought them by the case On Blairs site, its nice to see them offered through Amazon too!

review/text: This is an excellent bag of chips!  I bought two cases and shared them with the folks at work.  Everyone is raving about level of heat.<br /><br />The chip quality is very good, very crunchy like a kettle cooked chip should be.<br /><br />Must agree with the previous review, wash your hands after you eat these.  You do not want Habanero in your eyes!<br /><br />I have found that they are often out of stock, I signed up to be notified as soon as they came in, then I snagged two cases.

review/summary: Not so great
review/text: I first ordered the Chipotle flavor.  I didn't enjoy the flavor very much, but the texture was crispy and the amount of flavor was perfect.  There was plenty of flavor there but it wasn't overwhelming like some brands are.  It was because of this that I decided to give Blair's a second chance.  I ordered the Habanero flavor next.  I was extremely disappointed.  Gone was the perfect amount of flavoring the chipotle chips had.  Instead the chips had so much seasoning it was darn near falling off the chips.  I've had a few brands of habanero before, but this one tasted nothing like any of them.  It has almost a sweet flavor to it.  I personally didn't care for it at all.  On top of it all, the chips aren't even very hot.  I was very disappointed in how hot both chips were considering the brand is called Death Rain.  If you can find them, try Poore Brothers Habanero chips.  THOSE are some hot chips, with a fantastic flavor.

This is a high quality product that you will be able to enjoy over and over and over. I would recommend the spiced version over the other variations, but each is just as high of quality as the next.

review/summary: Pure Organic Cranberry Orange Bar
review/text: This bar reminded me of fruit cake.  The taste of the cranberries, oranges, and nuts (especially the walnuts) blended together to give me that awesome, wonderful taste of fruit cake.  (But not so much that someone who doesn't like fruit cake wouldn't like this bar.  If you don't like fruit cake, don't not try this bar just because I mentioned it tasting, to me, like fruit cake.  It is NOT fruit cake - it just reminds me of it.)  It has been a long time since I've had fruit cake.  That's one bad thing about being vegan - you miss a lot of wonderful treats that you used to enjoy.  Oh, there are companies that make vegan "treats", but all the ones I've encountered all use soy (and I don't like soy).  I have not yet found a company that makes vegan treats without soy.  Therefore, I either have to make my own or else miss out.  I have not yet made my own vegan fruit cake, but now I don't have to even try.  This Pure Organic Cranberry Orange Bar satisfies my craving for it.<br /><br />I am grateful for this bar (as well as all the varieties).  There will be times when I just want coffee and a pastry (especially when I am reading a cozy mystery), but I might not have any pastries already made (I can't go to the store to buy any, as I do not eat animal products, and they all have milk, eggs, etc.)  I either have to stop reading and make my vegan version (which I've done many times), or else I can just eat a Pure Bar.  No, I can't just go to the store to buy a pastry, but I can go to the store and buy a Pure Bar.<br /><br />I've had other Pure Bars, but this is the first time I've ever had this particular variety.  I am grateful for it; now I can have something that tastes, to me, like fruit cake, and coffee.  (Or tea, whatever mood I'm in).<br /><br />And not only do these bars tastes good, but they are healthy, organic, vegan, soy-free.  I don't know which is the strongest - the heavenly taste or the heavenly healthiness.<br /><br />I am indeed thankful for these bars.  I never have to worry about soy.  They are awesome tasting, and are always there for me when I need them.

review/text: This is, by far, one of the best teas [...]has to offer.  It's sweet, soothing flavor is perfect after a long, cold day.  However, I've learned to steep it an extra few minutes to really bring out the vanilla flavor.  Otherwise, it's only a subtle hint in the stronger black tea.  It comes out *perfect* if you steep it for 7 minutes (instead of 5).  I'd reccomend this to anyone, especially people with a taste for vanilla.  It also makes a great iced tea!

review/summary: superb holiday splurge, truly exceptional ham
review/text: My family has been ordering holiday goodies from the Swiss Colony since I was a little girl. When the boxes with the Swiss Colony logo arrived we fell upon them like famished fools. What a treat! The Swiss Colony Baked Ham is described by the company as "fork-tender", and that is absolutely true! These hams are so succulent, tender, and flavorful that they won't last long once they are opened! We simply sliced the ham and placed in a baking dish and let it cook just long enough to warm it and bring out the juiciness. We then devoured it with whatever else we were eating, but the ham was what we remembered! There is very little fat on this ham, but I always saved the end pieces and the bone and used them to cook a pot of dried beans. Best beans ever! This product deserves more than five stars, but that's all I am allowed to give--it really deserves ten stars : )

It's not flavored, it's made w/ real juice (concentrate, but I expected that) so the cranberry-ness really comes through.  No artificial flavorings in either the chocolate or the filling.  All the ingredients are quality.  Well worth the price & I'm going to bump up the frequency on my subscribe & save!

review/summary: More than pleased
review/text: Trying to find extracts/flavors aside from your run-of-the-mill kinds (ie. vanilla, almond, mint, immitation rum and banana) can be a challenge.  Luckily, I was thinking ahead for once and browsed online long before I needed it for an upcoming dessert/event.  While I didn't really need a 3-pk this purchase seemed like my best option.  A common complaint of strawberry cakes/baked goods is the flavor is either too strong (from using artificial mixes) or isn't there at all (from using just fresh strawberry/from scratch).  I'm not a baking snob who would die before making something from a box because I have cheated before and can assure you I will again.  But more times than not I try to bake my cakes and cupcakes out of real ingredients.  For this job, I needed something to add to my "not from the box" recipe for strawberry magarita cupcakes.  This product was just the thing.  True, it's a "flavoring" and therefore not 100% real but the description doesn't lie.  This is as close to the real thing as you're going to get.  I used plenty of fresh strawberries (macerated in sugar) and its juices in my recipe but if I didn't add this secret weapon my cupcakes wouldn't have had the great fruity flavor they did.  I'm sure I'll have future uses for it and luckily enough to go around.  I'm kinda considering to stock up and get their variety pack of flavors since it'd be nice to have on hand.

review/summary: Sugar baby feet
review/text: I am not able to zoom in on the image like the description indicates so I was unable to see that these feet are basically sugar cubes (which is fine, they're cute) sprayed with food color.  That would be fine except that they are not completely blue or pink, the spray doesn't get into the spot between the toes and the feet so it is still white, plus the pink is more of a hot pink rather than a cute baby pink.  I'm adding these to a cake today and I'm sure mom-to-be will love them but I just expected them to be totally colored.<br /><br />I also ordered the sugar onesies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026HG4SM">Lucks Dec-Ons Baby Onepiece Assortment, 12 pk</a> which are absolutely adorable.  If you haven't see them, check them out-they are going to be perfect on the cake.

review/text: I bought this sauce tonight because I felt like some linguine alfredo and it was on sale.<br /><br />I opened the jar and got a whiff of something completely artificial.  I can't even properly describe it... it was like plastic.  I thought, huh, maybe it just needs some garlic (I could smell no garlic whatsoever despite the self-described "roasted garlic" label).  I mixed in half a tsp. of minced garlic.  Nope... still smelled like melted plastic.<br /><br />I heated it up.  It smelled worse.  I tasted it.  It tasted worse than it smelled.<br /><br />Bottom line is this... if you like alfredo, don't buy this.  You'll only end up throwing out your dinner and most of a jar of sauce like I did.

review/summary: Love love LOVE this tea!
review/text: I discovered this tea a couple of years ago on a trip to Colorado. I liked it so much that I wrote down the name of it so I could buy it. I had no luck initially, but recently searched again, and of course, it was available on Amazon.com. It's every bit as good as I remember. The tea is so fragrant and flavorful. Truly good stuff. I also ordered the African Nectar, which is amazing.

review/summary: Great Dog Food, Baxter loves it.
review/text: I had read the list on the web site for reviewing the rating of various dog food and really liked what I read. Made a small purchse and  how my new little Baxter loves it and he is only 4 months old. Always downs his very healthy food that is put out for him on a regular basis 3 times a day and left down for ony about 45 or so mins. No itch problem and all so healthy with no junk fillers. People need to go look up the nutrition values of this food and make their own decision. Might even compare it with some fo the products your vet sells you and you will see the vet is in for profits with some of their product.<br /><br />Harold in Keeeeeeeeeeeeentucky

review/summary: Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
review/text: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

review/summary: Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
review/text: These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!

review/summary: Bold BBQ taste that is not too spicy!
review/text: I love these Blue Diamond Almond snacks and I particularly like the bold flavors.  This flavor is very good and the smoky BBQ taste just sets off the flavor of the crunchy almond that it coats.  I like an evening snack while I read a book and these for me are just so much better than chips and other snack foods.  It gives you a chance to snack but still eat healthy.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat.

I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 7% of your daily intake of sodium and if you are on a salt restricted diet then make sure to watch your salt intake.  The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.<br /><br />This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!

review/summary: Crunchy almond treat with a sassy Jalapeno kick!
review/text: Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!

review/summary: A hot, bold and tasty snack!
review/text: I love Blue Diamond Almonds and this bold flavor gives you a spicy hot choice for a snack.  They are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and calcium while only being 170 calories for one serving.  They also add 3 grams of dietary fiber to your diet and 6 grams of protein while only adding 2 grams of sugar.<br /><br />They do contain 15 grams of fat but only 1 gram of saturated fat and 0 grams of trans fat. (Mostly they are the good stuff)  If you want a quick snack that is high in protein and low in sugar and sodium these are pretty good and spicy.<br /><br />While there are other flavors that I like more this one is still very good.  Just remember, they are addictive so you only get one serving!

review/summary: Great Flavor....
review/text: I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.

review/summary: Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting
review/text: The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.

review/text: I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the "bold" flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.

review/text: When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you.

review/summary: Best flavor and best price of any Blue Diamond almonds!
review/text: The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.

review/text: I was concerned that these might be too hot, 'Habanero', but the heat is perfect as is the flavor... they are bold, if you like stuff plain--these are not for you... but if you like a robust flavor, a definite must!  Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend.

review/summary: Highly addictive! Great with beer
review/text: I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!

review/text: The taste is perfect. Smoky with just enough heat to let you know it is there. These don't have 5 alarm heat if that's what you are looking for. These almonds are perfectly seasoned and very addicting. Great if you are on a ketogenic or low carb diet.

review/summary: Wasabi Lovers Rejoice! These Wasabi SoySauce Blue Diamond Almonds Taste Fantastic!!
review/text: Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!

My boyfriend, who doesn't like sushi, really enjoys these too, so they aren't just for sushi lovers.  I believe they are roasted, so they are not as healthy as raw almonds, but they still make a great afternoon snack.

review/summary: The best almond flavor out there. How could something so delish be so good for you?
review/text: The "Jalapeno Smokehouse" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older. I like to think it's partly because of these luscious babies. Dr Jeddy prescribes a handful every day!

review/summary: Not as crunchy as the other Blue Diamond flavors
review/text: I'm addicted to Blue Diamond almonds. I've tried all the flavors -- and this was the last one I tried. I love salt, I love vinegar, and I love salt-and-vinegar potato chips, so how could I lose with these?<br /><br />Well, I'm just not that into them. The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.<br /><br />Oh well. Guess even my ol' reliable Blue Diamond can't hit it out of the park every time.

The combination of soy sauce salty and wasabi spicy create the perfect storm of "I'm going to eat this entire can RFN."<br /><br />The cans are all perfectly sealed and the almonds are always fresh - what else can you ask for? The cost is also lower than in local stores, but you can buy the larger bags cheaper (per oz) from some Walmarts if you can find them.<br /><br />Almonds are supposed to be appetite suppressants, but for me it's usually because I ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more.

review/summary: Great Low Carb snack to go!!
review/text: Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more.

review/summary: A healthy addiction
review/text: Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds. The soy sauce flavor is hardly noticeable but just nicely tones down the heat of the wasabi.

I like to have a healthy snack at work mid-afternoon so I bought a bag of these at the grocery store.  They are so good I can't stop at 23 (a serving size).  I am not going to buy these again until I'm at my goal because I can't stop eating them.  They are quite salty so if you are trying to control your sodium, beware.  They are not as "hot" as wasabi peas, a more gentle kick.  I highly recommend them. Very savory.

But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the "bold" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!

review/text: I love salt and vinegar chips, but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross, but was willing to give it a try.  And boy they are great!  They have about twice the vinegar punch of most chips, and are amazingly good, and the fat is the good kind, and you get plenty full on the almonds.  Mmmmmm.<br /><br />I was buying the tins (which are sometimes available at the grocery store), but then realized I couldn't stop once I opened a tin and was eating something like 1,200 calories in a single day just on almonds.  So these packs are perfect - there are enough almonds to really satisfy a hungry stomach, but not so much to blow your diet.  And they're great to stash when you know that you won't be able to grab a real meal, but don't want to find yourself at a vending machine or 7Eleven buying crap b/c you're so hungry.  Even my (naturally thin) hubby loves them.  Perfect!

I recommend them to anyone, not only those of us trying to stick to a diet that deprives us of less healthy snacks.

review/summary: Absolutely the yummiest of the Blue Diamond flavored almonds
review/text: I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried. They have the nice fresh-tasting almonds you expect from Blue Diamond, and you can actually taste the wasabi (unlike the jalapeno smokehouse, where the jalapeno part is really elusive).<br /><br />I was reluctant at first to try this. Didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. Terrific snack almonds (if you don't mind saltiness). Love em.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: You can definitely taste the salt & vinegar
review/text: Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too "dry," some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are "too" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12.

review/summary: Perfect balance but
review/text: I wanted more wasabi flavor but there is enough for a good balanced taste. Really, they are pretty good. You can actually find these in walmart for $3 a can so its about the same as buying here.

review/summary: A nice enough flavor, but I wouldn't describe it as either "Blazin'" or "Buffalo Wing."
review/text: I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their "BOLD" line. Alas, their definition of "BOLD" is apparently "a little too spicy for kids." This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-"blazin'." It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>. But it doesn't taste much like anything in particular. They could have called it "BOLD Generic Faux-Spicy Snack to be Eaten Brainlessly While Watching the Game" flavor and it would have been more accurate.

review/summary: Not the best flavor
review/text: Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.<br /><br />For spiciness they are better than the habanero but not as much as the wasabi can be (though in all fairness the wasabi is in a whole different taste spectrum anyway)<br /><br />Flavorwise is where they lose out. They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.

review/summary: Not As Balanced As Other Bold Flavors, But Not Bad
review/text: I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other "Bold" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the "soy" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Taste kind of strange....
review/text: To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again.

review/text: This product was delivered on time, but I can not say that it was worth the money.  When you look at the price per oz. it becomes much more expensive than you think.
