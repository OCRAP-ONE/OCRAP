review/summary: For that warm fuzzy feeling down to your toes!
review/text: There is this cafe down the road from where I live that serves the best cup of cocoa I have had in a long time.  I inquired as to how they make it and was told that it was "Big Train Hot Chocolate."<br /><br />I immediately came home and ordered the 3.5lb bag!  Its rich, creamy and satisfies that need for chocolate all the while warming your insides down to your toes!<br /><br />I now have my entire family stuck on this hot chocolate as well as friends who have personally ordered their own.  So if you are wanting that warm and cozy feeling you remember from being a kid with your cup of hot chocolate after a day playing in the snow.. purchase this, sit back and enjoy!

review/summary: pleasantly surprised
review/text: i've often used instant coffee in a jar since no one else in the house drinks it and making a pot regardless of the size is a bit of a hassle. jar coffee loses its robust-ness after a while, it sort of 'stales'. being this coffee comes in little single serve sleeves it is always fresh. and the flavor was surprising and when it hits the hot water it smells brewed, mmm good. i first tried it when i picked up a pack of 6 at my local target for only $1 (appx .17 per cup!). so then i thought i'd see if i can get a better deal on amazon for larger quantity. i don't care for super strong starbuck kind of coffee so i make mine using about 10-12oz of water verses the recommended 8oz. but if you like yours more full bodied i don't think this coffee will disappoint. ps. DO NOT buy Superior's brand of instant decaf, even tho i prefer weaker coffee i had to use 4 of their individual packets to get even a slightly mild flavor, it was much cheaper than tasters choice and as we learn over and over again 'you get what you paid for'... so now i'm back ordering the good stuff.

review/summary: Cats Love this!
review/text: I bought this kit for my cats after buying them cat grass at the farmers market.  They went crazy for it and the next time I went to market they were out of cat grass. Coming home emtied handed was not an option for my cats!! I bought the kit and it is a no brainer.  The grass comes up in a few days when put in sunlight.  It takes about a week to get it up to the size for the cats to enjoy and it last about a week.  It is worth it to see them devour the first blades when I put it out.  My cats are two full grown 20lb kittys!  They would live without out it but really like having it to munch on.  The combination of oat, rye, wheat and barley must make it tastier than just the oat grass that I get at the farmers market.

review/summary: SmartCat Performance Review
review/text: I purchased the "SmartCat Kitty's Garden" original and an extra refill. The product performs as advertised, producing grass my cat loved and voraciously consumed.  This is a good product; however the growing space is limited to 4 small pockets and the grass does not last very long due to the root system becoming "root-bound"; thereby choking any chance of long-term growth. Because of this fact, I decided to order Cat-Grass, Sweet Oats and other seeds in "bulk" and plant them myself...so as to have plenty and sustained growth over a longer period of time.<br /><br />HOW TO: (1.)Select a receptacle, which has good drainage, and is about 3 to 4 inches deep. A square shape is best so that your cat can't  tip it over or push it.  (2.)Fill the receptacle with dirt or peat mixture.  (3.) Spread and plant the new seeds about 1/8 to 1/4 inch deep ... making certain that every seed is covered with dirt. "Lightly pack the dirt" ... don't press hard... allow the shoots access to grow.  (4.)Water... (not soak)... and cover the container with a clear plastic...(like a big Baggie or Dry Cleaner's plastic bag). (5.)Be sure to use a "fork" to poke about 30 to 40 small vent holes in and round the plastic. This creates a "Hot House" effect and prevents mold. (6.)Place container where it will receive good, strong sun-light during the day and not freeze at night.  In about 5 to 7 days you should experience growth.<br /><br />Let your Cat have at the grass when it reaches about 3 inches in length. I lightly spray with water and re-cover the grass with plastic every other day or so to stimulate growth and peak my cat's interest.  When grass no longer grows... and this will vary according to your planting and care methods... simply use new soil and replant the grass by following the above instructions. The good thing about buying in "bulk" is that you can experiment with different growing methods and not lose money while doing so...Good Luck!!<br /><br />Good "Bulk" buys  Amazon.Com are:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045826ZU">Catgrass (Sweet Oats for Cats) 1,000 Seeds Bulk</a> and: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V1WVHA">Ferry-Morse 1985 Organic Catgrass Seeds, Monida Oats (16.5 Gram Packet)</a>

review/summary: Fast growing, but not long lasting
review/text: We've purchased a couple of these and the first one we had a HUGE mold problem with.  The second one was better, but only lasted about 2 weeks.  No mold problem, but the grass has died even with proper watering.  The other problem with it was that when the cats would eat it, they would pull the whole section of grass out of the container and make quite a mess.

review/summary: Not worth it
review/text: I had mixed results when I planted the seeds (they did sprout but not as fully as I would have liked). I ended up picking up some seeds from a local garden center that ended up working a lot better and being a lot cheaper. In the end I found that my local farmers market has some organic wheat grass I can pick up for $0.99 and get some of that every week. I'd recommend trying to grow a planter of whatever your pet likes best by yourself and just giving them that.

review/text: This product is GREAT! My cats LOVE it, and it is so easy to grow! It also grows VERY FAST! The only thing I did not like about this product is that the instructions are buried underneath one of the seed containers. You have to empty out the seeds before you can find the instructions to know what to do! If you do not know this, you will go crazy trying to find the instructions, or think that their are none! For this reason I rated it a 4.

To help protect the environment I think I will opt to get my own seeds and peat next time.

review/summary: kitty greens a hit!
review/text: I've been using this product for my two cats for quite awhile now. I first found it locally, but then they didn't carry it anymore so I began getting it at Amazon. Pros: easy to use, grass fast growing, both cats enjoy it, keeps them from getting their greens by way of my houseplants, reasonable cost when use refills. Cons: as noted by others the grass doesn't last very long before yellowing and wilting so I too just do two sections at once; cats can pull whole container out when eating, so in doing only two at a time now, I put small rocks in other two sections and problem solved. Despite the cons I like this product and recommend it.

review/summary: This is How I Plant Them
review/text: They are oats, wheat, rye, and barley. In other words, they do seed if allowed to mature before getting killed by cats. Since I do have a backyard with space to plant, I plant seeds in soil. It takes about 4 months to complete their life cycle. During their growth, I only pick off tips of the leaves so they could still continue to grow. Only the last few days of seed maturing the leaves turn dry and yellow and are not edible. In return, I could get seeds "for free" to plant right away, as long as the weather allows it.<br />I don't use any pest control or use any fertilizer, so certainly not all of the seeds would survive. Aphids, with the help of ants, and snails do invade, and a slight strong gust could break their fragile stems. However, I could be sure that they are certainly organic through out the process. And the source of grass would not die down during the months they grow.<br /><br />Notes: Remember to wash before feeding to cats, and certainly don't pick off parts that had been bitten by aphids or crawled by snails.

review/text: Bought these to decorate some goodies for a bake sale. I was happy to find a product that was vegan, gluten free, and that had no artificial colors. The only problem is that the actual sprinkles are not even close to being the colors shown on the package. They show: green, pink, yellow and white. I have a hard time seeing that they have are anything but white unless I am really close, and when I used them on white icing they weren't really noticeable. Bummer. I guess on darker frosting you would still get some impact and if I had to choose between artificially colored sprinkles or these I would still go with these.

review/summary: what happened to the color?!?!?!?
review/text: We had been buying these nonpareils and sprinkles for a while, but sometime in the last year they changed their formula and now the colors are so muted when you put them on food you can't even tell they have color. Poorly done Let's Do Organic! Especially when there are so few choice for naturally colored sprinkles and nonpareils. So, I'd have given them a lower start rating except that they still are the only naturally colored sprinkle I can get at the grocery store and I will continue to buy them.<br /><br />addendum:<br />I have since writing the above (I left it as I had originally written it) figured out that the "new formula" is that this is the organic version, the colors on their non-organic versions are fine, it is just the organic version that is so pale.  The problem is, our local natural food stores only carry the organic version, this is why I was no longer seeing any product with good color.  I found the non-organic version with better color at a Whole Foods while traveling out of state.  If organic is important to you on this item then alas there us nothing to be done but suffer pale colors.  But, if all you are looking for is sprinkles with natural coloring then, look for their non-organic ones and you'll be happy.

review/summary: Trying these instead of Frosted Mini-Wheats
review/text: I'm a big fan of Kellogg's Frosted Mini-Wheats, but I decided to give Shredded Wheat a try because Amazon is offering it at a really great price for four boxes.<br /><br />When I poured myself a bowl, I first noticed that Shredded Wheat is a lot smaller than Frosted Mini-Wheats.  These are closer to Chex in size and shape, but each piece is a dense brick of shredded wheat lightly covered in sugar.  Biting into them, they definitely felt harder and crunchier than Mini-Wheats too.  They also tasted a little more toasted and slightly less sugary, even though both products contain 12g of sugar.<br /><br />After having a bowl of Shredded Wheat, I think I still prefer Frosted Mini-Wheats.  Shredded Wheat is a little too dense and crunchy for my taste, but it's not a bad cereal.  I'll happily finish my four boxes, but I probably won't be buying them again.

review/summary: LOVE IT! WISH IT WASN'T SO HARD TO FIND
review/text: When I first decided I wanted to start eating a frosted shredded wheat cereal, I didn't know which one to choose, so I bought both brands - all our grocery stores carried both at that time. Initially, I thought I preferred its competitor, but then I came to decide otherwise. Additionally, right around that time I had my annual check-up and was told to cut my sodium intake, so I then took a look at the labels of all the cereals I had previously eaten for my health looking for sodium content. What I found was that Post Frosted Shredded Wheat was the only cereal to have ZERO sodium! ...The thing is, all of a sudden, I can't find it in any of our grocery stores. They don't even have a space for it anymore. All they carry now is the other brand. So I've had to resort to purchasing it on-line in mass quantities - constantly afraid that Post will discontinue making it. (Or maybe they have already and what we're buying is all that's left...)

On top of that, every box has a coupon for a free Fruit Naturals fruit cup ($1.59 value at my local grocery store).  Very good value, overall.

review/summary: Definitely Not Frosted Mini Wheats, But Okay
review/text: Post's Shredded Wheat isn't really what's pictured on the box.  Instead of a block of wheat with one side frosted and one side not, it's a block of wheat that's very lightly frosted all over.  This isn't necessarily bad, but because the layer of frosting completely surrounds the block, it makes it more tough/crunchy than what I'm used to.  The shreds of wheat are also a little more compacted than Frosted Mini Wheats -  it's a little harder to chew if you're eating it plain without milk, but will stay crunchy a little longer if you eat it with milk.  Despite the full coating of frosting, it isn't overly sweet.  All in all, it definitely wasn't bad, but I probably won't buy it again in the future.  Try a box before ordering the pack of 4 like I did!

review/summary: Healthy and Incredibly Tasty 100% Whole Grain Certified!
review/text: Post shredded Wheat in the Lightly Frosted Cereal flavor is our FAVORITE cereal! It is 100% Whole Grain certified with the stamp on the side of the box to let you know for sure. It has a finer texture that is not so rough on the inside of your mouth. It also does not tend to leave residue leaving you feeling like you are "snacking" on it for an hour after breakfast! It is not overly sweet and has a nice vanilla type flavor. It is amazing for gastric health if you know what I mean!<br />It is also tasty in warm weather put into warm milk to make a hot cereal.<br /><br />Our local stores all stopped carrying this cereal. Because I take a lot of medications that can make my digestive system sluggish it is an important part of my diet and more satisfying than a glass of medicine. When our store couldn't get it in Post had a link to Amazon.com. With FREE shipping and cost Lower than what I ever paid in any store it was an all around great buy!<br /><br />Shipping was MUCH faster than they told me it would be. Packaging was great and secure for a porch drop of.<br /><br />I am 100% happy. I think I will go eat some now!

I had to put them outside on my deck and you could smell them everytime you went out there.  I ran into a rep for Merrick at the opening of a pet store in my area and I told her how they smelled.  She said they went with a different vendor outside the US and they are cheaper and were buffalo. It did not sound like they were going to continue with the buffalo line but not sure.

review/summary: Dog Loves It even more than Merrick Flossies Beef!
review/text: I recently tried these out for my dog despite being more expensive than the regular Flossies as she seems to have gotten a little bored of the regular Flossies. (I stopped giving them to her for a while to help increase her interest again) She's VERY picky when it comes to new things and is not very food motivated so often times I will have to give her something several times before she will try it. (then often times once she does she loves it!) I was shocked that she went for this right away and absolutely loves it!<br /><br />I don't buy them that often so every time I do buy them she is so happy she can barely wait for me to get the packaging off! Speaking of, although I like when items are indiviudally wrapped it is kind of annoying having to get the shrink wrap off the product without breaking it, but I'm sure the reason why Merrick does this is because they do have quite a smell to them.<br /><br />Although the smell isn't pleasant it DOES NOT seem to resonate in the dogs mouth, nor does it stain the carpets. My dog has a soft mouth and is not a strong chewer so these types of treats have always been fine for her. She usually will chew for about 20 minutes and then leave it, which I will pick up and save for later.<br /><br />I've actually caught her eating the whole thing in one sitting now that we have tried these, which is a rarity! These seem to be more "chewy" than the original beef Merrick Flossies - lately she will eat through the Flossies rather than chew on them as she used to, but these she seems to love getting into smaller pieces and picking it up in her mouth and just chewing til her hearts content.<br /><br />Of course not all treats work for all dogs but my pup loves them. I haven't been able to find them in stores except when I was on vacation 300 miles away, so for now I will continue to order on Amazon. It seems that the prices have gone down considerably from when they first came out with the product, although I would like to see better bulk savings!

review/summary: A very robust honey with a mutli-floral taste
review/text: If you are accustomed to store bought clover honey that is clear to the eye and completely processed (meaning heated mostly), then this honey is going to be a shocker to your eyes and tastebuds.<br /><br />I am a honey lover (I love it straight off the honey comb, off the spoon, on my bagel and in my tea) and am pretty particular about the honey I choose.  I think that many of us are so accustomed to those cute little honey bears in the market with clover honey in them that we forget that there is an entire other world of "raw" organic and unprocessed honey.  This honey however takes raw honey another step further.<br /><br />If you are accustomed to spun honey (thicker and cloudier in color) than you are closer to this honey.  Typically honey bees go for the clovers or orange blossoms and you can taste the floral essence in the honey.  This honey is produced by the Mayans in Southern Mexico and has a complex taste filled with multi-floral essences.<br /><br />The review says that it has a "butterscotch" taste and I would say that descriptor is pretty good.  Like a wine, we use many different words (fruits, woods, etc) to describe it's nose and finish.  This honey is THAT complex that it really needs to be enjoyed that way and described like wine.  It is definitely gourmet.<br /><br />If you enjoy more mild honey, this honey might be just a tad too much for your taste and you might not find it as enjoyable.  The honey taste might overshadow whatever you are using it on (toast, etc).  However, if you really thrive after a complex taste and enjoy tasting the floral essences, you are in for a SWEET and delightful surprise.  This is not your average supermarket honey.  It's the champagne of honey that can be enjoyed by connoisseurs who appreciate the floral tones that are so complex.  I've never tasted anything like it!<br /><br />Delicious but anything but mild.  This honey is not for everyone, but those who love it will certainly love it.  I sense that dislike will go in the same direction.<br /><br />When using this honey, think smaller portions because of the pungency.  It is anything but mild!<br /><br />I definitely appreciated the fair trade part of purchasing this honey knowing that the Mayans are receiving a fair wage.  That makes me feel really good. :)<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/text: For the price, you can't beat it.  I love honey that has a distinctive smell, whether it's flowery or grassy or...  This smells clean, flowery and intense.  I actually don't like honey that's too mild.  If you add this in tea, you can still smell the honey.  You'll also like it if you just add a spoonful in plain hot water.  On top of all this, the raw honey is certified organic.  Somehow, I feel safer using certified organic products without the added pesticides and whatnots.  You'll also be helping the environment and the people who are working in these farms.  A definite 5 star product!  I actually used to buy this honey from Whole Foods Supermarket at a much more expensive price.

review/text: This is great-tasting honey.  It does crystallize, though, so it needs to be heated to make it liquid.  The plastic container is a problem -- it isn't recommended to heat it in the microwave, and the label recommends placing the jar in a bowl of hot water.  This is inconvenient and time-consuming.  I heated the jar once, and transferred the honey to a glass jar, which can be heated in the microwave without releasing any potentially dangerous chemicals, but this honey really should be packaged in a glass jar to begin with.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the plastic container.

No big deal, it softens when warm, and honey doesn't go "bad" sitting on a shelf.  My jars showed up intact.  I've gotten good raw honey cheaper in the past, but this was a pretty good deal.  I would consider buying it again in the future.

review/text: The 16 ounces on the jar probably refers to weight, not volume.  Not sure at what point a food product is considered a solid rather than a liquid, but this honey is fairly solid!<br /><br />I enjoyed the thick and creamy texture of this honey. In tea, I found that I needed to make the water slightly hotter than usual in order to dissolve this honey in a reasonable amount of time, but the wait was worth the effort.<br /><br />I also found myself adding more of this honey than my store-bought compilation honey to my drinks for some reason; to me, this raw honey did not taste as sweet as processed honeys, ounce for ounce, but certainly the raw honey tasted more flowery and complex.<br /><br />This was my first experience with raw honey, but I am hooked, and will continue to try this one and new varieties as long as I can afford to!

review/text: So the reason I gave this product 2 stars and not one is because it is fair trade and organic however, I was incredibly disappointed in this honey in general - I enjoy crystallized honey, but the flavor on this is just off somehow.  It *could* be the plastic.  When the package arrived the plastic smell was incredibly strong, took several hours to dissipate and even days later the containers still smelled bad.  I ended up ordering a different brand, Y.S. Organic Bee Farms, and there is just no comparison in flavor and texture - I will not order the Wholesome brand again.  Incidentally, when the new honey arrived, I still had one jar of the Wholesome left, which I put in the garbage - I didn't want anyone else thinking this is what honey should taste/smell like.

review/summary: Earth Friendly Yummy Raw Honey
review/text: I find this honey to have a mild but distinct flavor. The texture is divine, being thick and just a tiny bit sandy--if that makes sense. It dissolves slowly in your mouth and does not overwhelm beverages like tea. I also find it great for baking and raw food preparation. This would be an ideal honey to have on hand in the winter when cold season strikes. A little of this, some organic lemon and water will soothe a sore throat and cough, I think, better than any cough syrup.<br /><br />On the Wholesome Sweeteners website, they explain the ecologically and community-healthy way the honey is produced. None of their bees have been afflicted with CCD, incidentally, and the production of this honey provides stable income for Mayan communities that have been bee keeping for centuries. At the same time, this endeavor helps to protect the rain forest by providing consistent income for those resources.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Good Quality, I Use it for Healing
review/text: I had throat cancer and the radiologist recommended I take a spoon of high quality honey with hot water several times a day to help the healing in my mouth and throat.  They were burned pretty good from the radiation.  I started with store bought honey in tea but that honey burned my mouth if I took it plain--I take a spoonful and let it desolve in my mouth after having tea.  I went to Manaku honey because of the reported healing properties.  That worked great at helping my dry mouth and irratation. I took it for about two years.  Recently I decided to down grade, Manaku is fairly expensive.  I saw this raw honey and decided to give it a try.  I am not disappointed.  It is very good and feels almost as "healing" as the Manaku at a considerable cost savings.  If I forget to take my spoonful I can tell the difference, my mouth is much more dry and irritated.  I am very pleased with the quality of this honey.

review/summary: Strong odd taste & smell...
review/text: I did not care for this honey.  I found it overpowered my tea & just about anything else I had it with.  The smell & taste are weird.  Possibly from being packaged in plastic.  If they really wanted to do it right, they would use glass & only glass.  The taste isn't awful, but not great either.  I don't know how to describe it.  When I put it in my tea, the smell made me think of urine of all things!  In no way am I implying that I think there is pee in the honey - just that it smells a bit like urine to me.  It is an unpleasant off-putting smell.<br />Some reviewers were impressed with the thickness & cloudiness of the honey because it's raw.  Raw honey isn't always thick & cloudy.  It can be clear & runny.  A bee keeper explained to me that some honey's are intentionally treated to end up thick & cloudy.  Like a spread.  I forget what the process was.  I'm sure you can look it up.  I have seen many clear raw honey's.<br />If you don't want a strong honey flavor you shouldn't get this stuff.  The best honey is Hawaiian honey.  Localharvest.org has organic Hawaiian honey.  Try the Premium Silky Kiawe honey by Molokai Meli.  Since trying that honey, I have to agree that it is the best tasting honey in the world!  A cheaper raw creamy honey you might like is by Y.S organic bee farms.  Last I checked it is offered by Amazon.  Y.S Organic Raw honey - packaged in glass - is the next best thing to the Silky.  You try Y.S & you will probably never touch this honey again!

review/text: this is what we used to call honey cream. it tastes soooo processed to me and takes forever to dissolve in tea. Would be good with peanut butter I guess though the consistency is the same for both except pb is more spreadable. Maybe cooking. I thought I would try for the convenience of having it shipped but I'm back to my favorite bee guy and the organic farm - now thats GOOD raw honey

review/summary: Question and Review -- Health Benefits
review/text: This is not so much a review as it is a Question. However, I have ordered some and will review it once it arrives. Does this honey contain the health benefits that raw honey is known for? I've read that this honey is filtered a number of times [...]. WHFoods claims that "raw honey that has not been pasteurized, clarified, or filtered - provided it is of the highest organic quality - is your best choice" [...].<br /><br />Now that I've tried the honey, here's the actual review:<br />The honey is amazing--it tastes great. It is, however, crystallized, which I don't find to be a problem since I mix it in with my drinks. I imagine it would work fine as a spread as well.<br /><br />Cheers!

review/summary: Raw Honey? What the heck does that meam?
review/text: I have purchased this honey and what it really is honey that has been whipped so air is added and it becomes more of a spread then a liquid as it would be when taken from a hive.<br />Honey straight from the hive is like liquid gold and not this pasty  substance which is good for a sandwich spread but to say it is "raw honey" is a marketing term to confuse buyers.<br />To charge this amount of money for pound of honey is over the top. The best local honey sells less then $10.00 a pound.<br />Buy the honey from beekeepers in the area in which you live.<br />Not honey that is shipped around the world. You are just paying the cost of the energy to deliver.

review/summary: I love Silk Soy Milk, but not at $17.23/gallon
review/text: 18 cartons at 8.25 ounces per carton = 148.25 oz.<br />148.25 oz. = 1.16 gallons<br /><br />$20.00 / 1.16 gallons = $17.23 / gallon. For SOY MILK.<br /><br />If you really want your kids to drink soy milk, go to your local grocery store, get a half gallon of Silk for $3.00, then buy them a Thermos to fill up every day for their lunch.<br /><br />I love Vanilla Soy Milk, I really do. I'm willing to pay a small premium over regular milk for the lack of cholesterol, etc. without the nastiness that is skim milk. But the existence of this product for this price is almost an insult to our intelligence.<br /><br />Unless you're independently wealthy, that is. Then buy away.

review/summary: BE AWARE!!!!
review/text: Please be aware, that the people who originally owned SILK have sold the company to the $11 billion company Dean Foods.  They refused to participate in the recent Cornucopia study and refuse to divulge where they get their soybeans from (China).  Soybeans from China do not meet the stringent controls you need to determine if they are a) organic and b) not GMO (genetically modified).  The prices did not go down when the quality of their soybeans did, and they are secretive and defensive of their product.  Better to support American soy farms and products, for example Eden Foods.  I will never again drink/eat another Silk product. (I couldn't give zero stars, so i had to give one).

review/summary: Boycott Silk! Irresponsible and shady business practices!
review/text: I used to be a loyal Silk drinker back when it was actually organic and supported domestic farmers. Since then, the agribusiness giant Dean Foods (which owns over 50 milk labels in the country) bought Silk and began using conventional Chinese soybeans and quietly switching flavors of Silk from "organic" to "natural" without changing UPC codes or telling retailers, according to the Organic Consumers Association.<br /><br />The Silk portion of the Dean Foods website pays tremendous lip service to socially and environmentally responsible business practices--Dean Foods CLAIMS to use organic domestic soybeans, BUT REFUSES TO DISCLOSE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES OR TRANSPARENTLY PARTICIPATE IN SOYBEAN SOURCING STUDIES. It throws around the word "sustainable" without giving any proof or transparency to validate claims of sustainability.<br /><br />If you care in the slightest about supporting businesses that are honest, transparent, and environmentally responsible, DO NOT BUY SILK PRODUCTS.<br /><br />check out: [...]

review/text: I like Silk soymilk because it stays fresh in the fridge for quite some time, until it's opened.  I find it hard to use up an entire half gallon during the 7-10 use window, a problem which these little packages solve.  I don't feel obligated to use up the soymilk every day.  I can open one package, use half in my cereal, and then leave the rest in the fridge for a while.  And the Very Vanilla flavor is excellent in my tea.

review/text: I have wanted to post notices on the shelves of the grocery stores that stock Silk with their organic products.  Silk is no longer made with organic soybeans.  I think most people just grab it up without realizing that this product has changed.  And the price is high to begin with.  There are many other organic soymilks available that are cheaper and better quality than this rip off. I feel like they deliberately set out to deceive the consumer.

review/summary: I'd give it zero if I could!!!!!!
review/text: I usually go for Eden Soy or Trader Joe's as they are cheaper and usually taste as good or better, but I was in Walmart and said, "what the hell." Got a half gallon of Silk Vanilla soy milk and took it home immediately, storing it in a Trader Joe's insulated carry-all with some frozen goods on the way home.<br />Right off, it seemed thick, but I shrugged it off as I hadn't had Silk for a while, and I remembered that their stuff was usually thicker than others. Well before a week had elapsed the carton was bloated with gas. The milk got really thick like paste. Yum, a half gallon of mystery Soy-gurt.<br />I looked over the carton and found a "guarantee" of freshness and a web address. I used their web form and explained the defect in their product. Weeks later, they respond with the following response (basically tough poo, our "guarantee" isn't worth the cardboard it's written on):<br /><br />Thank you for your recent e-mail to Silk�. We appreciate your interest in our products.<br /><br />We guarantee the freshness and quality of our products if opened by the freshness date code and used within seven to ten days. However, our products are perishable food items and spoilage may occur if the products are stored in the refrigerator beyond the recommended number of days after the seal has been broken or if there was an interruption in maintaining the proper storage temperature. We apologize for the inconvenience, and hope you will continue to enjoy our products.<br /><br />For us, the good news is that you cared enough to let us know about it.<br /><br />Thanks again for contacting the Consumer Affairs Department.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Yvonne Ortega<br />Consumer Response Representative<br /><br />This is my response back:<br /><br />Yvonne:<br /><br />Thank you for your entirely cut-and-pasted, canned response. I appreciate that you didn't even bother to address me by name. Your lack of care and unfettered indifference overwhelms me.<br />You obviously don't "guarantee the freshness and quality" of your products. Otherwise, you would be offering a refund on my purchase, or some form of compensation for the stale milk you produced.<br />Your product's texture was a little off from day one and your product went completely bad on my family before "seven to ten days after the freshness date."<br />There was no "interruption in maintaining the proper storage temperature" during our trip to WalMart, as we use reusable insulated shopping bags for our refrigerated and frozen goods.<br />So, instead of trying to pass off the blame for your faulty product and shirking your promises, you should consider honoring your "guarantee."<br />I had almost forgotten about writing to you, but due to the nature of your response I have to let other consumers know just how worthless a "guarantee" from WhiteWave is.<br />I'm glad your title is "Consumer Response Representative" instead of Consumer Care Representative; at least WhiteWave is honest about that.<br /><br />Disgusted,<br /><br />So there you go, a premium priced product with below average taste and consistency, and worthless customer service!!!

This product tastes very good, perfect for someone who wants to try a healthy alternative to dairy.  I love being able to carry around the small cartons and not have to worry about keeping them cold.  I have used the Subscribe and Save feature for several months now and appreciate being able to arrive home and find the package at my door.  But...it is too expensive for me to justify any longer.  Especially since I am now seeing it in WalMart and Kroger.<br /><br />Taste is terrific!  It looks like milk.  It is just a little thicker than skim milk.  And the convenient packaging is great.  If it was cheaper, I would order it from Amazon forever!

review/text: We originally began purchasing Silk Very Vanilla Soy Milk because our son has a dairy allergy and couldn't drink cow milk. We tried all the Silk "flavors", but he only wanted the Very Vanilla. When we found these travel friendly 8.25oz. containers at a local BJ's Warehouse we were very happy.<br /><br />They make traveling with children easy because there's always silk available. You just can't leave it in a hot car. Last year our BJ's location closed and with no other available sources nearby, we started ordering from Amazon's subscription service.<br /><br />The first shipment arrived just 3 days after ordering and was packaged just fine.<br /><br />The producers of Silk (Great Wave) have also been fantastic. After purchasing one of these Silk 18 packs from BJ's and discovering over time that some had "curdled" I contacted them with a friendly e-mail making them aware of the issue. They, in turn, refunded our full purchase price.

review/text: That makes it great for the kids, less so for me.  They are quite handy and do a great job managing portion control for afternoon snacks.

review/text: Silk Soy has always been my favorite.  And vanilla is the best of the bunch, although I also dearly love the chocolate.  Some people claim to dislike the aftertaste, but I LOVE the aftertaste.  All of Silk Soy's flavored milks are far superior to flavored cow milk on the market (except for Horizon's UHT version), because flavored, grocery store milk is too thick for my taste.  Thick as in egg-nog thick.  Silk Soy pours like regular milk, not thick at all, and is delicious.

review/text: My 2 year old has dairy allergies, and these aseptic soymilk boxes make traveling to his grandparents' houses much easier.  They're also great to carry in the diaper bag so that you have "his milk" in a pinch.

review/summary: I like Silk soymilk!!
review/text: As I don't have my own car, I have to go to grocery stores nearby to buy soymilk. But after I found that this product is delivered with free-delivery option on Amazon, I usually order online to enjoy this product! This brand is, I would say, superb. Vanilla and "Very Vanilla" flavors both taste awesome!! I will definitely use Amazon to order it in the future as well!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I had some at a friend's house and I liked it. I had to take lactaid tablets because milk just doesn't sit right with me but I'm not totally lactose intolerant. Silk Soy milk in Very Vanilla is almost like a milkshake. It's so good! Definitely hooked on it and probably won't drink regular milk that much anymore now that I know about this stuff.

review/summary: I LOVE VERY VANILLA
review/text: I would never pay the price that is being asked here because I could buy the half gallon cartons for around $3.50 each.<br /><br />Problem is that I have moved from NY to central California and cannot find the VERY VANILLA in any of the supermarkets or variety stores even though they all carry the other flavors!!

review/summary: tastes good but....
review/text: the straws are two part so they don't seal and you suck air with product....also the packaging seems pretty wasteful and can be a challenge to pierce with the straw.  I bent a few..  I can see using this for special trips, but overall I would buy the product in the larger size as it's a tasty food.  This lost a star because of the straw and packaging and not because of the product itself.

review/summary: ricemilk revolt
review/text: after researching and finding out the dark side of soy, i switched over to rice dream rice milk (get original only, and dont get any milk substitute in these shelved containers- get em from the fridge section).  the rice milk far better.<br /><br />  rice dream  ---  vanilla silk<br /><br />taste:  5*  ---  4*<br />MSG:  no  ---  yes (carageenan- bad!!)<br />texture:  thinner  ---  thicker<br />color:  ultra white  ---  off- white<br /><br />  silk is great that its organic (one thing that rice dream doesnt have), but if you know your stuff, you know that up to 10% of the soy in organically labeled food can be genetically modified.<br /><br />  for the record, i drank silk for at least 3 years and loved it... until i researched the ingredients and made the switch.

review/summary: There are better products
review/text: This item is too sweat for soymilk. It also has a strong artificial flavor. It looks to me the person who made the product doesn't like soymilk at all, so he added a lot of other stuff to cover its original taste. Too much sugar makes the product unhealthy.

review/summary: good for baking and ice cream
review/text: I am only able to order this ingredient because of the discount that makes the price $15 per 18.<br /><br />I prefer the taste of plain soy milk but my efforts at making it myself resulted in a food reaction.  I make ice cream with milk for my family but sometimes I do not want the taste of dairy so I can use one carton of this soy milk in the second churn of the ice cream machine.<br /><br />I have been unable to discern the presence of expensive vanilla in my cooking efforts including ice cream so these box milk and soy milk products with vanilla are perfect for me.  I save on the expensive extracts and am spared the stress of not being satisfied that I am getting value for dollar.<br /><br />I am also using this ingredient because I recently purchased the Vegan cupcake book although I refuse to use margarine and shortening. It seems my tastes in snacks and sweets are leaning towards traditional Chinese recipes that use alternative flours and are hardly sweetened but I still want to explore the use of these ingredients in traditional baked desserts.<br /><br />dwt

review/summary: Decent training treat, as long as your dog isn't super picky!
review/text: Cloud Star's Tricky Trainers are bite-sized, palatable, chewable treats that are approximately 0.5 inches big. They come in three main flavors: cheddar, liver, and salmon. I sampled (well, JP, my dog, sampled) two flavors: cheddar and liver. These treats were perfect sized for putting into a Kong treat dispenser, and were generally palatable (JP finds them much more palatable then dry treats). I found the Tricky Trainers surprisingly more "dry" than most pocket-sized treats, however. In other words, they don't seem to be oily to touch, aren't excessively moist, and have a high anti-squish (i.e., firm) factor. This is beneficial if you're using them as true training treats to reward your dog (i.e., storing them in your pocket). Their con: I found the cheddar smell to be repulsive - it has a really strong smell, so if you're cheese shy, avoid. Cheddar is the 5th ingredient (remember, ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance (from most to least). For the other two flavors, chicken liver and salmon are listed first. The other con: the number of calories per treat isn't listed, so we don't know exactly how "low fat" or "low calorie" they truly are. The final con: if you have a super picky puppy that you are trying to train (and are using these as food motivation rewards), these may not work as well as small pieces of hot dog or pieces of freeze-dried liver treats. When it comes to puppy training, finding a treat that your dog can't resist is imperative to get them to train correctly!<br /><br />These products are listed as wheat and corn free, which is good if your dog has these specific food allergies. That said, if your dog doesn't have these specific allergies, not a big deal. The good news: all ingredients are natural, made in the USA, and the products contain no artificial favors or colors. Overall, a pretty good training treat!

review/summary: great flavor for  Country BBQ ribs
review/text: I tried the  Louisiana Spice Rub and Blend on country style ribs - I used it as a rub and  then also added it to my special barbecue mopping sauce.  The ribs  had a great depth of flavor and it added complexity to my BBQ sauce.  I have been making my special sauce for more than 20 years and this is the first time I changed the recipe -and will continue to add  Mrs Bryant's Louisiana Spice Blend to the sauce and  use it as the rub as it  really made the ribs into something extra special - and the sauce was scrumptious with the mashed potatoes and biscuits!
