review/text: I have been looking for this item since last winter. My store stopped carrying it (and I shop at four different grocery stores)I'm so glad I found it here. This is so very rich and smooth, I like the flavor but wish it came in a dark chocolate flavor. And I really agree about the coffee, it makes it so much better. Most cocoa mixes are like drinking colored water, this is so good and you don't need milk to get the thick and rich balance. LOOOOOVE IT !!!

review/text: I love this Nestle hot chocolate but have only been able to find it in the supermarkets for about $3.69 for eight servings.  When I came across these canisters at this great price, I immediately ordered it.<br /><br />It's a satisfying hot chocolate which has only 25 calories and comes out to just pennies a serving.

review/summary: My favorite flavor
review/text: These wonderful fruits are of a consistency somewhere between apple sauce and baby food. After trying all of the flavors, I especially enjoyed this somewhat tropical blend, with just the overtones of banana baby food I've missed since my daughter grew up. ;-)<br /><br />While these are more expensive (even in the store) than the little fruit cups, they have a perfect use ... Traveling!  As any parent with a child knows, kids, spoons, and  liquids are not a good mix. Spills happen!  Since these include only fruit, juice, and natural flavorings, they make a nice snack without added sugar.<br /><br />However, having recently made an extended trip by myself, I discovered they are wonderful in a different way. They make a great boost for the driver as well. And they aren't half bad, even when warm! I am a diabetic, so the 15 grams of carb are a perfect complement to my needs for a snack. I kept a couple next to me, and they were perfect when my blood sugar was dropping and the next rest stop was far away. My only problem using them this way involved getting the lids off!

I Throw them into the fridge to keep them cold and take them with me where ever I go.  Also, there's NO mess!  I'm really happy with being able to eat "real" fruit without worrying about when they'll go bad.  These taste great too!  Also, I use the Subscribe and Save and I get these awesome pouches of yumminess for less than a dollar a pouch.  Well worth the price knowing that they'll keep a heck of a lot longer than fresh fruit.

review/summary: Worked Well, For A While.
review/text: We have trouble getting  enough fruits and veggies into our young boy (3.5 years old). It's an ongoing problem. Sometimes he'll eat all we serve and sometimes not. Sometimes he'll eat apples or grapes and sometimes he won't touch them. It's unpredictable. As such, we've tried a numbet of "tricks" to get him to eat more of the things we'd like in his diet. My wife brought home some Buddy Fruits blended puree in a squeezable bag. Down it went. It was the mango, passion fruit and banana blend. We were pleased with our discovery. That was a few weeks ago. Now he won't eat them in any flavor. Go figure. In any case, this product worked well while it worked and it may work again in the future. We'll keep trying. Who knows? Bananas were the same way.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: must have for a kid that likes to feed themselves
review/text: My baby started to become a picky eater around 12 months.  By 14-16 months she refused all baby food and absolutely refused to eat any food from a spoon.  This product is great because she actually gets healthy food that she can feed herself.  This is slightly cheaper than what I can buy in the store and the flavor I could only find on the internet.  It's great that it just shows up at your door in bulk instead of having to drag your kid to the store.  Also, this product is great on the go, and keeps longer than fresh fruit in your fridge.  Perfect for a picky eater who you're trying to get in their five-a-day!

review/summary: quick, convenient and tasty
review/text: These sticky rice bowls are real winners. They take two minutes to prepare in the microwave and they give you a nice  serving (or two)of very good sticky rice. You can add vinegar to make seasoned sushi rice for your own sushi, make rice balls, serve with vegetables or  protein or just eat as is. Reasonably priced given the convenience. These are becoming a staple around our house. They can be  the basis for a quick lunch,a nice side dish or a foundation/element of much more elaborate preparations. We put this in lettuce wraps with some leftover duck and a few seasonings and had a very elegant and successful snack for unexpected visitors.  One bowl usually serves two normal appetites or one very large, very Hungry, man quite nicely,  I've added this to  soups and stir fries etc. and one bowl was actually enough to serve three or four people when used that way.

review/summary: fast and tasty!
review/text: I ordered this after reading the reviews here. I had mixed feelings about ordering it, since some people complained about the smell. Decided to go ahead since I thought the other Annie Chun's products turned out pretty good. This one turned out pretty good too. It is quick, just pop it into the microwave and put it on high for 90 seconds and you are done. It is pretty tasty too, perfect consistency. I did notice the smell that others have mentioned, like heated plastic, probably from the plastic bowl it gets microwaved in. That's why this gets 4 stars instead of 5. A friend told me to remove the rice into a ceramic bowl and then microwave it. If it makes a difference, I will come back and update this. In the meantime, this is a great time saver for those quick meals and much, much better than fast food.<br /><br />Update: It does make a difference if I microwave it in a ceramic bowl, and tastes great! However, the 4 stars stands 'cos I have to take it out of it's plastic container and put it in a different bowl. You would think Annie Chun's would do something about this especially since their soup bowls are made of enviornmenatlly friendly and biodegradable materials.

review/summary: Easiest Sushi ever!!
review/text: I have used this sticky rice for months now to make sushi when I do not want to cook the rice myself.All I do is microwave the rice for 30 seconds,remove from the plastic bowl to a glass one, add a few drops of rice vinegar,stir and it is ready to roll.One container makes two rolls of sushi for me because I make smaller bites. I was so glad to find it here on Amazon because it is about $1.50 LESS per bowl than buying it in my local supermarket, when I can find it.I have a nose like a hawk and have never detected a strange smell.The rice is extremely mild and sweet.

review/summary: It couldn't be any more simple or any more delicious.
review/text: This rice has that sticky rice texture and taste down pat! If I get hungry after dinner, but before bedtime, I just heat one of the containers and pour a little of my favorite teriyaki sauce on top. Delicious...with no cleaning up!<br /><br />I found out that I was paying $1.98 at Walmart for each bowl, so the amazon.com price (with discounts) wasn't really a bargain, but if you shop at regular grocery stores like Safeway or Albertsons, I'm sure you'd easily save money with this deal.<br /><br />P.S. - No weird smell to me.

review/text: I recently purchased this item for my nephew who in serving in Afganistan at the present. He was thrilled to receive this item. He liked it so much, I have ordered another shipment for him. I also ordered 2 more shipments. The sticky rice is fantastic. Great for quick snacks, lunches and easy enough to heat. Open lid and microwave for 1 minutes. The bowl also doen't get so hot that you don't burn your hands touching it out of the microwave. Would recommend this product and give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Homemade Sushi Made Easy
review/text: This is the same rice that used to come in that silly excuse for a sushi kit.  However, I can't say anything too bad about that old kit they don't seem to sell anymore, since it put me on the road to making sushi at home SUPER easy.  Basically, microwave this rice for 1 minute and it is perfectly done sticky rice.  Smooth it onto some seaweed, add your favorite sushi ingredients, and roll it.  This is perfect because my wife is pregnant and she can eat sushi as long as the ingredients are cooked...if you eat out you take a risk of it being cross contaminated, etc.  The 6 pack is a decent deal and you don't have to go to Wallyworld to pick it up (if it is even in stock.)

review/text: These bowls are a very nice option for a small lunch or large snack - they're quick and have a nice flavor, even on their own. They're also great for practicing one's dexterity with chopsticks (part of the reason I bought them).<br /><br />The other reason I bought these bowls was to try furikake (Japanese rice seasoning). The rice maybe has a bit too much of its own flavor; the addition of the furikake made it too sweet. I even made sure I added the correct amount of seasoning.<br /><br />For most people, these bowls will prove quite nice and convenient. But if you want to try furikake with them, don't - just order some takeout instead.

review/summary: THE BEST RICE!
review/text: We have a favorite sushi restaurant where they serve sticky white rice, and we love it.  I used to be able to buy Sticky White Rice, uncooked,  at Trader Joe's, but for some reason they no longer carry it.  Then I found this brand, Annie Chun's, at my local Ralph's market, and tried it, and it is every bit as good as the rice from the restaurant.  It is pre-cooked and ready from the microwave in 2 minutes.  But now, for some other unknown reason Ralph's no longer carries it, so I went to Amazon, and of course they have everything, and here it is, at a lower price than at the market!  Thank goodness for Amazon for many different reasons..... And yes, sticky white rice has a flavor all it's own; we like to sprinkle black sesame seeds on top of it when we serve it.  Try this.  You'll love the ease in preparation, and the flavor is wonderful!

These two snacks had none of the stale and rancid flavor of Sahale's "Dauphine" (walnut) and "Soccorro" (Macadamia/hazelnut) snacks that came in the same shipment.  "Dauphine"  and "Soccorro" tasted much fresher when bought in a local store.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I really like several of the Sahale products, my favorite being the Valdosta blend (almond/cranberries). This one, however, is not going to be one I'll buy again.  Given all the five-star reviews, I was expecting these to taste MUCH better than they do.  While not too sweet, the strong vanilla flavor overwhelms the flavor of the cashews, pomegranate, and apple.  I love vanilla, but there's just too much in the blend for me.  I bought the pack of six and wish I had bought one pack to try, instead.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: I bought 3 different flavors as I'm gluten free and they seemed safe. The PB & J was the best although it's kind of expensive when you are getting mostly peanuts but tasted pretty darned good. The Almons w/Cranberries is pretty good too! The Barbecue I didn't like AT ALL, they taste strictly like Chipotle, you cannot taste any Ranch, or Barbecue taste.

review/summary: Overloaded with sesame seeds and too chewy!
review/text: The overload of sesame seeds ruined the taste for me.  The nuts were chewy instead of crispy and it was mostly nuts, not many cranberries.  Thankfully it wasn't too sweet but the texture with the sesame seeds and "chewy" nuts ruined it for me.  They may have been stale but the lack of a expiration date made that unclear so I trust Amazon wouldn't send me expired goods although they have before.

It wasn't the spice & sweet mixture that we didn't like - it just didn't taste good at all.  One bag we got was very stale but the others seemed fine.  I ended up selling them on ebay!

review/text: I got this product as part of a six-flavor package.  It turned out to be the only Sahale product that I have tried that is bad.  Worse than bad.  Terrible.  Disgusting.  How did this stuff get past the corpoate taste tests?  It is even worse than Emerald brand dry roasted almonds, which are awful because of the garlic and onion added.  I love plain salted roasted almonds, and thought Sahale could find a way to make them even better tasting.  Not this time.

review/text: I tried these after enjoying the Valdosta and Ksar blends (which, I realize, are not glazed) - but to me, the combination of vanilla and cashews renders them both bland. Also, the pomegranate is a little thin on the ground.

review/summary: Strange texture and taste
review/text: I bought these several days ago from our local supermarket and was very disappointed.  The nuts were chewy and slightly soft..is this normal and yes they were months from expiration.  Yuck at the softness, however.  Then there was a strange texture of hard, little bumps on this softened nut..another yuck.  The taste of the flavors blended wasn't my thing either..all wrong in my opinion.  I gave it a two because it was edible but will never repurchase.

review/summary: Indulge Your Tastebuds
review/text: About a month ago, I noticed a new product at my local QFC. It was on sale and I actually did a double take and returned to check out the display. It was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by Sahale Snacks.  I had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever I got the munchies.  Sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy, upscale "town mouse" to my regular, boring "country mouse" trail mixes.<br /><br />The one that caught my eye was Sing Buri with cashew, pineapple, peanut, lemongrass and Chinese chili. The ingredients definitely made my mouth water, but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. The bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces, but I was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. I didn't even wait to get home, but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. It was amazing!<br /><br />The more I looked into Sahale Snacks, the more I liked. On the website, the story is told of the two founders hiking up Mt. Rainier in Washington State, dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m&m combo that was their trail mix. What resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy.<br /><br />These snack blends are a little pricy, but in my opinion, totally worth it. This would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. This is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love.

review/text: I first tried this nut and spice delight at Costco........I had some of the samples that were offered that day and I choose to purchase the Sing Buri. My goodness this is good!! The flavors are just right. You know how a really good (Asian or French) sauce holds together and has a progression of flavors? I found that this happens with the nuts and chili and lemongrass.<br /><br />Really, this is a gorgeous snack and healthy too!<br /><br />Now that Amazon is offering this company's products, I ordered 2. And with the nice 10 bucks off, this is a very nice bargain!<br /><br />Depending on your palate (some folks are happy with Planters nuts you know), I think you will be delighted with this choice!<br /><br />Scrumptious!

review/summary: Love this flavor!
review/text: I bought the variety pack and tried this flavor third (see my reviews for Socorro and Soledad). I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love this flavor. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. They use black pepper which is flavorful, but I wouldn't call it spicy.  The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. There is about equal of both nuts and fruit.  Valdosta has 7 grams of sugar in a 1/4 cup serving.

review/text: Ever since I have tried this productI eat some everyday!! It is the perfect blend of savory, tangy, sweet, and a touch spicy.  I know that sounds like a weird combo, but its sooo good, addicting even. I initially  bought this prouct at a local natural and whole foods store, but amazon .com has the lowest price I've seen anywhere and u cant beat free shipping!! It's so conveniant. I have ordered this product from amazon several times and I must mention one order contained multiple expired items that were definitely stale tasting, so I let customer service know and they immediately responded and very pleasantly resolved the matter to my satisfaction. I do suggest the multiple 12  2 oz multiple pack only because this blend is so yummy portion control is helpful!!!

review/text: Be warned - if you like these, then you are setting yourself up for many re-orders! I personally love the marriage of vanilla and cashews, and while I wasn't sure about the pomegranate - it helps to create a unique blend of flavors. They have become my go-to munchie and the only complaint I have is the relatively high cost. Most stores have them for around $5/bag, but ordering this package saves you $1 per bag overall. Go ahead and treat yourself - they are a great alternative to the usual cookie, cake, etc. type of snacks.

While I haven't tried the other flavors yet I'm sure they are just as tasty!  You won't be let down with this wonderful snack.  Enjoy!

review/text: I got a variety pack of Sahale mixes, and this was the only one i liked. The others just didn't work for me, though i only actively disliked one (sing buri, my coworkers all hated it too, though they gladly ate the other flavors i dismissed).<br /><br />For the reviewer who said it was too peppery, either they're extremely sensitive to black pepper, they got a badly mixed bag, or by chance grabbed a bit that was more peppery than the rest and didn't explore further. I think the pepper is perfect, strong enough to give it a little kick and sting, but light enough that it's not the primary (or even secondary) flavor. There is some variability, though, and once in a while you'll get a mouth full of pepper.<br /><br />While i gladly eat these for a snack at my desk at work, they are a must-have for long plane trips. The nuts make it filling, and the cranberries and glaze give it a nice sweet touch without being so sugary that i get the jitters trapped in a middle seat on hour 2 of a cross-country flight.

review/summary: Great snacks
review/text: I picked up a bag of these on a whim the other day and I was instantly hooked.  I like almonds, but plain almonds do get boring, salted almonds are usually too salty, and honey covered almonds are usually too sweet and too salty.  And it's hard to find almonds that aren't roasted in some kind of cheap oil.<br /><br />Enter these Sahale snacks. A little salt, a little honey, and dry roasted almonds.  Oh and cranberries.  In my bag I didn't get many cranberries, I don't know if that was a fluke but I didn't care because I was mostly after the almonds.  If you are looking for a  big handful of almonds and cranberries this might disappoint.  For me it's been a great snack to keep around the office (it helps me avoid the 3PM coke-and-potato chip craving).<br /><br />The price seems a little high at first, but a single bag last several days, which put's in line with the cost of bag of chips.  Overall a great snack that's actually pretty good for you.

review/summary: Larger sized bags of the Valdosta Blend are available at Costco seasonally
review/text: The ingredient list made for interresting reading. So much so that I almost left my first bag of these treats on the shelf. The kicker for me was that they did not contain any ingredients I am allergic to, so into my basket they went.<br /><br />Once I tried them I became addicted.  These are great right out of the bag.  I also love them in a tossed green salad with crumbled bleu cheese and thinly sliced fresh pears.<br /><br />I checked Costco yesterday for the Valdosta Blend, but they were out.  They are currently offering another Sahale blend with almonds.  I didn't buy it--I'll wait for the Valdosta to come in.  I am not sure if Costco changes the Sahale snack selection seasonally or if they were just out-of-stock.<br /><br />When we were vacationing in Texas, I bought another Sahale blend to sample.  I wish I could remember the name of it. It wasn't as good and I would not go out of my way to buy it again. I will continue to buy the Valdosta Blend regularly though.

review/text: I have been buying these from Costco for years, but was told a few weeks ago that they were gone and not coming back in the foreseeable future.  I hate it when Costco does that!  Thank goodness for Amazon -- at least I can order from them!  I don't think the ones I received are as fresh as the ones I used to get from Costco.  The cranberries are pretty tough to chew.  But they're still a tasty snack and indispensable on a salad of spring greens, blue cheese, apples or grapes, and drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.
