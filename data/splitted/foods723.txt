review/summary: Worth the extra cost
review/text: This is very similar to Hamburger Helper, and looking at the box I was sure that it would be about as good.  Easy to make, one pan meal.  I have to say however that I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was!  Usually I doctor up boxed meals with various seasonings, but really this didn't even need it.  I have bought some of the other flavors, and been just as impressed.  Great product!

review/summary: Tastes good but similar to Hamburger Helper
review/text: This product is very similar to the Hamburger Helper version.  It comes with noodles, a spice packet and the Velveeta cheese.  You brown the meat, add water, spices and noodles and simmer then add the Velveeta cheese sauce.  It's a very quick meal (~20 minutes, give or take) and tastes pretty good.  One thing I will say is that I'd recommend adding your own spices to the meat while browning it.  The included spice packet adds flavor to the noodles, but it didn't seem to stick with the hamburger.  So the hamburger can taste pretty flavorless once finished.<br /><br />Overall, it tastes good and is quick.  While it reminds me of Hamburger Helper, the Velveeta Cheese does add something.

review/summary: Is what it seems like it
review/text: If you like velveta or mac n cheese you'll love this product, I think. It comes with the seasoning, noodles, and cheese--you provide the meat. I cooked the ground beef with onions. Probably all told, it took 15 minutes. It was fast and for a family who has kids who want there mac and cheese I suspect perfect. I have in the past added carrots and peas or blended caulieflower and broccoli to these products to make em a full meal. I personally think there is plenty of cheese sauce to go around. And I always add a little fresh ground pepper to balance out the salt.<br /><br />All that being said if you dont like cheese sauce or velveeta this wont change your opinion. Also I didnt think the seasoning added too much flavor wise, seemed mostly salt with maybe some onion or garlic powder. Also it doesnt really save time over anything else that requires ground beef, ie hamburgers or tacos, except on the prep side.<br /><br />If you or more likely your kids enjoy mac n' cheese though, give this a shot, its a nice change up and adds some protein to the normal mac dish.

review/summary: Just okay to me
review/text: Undoubtedly this will be compared to Hamburger Helper right off the bat and I suppose it's fair because they both try to do the same thing. Create an easy to prepare meal with nothing but ingredients in the box and some hamburger.<br /><br />Does this taste like a Cheeseburger? Not to me. The cheese is almost overpowering and once you get paste the cheese there isn't to much flavor there.<br /><br />It's easy to prepare and it's quick. But if you are looking for a culinary experience that will rock your taste buds... well this isn't the way to go.<br /><br />On a side note - if you or anyone you know is on a low sodium diet, or are keeping track of your sodium intake read this label. The sodium content for one serving is off the charts. I was legitimately shocked at how high it was.<br /><br />While I may eat it again down the line it's not something I am going to run to the store to specifically get and bring back to share.

review/summary: Tastes Like a Cheeseburger!
review/text: I had the ultimate "Taste-testers" test this product......my grandkids.  They gave it a thumbs-up all the way.  It is super creamy & taste like a cheeseburger.  The 4 stars came from me......it gets a 5 star for taste.  I felt that it could have used more macaroni.  I almost cooked some more to add to it.  But, I guess less macaroni maybe helped to make it creamier.  We will definitely buy this again...it could be a meal all by itself.

review/summary: Quick Backup Family Meal
review/text: I can't say this is my favorite food in the world - but it is excellent as an emergency back up meal for a busy family.  You quickly brown and drain the ground meat, adding a seasoning packet - then add water, the noodles, and cheese into the pot.  20 minutes from start to finish - more or less.  Velveeta is a guilty pleasure of mine...so this was an easy sell to me.  I must admit that the flavor seemed to me to be more like a sour cream - than what I would normally expect from Velveeta - but I still enjoyed the meal.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: You know, for a convenience meal, this is quite tasty.  I was quite pleased with the flavor and ease of preparation.<br /><br />For the record, the box contains a packet of seasonings, elbow macaroni, and a package of cheese sauce.  You add one pound of ground beef, although I believe you can cut down on that a bit if you want.  I found the seasonings well balanced, enough for adults but not too much for kids, so something the whole family could eat and enjoy.  I did not detect any strange chemical undertones as are sometimes found in packaged meals.<br /><br />It was very simple to make.  When I come across a meat sale, I divvy it up so I always have some one-pound portions of beef in the freezer.  So I took one out, defrosted it a bit in the microwave, and browned it in a skillet while I was doing other things.  Then add two cups of water and the package of spices, let it boil up, then cover and simmer 11 to 13 minutes.  I timed mine at 12 minutes and that was a bit too long for the noodles.  I would recommend sampling the noodles at 10 minutes and judge from there.  Then turn off the heat and add the cheese sauce -- yes, thankfully, it's a sauce, not dried powder.<br /><br />The box says it makes five one-cup servings.  That makes at least four adult-sized servings, maybe five depending on side dishes.  The leftovers went to the office for lunch and were good microwaved, although I first added a few drops of water to keep it from getting too dry.<br /><br />Would I pick up another box to have on the shelf for one of those nights when I need a quick meal?  Absolutely!

review/summary: Works Great with Ground Turkey!
review/text: I tried both the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YV80OE">Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit, 14.64-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>and this one, and I have to say this one is a winner.<br /><br />The instructions were easy enough to follow and you just simply need to add your own meat. I used ground turkey instead of red meat. The seasoning was good, and didn't taste too salty. It helped balance out the taste of Velveeta, which I always find a bit too sweet.<br /><br />I'd buy these for a quick and easy meal on days I'm tired from a full day of work.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: It's like Hamburger Helper, easy to prepare, fast, heck a child could make it.  And honestly, as far as taste goes...I'm sure children will like it. It really tastes like a cheeseburger.  In a bowl.  With pasta.  Maybe I'm just not used to it but, as a cheese lover I thought I'd love it.  It's only okay.  You get the feeling it tastes like a cheeseburger but, somehow that doesn't translate as well when it's in a skillet scooped into a bowl.  It's a worthy alternative to the instant meals since the Velveeta cheese is indeed...cheesy.  Somehow I just couldn't get into it.

review/summary: Easy to make, great flavor and you only add ground beef and water
review/text: I'll admit it - Hamburger Helper is a guilty pleasure of mine. I don't have it every week or even every month, but sometimes I just crave it. It is tasty, but I think it is also a comfort food that reminds me of my childhood and simpler times. Since I was a kid, my favorite flavors have been Beefy Pasta and Cheeseburger Macaroni. When we visited my Dad and money was tight, he would just make a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and throw a little browned hamburger meat in it as a cheaper version of Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />I was intrigued to see that Kraft came out with their own version of the trusty old Hamburger Helper meals. As far as I can remember, I don't recall any competition for them in the past.<br /><br />So I ordered a box of the Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillets Dinner Kit. The first difference I noticed right off the bat is that unlike the Hamburger Helper, you don't need to add milk. In fact, the only things you need to add are water and ground beef.<br /><br />Included in the box are the macaroni noodles, a seasoning mix in powder form, and a packet of Velveeta cheese sauce. I call it cheese sauce for lack of a better word, but it is more like a really soft Velveeta than a sauce as it isn't runny.<br /><br />The Kraft Skillets Dinner is a one-pot meal, as with the Hamburger Helper, making cleanup easy. You will need a measuring cup for the water, but using it only for water merely requires drying for the measuring cup, not washing.<br /><br />You begin by browning the ground beef, then you add the water, seasoning mix and macaroni, which is then cooked on a low heat for about 11-13 minutes. Once that stage has completed, you simply squeeze the cheese packet into the pot and stire it until it has melted and mixed into the seasoned sauce. Voila!<br /><br />As for the flavor, it is just as good as the Hamburger Helper. I think I would honestly find it hard to choose between the two products based on flavor. The one deciding factor for me is probably that you don't need to add milk. I don't drink milk, so I don't usually buy it unless I need it for a recipe and most of the carton usually goes bad before I've used it all.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying more of this to keep a box on hand in the pantry.

review/summary: Not for Macaroni and Cheese Purists
review/text: We are pretty big macaroni & cheese lovers in my house, and we enjoy frying up some hamburger to throw in from time to time, so I jumped on the chance to review this product.<br /><br />It's quick and easy, fry up the burger, throw in the water, seasoning mix and macaroni. When the water is absorbed, mix in the accompanying Velveeta cheese sauce, and serve.<br /><br />I found that it was a little on the watery side for me, I like my mac n cheese kind of dry, but it wasn't over the top. The taste is mac n cheese mixed with stroganoff flavor. Not bad, but not wonderful either. It's almost like they're trying to appeal both the mac n cheese lovers AND the hamburger helper crowd.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Sure, if it's on sale, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.

review/summary: Cheeseburger in a bowl
review/text: This is your typical "add hamburger," pasta & seasoning boxed meal.  The difference it that it comes with a packet of creamy Velveeta cheese.  If you are a fan of Velveeta, then you will like this!<br /><br />The cheeseburger flavor is excellent.  In addition to the ground hamburger, I added a can of diced tomatoes, a chopped onion, and some sliced mushrooms to mine for a more 'complete' burger taste.  It also suggest on the back of the box that you can sprinkle some shredded lettuce on top just before serving, and I imagine, if you wanted, you could add some sliced pickle too!<br /><br />The box weighs 12.8oz (364g), making "about 5 1-cup servings."  Inside you will find three packets: powdered cheeseburger flavor packet, foil packet of real Velveeta cheese, and a bag of dry macaroni.  Unfortunately, despite the large size of the box, there is only 12oz of macaroni (1.5 cups dry), which is about enough to feed two adults when made.  Of course, you can add more macaroni of your own to stretch it a bit further, but doing this cuts down a little on the cheeseburger flavor.  If you have your meat already browned, it takes less than 15 mins to prepare (extra if you need to brown your meat).<br /><br />Overall, we liked the flavor, and with the additions I mentioned above, it was like eating a cheeseburger in a bowl!  Recommend for two people, for a quick but filling meal.

review/summary: Meh...you'd do better making your own
review/text: I don't regularly eat Hamburger Helper but I did eat quite a bit in college.  When I saw this new offering from Velveeta I thought "oh cool, I should try that."  Instead of a creamy Velveeta-ey version of classic HH it was gritty, dull flavored, and all around pretty week.  I would recommend avoiding this product.  If you're inclined toward trying it I would say go with Hamburger Helper, or better yet make it homemade.  Ground beef, Velveeta, pasta, and milk will do you much better.

review/summary: A house divided.
review/text: I loved this stuff, but others in my house didn't care for it as much as me.  They didn't think it was bad, just not spectacular.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, no matter what, anything that requires you add hamburger is going to vary in quality based on the quality of hamburger you put in it.<br />This one ends up being somewhere around 50/50 in amounts of burger and noodles.<br />Inside you get a bag of noodles, a packet of the creamy velveeta cheese and a packet of seasoning.<br /><br />The seasoning is what others in the house were not so sure on.  This seasoning doesn't blend with the cheese or anything like that, its made to season the hamburger.  When the meal is done cooking you will add the cheese.<br /><br />One thing I can say is that I feel like it could have used more cheese but I am like that with everything.  Extra cheese, extra sauce and all that.<br /><br />In the end, I would probably buy this again as I prefer the melty cheese over powder and I think it tasted great, but I will likely not get to eat it that often as others in our house would rather have something else.

review/summary: Looks thick and cheesy on box
review/text: You know when you see Velveeta that your getting a thick and cheesy flavor.  Velveeta appears to be branching out from the mac & cheese business for a stab at, well, Hamburger Helper.  The price point is great.  The preparation is easy and quick, but the final product falls short of expectations.  The hamburger flavoring dominated the meal.  The thick gooey Velveeta cheese gets quickly eaten up by any excess water in the pan making it thin and runny.  The taste was good, but not the thick, cheesy goodness that I expected.

review/text: On the positive side, this Velveeta Cheesy Skillets - Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac is easy to make - the directions were clear and easy to understand and yes, it does only take 20 minutes. You can prepare everything in one pan which makes clean up a breeze. However, I wouldn't make this dish again - while I love cheesy food (the more cheese the better) I found this dish tasted very salty (and I don't mind salt - love it on my chips and fries). The salt/seasonings seemed to overwhelm this dish.<br /><br />The serving size is 2.5 ounces (approximately 1 cup) and there are approximately 5 servings in a box.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional Information - as prepared (percentages based on a 2000 calorie diet):<br /><br />Calories: 350<br />Calories from Fat: 140<br />Total Fat: 9g 25% (Saturated Fat: 3g 25%; Trans Fat: 0.5)<br />Cholesterol: 15mg 22%<br />Sodium 850mg 38%<br />Total Carbohydrates 27g 9% (Dietary Fiber 1g 4%; Sugars 6g)<br />Protein 8g<br /><br />Vitamin A: 2%<br />Vitamin C: 20%<br />Calcium: 15%<br />Iron: 15%<br /><br />There is a note which says that 1 cup prepared as directed with 90% lean ground beef contains 16g total fat (5g saturated fat, 1g trans fat), 65g cholesterol, 900 mg sodium, 27g total carbohydrate (1g fiber, 6g sugars), 24g protein.

review/summary: It's better than average for a Velveeta/HH type meal, though it seems pricey
review/text: I used to have Hamburger Helper (HH) as a kid.  But when I became an adult, I bypassed the HH for something cheaper, making cheese sauce myself.  So I usually make a roux and then add pasta to it.  This meal is better tasting then I thought it would be.  It comes with a spice pack, cheese sauce pack and pasta.  You supply the meat.  I personally wouldn't buy the product for $2.50 a box when I can buy a bag of pasta on sale at my local supermarket for $1, then add spices already in my cupboard and then make a roux, which yes, takes 30-40 minutes instead of the 20 here.  I have no kids and my boyfriend and I have time to cook, so time isn't too tight for us.  Even with a a dollar or two of real cheese added to my recipe, I'd rather know what I am eating for $3 (which really would make twice as much pasta as the pasta that came in the box) then eat something loaded with odd ingredients I don't know.<br /><br />Despite this, the skillet meal is easy to prepare, even an older kid could probably do this and it would save time for busy adults.  It tastes ok. The spice gives it a Mexican sort of appeal and I ate it as shown on the back of the box, with shredded lettuce and onion.  I do think that most of the money you pay for this item goes into packaging and the design of the box.  Since I am not eating the box, I'll stick to my own cheese sauces, thanks!<br /><br />Note:  I did use very lean beef for this meal and it came out rather cheesy, which was a good thing.

review/summary: Strange After Taste
review/text: This was certainly a simple meal to prepare, but keep in mind that it makes five servings that are 350 calories each.  It seems like it only makes about three servings, so I was surprised at how small the servings actually were.  The noodles were kind of big and cooked up a little mushy for me, but I didn't quite follow the directions to the letter because I misread them--but it still worked.  The cheese sauce had a strange artificial aftertaste to it, which I didn't like.  For that reason alone, I'd stick to Hamburger Helper if I were to buy this sort of thing for a quick meal.  I'm also a vegetarian, so I'll mention that this doesn't contain chicken fat or beef stock or anything that would be non-vegetarian.  I used some Boca crumbles to make this into a meal, and I'll say it wasn't bad--but that aftertaste hung around with every bite.

review/text: We found this product to be suitable for someone in a hurry with not much time to cook, but still wanting a nutritious meal. After cooking it was not watery and had a very good consistency. In addition, it had an excellent aroma with an excellent cheese taste. This is not your mother's hamburger helper but seems to be a step above that. Just add some good quality low fat hamburger to it and follow the easy instructions and you will produce a fairly well balanced meal, just add some orange juice and/or vegetable or fruit, and bread, on the side, to more completely balance it, and enjoy. Best when freshly made, the left-overs were just okay after microwaving.

review/summary: How'd they get the cheeseburger taste in there?
review/text: Our family doesn't eat "skillet dinner mixes" very often, but they sure are handy to have around for busy school nights when there's little time between homework and sports practice. Plus, now that my son is getting old enough to start taking on some meal-preparation responsibilities, I've been keeping an eye out for meals he can make on his own. This one is certainly in his skill level!<br /><br />The instructions are easy enough to follow: brown some ground beef (not mentioned on the package: rinse it in a colander under hot water to reduce your meal's fat content then return to the pan); add 2 cups of water and the noodles from the box; bring to boil then cover and simmer until most of the liquid is gone; finally, stir in the cheese goop... er, sauce... and serve. Definitely something a pre-teen can handle!<br /><br />Our first impression: we were all surprised how Kraft managed to get the cheeseburger taste in there... straight down to the pickle flavor. Seriously, where did that pickle flavor come from? The box mentions 'natural spices' but nothing about dehydrated pickle or pickle juice, but WOW it certainly had that taste! Second impression: we couldn't decide if that was a good thing, or a bad one.<br /><br />Nutritionally, there's not a lot to feel good about with this meal. It's high in fat, low in fiber, heavy on the salt and chock full of additives. But, sometimes when you're trying to feed a hungry family in a hurry those things don't matter as much as getting their bellies full. For our family, we've decided that if we have this in the future we'll be sure to pair it with generous servings of fresh veggies and fruit.<br /><br />To sum:<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Easy enough for a tweenager to make.<br />2. One-skillet main dish.<br />3. Calories can be slightly reduced by using very lean ground beef or even ground turkey, and rinsing the meat after it's browned.<br />4. Very, very filling.<br />5. Definite 'cheesburger-y' flavor.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Low fiber.<br />2. High sodium.<br />3. High fat.<br />4. Where DOES that pickle flavor come from???

review/summary: Easy to Prep One Pan Meal
review/text: This product is a bit of a change for me. I live in a home with, other than me who'll eat anything, an organic vegan wife and an organic vegetarian daughter. So let's say I got a bit of razz when I started to prepare this product for me and me alone to eat. I figured it'd make a great sort of food to make a work lunch since we have a microwave there to re-heat casseroles.<br /><br />There are four simple steps to prepare this meal if you call 'cover the pot' a step. The instructions say to use one skillet for the entire preparation but I transferred the browned meat (first step) into a saucepan for the remaining time. It made no difference, I"m sure. Total preparation time is about a half hour, but it's not an unattended half hour. Step one is to brown the ground beef which, of course, requires monitoring and turning. Step three which starts cover the pot says one needs to monitor and stir the pot regularly for the roughly quarter of an hour this step requires. While hardly onerous or demanding, this isn't something you can just throw together in a pot, turn up the heat and come back to a finished product in a few minutes.<br /><br />The result is some rather loose cheese sauce which coats soft elbow macaroni and the browned crumbled ground beef (or other meat, I suppose). As with most casseroles, this tasted substantially better after having stood for an hour and much better after 24 hour refrigeration and a reheat. Overall I found this to be generally good tasting and perfect for my intention of taking some to work for reheating in the microwave. It'd also make a quick family dinner especially if you have the time to prep it an hour ahead of dinner time to allow it to stand for a bit.<br /><br />There are two downsides which, to me, detract from the enjoyment in this dish. The first is probably exclusive to me. I find this food to be rather salty. Then again, I never salt my food and often find restaurant food to be too salty as prepared so I would anticipate that this would not be an issue for most folks trying this product. For example, I work with one woman who heavily salts her pizza. I'm sure she'd complain this product needs salt.<br /><br />The second issue I have is presentation. This dish looks terrible. There is no suitable description, metaphor or simile I can use to describe how this looks on a plate which would be suitable for a food product. If presentation is important to you, then proceed with caution. I don't doubt that the experts at Kraft can prep this dish to look like the box picture but my try fell woefully short. Then again, if this one is for children, that's not an issue, I'd guess. I think kids will eagerly lap this food up.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this and ate the entire amount up, but due to the saltiness, I think this may be my last shot at this product. Those who are comfortable with the saltiness of a typical sit down restaurant won't, I think, feel likewise.

review/summary: Nice Tasting Quick Meal
review/text: Velveeta Skillets Dinner Kits make for a quick and easy meal.  Prepartion time is aroung 20 minutes with most of time spent browning the ground beef and simmering the pasta.  Taste was better than average with creamy velveeta cheese sauce.  Sodium is high at 850mg per cup serving and fat is at 9g.  With that in mind, this is not something to cook every night but is worth having on hand for those quick dinners.

review/summary: So tasty...so cheesy.....SO GOOD!
review/text: Our family has started to dig into various Cheesy Skillet meals by Velveeta, and this one has become our favorite.<br /><br />The preparation for this meal couldn't have been any simpler...just follow the instructions on the box and you're good to go. Within 15 minutes, your senses will be on cheese overload.<br /><br />I've uploaded some pictures into the "Customer Images" section - not an easy task, because I wanted to dive right into this meal instead of taking pictures of it!<br /><br />The cheese was delicious, there were noodles aplenty, and it provided a very hearty meal. I could only finish 2 servings before I was stuffed.<br /><br />If you serve this with a side dish of vegetables, you'll have yourself one smiling family.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Velveeta Ultimate Cheeseburger Skillet Helps Create a Simple Meal
review/text: A simple meal is often welcome when your working life takes up a good portion of your day and Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger offers exactly that. It contains the basic ingredients in a box, ready to prep and serve with minimal effort or culinary skill. All you need is ground beef and water to create this food product and it can be served as a main dish or a side dish with other foods.<br /><br />Velveeta is the most popular processed cheese food in America and while I am not too fond of the taste of the actual cheese product, I have found the Velveeta meals a decent tasting food that makes for a reasonably easy meal. And this particular product is no exception. The cheese is fairly smooth and there is a decent amount of balance from the seasoning mix. I found it compatible to my palate, even though I readily admit it is nothing incredible.<br /><br />Nutritionally, Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger is fairly good. The base product, without meat, has a good amount of calcium and iron. But on the negative side, there is a good deal of sodium in this product and it definitely comes through in the taste, which is a little saltier than I prefer. Calories are not too bad, provided you can consume in moderation. A single box is intended to serve five people and if you can keep your portion down at that level, your waistline and heart shouldn't suffer.<br /><br />I like meals that are easy to prepare and Velveeta Cheesy Skillet Ultimate Cheeseburger certainly fits in this category. There is little to do other than brown the ground beef, add water, stir, and wait. Taste- wise, the product is good, but not great and it doesn't come even close to the taste of a freshly made meat, pasta, and cheese casserole. However, it will do in a pinch and it has enough to offer to award it with a slight recommendation.

review/summary: Spanks Hamburger Helper's behind!
review/text: We don't use 'skillet meals' very often but wanted to try this because it's new.<br /><br />The only other version of this we had eaten was from Hamburger Helper. The Velveeta product was just this side of homemade tasting, and beats HH hands down. The only odd thing was having to add a packet of cheesy powder to the dish when making it; reminiscent of Kraft Mac N Cheese. I had fully expected all of the cheesy sauce to come from Velveeta cheese.<br /><br />This dinner was creamy and yes it was salty, but in a good way. I would buy this and keep it handy for the teen to make a quick dinner. Both my son and husband loved it and said they would definitely eat it again.<br />If I make this again I might add a little finely diced onion and a can of diced tomatoes to make it stretch since my family gobbled this down and didn't leave much for me!

I thought the cheese was just a bit sharper than typical velveeta, but I liked it.  My wife thought that it is cheesier than hamburger helper and likes this better.  I'm up for trying a couple of the other flavor mixes.  Good meal.  If you buy it I hope you enjoy and thanks for reading my review.

review/summary: NOT Hamburger Helper, but Quite Good Just the Same
review/text: My box showed up today around noon, which solved the question of "What's for dinner?"  I've been looking forward to trying this ever since I heard about it -- I'm a big Hamburger Helper fan (have been ever since I moved out on my own some 20 years ago).  I figured this would be Hamburger Helper with real cheese rather than cheese powder.<br /><br />Preparation is easy; brown the ground beef, drain, add 2 cups of water with the seasonings packet and the macaroni.  This is the first place you know this isn't HH; you have to make sure you cook the water (or "most of it" as the instructions say) off before you add the Velveeta.  Another difference is that the seasonings smell a little .... strong, and a little unusual, to put it mildly.  I wasn't too fond of the odor emanating from the skillet, and at this point I started to hope that I wasn't going to have to make something different for dinner.<br /><br />This also tastes different from HH.  Not bad -- in spite of my initial worry, the Velveeta Cheeseburger Skillets tastes quite good.  But it is rather different from HH, and if you're expecting HH you will probably be disappointed.  I can't quite put my finger on what the spice is, but there is a definite spice that makes this taste completely different from any cheeseburger macaroni that you've ever had before.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this will completely replace Hamburger Helper for me; I'll have to wait and see what other varieties they come out with before I make that decision.  But I do know that this is a good alternative, and for people who want something different, it will be a good choice.

review/summary: Not Your Typical Boxed Dinner
review/text: Velveeta Cheesy Skillets look like your typical 'boxed dinner'. You add a pound of ground beef to macaroni and seasoning, for a quick, tasty meal, but the similarities end there. Velveeta Cheesy skllets dinner kits have a package of creamy Velveeta cheese sauce right in the box, so the meal is much more creamier and cheesier. It comes in four varities, but I tried the Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac. Very easy to make and really tasty.  The box makes the directions very clear and concise and all you need to add is water and ground beef. I really think having the package of Velveeta cheese sauce makes a huge difference from other brands because it didnt turn out watered-down like some of this type of meal so. It was very rich and creamy.The seasoning pack gives it a little "zing", so it is more than just mac and cheese with meat. The box also suggests "cutomizing: it with chopped tomatoes and lettuce. Although this sounds good, I prepared it the regular way.  I love to cook, but sometimes I come home from work and dont feel like preparing a big meal. Those are the days I like to have something easy to prepare. This was perfect and  because a package makes about 5 servings, so there was plenty left over. Very filling and satisfying, I would definitely buy it again. I could preapare it and divide into servings for several lunches during the week. I think it's also great for kids who like mac and cheese. While, it certainly is not a "gourmet" meal , it is quite excellent quality.

Super easy to fix and the flavoring was great. I cooked it exactly as the directions state. Clean up is simple as it is all cooked in the same pan. Love that.<br /><br />I had a side salad and bread as well with this meal, which worked well with it. The box comes with spices that dress the meal up a bit. Totally recommend this if you love Velveeta or the similar meal by Hamburger Helper- The Velveeta Skillet meal is MUCH more delicious.

review/summary: Tasty, and easy to add to
review/text: To get it out of the way, let me mention the obvious downside. At a minimum of 350 calories for one cup - and you will eat more than one cup - it's better to treat it as a very occasional treat than a mainstay. It's beef, velveeta and starch; and it's slightly higher in calories than some equivalent products. But if you're dieting, you're already avoiding meals like this one.<br /><br />As an occasional treat, though, it's nice. It's simple to prepare, and it went flawlessly. It cooks in one pan, is tolerant of varying heat (I cooked it over a woodgas stove), and doesn't take long. The taste is a little on the bland side as is, but adding spices and other additions is easy. It's creamy and rich. I added some tomato and some minced, dried onion, and spiced with a splash of hot sauce and lemon pepper. It doesn't need salt. It was good. And if you actually measure out a cup of the stuff and sit it next to a decent quantity of vegetables, it's not as much of a dietary train-wreck as you'd think, and you aren't hungry again soon afterwards.<br /><br />I think packaging could be improved; the packaging isn't very suitable for burning or recycling.

I enjoyed how easy this dish was to prepare and you didn't need to add much to the dish to create a full yet satisfying meal. I loved the fact that Velveeta didn't put in a powdered cheese product but instead used creamy Velveeta that created the perfect dish.<br /><br />The Hamburger helpers are a bit too salty for my taste but this product didn't over salt the product and this made it that much better. I will definitely purchase this product in the future as an easy dish for my family on those hectic days.

review/summary: YUM YUM!
review/text: My children love Velveeta Mac and Cheese, so I was happy to see a Velveeta version of "hamburger helper."  Usually, when I have made "HH" I "doctor it up" with add-ins, like mushrooms, sour cream, french fried onions, etc.  I wanted an accurate review of this product, so I prepared it exactly as directed on the box, with no additions.  My family was very pleased with the results.  The cheese sauce is rich and creamy, and does not require "waiting time" for it to thicken, as with other box meals.  The noodles cooked up well, and I didn't have any that were undercooked, as happens sometimes with other meals.  I will say that one box prepared would not have been enough for my family (three adults and two teenagers) if I had not also prepared two side dishes to go with the meal.  I usually prepare two boxes of HH (or this Velveeta in the future) so that everyone can have all they want, plus there will be leftovers for lunch the next day.  I have also tried the Velveeta BBQ Chicken Ultimate skillet, and I must say, it is even better than the cheeseburger meal.  I am very pleased with this product, and I hope that Kraft will expand the line to include more choices.

Just not me.  I found it to be a lot like Hamburger Helper's Cheesburger dinner not only in taste, but rather, in its lack of good taste.<br /><br />One lb. of hamburger meat is all that is needed -- the rest of the ingredients are included.  Once the meat is cooked you add two cups of water, the macaroni, and the spice packets.  That cooks down and then once most of the water is gone, you add the cheese packet.<br /><br />I wasn't keen on it, my husband ate it because he was hungry.

review/summary: Quick and yummy, but very salty
review/text: This evening we had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YV80O4">Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner Kit, 12.86-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> for dinner.  We were excited about trying this because my husband loves Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Macaroni and wanted to see if this was better. Twenty minutes is the total prep time, and all you need to prepare this dinner is two cups of water.<br /><br />My family had mixed reactions to the prepared meal:<br /><br />Dad: Wasn't what he expected - He thought that it would have a thick, Velveeta-type sauce.  The sauce tasted very cheesy, but was thin and kind of watery. Still it tastes better than the previous favorite.  We have a new winner!  Oh yes, there is no way that this is five servings.  It is one Dad-at-home-alone dinner, or all three family members having a meal with a salad on the side.<br /><br />Mom: It really is more like three servings than five, maybe even two servings if Dad is hungry.  It doesn't matter though, because of the over 1,400 mg of sodium per our family sized portion (850 mg per serving as the box calls a serving x 5 servings = 4,250 mg/3 people in our family = 1,417 mg. per serving)  Due to health issues, I can't eat that much salt, and I'd prefer that the rest of the family limit their salt as well.  I might be outvoted though.<br /><br />Kid: (with teeny appetite)  I tasted mustard, so I won't eat this.<br /><br />As it turns out, the dinner does contain a minute amount of mustard, so if you have mustard-hating kids, beware.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, and hope this gives you the info you need to decide if Kraft Velveeta Dinner is for you.

review/summary: Easy and cheesy
review/text: When Hurricane Irene hit New York, we lost power but still had a stove that worked. This kit provided a quick and easy and quite cheesy meal.  Essentially all you add is browned meat and water.  The macaronis are simmered in a seasoned water for a little over ten minutes, then mixed in the browned, drained meat.  A packet of velveeta is stirred in the meat and macaroni mixture.<br /><br />Everyone loved it except me.  No I wasn't expecting haute cuisine but I though it could have been less salty and more flavorful. It does taste like a cheeseburger.It is designed to please as opposed to challenge. In fairness, everyone else thought it was absolutely delicious--to the extent that they went out and bought ten boxes.  It definitely benefits from serving with a nice crisp salad or jazzing up with some hot peppers, tomatoes and/or salsa.<br /><br />This is ideal for the busy family, college students or any one looking for a filling, flavorful, easy to prepare meal.

review/summary: A Step Above Hamburger Helper
review/text: I've always preferred the boxed Velveeta with shells over Kraft Macaroni and Cheese (or is it cheese and macaroni?).  It's cheesier and more flavorful.  To now compete with Hamburger Helper, Velveeta came out with their new "Cheesy Skillets" meal-in-a-box.  I tried the "Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac" version.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any hamburger on hand, so I used what I did have: kielbasa.  I also added some roasted peppers.<br /><br />The pasta in Velveeta Cheesy Skillets is a much larger version of elbow macaroni.  It really holds and absorbs the sauce well.  In addition to the tradition soft cheese sauce like the Velveeta shells boxes come with, there's a seasoning packet to add to the meat, pasta, and water.  It really added a lot of flavor to the already rich, creamy cheese sauce.  It feels a step above Hamburger Helper, much like their boxed shells is a step above traditional boxed macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />My only disappointment?  There was literally only a handful of pasta included in the big box.  And the package says that it contains five servings.  Five?  Seriously?  Who are they kidding?  If I split the box up into five servings, everyone would literally get half a cupful.  These are supposed to be entire meals-in-one, not side dishes.  Let's be realistic here.<br /><br />My suggestion?  Buy the box and an additional box of pasta, add additional water when cooking, and you'll make a real dinner for five.  There's plenty of seasoning and sauce to cover and flavor any added pasta.

review/text: So here we have Kraft's answer to a certain popular food product. How does it compare?<br /><br />If you're familiar with the cheeseburger macaroni version of that other boxed hamburger thing, you're on the right track, except that this version comes with actual liquidish sauce that you stir into the finished product. What you end up with is kind of like mac and cheese with undrained hamburger. It's quite greasy, but tastes decent, though frankly I couldn't actually really taste the cheese. That might be a bonus for some.<br /><br />Really this is quite similar to the other thing, so if you're looking and can't decide which to buy, go with whatever is cheapest and you'll do just fine.

review/text: This is a fairly easy dish to prepare. I picked up a pound or so of lean ground sirloin and browned it well to achieve some flavor. Next I followed the directions on the box and made some improvisations to add some pizzaz. Without a personal touch with spices and other goodies, especially some well sauteed onions etc, this would be a fairly blase cheesy glob of meat. A green veggie and a piece of fruit for dessert help to soothe your conscience a little bit for the enormous calorie count in the meat and cheese. Bon appetit.

You brown a pound of beef (or whatever ground meat you like) in a skillet, add noodles, water and sauce mix and cook - so very similar.  At the end of the cooking process though you squeeze in a bag of liquid Velveeta and stir in.<br /><br />So how does it taste?  Not bad, but not great.  Honestly the cheeseburger flavoring was not the best and seemed bland overall.  The cheese and noodles were good but the whole I did not find overall satisfying.  I felt it was an average dish and have rated it accordingly.

Definitely not to much, but not lacking either. While I don't normally make Hamburger Helper, I usually have a box or two in my cabinet in case I just do NOT feel like putting anything together. I will now be replacing those with these. I noticed in the grocery store that there's a bunch of different flavors that looked pretty good. I won't be eating these often, but they're absolutely more substantial than HH!

review/summary: Delicious and easy
review/text: This meal-in-a-box courtesy of Kraft is quite tasty and very easy to make. Miles better than just macaroni and cheese, you add in your own ground beef and some spices and cheese that comes in the box. While I can't quite place the spices, the net result was something that tasted exactly like one of my mother's home-cooked meals. The amount of cheese sauce was "just right"- the meal wasn't overly cheesy but I could still get hints that something rich and creamy was lying underneath.  I threw some frozen peas and carrots into the mix to round out the meal, and was able to get 6 filling meals out of it. Move over, Hamburger Helper, I am totally going to buy these again.

review/summary: just so-so
review/text: Ok, first let me say, this is not the healthiest of meals so if you are on a health kick, this one isn't for you.<br /><br />I personally love this kind of stuff so I was very excited to try it.<br />it's easy enough to make, brown the ground beef, drain, add water and pasta and the flavor pack and then add the cheese.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I wasn't too happy with this one.  it lacked taste.  I don't think there was enough cheese or the normal Velveeta cheese that you can buy in the store.  It seemed to lack the cheese taste when the meal was said and done.  The cheese seemed a bit watery and really not enough.  So we ate 1/2 of it in one meal and the next day, I added a bag of frozen veggies to it and I also added salsa and more cheese and it tasted good.<br />I don't think the cheese that comes with the meal is the same one that you buy in the store.  I really did water down and lacked taste.  If you want to try it, get some Velveeta and add it on your own.

review/summary: Pretty Good for an Easy Meal
review/text: This Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner is your basic "Hamburger Helper" type skillet dinner. The spice mix is very mild and the cheese sauce is standard Velveeta. The finished serving size might seem a bit small for many people. The dinner is easy to make and quick. If you are into this kind of product, this one is probably on the lower end of the spice scale and should be good for younger kids.

review/summary: Didn't Turn Out Too Well
review/text: My experience with this cheesy skillet wasn't a good one. I followed the directions but it came out kind of runny at the end and wasn't very cheesy. It may have been something I did, but the end product just wasn't very good. I'm not a big "cheeseburger" person anyway. I did try the chicken & broccoli skillet and it turned out amazing. I would definitely recommend that one over this skillet. I just prefer the chicken and the noodles over the hamburger and noodles in this skillet.

review/text: My sodium radar told me to not even try this product, but it sounded good so I did. Ew! A whopping 900mg of sodium in a one cup serving, to go with the 370 calories. It is worth it to take the extra effort to boil whole grain pasta, make a cheese rue myself, then add hamburger. Time-consuming, sure, but way better tasting and better for me. Even my husband gave it a thumbs-down and he is like Mikey from Life cereal commercials!

review/text: We tried out Cheesy Skillets last week with some fresh ground beef.  The flavor was fairly unassuming.  Typical boxed meal fare.  The cheese was creamy, not gritty.  The spices were light, not overpowering or even noticeable.  Thirty minutes later, we were both running for the restroom through...<br /><br />Might be good for choosey children, but nothing to break the cookie-cutter boxed meal mold here...

review/text: Just like Hamburger Helper & related products, the Velveeta Cheesy Skillets meals are fast and easy to prepare. Yes, Velveeta cheese is actually not healthy for you and all, but despite that I do think these taste better than Hamburger Helper. Even the most novice cook can prepare one of these without issue in under 20 minutes; all it takes is some water and meat (I prefer ground round or other less fatty alternatives to ground beef).  My son made this without a problem and we combined it with some vegetables to complete the meal. Everything else aside, better pricing could probably be found at your local store.

review/text: (I'm not sure why it isn't marked as such, but this is a Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program.)<br /><br />On the plus side, it's easy to make: you only dirty a skillet and spoon.<br /><br />On the minus, it doesn't taste like much of anything. For all the seasoning and cheese, it still seems like it needs salt. It doesn't taste like any cheeseburger I've had...or even like one of those beefy mac dishes. It's just bulky stuff that lays in your stomach.<br /><br />I really can't recommend this to anyone.

But sometimes you don't have time to cook a complete meal for your family in todays fast paced world. Velveeta Cheesy Skillets work.

review/summary: It's no Julia Child.....but it's very tasty, easy to fix!
review/text: I fixed this dish with lean ground beef.  Browned the meat, added two cups of water, stirred in the seasoning and macaroni.  When that was done few minutes later, I added the Velveeta Cheese, minus a few tablespoons, and VIOLA!!  It was tasty for a quick dish.<br /><br />Don't overcook the macaroni, use the exact minutes stated on the box.  The Velveeta Cheese is tasty.  And, you can't expect this to be lacking calories, as anything with cheese can be a killer!  But I like it.<br /><br />Upon reheating, I used the remaining cheese.  It works great.<br /><br />With a lb of ground beef, you have plenty of macaroni, seasonings, and cheese.  This will serve a small family, providing you have a vegetable side dish too.<br /><br />But, here's the key.  Eat at while fresh, because when you reheat, the macaroni can get mushy.  Or, make sure you do not overcook the macaroni the first round.<br /><br />Kraft Velveeta..... tasty, easy to make, great for kids too. ...Rizzo

review/summary: Too Greasy
review/text: This dinner in a box is basically a Hamburger Helper-style cheesy macaroni.  It comes with pasta, spices, and cheese- you add the hamburger.  It can all be cooked in one pan, which is a definite plus, and it is definitely a quick and easy meal.  Those are the positives.  I wasn't nearly as pleased with the results as I was with the process.  The resulting concoction was was very greasy, and didn't have much flavor.  I used extra lean beef, so I don't think the meat was the issue.  I had previously tried the chicken and broccoli Cheesy Skillet, and that one was good, and didn't have a grease problem.  I'd buy that one again, but I'm steering clear of this variety.

review/text: This one-pan dinner isn't bad, it's basically another version of Hamburger Helper (which I happen to like as far as this type of thing goes), so there aren't a lot of surprises here.  It's simple to make and fairly cheesy, but I was left wishing there were a bit more cheese.  I think adding some parmesan cheese would help as well, I may give this product another go round and see how that works.  I can't say this is any better or worse than any other one-pan dinner, so I suppose if you're in the market for that sort of thing, this is as good as it gets.

review/summary: Not a Good Choice
review/text: I took this box of Cheesy Skillets to a cabin getaway and had it for dinner one night while we were there. That was not a good move. The nearest restaurant was 25 miles away. And guess where we went for dinner that night? The skillet smelled up the whole cabin. We had to leave the doors open and let all the bugs in to get the stench out. So we had a smelly cabin and tons of mosquitos because we cooked something we couldn't even eat. That's right, we threw it out.<br /><br />That was my experience with this product. I also had the Chicken and Broccoli flavor which I liked, so it's not a blanket statement for the whole product line - just this flavor.

review/summary: Good for what it is
review/text: Good:<br /><br />This is the best boxed mac n' cheese that I've ever had. The texture and flavor are the closest thing to real macaroni and cheese. It is definitely better than the powdered cheese form. It tastes pretty decent. With some hot sauce, either the rooster asian sauce or tabasco, it's even better.<br /><br />Fast and easy to make.<br /><br />Good value for the money.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />Presentation is nothing like the box. It is less cheesy orange and more white-ish. It does not look very appetizing, until you put a reddish hot sauce on it. On the bright side, I'd rather Kraft put less food coloring in their food and not more, so this is a good thing.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, it's not as good as real mac n cheese, but it's the closest thing to it coming out of a heavily processed box.<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />If you're a poor university student, or you can't cook, this is the thing to get. I could have seriously used this a few years back. A good change from endless boxes of pizza or chicken wings.

The Velveeta pouch was big and added plenty of cheesy taste to the pasta. If you are a fan of box pastas and cheese then you will like this; if you are like me and prefer fresh, then go ahead and skip. It tastes way too processed.

review/summary: YUMMY for Everyone's Tummy!!!
review/text: This is basically a Velveeta version of Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Mac, which if you add extra seasonings, is pretty good along with being a cheap meal. I have to say Hamburger Helper has just met its match.<br /><br />You cook up the hamburger the same way, add in water, a seasoning package, and then the noodles. Then, when the water is absorbed, you add in a package of Velveeta cheese. YUMMY!! It really made the meal pop with a great cheesy flavor without being too cheesy, a problem that I commonly have when cooking with Velveeta.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the macaroni noodles were a larger noodle. Typically you get little elbow macaroni noodles in the Hamburger Helper. That just added to the filling meal.<br /><br />I recommend this. It comes out to be about $2.50 a box when ordered off Amazon, which is cheaper than buying Hamburger Helping in the store. It is a good, hearty meal good for any family.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVDs.

review/summary: Even Good With Venison!
review/text: *DISCLAIMER: I did NOT use the seasoning packet as I knew the meat would have more than enough spice*<br /><br />My husband LOVES Hamburger Helper, so I was curious what he'd think of this. I didn't tell him that it was from Velveeta and simply browned up some Venison sausage and cooked the noodles and cheese sauce as the instructions state. I didn't add the seasoning because the venison sausage has tons of spice to it.<br /><br />We all dug in. We all loved it. When I told him that it was from Velveeta, his response was "I thought the cheese tasted different." I LOVE that the cheese isn't some processed powered stuff, but is rather thick, creamy cheese that folds into the meal perfectly. I can't wait to purchase more of these once they hit our local store!

In fact, it lacked taste and was incredibly bland. I was shocked at how awful it tasted, and even my very hungry family did not like it.<br /><br />The Velveeta package is what confuses me here, because as soon as you add it to the noodles it seems to disappear and you're left with plain noodles and hamburger. Besides the cheese sort of disappearing, there is no taste with this product.<br /><br />The traditional powdery cheesy Mac n' Cheese you get out of a box (which I actually can't stand) is better than this.

review/summary: Tasty and good for a quick meal
review/text: If you're pressed for time and want something that's easy to prepare, filling, and that the kids will eat, this should suit just fine. I wouldn't eat just this for a meal, though, due to the high fat content.<br /><br />We (two adults and three kids) had this for dinner a few days ago, and my wife said it was very easy to prepare. She mentioned that a few times, actually. This makes a good amount of food when prepared according to the package directions. The package indicates enough for about five people, and that's about right. There was more than enough to go around, plus leftovers, although we didn't eat this exclusively for the meal.<br /><br />Most of the family liked it. The flavor was good, and it went down very easy. There was a surprising amount of cheese, enough so that I think in addition to the ground beef you could add additional things like chopped onion, bell pepper, or whatever, and make quite a nice dish out of it. I ate some cold leftovers with lunch the next day, and it tasted just fine.<br /><br />My only gripe is the same thing I have with other cheese-type products: it's very high in fat, and therefore felt rather greasy, and sat a little heavy in my stomach. According to the box, one serving as prepared gives you 25% of the recommended daily fat intake. Because of this, given a choice this isn't a food product I'd eat on its own. Rather, I'd have this along with a small salad, fruit, etc. I'd really like it if instead of having the cheese sauce pre-made in a pouch, they provided a powder (similar to mac-and-cheese) so I can prepare the cheese sauce how I like it.

review/summary: a crowd-pleaser; even (most) adults liked it
review/text: We had six kids and four adults to feed when two families got together one evening this weekend, so we made two packages of the Cheesy Skillets Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner. In one skillet we added chopped tomatoes, which the adults preferred more than the kids. But everyone liked it and definitely wanted to make it again. We polled the kids and got a thumbs up from all of them! Most of the kids liked that it had "big macaroni" instead of the classic Kraft Dinner small elbow noodles. Both sets of parents usually add sliced cheese when we make the Kraft Dinner to boost the cheese flavor, and all of the kids felt this was cheesier even than that. (No surprise...an actual cheese sauce vs. dried cheese powder is going to win out.) One of the girls said it was "just yummy!" One of my boys said he wanted to add ketchup (well, it IS a cheeseburger meal) and another, hot sauce. I personally did not care for it and thought the flavor was weird. It really depends on you more than anything.

review/text: The preparation of this hamburger helper-type meal was very easy. Brown some ground beef, add water, pasta and the seasoning packet. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for about 13 minutes. Uncover and add the enclosed packet of cheese sauce. Stir and serve.<br /><br />My family liked this meal as it was like eating mac & cheese with browned hamburger. It was a bit bland for me so I zipped it up by adding a good sprinkling of white pepper on my serving.<br /><br />Easy to fix and relatively tasty.<br /><br />Recommend.

review/summary: It's Cheesy!
review/text: I normally only make these meals when I am in a pinch for dinner.  I have had a couple of favorite flavors of Hamburger Helper over the years.  I must say that I found this boxed dinner to be quite good.  It simply takes one pound of ground beef, and 2 cups of water, and in about 20 minutes you have dinner.  There is a liquid cheese sauce that is not normally in most boxed dinners.  It was rich and creamy.  I really liked that this reheated well too.  These Cheesy Skillets would be a great item to have in your pantry when you need to make dinner that is fast and simple, and tasty to boot.

review/text: I can't tell you how many times I've had Hamburger Helper. And even though I like Hamburger Helper (hey, it's easy!) I always felt like there was room for improvement. Well, that improvement is here!<br /><br />Kraft Velveeta's Cheesy Skillets is basically the same concept as Hamburger Helper. You brown the meat, drain it, cook the noodles, add seasoning packet... and voila! But the best part is the cheesy packet you add at the end. Wow! It really kicked it up a notch! Everyone in my house thought it was absolutely delicious! If you love Velveeta, you can't go wrong!<br /><br />All I know is... I'll never buy Hamburger Helper ever again!

review/summary: Satisfying The Kid In All Of Us
review/text: My mom always made the greatest Mac and Cheese, she would add, at times, different things like hamburger, tomatoes etc.  I suppose it helped clean out the fridge, but it was always good.  I still enjoy Mac and Cheese and we love using different cheeses etc. but stick to the basics.  Is it fair to compare Cheesy Skillets to what mom made?---of course not.  No one cooks like our moms did!  I will say that after trying  this I was surprised to find that it was better than I anticipated.  I suppose an aversion to prepared food is one of my faults. We did not add a full lb. of hamburger as it calls for, rather about 3/4 lb., which for us was about the right amount.  It was tasty, slightly salty, but enjoyable.  For those times when you get home and just do not feel like preparing a meal and don't want to go out, it would be great to have this in the pantry.  Easy to fix, quick and really quite good tasting.

review/text: My husband, my 9-year-old daughter and myself really enjoyed this meal but we all three made the comment that it needed more macaroni.  The recipe calls for 1 pound of beef and that's what we used but it seemed so much more beefier than it should've been.<br /><br />Preparing this meal was very quick and easy and I didn't think the calories were bad at all.  The box says that it makes 5 1-cup servings and I don't know who could be satisfied with just 1 cup but for the 3 of us (with me being on a diet) it seemed just right when we had some rolls with it.<br /><br />I would recommend this meal.  It's pretty tasty.

review/summary: Fabulous product - Improvement over Hamburger Helper!
review/text: In our house, I've been barred from EVER buying Hamburger Helper.  I suppose that's what happens when you cook from scratch for a bunch of boys nightly!  So, when I mentioned that we were going to try this, the number of moans and groans almost outweighed the sound of the hamburger cooking in the skillet.  But, were we ever in for a surprise.  This stuff is awesome!  It actually includes a large packet of smooth Velveeta cheese to mix in with the entree and just that one element really makes it go over the top in taste.  Mind you, if you'd like to save the calories from the cheese packet, the entree tastes great without it.<br /><br />My only complaints are: 1), it's a bit salty.  This is particularly heightened after adding that packet of cheese.  It's not over the top like some soups can be, but it's definitely a negative.  If you're on a salt-controlled diet, this might be an issue. 2). The actual serving size of the package is small.  And I mean, VERY small.  If you have a family of 3, then each individual would get one serving.  Any larger than that, then you're in trouble unless you have VERY young children.  If you have a hungry husband and sons, you'll wind up buying 3 boxes to actually make enough to fill them up.  My suggestion: add a salad with meat, along with a vegetable and some healthy bread and that helps considerably.  In addition, add something like a can of diced tomatoes to this dish and use ground turkey or chicken to make it healthier.  Milk to drink always helps too.  There is enough sauce to add an additional 1/2 pound of meat to the dish, along with the tomatoes, and the cheese sauce can cook a bit longer in the pan to make it more "runny" to infuse with the additional ingredients.<br /><br />So, this is definitely a "keeper" in this house.  I about fell off my chair when I heard a "Yum!"  But, Velveeta has been creating "Yums" for years and I am not surprised that this dish is in keeping with their history. Highly recommend!

review/summary: Comfort Food for your inner child
review/text: When they say cheesy - they mean cheesy.  This is the type of one pot meal mom made when my brothers and I were kids.  When this arrived it was one of those off days when I didn't quite know what to toss together for supper & thought now's a good time to give this product the once over.<br /><br />It was on the table in 20 minutes, as promised.  I used turkey but imagine the ground beef choice would be just as easy.  Brown the meat, toss in the flavor pack & pasta, 2 cups of water & let simmer for 11 minutes.  Then add the Velveeta Cheese pouch & kick it up a notch.  True comfort food in the blink of an eye.  Serve with some green beans & salad & you have a meal the family will enjoy (and ask for again).<br /><br />The nutrition values are a little on the high side and I don't like that little trace of trans fats at all but for a quick and easy meal with no fuss it's still a good option & better than a lot of "fast food" choices you may haul home.<br /><br />I say give it a try & judge for yourselves.  If you don't agree leave a comment below but I'll bet you're happy with your purchase.

review/summary: Yummy and delicious!
review/text: The latest spin on semi-homemade dinners is Kraft's Velveeta Cheesy Skillets. The kit includes pasta, a seasoning packet, and the gooey Velvetta cheese. All you need to add is 1 lb. of ground beef (or turkey) and 2 cups of water. The product claims to be ready in about 20 minutes, and that is correct. It took me about 19 minutes from start to finish. In terms of overall flavor, my kids, husband, and I all loved this meal.  In terms of the nutritional value, it's approximately 350 calories prepared and 25% of the daily recommended fat value. The real kicker is in the sodium content... 850mg. Let's be honest, it's not a gourmet meal; however, for a quick fix on a school night, you can't beat it. Serve it with a side salad and some fresh steamed broccoli, this meal is a winner.

review/summary: An old stand-by hits the spot!
review/text: I've always had a soft-spot for pasta and cheese because when I was raising my six children it was an easy, economical solution for a quick meal that they all liked. For some reason unknown to adults, kids do tend to like pasta and cheese in all its variations much better than adults do. I used to prepare the macaroni and cheese (no hamburger) for them with a salad and a half sandwich or a plain burger. Simple and easy...<br /><br />Ease of preparation is one of the reasons I got this product. The other reason is that when I saw the burger bits on the package it reminded me of good ol' juicy cheeseburgers that I loved in my younger days. Even though I don't eat them now, there was a time when I scarfed those cheeseburgers down...with big slices of raw onion. Yummy! Anyway, this dish blends together in a taste reminiscent of a cheeseburger and is very tasty. A bit too salty, but since I won't be eating it often, it won't harm me.<br /><br />In summation, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YV80O4">Kraft Velveeta Ultimate Cheesburger Skillets Dinner Kit, 12.86-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> passes the taste test, the ease-of-preparation test and since one box is enough for five people, it also passes the economical test. What more could anyone ask for in a hurried meal?<br /><br />It hits the spot!<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, September 26, 2011<br />Author of "Dream Reachers" series of books (with Chase Von)

review/summary: Not just a Hamburger Helper wannabe!
review/text: I thought this would be a lot like Hamburger Helper.  Boy was I wrong!  Because the cheese sauce isn't added until the very last step (just before eating), this is creamier and smoother than any variety of Hamburger Helper I've ever had (and I've tries most of them).  I suppose some people would think that the extra step (waiting until the seasonings and pasta have already finished cooking before adding the cheese sauce) make this more complicated.  I don't think so, and it is SO worth that little extra step!

Start with ground meat (I used goat), cook, drain the fat, add the spice mix, macaroni, water, cook until ready, add in the Velveeta.  To add more flavor and make a little healthier, i also mixed in sauteed onions, pistachios and hearts of palm.  A good dose of vegetables (really, anything on hand will fit the bill), greatly improves the dish, and takes little extra work.

review/summary: Easy, inexpensive and good
review/text: That title about sums it up. Total prep time is about 20 minutes, and in addition to the package's contents all you need is a pound of ground beef and two cups of water. In the last step you may look at the amount of cheese sauce they want you to add and hesitate, but that block of Velveeta is only that intimidating when it is in one solid chunk; once you mix it in it looks like the front of the package. Each box gets you roughly four normal-sized servings.<br /><br />This may just be me hearkening back to my old college dorm days, but I tried it cold (having refrigerated about 2/3 of it, as I was cooking for one that night) and actually enjoyed it just as much as I did right after taking it off the skillet.<br /><br />In short, this is one easy box dinner I will be returning to several times.

review/summary: Not Bad, Not Great...Another Meat `N Noodles Product
review/text: In the box you get yer dried elbow macaroni, an envelope of "seasoning," and an envelope of squishy Velveeta "cheese sauce."<br /><br />The box is a bit of a deception, as the contents easily would fit in a smaller box.  A bigger box conveys the expectation of a bigger end-product, right?  And of course a bigger box stands out better on the store shelf and offers a lot more copy space for that crucial moment when you have to engage and convince the consumer.  Mmmmm, pretty golden-yellow colors, and red cursive-y lettering, with a photo of noodles as big as my fingers...<br /><br />I followed the on-box instructions explicitly.  Well, okay, I admit it, I used 1.37 pounds of hamburger instead of the stated 1 pound.  All glory and praise to Odin that there were no adverse effects!  It all turned out just fine, basically just like the photo on the front of the box, neither watery/runny nor dry; everything glommed together just right.  The stated "makes about 5 one-cup servings" is about right.  Now, Kraft came out with the "family size" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019RLJV2">macaroni n' cheez</a> kit way back when, and I'd argue that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5RRA">Velveeta</a> (a Kraft brand) would want to do the same thing, and it might even help actually fill up this oversized/underutilized box.<br /><br />I didn't add anything to the recipe, as this was the first time with the product, and I was cooking with this review in mind.  As for taste, it was just fine.  Nothing special, but not bad.  Now, did this taste like "ultimate cheeseburger?"  No, not at all.  That's because there was no bun, mayonnaise, pickles, mustard, or grill-charred meat with a slick slab of melted cheez atop, all of the things I put on a cheezburger.  I did go with the "customize it!" advice on the back of the box and had some chopped onions, diced tomatoes and chopped lettuce on hand, which was a nice addition to the product, more than anything lending it some crunch, and a nicer range of flavor.  One could really go nuts and drop some salsa into the mix, or even saute' some fresh broccoli or carrots with the hamburger.  Now we're talking a meat n' cheez dinner creation that's a lot more interesting and certainly more tasty.<br /><br />If I were to use this product again--and this might be a good thing to put in the copy on the package--I'd cook some diced onions with the hamburger, and/or some chopped mushrooms.  This would bulk up the servings somewhat, and definitely yield more depth of flavor.  I added no spices to the product, and it was accordingly bland.  If I were to cook this again, I'd add salt, pepper, some caraway seeds, maybe a bit of rosemary and most definitely some garlic and a little bit of red pepper.<br /><br />Yes, it was ready in about twenty minutes, as the box copy promised.<br /><br />Yes, I'd use this product again, but I can't say I'm going to go out of my way at the store to find it and buy it.<br /><br />I do like the TV ads for this product, though, funny and original.  Let the smiting continue!<br /><br />Bottom Line: this is another offering in the great American <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4IQ6">Hamburger Helper</a> tradition.  It's a one-pan dinner that's really easy to make and takes little time.  Following the instructions yields a passable main dish that while not bad, isn't really that interesting and offers some nutritional value.  The kit does offer, however, a foundation upon which one can experiment and improvise to create more varied mealtime indulgences.

review/summary: Amazingly Good!
review/text: I have to admit, I am NOT a fan of processed foods. I cringe at the thought of Hamburger Helper and products like that. However, I have a soft spot in my heart for Velveeta Shells & Cheese, which I loved as a kid and would spice up in college with veg or meat to make it into a full meal. So when I was given the opportunity to review the new Velveeta Cheesy Skillet, I decided to take the plunge into childhood nostalgia.<br /><br />The long story short is that we really enjoyed this. The dish was exceptionally cheesy, which my household loved and the flavor of the meat blended wonderfully with this dish. My girlfriend was actually disappointed that we only recieved one package instead of the full six pack you get here at Amazon. So the fact you have two people who prefer to cook everything from scratch loving this dish tells you the flavor quality here.<br /><br />My only qualm is that this is exceptionally high in sodium and fat even before you add the hamburger. To offset that we went with 93/7 extra lean ground beef.<br /><br />For those that are curious, you're getting 15 ounces per package here compared to the 12 ounces you would get in a 2% milk Shells and Cheese package, so although the Cheesy Skillets cost a bit more, you're actually getting more foodstuff to balance it out.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this for those that don't like to cook or that need a quick meal on a small budget.

review/text: This is very similar to Hamburger Helper in terms of ease of preparation, but it uses a Velveeta-based liquid (or semi-liquid) cheese sauce in a foil packet rather than powdered cheese that you reconstitute with milk and butter.  That bumps it up quite a bit in terms of flavor, although it's still just cheeseburger macaroni, so it's not going to change your life.<br /><br />(Except perhaps by shortening it slightly...in the interest of full disclosure, for any health nuts out there that may somehow be unaware, cheeseburger macaroni isn't the healthiest meal you can choose.)

review/text: I've enjoyed many a meal of Mac & Cheese Hamburger Helper through the years, and Kraft's Velveeta foray into the skillet, quick meal world is very much in this vein...but cheesier and tastier. Our family liked it.<br /><br />The cooking process is pretty straight-forward - cook the ground beef, add the noodles, water, and seasonings, boil, and add the cheese. It's probably a 20 minute process, but the chief need not be standing over the stove that whole time.<br /><br />It was enough food for a couple of adults and a couple of little kids.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I was really surprised  at how good this product tasted. I was expecting something bland like hamburger helper. The cheese was thick and creamy, and the overall dish was not super salty like I expected. I would definitely try all the varieties of this product.

review/summary: Creamy Cheeseburger Macaroni in a box
review/text: This is an upgrade to your traditional Hamburger Helper brand.  If you like Velveeta with its creamy smooth cheese, then you will like this product.  I don't purchase a lot of easy quick meals but I always have it on hand for emergencies.  This fits the bill perfectly.  It has taste, texture, and provides a great casual meal for the family, especially my children.  Water + ground beef + this box = quick easy dinner.

review/summary: easy to prepare
review/text: its not much different than its competitors when it comes to the ease of preparation. in this, they are all pretty much interchangeable. hence, all that really matters is in the taste. it's quite good actually, cheesy and savory. i just wish that it was a tad cheesier and creamier. i admit i improvise a lot when cooking - my style is loose and dynamic i guess. so, trying to be 'healthy' - yes, box preparations ain't exactly the healthiest, but i never say i wasn't lazy - i tossed in some fresh cauliflower and broccoli with the pasta. the flavorings comes next, and that's when i tasted it to make sure it wasn't too bland. that's when i noticed that it WAS bland, and added a bit of salt to taste. what i didn't realize is that how salty the cheese sauce was! that really threw me off. thankfully i didn't add a lot of salt, so the dish was palatable and quite nice really. however, looking back, i think that if someone prepares the meal strictly according to the directions without additions, the end product may be a tad salty.<br /><br />all in all however, a decent and quick meal.

review/summary: Tasty, quick meal!
review/text: Some days you just want something fast and easy for dinner. Luckily, Velveeta Cheesy Skillets kits are fast, easy, and pretty tasty.<br /><br />I made this one using ground turkey, and it turned out to be a pretty big hit for my family. In about 20 minutes, we were chowing down. The sauce did taste a little artificial, but then it's to be expected with this kind of boxed dish. The cheese sauce, though, was immensely better than powdered sauces in other skillet meal kits.<br /><br />The price is a little on the high side, but having the cheese sauce makes up for it.

review/summary: Say Goodbye to Hamburger Helper :)
review/text: I was reluctant to try the Velveeta skillets dinner kit because I cannot stand hamburger helper and this product reminded me of it. However I was really surprised by how much I liked it. This meal has so much flavor it's unbelievable. You can really taste all of the flavors of this meal and it doesn't taste like cardboard as other box meals do. The cheeseburger box meal makes a lot of food as well. In comparison to other box meals this Velveeta box meal has them beat hands down with taste and quality. If you are looking for a great meal at a reasonable price look no further than this meal. This is so simple to make as well...cook hamburger, cook noodles, add the cheese, and the sauce packet and it's complete. I liked this cheeseburger skillets dinner so well that I purchased another one recently. This is also a hit with the family. Highly recommended to all family who likes Velveeta cheese or box meals.

review/summary: Cheesy goodness
review/text: One of the greatest "joys" of being a college student is being poor and the culinary innovation that is invoked in order to make the most out of your dollar.  I found myself as being the Hamburger Helper Connoisseur among my friends.  Little did I know that they were as healthy as Cup O Noodles and with each bite, I met my daily allowance of sodium. So it was with a bit of nostalgia that I approached my trial with the Velveeta version.  I would say that when it comes to helping make a quick meal, the relative ease of preparation is a big plus.  But the basic recipe is somewhat lacking, although cheesy.  I found that adding some extra garlic, chopped onions, and some fresh diced tomatoes, it became a lot better.  But I don't really see how it is much easier than making a similar dish by adding dry pasta noodles, velveeta cheese and some milk.

review/summary: Really cheesy, really easy and really good!
review/text: This meal was incredibly easy to prepare, following the instructions on the box.  Essentially brown some ground beef, and add everything else in one skillet.  A few minutes later you have a really delicious cheesy treat.<br /><br />let's be honest, this is a meal in a box.  If you are seeking a true epicurean, go buy your fresh ingredients and make a fresh meal.  This cannot compete with that, and it isn't trying to.  If however, you are a busy parent, who gets home at 5:30 and is trying to have a good warm dinner everyone will eat by 6:00, this is a good choice.<br /><br />Again, this is not the healthiest thing you will eat all day, probably.  However, it's great comfort food, it's warm, cheesy and tasty!<br /><br />We highly recommend this for an easy quick meal.

review/summary: Kraft hits home
review/text: "Kraft Velveeta Cheeseburger Dinner"; is really good in flavor but you have to make sure to do not add salt. It has a lot of salt pre-added.  It does feed three to four people if you add a salad or vegetable with it. It is easy and quick.  I have bought another dinner from Kraft Velveet and it was good too. It beats eating a boxed macaroni and cheese.  This is good, fast and tasty and I recommend it for any one who needs to eat on the run.  Thanks to Kraft, again.
