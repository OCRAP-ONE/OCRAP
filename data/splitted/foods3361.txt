review/summary: Seriously? A total of 3 stars?
review/text: I don't know what sauce several of the other reviewers are trying, but it is not the Maker's Mark Gourmet Sauce. This stuff is absolutely awesome. It is the only sauce I use. Great on beef, chicken, and don't even get me started on pork. Slightly sweet, but with plenty of kick from the spices. This absolutely blows away the competition.

review/text: These deli franks are one of the greatest vegan products that I've tasted from Cedar Lake. They taste like real meat franks that I wouldn't be able to tell the difference if I haven't known they're vegan. That's what's great about eating this kind of food. I get to enjoy delicious food without worrying about my health. These franks are guaranteed to be filled with nutritious ingredients that are not artificial. It is an added bonus that they're also juicy!

And if the meatless part is not enough to satisfy my vegan needs, they are also fat-free! This fact makes me enjoy eating them more because I don't have to feel worried about gaining some extra weight. There's really nothing that can beat a delish and nutritious combo meal!

review/summary: We love these in our house!
review/text: I was first introduced the the Old El Paso Gordita Dinner Kits when I went over to a friend's for dinner back around 2000.  They made chicken they had cubed up added the seasoning etc.  They were fantastic! Since then have been regularly eating these and haven't regretted it one bit!<br /><br />To me the best part of the kit is that it comes with a creamy zesty ranch sauce packet which is tangy and pretty spicy but not too hot.  I even save the packet of the leftover sauce and use it for the next several days on things like nachos.  Yum!<br /><br />The next best part is the gordita shells themselves.  Nice and thick yet soft.  Make sure you warm them up in the microwave first to make them taste and feel better.  We usually throw them in the microwave between paper plates for about 80 seconds at between 30-50% power. Would like it if they were slightly bigger but for most people they are probably the perfect size.  The texture is great.  I always prefer soft shelled tacos and burritos over hard shell tacos, so if you prefer hard shell then this kit may not be for you or buy this in addition to hard shells and have some friends over ;)<br /><br />Sometimes we use ground beef; other times ground turkey; cubed chicken.  All taste great.  We probably have these once or twice a month (4 nights of food when you figure in leftovers) as buying 6 at a time is a commitment but we don't mind.  I think we used to get the 12 pack but then they weren't in stock for a while so we became sad until I recently did another search and came across the Pack of 6.<br /><br />*Another note if you want to save a step and some time:  The instructions say to brown the meat first then add water and the seasoning.  I skip the water and add the seasoning immediately to the meat in the beginning then brown the meat with the seasoning already on it.  I don't notice a difference.  Also recommend using a leaner ground beef to avoid a grease puddle at the bottom of your meat when you are done.

review/text: I used to purchase Old El paso Gordita Dinner kits all the time at my local grocery store, I was so disappointed when both local chains discontinued carrying them, they were so good and my kids really loved them. I was checking out the groceries on Amazon and was delightfully surprised to find them there! If your family enjoys soft tacos I highly recommend that you try the Gorditas, the shells are thicker than traditional soft taco shells they are really good, and the south western ranch sauce is awesome ! They are so easy to prepare and the price is very affordable.

review/text: Nothing compares to first flush Darjeeling which fills the room with its aroma. Unfortunately the tea does not survive very long, no matter how well it is packed and sealed. The freshness lasts no more than a couple of months. I know, I've bought it direct from the Makaibari estate in Darjeeling on a visit there.<br /><br />This is the best first flush Darjeeling you can get online or from any local store outside India. It's almost there, not quite. The container is great, with two lids protecting the tea, you can use it later to store tea from other sources that comes in paper cartons.

review/text: Update on Aug. 11th<br />my family went to JAPAN for home leave and they came back here recent. They brought 1 pack of Tao of Tea, First Flush to JAPAN with them and they took it to their friends, who know and have been purchasing First Flush from Lupicia, they commented as following,<br />The taste is not so bad.<br />The aroma may be less but still acceptable.<br />As first Flush, it really depends on the weather Like Wine , so, it is hard to compare...<br />And then they told the price in AMAZON, they say "extra credit" and in fact cheap to compare to Lupicia !!!<br />The Less aroma some reviewers complains however we know it really depends on the tea (grade. farm, cost )<br />Not easy to compare ...<br />as Subjective issue , I leave it for further reviews and hope you enjoy what we enjoy with Tao of Tea ...<br /><br />Next tea will come to us by end of Aug. looking forward to having them !!<br />I give 4 stars at this time...<br /><br />>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br />Update on June 3rd, 2012, As subscriber of this tea, I received packs of the 2 ...<br />I could see some changes from the can(tin), from Silver to Black.... it is nice looking and the both are the fine and the can has second lid ( sealing from the air ) as tea can, it is very nice feature...<br /><br />And I know the tea quality and tea leaf are fully depended on the year's weather, etc...<br />Thus I can not do compare apple to apple comparison , however the this year's taste is completely changed... ( I could see the leaf also looks different )<br />With my preference, I like to have year of 2010 taste and aroma compare to 2012's ...<br />I hope Tao of tea is looking for the best tea for us ...<br /><br />>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br />Update on Dec. 17, 2011 , I have been getting this tea since Early sept., already got 3 times received the tea packed of two. The taste seems changed from the earlier , the tea seems similar to the second flush ... Strong and Darker tea since Nov. shipment, I am wonder why and I and my wife have been verify the tea between Lupicia first flush and this tea in Dec. This month... Uhhhh... The taste of this tea likely second flush ...<br /><br />Any one who has been purchasing the tea , how do u think ?<br /><br />>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.  Original review dated Oct. 25th 2011 >>>>>>>>>>>>>><br />We bought several first flush tea from Lupicia , however their tea came to USA are really limited and very expensive , at Amazon, I found a reasonable cost and taste good first flush tea. I recommend it everyone who likes to have first flush taste ...  not strong at all, spring tea in mind ...<br /><br />Their service is very good , shipment and packing, all the good for us ...<br /><br />We are going to continue to buy the tea...

The Ethiopian store near me closed, which meant that I had to go on the hunt for a new supply of green coffee for home roasting.  After trying a few other options, I found these, and will be buying them as long as the price remains reasonable.  They may be a little wet, but they roast evenly, and you can buy with confidence.

review/summary: Not at all what I thought
review/text: So Amazon suggested this as an alternative to Crawford Garibaldi biscuits.  Being how I am in search of a suitable replacement for the old Sunshine raisin biscuits, I figured I'd give 'em a try.  What a mistake.  Not only they are nothing like the Sunshines, they are nothing like the Garibaldis either.  The pictures on the package are quite misleading, suggesting that there is actual fruit to be found inside the biscuits.  Not so.  Yeah, there's a couple of raisin specks in each biscuit, but if you didn't already know that you'd be hard-pressed to figure out what kind of fruit it was supposed to represent.  On the upside?  Well, the dog likes them.  So I won't bother to return them as she is a good dog and deserving of things that she thinks are a treat.  You probably won't find them very treat-like unless you long for dried out wafers with vaguely representational fruit-specks in them.  Get the Garibaldis instead. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DKT8AC">Crawfords Garibaldi Biscuits 100g (case of 12)</a>

review/summary: Ought to Be Illegal
review/text: I think the FDA should classify these things as illegal drugs.  They're so darn good that I can't even have them in the house (I haven't bought them from this vendor (and I won't comment on the price), so I'm just talking about the Golden Double Stuff Oreos, themselves).  While I was binging on them, I'd force myself to eat "only" one "line" of 11 cookies a day (there are 3 convenient "lines" in each pack and that re-sealable flap on the front is great for easy access while keeping them fresh during their short existence in my vicinity).  Even so, as I continued to shovel them in, I'd sit there moaning about how my liver and pancreas were hurting, my teeth and tongue were coated with fur, and my eyes were jiggling around in their sockets.  Sometimes, some crumbs would fall out of my mouth while I was complaining and I'd have to root around for the errant pieces like a pig looking for truffles.<br /><br />Now, given their ingredients:<br /><br />"UNBLEACHED ENRICHED FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, REDUCED IRON, THIAMINE MONONITRATE [VITAMIN B1], RIBOFLAVIN [VITAMIN B2], FOLIC ACID), SUGAR, HIGH OLEIC CANOLA AND/OR PALM OIL, DEXTROSE, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CORNSTARCH, SALT, BAKING SODA, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR, SOY LECITHIN. CONTAINS WHEAT, SOY."<br /><br />You might do as I did and say, "Heck, they're not that bad.  After all, I can pronounce (and even recognize) most of those things."  But, according to the label, the Serving Size is two (hah!) cookies.  Those two cookies contain 150 calories and 7 grams of fat.  Plugging that into the old Weight Watcher's point formula gives 3 points per 2 cookies.  Four cookies is, essentially, a full meal.  The 11 cookie "line" I was eating was the equivalent of 2/3 of my daily point allotment.  Of course, with the pain in my liver and fur on my tongue, I really didn't feel any desire for any actual meals.  So, I guess the points evened out in the end.<br /><br />Anyway, I've banned them from the house (I've been Oreo free for maybe a month, now).  I still have to force myself to not go down the cookie aisle, though.  And, if I do succumb and enter the aisle, I stand there and stare at the package with a mournful, puppy-dog look on my face while I yell at myself (on the inside) to just walk away.  So, I rate these at an absolutely wonderful, perfect, yummy, delicious, etc. 5 stars out of 5 and wish they were illegal.  Darn, they're good.  A 6-pack, hmmm....

review/summary: Best Earl Grey Tea
review/text: I have traveled the world of earl grey tea varieties and there are many good ones (and even more bad).  However, I have never had a tea that registered near perfection like this one.  I have been sipping this tea for nearly a decade and it is absolutely outstanding (and had fantastic experiences ordering it through Amazon).  I highly recommend it.  I do always warn folks to avoid tea bag teas in general since they are mostly created using the lowest quality tea leaves ("tea dust"), so invest in a tea stick (Google it) and enjoy loose leaf varieties so you can have a cup of tea at it's highest quality.  For what it is worth, never allow the tea leaves to sit in your hot water for more than three minutes (less than half that time for a cup rather than a tea pot full).  Enjoy!

review/summary: Finally A Great Earl Grey
review/text: After the demise of the Williamson & Magor brand,I've been on the hunt for a replacement earl Grey tea. Today my quest has ended! Taylors of Harrogate loose leaf earl Grey is made from full tea leaves not bits and dust. Most importantly, they use "REAL" oil of bergamot,the ingredient that makes an earl Grey tea well,earl Grey tea. Nowadays, Many manufacturers are replacing it with an artificial flavoring that may smell similar, but quickly loses it's taste when heated and becomes VERY,VERY bitter if steeped for more than 3min. This Taylors of Harrogate loose leaf earl Grey tea is extremely aromatic and it's floral/citrus notes from genuine bergamot oil is unsurpassed, flavorful, and very forgiving if over steeped! I Would give it ten stars if I could! High quality product.

review/summary: What is this stuff?
review/text: I have been drinking Earl Grey for over 30 years and sadly watched the demise of my favored vendors one by one.  After the last disappearance, I tried the Taylors on the basis of the reviews.  Disappointment is not the right word. It smelled strange out of the box, and after brewing it properly discovered that it bore no resemblance to the dozens of different Earl Grey experiences I have had.  It is heavily dominated by the peaty nature of the Chinese black tea base (almost an Oolong) and the bergamot is barely detectable.  Unique, but not what I want.  De gustibus non disputandem.

review/summary: Potent Bergomot
review/text: This does not have the strongest Bergomot odor of all Earl Grey teas I have tried, but it does have the strongest Bergomot taste.  It is not as balanced as Bigelow's, and not weak like Twining's Bergomot.  It covers up all the tea taste, you can't tell what kind of tea it is.  It is economical to use, since you have to use less. I love Bergomot aroma, but I'm not this partial to its flavor.  Others have complainted of heavy Bergomot in Rishi's Earl Grey, but although its odor is extemely powerful, its it does have some tea flavor.<br /><br />This is good to mix with plain tea to introduce Bergomot taste.

review/text: This stuff works great for smoothing out the texture of popsicle's which is all I have used it for so far. It is taking a bit of trial and error to get the right amount for different flavors and mixtures.  You don't need much, perhaps a quarter to a half teaspoon per 10 bar batch, but it works wonders at reducing the formation of Ice crystals so the mouth feel is smooth and creamy.  This small bag will last me years.  I store it sealed in a ziplock freezer bag, in the freezer. So far my favorites are lime with coconut milk and chocolate peanut butter bars.

review/summary: You Can See and Taste the Difference!
review/text: Do you know what's inside your tea bag? Brands of tea that you buy in a supermarket usually have tea bags that you can't see through. Cut one open- what you'll find are crushed and powdered tea leaves that are meant to brew your cup of tea quickly- normally 15 to 30 seconds.<br /><br />If you buy loose tea you'll be getting whole tea leaves- leaves that take longer to "open" and brew, but which normally produce a tea that is a better quality and which tastes better.<br /><br />Might Leaf tea bags come individually sealed in see-through cellophane packets. The tea bags themselves are made of see-through thin woven silk, and inside are tea leaves that are a lot closer to loose tea than anything else you've seen in a bag. You have the convenience of a tea bag with the quality (almost!) of loose tea. If you're not ready for loose tea yet, try Mighty Leaf teas. Yes, they cost more than usual tea bags, but you'll be very pleased with the tea they make. If you like white tea, their White Orchard tea gives you an aromatic, mild, flavorful light-colored cup of tea. You can re-steep the tea bags 2 or 3 times, and if you do that the price per cup becomes very affordable.<br /><br />I used to laugh at the Great Depression stories of my relatives hanging up tea bags to dry on a clothes line. Most of us don't have clothes lines any more, but these tea bags are worth saving and using again!

review/summary: Nice spicy black bean dip
review/text: I have searched for dips for tortilla chips and similar foods. Many are bland; some just don't taste very good. This product is one of my more successful "finds." This is a fat free spicy black bean dip.<br /><br />The bottle says: "With a color and flavor as smoky as a desert sunset, our spicy black bean dip has a heat that comes from deep within. . . ." On the one hand, there is a quiet heat from this as you dip a chip and then eat the chip with the dip. But it is not so hot that it is unpleasant. So, pleasant heat, I suppose, is how I would describe the effect of this.<br /><br />I purchase this regularly, so that this is not a "one shot" product for me. And I intend to keep purchasing bottles of this into the future. . . .

review/text: I just bought this, ground the beans, and tried a sip. What a disappointment. I've always enjoyed Eight O'Clock Coffee and consider it one of the best bargains out there. Bokar is one of my favorites. The decaf is just strange. I don't know if the beans were burnt or if there are chemicals used in the decaffeination process which flavor the coffee, but I don't know if I can drink it without mixing it with some caffeinated beans. Or maybe I'll just throw it away. I've had lots of decaf coffees from other brands and have never been so disappointed. I know decaf will never compare to the real thing, but this is just quite awful. I finished my four cups, but this will be the last time with these beans. Maybe I just got a bad batch.

The chocolate tastes similar to that of regular chocolate pocky, but is much thicker and creamier and all around about 10x more amazing.  It's kind of like a perfect blend of milk and dark chocolate and has a tiny bit of powdered cocoa on the outside.  In the box, there's 4 individual packets with 6 sticks of pocky each, 24 total, so it's perfect for sharing or, you know, not.  The only thing you'll hate about this product is when it's gone and then you have to go get some more.  This pocky is a must try for pocky lovers or even people who've never heard of pocky before.

review/summary: Helps my tourettes and crohn's
review/text: I have been purchasing this tea locally for a couple years now, but I think I will order in bulk online now.<br /><br />I have mild cases of tourettes syndrome and crohn's disease, and chamomile has helped me to cope better with both.  I discovered by accident that my tourettes symptoms were noticeably lessened when I drink chamomile regularly, and although I am no neurologist, I suspect that some of the herbs help stabilize the erratic nerve impulse loops that are so common to those afflicted with the disorder.  I have also concluded that the calmed nerves were not simply the result of drinking a warm drink.  I have experimented with a number of other teas and drinks, both caffeinated and non-caffeinated, and although they relax me, they don't help as much as chamomile.<br /><br />As far as crohn's goes, regulating the diet and eating frequency are very important, but chamomile helps to calm nerves and all kinds of tissue.  It isn't a pain reliever, but it definitely helps.<br /><br />ZEN NOTE: I also discovered by accident that I can achieve a sort of zen state by adding a small pinch of caffeine powder to a big cup of chamomile, and after some research, I think I discovered why (on a vary basic level): they affect different parts of the body; it is not a simple matter of chamomile calms you down and caffeine spins you up.  According to the wikipedia page on caffeine, caffeine is structurally similar to adenosine, a molecule that, in the brain, will protect the organ by inhibiting neural activity and increasing blood flow under certain circumstances.  Caffeine, being structurally similar, will block the brain's adenosine receptors for a time but will not cause the same effects once there.  It just sits there, and neural activity stays high.  Chamomile's herbal properties, for reasons unknown to me, stabilizes nerves and thus calms all kinds of tissues.  Combine caffeine and chamomile to create a drink that calms the nerves and yet maintains a high level of neural activity.<br /><br />It is quite pleasant.

review/summary: Package Quantity
review/text: You only get 6 packs of 20 not 6 packs of 40. So it is not quite the bargain expected. I contacted the seller but they just shrugged it off. They have not even corrected the description just said that they always just sold it in packs of 20. Amazing that no one picked up on this before. The tea is good. I love chamomile as it can be used for many things such as upset stomach, pink eye (just soak a cotton pad in it and put it on your eye). It also makes blond hair really shiny and pretty. It is also very good iced, very refreshing.

review/text: I like the mild flavor of this tea. I first tried it when I was looking for something to help with a bad stomach and acid reflux caused from stress and tension. Then I found that I liked it anytime just for the flavor of it. I like to mix it with the Sleepy Time tea and the Tension Tamer tea as well. The 3 teas mixed together makes a good tea for a cold winter night. I've found the Chamomile tea is good for when your down sick with the flu and cant get anything down and nothing sounds good. I usually use this tea for its medicinal value but its also good as just a beverage.

It gives me a nice afternoon pick-me-up and I love the fruity taste.  The drink is augmented with ginseng, guarana, B vitamins, and other good stuff.  While it's probably not the healthiest drink on the market, I love the taste.  I'm one of those people who can't drink water and need to find other sources for hydration especially since I live in Florida where it's very hot.  Rockstar and Blackberry Ice are my drinks of choice.

review/summary: Zero Carb = BEST
review/text: As I work nights, I've tried almost EVERY energy drink out there. They usually taste like vitamin-y candy.<br />This is the best (besides Juiced Guava... Less calories. When you drink 2 a night, that adds up).<br />As I sit here, sipping the lovely purple liquid, I contemplate how to describe the flavor. Sweet, hint of fruity? I dunno, but it's VERY enjoyable. I visit 7-11 nightly, was all bummed out because they were out. Got Monster instead and whined at my 7-11 guy. He told me to put the Moster back and went and grabbed me some from his stash in the back. What a winner!! :-)<br />I like RockStar Zero Carb (blue can) WAY more than Redbull or Bawls. Though I do enjoy Monster's HitMan energy shots, though too much caffiene too fast. Prefer to slowly consume throughout my shift....<br />Hope this helps someone.

I have no more energy than with any sugar drink and I've heard a lot of tall tales about these drinks. Just drink it if you like a well flavored drink. It's good.

review/summary: The king of energy drinks!
review/text: I started drinking Monsters in high school, usually one or more a day. I tried Red Bull, Nos, Amp, Rockstar, and tons of other varieties, but it wasn't until I found Rockstar Zero Carb that I discovered one I really liked. I normally hate things that are ambiguously flavoured "wild berry" or something similar, and I don't usually enjoy diet beverages. Rockstar Zero Carb is the exception to this rule. I'm in my 20s now, and I don't drink energy drinks every day, but when I do drink them, this is the kind I prefer.<br /><br />As a side note - this packs in a lot more "energy" ingredients than most energy drinks, and I've always felt that I absorb them better without the carbs. And if for some reason you have no sense of self-preservation and drink four or even five of these beasts in a single night, you don't have to worry about all the awful sugar you'd get in the non-sugarfree version.

I found it cheaper to do this so I bought a couple 24 packs. These did not last long between the two of us. They taste wonderful but are a lot of caffeine. If you don't drink it normally Id NOT suggest these! My friend tried one and could not finish it. She felt sick the entire rest of the day because she never drinks caffeine. I routinely drink it and have since I was young. These cans are wonderful for me to take in my lunch to college classes and help me keep up between class, clinical, working and homework! Plus 20 calories for a whole can? Who can beat that?

review/text: (This review is for the white can with the gold star)<br /><br />I imagine if I were to break open a battery and empty the contents into my mouth, this is exactly how it would taste and feel. It's brutal. I can't really describe it. It tastes sort of... pineapple-y? With a hint of dirty socks and metal...?<br /><br />But it has a lot of good stuff in it and really wakes me up. But the blueberry flavor (blue and white can) is 100x better.<br /><br />If you want a sugar free energy drink, get the diet Red Bulls. I can hardly taste the difference with those. But these are okay sometimes and WAY cheaper.

review/text: I am the type of person who needs a caffeine rush in the morning in order to make it through the day. Unfortunately, I can't stand the taste of coffee.<br /><br />When energy drinks entered the market, I tried them out but couldn't stand the taste of all the sugar. Once Rockstar released a sugar free energy drink, I was hooked from the start. It doesn't have a flat taste like all other sugar free drinks do, this one will give you a pop when you take your first swig.<br /><br />Price is pretty completive, though you can find them cheaper if you hunt around. Some convenience stores will sell them  2 for $3, making them a better deal. But you have to drive around and find a place that has them on sale, so I think paying the extra 20 cents or so on here is worth it.

review/text: I picked up a can of the sugar free Rock Star today. I was dying of thirst so when I opened it, I took a big chug of it. About halfway through swallowing it, the taste hit me, and I wanted to spit it all back out right away!<br /><br />WHAT! THE! What *is* that disgusting taste? It was like chewing a big wad of Hubba Bubba, then drinking some nasty strawberry soda mixed with Code Red Mountain Dew and a baby aspirin all at once. After the first drink, I was still thirsty so I braved another swallow and I ended up just opening the car door and dumping the whole can out right then and there. It made me GAG trying to choke this hideous concoction down! What a waste of money.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of energy drinks to begin with, but I've never !!IN MY LIFE!! tasted one this gross. It even smelled like CAT PEE.

The only downside is that it's hard to find sometimes!
