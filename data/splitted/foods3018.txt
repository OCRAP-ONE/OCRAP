review/summary: brings back memories
review/text: Over 70 years ago my Grampa took me to the beach almost every day., To me, highlight of the outing was when he bought us "Orange Crush" in the heavy dark brown bottle, from the vendor boy.  Back then the juice was unfiltered and there was even small bit of orange in it.  For many years I hve tried to find something to drink like the ORIGINAL OC.(to no avail)  I use my seltzer siphon and if I tinker with the amount of syrup I can get really close to perfect.  I am so glad I bought this, just great.,

review/summary: Pretty good taste; goes a long way
review/text: Contains both sugar and sucralose (Splenda), which leaves me a bit of an aftertaste. (Your mileage may vary.) Everyone else in the family likes it -- pretty good root beer taste. We don't have a "SodaStream" carbonator, but just use plain old carbonated or sparkling water to mix it. A little goes a long way, making it cheaper than most alternatives.

review/summary: Energy Drink vs Red Bull
review/text: I love this product.  I've heard alot about the Sodastream and finally decided to purchase one, and as I drink a lot of Red Bull (mainly as a cocktail mixer), I gave this mix a try.  Quite impressed on just how I can't really tell the difference between this Energy Drink Sodamix and Red Bull, other than the price.  On average I spend about $2.25 per can of Red Bull, and this Sodamix will yield 50 8oz servings, so easy math says $112 for 50 cans of Red Bull or $6.99 for the Sodastream Energy Drink Sodamix 16.9 Fl oz bottle and 50 8oz servings.  And as not to be biased, I have a few friends who also drink Red Bull who all agreed that it was a toss up on tasting the difference between the two products, and how much money could be saved.

review/summary: Redbull?
review/text: Someone said that it tasted like a Sprite. No it doesn't to me. Not even close in my opinion. It's a Energy Drink. It tastes more like Redbull but with a less tart flavor. I couldn't taste any after taste so that was a plus. Even if it does have Splenda in it, I don't even taste that and I don't like Splenda. It isn't my favorite flavor as I am not a fan of Redbull, but if you do then this syrup just may be for you.<br /><br />*EDIT* I just realized when I wrote that it does not taste like a Sprite the person was commenting about the Lemon Lime syrup. I apologize about that.

review/summary: Diet Flavors are Not Great - Nasty Aftertaste
review/text: I absolutely love my Sodastream because I drink a lot of sparkling water and this has saved me a fortune! Recently I thought it would be great to have some of the soda flavorings around for guests, mixed drinks, etc. However, I have not been thrilled with diet flavors I have tried so far. Of the three I have tried (diet tonic, diet ginger ale, and diet root beer), I think the diet root beer is the best, but is not even close to any of the name brand diet root beers.  Both the diet ginger ale and diet tonic have a nasty aftertaste - way worse than any name brand diet soda on the market.  The worst part about the aftertaste is that it doesn't seem to go away. As I write this, I still have a bad taste in my mouth - and it's been nearly a half hour since I drank some of the diet ginger ale. That alone compelled me to pull out my computer and log a review. I have tried them several times now, altering the amount of syrup to see if it would make a difference, and each time I end up pouring it down the drain. I am SO disappointed by this as I had high hopes for flavorings.

review/summary: Win some, lose some
review/text: I recently received a soda stream, and have been playing around with the flavors. What I find is that everyone has their own amount of syrup they like added to the bottle. For example, with the cream soda I had to use about half the recommended amount, but with the diet root beer I like to add more mix. The real thing with these flavors - you just have to try them. I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas. All in all I like the soda stream, it's fun, but I still buy Coke and some other sodas. I am looking forward to trying some more of the exotic soda stream flavors (BBB has almost all of them in stock) and playing with making my own.<br /><br />3 stars because... well, win some, lose some with the flavors. It's all subject to taste.

review/text: This is fabulous. Heard about it on Sean Hannity and wanted to try it. My wife bought it for me as an early Christmas present. The set up and operation is super simple. To me the taste is excellent because it is so fresh. I like Polar sodas and those work out to about $.98 a liter. This does $.67 a liter. The diet cola does not have the classic metal taste and no aspartame. If you love diet soda you will love this. If you don't, you will leave a poor review. I thought it would taste like a cheap store brand diet cola, and it is so much better than that. It reminded me of Coke Classic.

review/summary: Diet drinks taste like diet soda from the old days
review/text: I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 "regular" syrups.  I have only tried the diet, caffeine-free syrups.  None of them come close to tasting anything as good as the diet drinks I buy at the grocery store.  Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.  I use my Soda Stream to make seltzer and it does a great job at that!  I've been experimenting with using drink mixes like Crystal Light, and those work OK.  DISCLAIMER:  I'm one of the folks who get a bad aftertaste with Splenda and Splenda is the sweetener used in the diet SodaStream drink syrups.

review/text: Of the Sodastream syrups, this is my favorite.  Unlike the other flavors, which are very often poor remakes of classic brands, the orange flavor is unique. It has qualities of Orange Crush and Sunkist, but adds an original flavor that only it has.  Overall, it is a great flavor, and even pop snobs will likely enjoy it.  If you can't live without the classics, any flavor (including Orange) is not worth buying though, so be cautious, and try buying one instead of a three pack the first time.

review/summary: Regular Cola has Artificial Sweetener
review/text: I bought the regular cola flavor to give it a try, but after tasting it, I realized that it had artificial sweetener. I didn't think to read the ingredients before buying, since it wasn't diet. Not sure why they did that, since the first ingredient is SUGAR. I can't give it a good rating, as I stay away from artificial sweeteners and I feel that they were a bit deceptive by not making the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners more noticeable. I don't drink cola every day (maybe once a week or less) and I feel that sugar is OK in moderation.

review/text: I have the SodaStream and love it. I am a diet soda drinker and love all the varieties of flavors my local retailer carries. My favorite is the pink grapefruit. I came on Amazon expecting to find a deal and was shocked at the price some people are selling the flavor syrup for. HIGHWAY ROBBERY! These can be purchased for $3.99 - $4.99 (Bed Bath and Beyond, Kohls)for single bottles . I thought maybe this was the price for a double pack, but doesn't appear to be. At this price, this machine would not be very cost effective now would it?

review/summary: Ginger Ale Flavor is quite tasty!
review/text: The other reviews are correct in the fact that the "suggested" retail price is $4.99 per bottle.  Some sellers are ripping the consumers off by pricing them higher.  As always... caveat emptor!<br /><br />The Ginger Ale syrup is very good in my opinion.  It is very close to Canada Dry's Ginger Ale in crispness and tartness.<br /><br />I use the "three buzz" carbonation method and then fill the syrup cap to the line in the cap about a 1/2" from the top of the filler.  This creates the perfect syrup to carbonation ratio and makes a very drinkable and tasty ginger ale!

It' is 1/3 the price per serving of store bought soda, 1/2 the caffeine, 1/3 the sugar and calories, but it still tastes amazing. And we don't have bags and bags of recycling, and we can make whatever soda we want when we want. At this price, it's basically just buying 3 cases of soda on sale... what's the point??? When you can order it online from ANYWHERE ELSE for half the price, this is just absurd. Please just search for it, you'll find a better price in about 10 seconds.

review/summary: Aftertaste
review/text: I bought the Sodastream after just looking at it for a while.  Then, decided to try it as I remember drinking "fizzies" many years ago and was shooting for that effect.  Sodastream does indeed add great fizz but beware the aftertaste.  I tried the orange and thought, while I was drinking it, that it was terrific.  But, then, for more than a day, I had an aftertaste like some of the diet drinks leave.  Same with the Root Beer.  And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.  That part is very disappointing.  Not sure if that can even be removed.  Is it the carbonation itself?  Regular carbonated drinks do not have it.

I said wow that is a big jump $130 plus to just buy the unit then you gotta buy the charging cartridges "co2" and bottles then the syrup all told it was near 200 to get me started and ready to go. So I said to myself hey I can buy soda water in my store for 88 cents per 2 liters and the syrup makes 6 or so liters per bottle depending on how strong you want the taste I buy the energy mix 2 or 3 bottles at a time and it lasts me about a month I still buy other soda buy much less and no more paying 3 bucks a can for red bull,oh side note if you are into jager bombs and so are your party friends buy a bottle of this and some soda water bottle of jager and have fun in my opinion it tastes better than real red bull

review/text: Ive heard many reviews about Sodastream: most bad, a few OK. I understand that Sodastream sodas cant taste exactly like regular soda so im not expecting them to taste exact. With that said Im pretty pleased with or am OK with most of the flavors that ive tried. Bellow are my reviews of a few.<br /><br />Cola: 5/5 stars Doesnt taste exactly like Coke but is close. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Orange: 5/5 stars If youve tried different brands of Orange soda you will notice that some taste better than others. This tastes like cheaper dollar store orange soda, so is similar to Sunkist, but it still tastes pretty good & does taste like a known orange soda.<br /><br />Lemon Lime (Sprite): 4/5 Tastes like Sprite at first but leaves an odd after taste. Ive noticed that if you open your mouth after each drink the after taste is minimal. If it werent for the after taste I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Cranberry Raspberry: 5/5 Not sure what to compare it to, but it tastes great with no weird after flavor.<br /><br />Energy: 5/5 This came in the trial pack, & since im not into energy drinks I sipped it & had a friend try it. It gets 5 stars because it tastes just like Red Bull according to both of us.<br /><br />Dr. Pete: 3/5 Its OK but it tastes pretty vanillaish & not all that close to Dr. Pepper. You can sort of taste the similarity but not enough to say "WOW! JUST like or very similar to Dr. Pepper!!!".<br /><br />Overall Im still a big Sodastream fan, & most of the flavors ive tried I would buy again.

I like to.<br /><br />However, diet lemon-lime is not different, it's NASTY.<br /><br />It has an incredibly bitter aftertaste. I drink diet sodas all the time and nothing has a bite like this. I kept trying it thinking I would like it or I did something wrong, but it tasted nasty every time.<br /><br />Having said that, I think it's worthy to note that SodaStream makes a variety of flavors, some of which are unique and delicious. In addition, I have made some drinks with this base by mixing in some tastier flavors.<br /><br />As another review stated, SodaStream does NOT save money. But it is pretty fun.

review/summary: The ENERGY drink is the only one I can tolerate, and I love that one!
review/text: We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July. For myself though, I think all of the sodas are totally gross except for the Energy drink one. They all have this creepy flavor, I'm not sure what exactly it is?  You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.<br /><br />Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding. If you like that, you'll love this.<br /><br />To me, I look for the Guarna (sp?) in energy drinks, and this has the absoute most guarna flavor of anything I've tried. I LOVE IT.

The soda stream device is a COMPLETE RIP OFF,But if you add up 50 cans of red bull the cost would be anywhere from $150-200 which pays for the cost on the machine and then some with the savings of buying this syrup. The purchase of the machine is worth it but only if you like the energy syrup, otherwise go to walmart and buy a two liter of regular pop for a buck.

review/summary: Some really great and some really really bad
review/text: Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase.

review/summary: A fairly "meh" generic cola.
review/text: I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other "b-list" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the "kick" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway).

It does not taste overly sweet, nor does it leave you with a chemical after taste.  Plus it is nice that you can control how much syrup you add to play with the flavor a bit.  I would recommend at least trying this syrup and definately use it for a root beer float!

review/summary: With a little doctoring, very good
review/text: This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little "spicy" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that.

review/text: I chose the diet soda. Notice that the total amount of the product is not written. I was perplexed at first, but then discerned that the product image clearly says 750ml. So at $8.39 it seemed to be a decent price. However what I received was a 500ml bottle. Not worth the hassle of returning for a couple of bucks, but an annoyance none the less. So beware when you purchase. I suggest you assume that you will receive a 500ml bottle.

This is nothing but a customer advisory.  Buy the syrups direct and save a bundle.  As for the product, its a great product.  Spending 99.00 on the machine means I have to drink a LOT of soda to equal 99.00 of sodas but it is more fun and a lot less waste.

review/text: First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull. When I burp, it has the similar energy drink belch smell that energy drinks have for some reason. The color is not quite the same as Redbull.<br /><br />But having said all that I still find this to be an excellent value when you compare the prices of Redbull vs this mixture. At the store, Redbulls are $1.99 where as this one costs maybe $0.40 after all is said and done (cost of carbonation, syrup, shipping charged on carbonation, etc). I made that number up in my head though, did not use a calculator or even really think mathmatically about it so it is pretty much a made up cost I pulled out of the air and doesn't represent anything truthfully.<br /><br />Anyhow, I know it is a much cheaper solution, I enjoy it and am drinking some now.

review/summary: Flavors from home and childhood
review/text: The sodastream has been a real help to my family we are currently serving overseas and while there is an abundance of coke here the other flavors of soda are shall we say lacking! Some are so bitter that they are not palatable to my family. Rootbeer is a favorite and the sodastream has it nearly perfect to the rootbeer my dad made when I was young! I think that a touch more syrup is necessary to reach the true rootbeer flavor so it gets one less use for my family than the bottle says and I think there is an underlying mint flavor that is not overwhelming or unwanted but a bit noticeable to me. I did not give it 4 stars because the items arrived dented and not packed as well as I would have liked to make the journey overseas not punctured but close. It was however shipped quickly and without delay. I have not tried the diet in any flavor other than cola and with  the significantly lower sugar count in the regular probably wont but wouldnt mind hearin how they are! Thanks for shipping to us folks overseas since the sodastream site will not and where they have international sites they will only ship the flavor varieties for each country! That doesnt help much for me!

review/summary: When grading on a curve, Via holds up.
review/text: I've tried both the Italian and Colombian Via varities, and while there's definitely a 'Starbuckiness' to both, neither is a substitute for the real thing. However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy.

review/summary: Only regret - expiration date
review/text: I don't use VIA packets frequently, but I like to keep them on hand. When I purchased the 12-pack decaf VIA packets in the Starbucks store, the best before date was at least a few months away. The 6-pack of 3-count packets which I received from Amazon has a best before date which is about 5 weeks away. I doubt I can use 18 packets in 5 weeks, but I also saved a good amount versus what I would have paid in the store. It's really a matter of individual usage. Perhaps many people use one packet every couple of days, but I usually don't need it that frequently.

Still prefer the Via Italian Roast... the Via French Roast is not any darker as you'd expect in the real coffee world, plus it has a tiny hint of a strange aroma/flavor.

review/summary: Fair Substitute for no local Starbucks
review/text: Overall I've been very pleased with Starbucks' VIA products.  I've only tried the Italian and Columbia varieties.  The convenience is a major factor, and it beats the pants off anything "instant" I've ever had before.  Great for backpacking.  The ability to do a 50-count bulk purchase is the way to go, though, as buying 3-packs locally is steep--but perhaps not so much when one considers the price of a cup of the real thing.  My only beef is that my most recent purchase had a "best by" date just 2.5 months away (a complaint I've seen others make).  I spoke with a Starbucks rep who claimed it was still going to be fine for some unspecified time beyond that date, that they'd take my return if desired, but that they couldn't promise that the date on whatever replacement shipped from the warehouse would be any further distant.  Kind of lame...but I'm going through it quickly enough that the question is probably moot.

We had a system of grinding our beans and doing a cup at a time with our coffee that we brought with us.  We ran out in the middle of not coffee country.  We did find a Starbucks and got some Via to tide us over.  It isn't the Americano my husband does for us at home, but it has become a good substitute when we are traveling.  Still love our own beans...but this is good.  Certainly not like any other instant I have tasted...much, much, much better.

review/summary: Surprisingly Fresh, Rich Coffee Taste for Instant, but Pricey
review/text: I am a devotee of freshly made espresso coffee every morning which I make at home with a vacuum espresso pot. The results are a very full-bodied, strong coffee(I use Costco's Kirkland brand Columbian Supremo) that I add just hot water and half and half to. Similar to a double shot Cafe Americano at an espresso bar.<br /><br />I am absolutely NOT a fan of Starbuck's overpriced and over roasted coffee. I also despise coffeemaker Folgers coffee, if I can avoid it! And other instant coffee tastes bitter and watery to me.<br /><br />However, these little packets are quick, pack anywhere--like a purse, glovebox or suitcase--and make a fascinatingly GOOD cup of coffee.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, on the strong side but no "Burnt" taste, and close to freshly brewed coffee as -- sheesh, it tastes like a fresh brewed cup. I am impressed. I add water and my half and half and it's better than good. I love Columbian coffee and this is the flavor I hoped for.<br /><br />Starbucks has done this right!<br /><br />The Downside: The cost is really an issue. I paid $5+ at Starbucks for a 3 pack. Then I got a 3 pack at Walmart recently for $2.99. This offer gets you more for about 80 cents each, but for instant? So I give the VIA coffee a 4 star rating even at the cheaper price.<br /><br />The quality is there though, so I plan to get some for my business trips out of town (no more running out for an expensive espresso) or as a backup in my purse. But I still use my espresso maker for my everyday cup.

review/summary: Better than other instant coffees...
review/text: I bought this when I saw that the price for 50 was much better than the price of the 8-pack or whatever in the SB store. I decided to give it a try. VIA coffee has a full flavor compared to other instant coffees, but it still isn't as good as a fresh cuppajoe. I love the convenience of these packages, since in my job, I don't always have time to go and find a cup of coffee. I can pour bottled water into my mug, pop it in the nuker, and then just pour the package into the steaming water. It also seems to be stronger than typical coffee, as far as the caffeine. All in all, I feel like I made a good choice. If I were you, and you were me, we'd be each other, and you'd know how I feel about the VIA coffee. I should mention here that I am NOT a huge fan of Starbucks coffee in general, but I was impressed with VIA. ONE COMPLAINT... the package. When you open the package, the opening is so narrow, that when you try to pour it into your steaming water, the steam makes the coffee powder get all sticky and clogs the opening. Other than that, I'm pretty happy with VIA. (But I'd rather have a nice fresh cup of french-press... or Dutch-press =))

review/text: Although this is one of the best instant coffees in the world, I second another review here. Although getting a bulk pack of 50 of this at less than $1/pack (cheaper than buying it a Strbux) the expiration is 6 months. So, unless you consume one of these at least 2-3 times per week - which I don't per se - watch out. Also, I shaved off a star bc of the poor packaging design of the individual packets. When you tear off the corner (the way they indicate where and how to open it)  the opening is still very small and a fair amount of powder is still left in the packet unless you shake it vigorously and make sure it all comes out, or simply chop off the top with a scissor.

review/summary: The perfect compromise: Drinkable instant coffee
review/text: Better than all other instants, as good as many brewed coffees, Starbucks VIA is a great balance between fast, easy and good.  Heat your water, tap the powder out of the tube into a cup, pour and stir.  No grinding, no filters, no mudding the beans; it's just as fast, and just as easy, and spooning crystals out of a jar.  But Starbucks VIA is far, far superior to any other kind of instant, and gives a lot of second rate brews a run for their money.  Is it as good as my best beans, freshly ground and brewed?  No.  But it's better than the coffee that comes out of Keurig packs, and better than the coffee from fast-food restaurants.  And it's instant.  Sometimes you'll want to take the time and trouble for the best possible cup of coffee; and sometimes you'll just want a dang cup of something hot, strong and black.  For those times VIA is a great choice.

review/text: This product gets a 4 star vs 5 star due to one little factor, bitterness. For the most part making a cup of coffee without a coffee maker couldn't be more easy or delicious, though I find that these Via Ready Brews (all flavors I've tried so far) have often a hint of a bitter after taste. Its not so bad that its undesirable, however, I'm sure that goes with having the ground micro-ground to produce your coffee as opposed to filtering through larger grounds to make coffee. I will say as for 'instant' coffee - this is one of the best I've had. Each flavor has a distinct aroma and taste. Doesn't quite replace a freshly brewed cup of coffee though.

review/summary: Great for coffee emergencies.
review/text: I am not generally big on instant coffee and this is still a little pricey, even in this package - but it tastes decent and is easy to carry. I like having a little something on me for when I really need it.

review/summary: Why pay more?
review/text: This coffee is THE BEST way to start your work day. The added bonus of not paying what you would pay at a Starbucks for essentially the same thing is an even better way to start your day :)<br /><br />Flavor: rich, bold and full-bodied. I've had other kinds of instant before and although I do prefer to use my moka pot for coffee, this makes a REALLY nice alternative.<br /><br />This coffee leaves no lingering aftertaste, the aroma is incredible and the taste is fresh brewed. You can't beat that! I keep stashes of these at work and in my handbag. Mmmm!

review/summary: Great!
review/text: I just tried the Columbia Medium and I am in LOVE! I was pretty skeptical of an instant coffee but found it at the grocery market for $1 for the package of 3. At first, I thought it was going to be way too strong and bitter but I was pleasantly surprised. It was smooth and full of flavor as if I just bought it fresh at the cafe. I added Truvia to it also and couldn't have had a better cup 'o joe. I am hooked!

review/summary: Other packings
review/text: Real great coffee ! But I suggest that the coffee be also brought out in bulk packings like cartons,cans or bottles in half,one or two pounds  for facilitating regular home usage.The current packing may be useful for travel and restaurant use only.

review/summary: Really bad packaging. Really good marketing
review/text: I travel a lot, often to places where nescafe (ugh) is high end. So my comfort was Via but the packaging is so irresponsible. So I experimented. I have now taken several multi-week trips with a plastic bag of  Bustelo Instant Espresso  measured out from a jar. I used it with just boiling water - or hot milk and water - its as good if not better than Via despite my snobby skepticism about preservation of taste. And I feel I am not adding as much  to a scary pile of non biodegradable waste. Starbucks says they care about environmental stuff but I'm not a crunchy and I can see how marketing has over-run ethic.

review/text: When my box arrived the product already was past the pull dated. . .  I got 200 vias not that are past the pull date.  I did not read anywhere on the purchase that i would be buying an inferior product.  I would not have purchased 200 if i had known they were all past the pull date. . .
