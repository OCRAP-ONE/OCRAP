review/summary: Couldn't be more pleased!
review/text: One reviewer  described The spice Lab Finely Ground Himalayan Salt  grains as being too  being large.  Not mine.  Mine  is finer than course kosher salt.<br /> I ordered a small package first to check it out and now I am ready to spring for a big one.<br /> It seems to take less salt,  it's easy to control with your "pinches", and it tastes great!<br /><br /> I love the consistency of this Himalayan.  It is in no way as fine as table salt but somewhere in between table and Kosher - leaning more to the Kosher.  Maybe half as fine as course Kosher.<br />  Some salts I have bought have just been too fine for me to predict how much salt I'm really adding.  I'm not good with really finely ground salts and end up over salting or under salting.<br /> I like to see each individual grain of salt if you will...and I can with this  Himalayan.<br /><br />I couldn't be more pleased and the price is good too.  Came in great shape nicely packaged...

review/summary: Best non-whey non-soy alternative
review/text: Edit: Upgraded to 5-star.  They appear to have changed the recipe, as the last couple containers I have acquired have tasted substantially better! It almost tastes like Swiss Miss cocoa (and while Swiss Miss is not really my idea of great cocoa, for a protein drink mixed with water, that is pretty good!)<br /><br />Summary: This is the best non-whey, non-soy protein I have found, and I would highly recommend it to anyone with soy+whey/dairy sensitivities! I rated this 4 stars, but if you can't have whey, it is definitely a 5-star product.<br /><br />I'm allergic to both whey and soy, which has made finding a good protein supplement quite a pain! I have tried pretty much everything on the market, including a variety of wheat, buckwheat, and brown rice proteins.  If you are looking for the highest quality protein available, you are unfortunately limited to egg, soy, whey, or casein (based upon PDCAAS, the FDA and FAO/WHO's method of determining protein quality), so egg is really preferable to the alternatives.  Fortunately, this is, in terms of consistency, digestibility, and nutritive content (0 fat 0 carbs), and overall flavor, the best of the various proteins I tried.  In case you are wondering, there is no cholesterol in this protein, either.  Texture and overall 'drinkability' are great... I drink it mixed with water with no issues.  Flavor is decent: obviously, none of us are drinking protein powder expecting a gourmet flavor extravaganza.  This protein is decently tasty if you like chocolate (not as good as most whey/casein proteins, but better than almost all non-whey proteins... I tried quite a few of those as well before discovering that I could not tolerate dairy proteins).  Be warned: the vanilla version of this product tastes terrible.  In my opinion, it is barely drinkable.<br /><br />Four stars overall.  If I had no food sensitivities, I might still use this in conjunction with whey protein, but would probably not use it exclusively.<br />Five stars if you can't have whey protein!<br /><br />I hope that this review is helpful!

review/summary: Egg Protein Review
review/text: I found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder. I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering. Before I get into my review, I might mention that I never thought of myself as whey or lactose intolerant, but after 3 months of taking quality whey protein I knew that what I was experiencing was not typical. (I'm talking about bathroom habits including frequency and consistency). I asked a few older guys in the gym what there experience was with whey, most if not all where fine with it and experienced no problems or side effects. One natural BB that is about my age late 30's suggested this egg based protein product and noted that one of his training customers found it to be an acceptable alternative to the milk based protein products.<br /><br />I did some research and to be honest the manufactures web site for beHealthyNFit is totally useless and outdated with little or no useful information. Their poor web site almost made me not buy this product. It sure didn't invoke any consumer confidence and in my opinion is totally unacceptable.<br /><br />How does it taste? I bought the chocolate (I'm not a chocolate lover but I think chocolate flavoring is the best option for protein powders) The flavor is chocolate but its defiantly not a rich milk chocolate and it wouldn't fall in the same category as a dessert. More of a taste that you can get used to.  I have also seen this flavor described as chocolate with a hint metallic. I'd agree with that. It has an after taste that some may find metallic.<br /><br />How does it mix? I mix this with water directly in a 16oz. ready to drink water bottle. I drink 1 or 2 ounces, usually down to the top of the label. Then I place a funnel in the top and dump in one scoop. Usually I will need to shake or tap the funnel to get the powder to pass through. Then I screw the top on and shake well. I have found that if the water is very cold the powder will clump more often and mix poorly. Room temperature water or water that is cool but not ice-cold works best. I use a wine fridge to keep the water at 50.( I don't like clumps) Note: The consistency is exactly like water, if your expecting this to be a thick or heavy drink then will be disappointed.<br /><br />I found that if you live in a humid state like Florida you will need to make sure that you screw the lid to the protein power on tight. If you expose this power to high humidity you will have a terrible time with it clumping and mixing properly.<br /><br />General tips for drinking protein drinks. I have found that eating a granola bar while drinking a protein drink helps. First biting the granola bar then taking a drink. I found this to work for me and it makes the occasional protein clump less noticeable.<br /><br />Is there room for improvement? Yes, loads of room for improvement. Is there anything better? I haven't found it yet but I am still looking. I will give this high marks until I find something better. Please leave a comment if you find a better non whey protein product.

review/summary: Superb when you can't take whey or even when you can
review/text: This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea...

review/text: I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found.

review/text: I've been a fan of HnF's egg protein for a while now as whey bloats me and gives me indigestion (that being said, the ONLY whey I've found that doesn't bother my stomach at all is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BOTGTM">Optimum Nutrition 100% Platinum Hydro Whey Turbo Chocolate 1.75 Protein</a>).<br /><br />The chocolate tastes pretty good with water (although I don't really care about taste), and is actually pretty darn good with rice milk. It also tastes good in smoothies (I use frozen bananas and rice milk).<br /><br />Only downside is you may get gas initially and you're going to smell things that no human should smell. This passes pretty quickly (huhuh) though.<br /><br />Oh and don't buy the vanilla flavored powder because it tastes like soap. I use it in smoothies and it lends a little vanilla flavor but it's still not very good.

review/summary: Low calorie, high protein, great taste
review/text: I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs.

review/summary: The Best Protein Out There
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best protein powder out there.<br />I've used a lot of different protein products, from Dymatize to Optimum Nutrition (Gold Standard) and CellTech (MuscleTech), BSN, many others as well.  The reason that I tried this one is because I've been doing a lot of research, talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general.  The conclusion that I have come to is that the whey products are ok, but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is.  Sure it is good, and the protein is not bad, but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy, whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product, and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there, many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency, while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these, this is precisely why whey is so cheap, and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive, but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture, I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used, and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of "Metabolic" whey that I tried, it is still sitting in the back room.

review/summary: Very good nutritionally, but expensive and clumpy
review/text: The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix

review/summary: A Protein Powder to make you Gag.
review/text: I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new "worst" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've tried a number of protein powders over the years.  Most problems I encountered ranged from poor taste, to not mixing well, to leaving me bloated.  The Healthy n Fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol, no fat, no carbs, minimal sodium (in the big scheme of things) and even some potassium.  Add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I don't feel bloated with this at all like I did with other products like Muscle Milk light.  I usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then I use it straight right after a good workout.  Again, it tastes great on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I strongly recommend this product.

review/summary: Best Natural Protein
review/text: Having a lactose intolerance, I've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some Whey Isolate proteins as well. This is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there. Vanilla and Chocolate are both delicious (I would stay away from Strawberry, it has a strange artificial taste to it, this was the updated formula too so they still haven't worked it out). I prefer to mix with some Vanilla Coconut milk and it's actually something I look forward to drinking (as opposed to some that I had just choked down as quickly as I could). I have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well.<br /><br />Another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame.<br /><br />If you can't handle Whey/Casein protein then I would absolutely recommend this one (even if you can but want to try something else). Best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good.

review/summary: TASTE ACTUALLY GOOD LOL, IM SHCOKED
review/text: I like this product, and i agree with any post, who says it mixes well, i bought a sample case just to test the waters, and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it, i think i feel my body is responding to it very well, i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over 30 for it, lol, but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase, i am going to stick with egg white protein, since i dont like eating them, everyone taste buds is different, some may like it, some may dont, then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites, some dont, but as for me personally i like it so far, might try out the strawberry passion protein, but the vanilla kind taste very good, i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes, or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups,

review/summary: SEEMS TO CONTAIN SOY?
review/text: I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR JAY ROBB EGG WHITE PROTEIN SHAKES, WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER BUT DOESN'T FIT MY BUDGET - TO EXPENSIVE FOR EVERY DAY USE.  I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AND CAME ACROSS THIS.  SINCE ONE OF THE REVIEWS SAID THAT IT WAS SOY FREE I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE TASTE WITH ALL OF MY HEALTH PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT A LOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.  IT JUST TASTE LIKE WATERED DOWN CHOCOLATE TO ME.  I DRINK IT WITH WATER OR SOMETIMES WITH RICE MILK BECAUSE I NEED THE EXTRA CALORIES ON DAYS THAT I CAN'T HANDLE SOLID FOODS.  HOWEVER,ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, IT DOES CONTAIN SOY. HOW MUCH I COULDN'T SAY AS IT WASN'T LISTED ON THE INGREDIGENT COLUMN.  I FOUND IT MENTIONED ON THE BACK OF THE LABEL STATING THAT IT CONTAINED SOY LETICHEN(THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT).  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH.  IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INFO. ALSO,I NOTICED THAT IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT $10.00 SINCE I PLACED MY ORDER LAST MONTH,SO IT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE, BECAUSE THAT PUTS IT ABOUT EVEN WITH WHAT I WAS PAYING FOR THE JAY ROBB EGG WHITE SHAKES.

review/text: So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint.

review/summary: Long lasting and QUIET entertainment for our dog...
review/text: After many years of calm, geriatric dogs that were long past their chewing (and playing) days, we added a 15-month old Weimaraner rescue to our house as 2012 started. He's adapting to life outside of the rescue home, and we're adapting the double-barreled threat of a high-energy breed and what can only be described as lingering puppy brain (in the full size body of a grown dog).<br /><br />There are toys for exuberant play (such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD57ZI">Kong Wubba</a>), and there are toys for quieter times, and to fully satisfy a dog's need to chew.<br /><br />First, the dog loves this chew. And when he engages with it, the result is an extended period of time when we does so in one place (very much unlike other toys, which generated motion and noise!).<br /><br />Second, it's odor and splinter free. We don't find pieces of it laying around, and it has no smell (at least to us two-legged critters).<br /><br />This was recommended to us by a local dog specialty store, and the research I've done indicates far fewer concerns about its safety compared with other chew options.<br /><br />Makes our dog happy and lets him turn down his motor a bit. What's not to like?

review/text: I decided to get this item for my new shelter dog.  He went through dog toys like mad and most dog chews would be swallowed whole, only to be puked up later on.  I was trying to find a product that he would get excited about chewing on and wouldn't be destroyed within minutes.  Boy did this fit the bill!  He has had it for well over a month now and has not even made his way through 25% of it yet.  It doesn't have a smell and it hasn't broke off into pieces.  I recommend this product to all my friends who have dogs and will be buying another one when the time comes!

My daughter says these antler bones are the only type that just last and last, and her dog gets a lot of chewing satisfaction.  These are natural antler bones which are "harvested" from the forest after being shed by a moose. Recommend highly, especially if your dog can chew most bones up in minutes.  These antler bones last for weeks!

The elk antler seemed to be less dense in the middle and didn't last quite as long as the deer antler before it did.  We've yet to see how the moose antler will stand up to time.  For the cost, I hope it lasts at least 1 1/2 months.  :-)

review/summary: Meets the needs of 6 fussy eaters
review/text: I have 11 rescue cats and 6 of them really like this food. Three of these guys have IBD which gave them chronic vomiting problems. I'm not a fan of raw food and I don't live in a large metropolitan area where I have lots of high-end choices. I don't like feeding my cats corn or wheat any more than I have to. I tried Felidae and no one ate it. I tried Blue Buffalo and no one ate it. I tried By Nature and a few would eat it. I tried Pet Guard and a few liked that but mostly my Chihuahua thought it was yummy. I tried Sensitive Stomach and most of them would eat it and some seemed to really like it! I still get the occasional digestive upset but only about 1/10th of what I used to see. I also feed Eagle Pak Holistic Chicken but I have to drive 40 minutes one-way to get that and the store doesn't keep it reliably in stock. Now I have 4 feeding stations using: By Nature, Pet Guard, Eagle Pak and Sensitive Stomach and every one is eating and thriving. Sensitive Stomach seems to be the favorite and I fill that bowl up about the same as the Eagle Pak but three times as often as the By Nature and Pet Guard. All my cats have fabulous coats and the two that don't have chronic diarrhea have firm stools. Now I would love to find a food that has extra Lysine and Dura-Lactin in it for my chronic Herpes carriers.<br /><br />I was horrified when Eukanuba stopped making Sensitive Stomach last year. When I heard the news I drove all over my city buying every bag I could find. I found 10 bags and that didn't last me through the drought. I was so glad to see it return to the shelves. Sensitive Stomach has a higher corn content than I would like but the cats that prefer it aren't overweight, aren't suffering from corn allergies, don't have trouble with diabetes and seem to be thriving, so I'm tolerating the corn content.

review/text: Since the last reviewer obviously loves Jolt, but mistakenly put down only one star, I thought I'd add my 2 cents.  The gum tastes good (the flavor doesn't last a long time, but that's not why I chew it), and definitely wakes me up - especially when I'm driving.  I hate coffee, so this is a good alternative.  If you've had a long day and already chewed  two to four pieces, it won't have the same kick.  But just to get through the day (like most coffee drinkers), this gum is great!  As a mom of five kids, I wish I had discovered this several years ago!

review/summary: I love this stuff
review/text: Jolt gum is a lifesaver. I've been chewing this stuff since I was in High School and, 5 years later, I'm still going. The 12 packs of Jolt last me over a year, but that's fine since they expire in one and a half. They're great to keep in your car, in backpacks, your desk at work, wherever. And just chew a piece when you need a little pick-me-up. One piece is perfect to wake you up when a professor or coworker is putting you to sleep with their presentation, or when you're working on a really monotonous project.<br /><br />The taste is alright, and you start liking it after a little while. Each pack comes with 12 pieces of gum per pack, and each piece has it's own compartment (like Dentyne Ice), so you don't have to worry about having loose pieces of gum floating around once you open it (like with other energy gums). All in all, this is a great buy. It's much easier and less obtrusive to chew a few pieces of this than to go grab a cup of coffee.<br /><br />One thing to note: the pack says that two pieces of gum have the same amount of caffeine as an energy drink. While this may be the case, two pieces of gum don't make you as hyper as an energy drink. Energy drinks also have taurine, guarana, loads more sugar, and plenty of other things to wake you up. This isn't a bad thing, though. It lets you control your energy level much easier.

There's a slightly noticeable bitterness to the flavor because of the caffeine, but it's not bad (and you get used to it quickly).

They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

review/text: Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!

review/summary: Techno-BEST
review/text: My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

I like my tea strong, and I find I can actually make about 1 and a half mugs of tea from each of these K-Cups, and still get a good strength. Another cheaper option is simply buying a box of the Tazo Awake tea bags and just use your Keurig to make the hot water for your tea, then just add a tea bag to it. But if you like using the K-Cups, you will be happy with the cup of tea these produce. I've used up about half of one of these boxes so far, and only once did I end up with any tea leave in my cup. There were just a few, and it only happened one time so far, so I think it's not that common an occurrence. It didn't affect the cup of tea at all, I just always check to see when I'm trying out new K-Cups how clear of a drink they produce. In all, Tazo has produced a better of a cup of tea than I've brewed from other brands of K-Cups, such as Twinings Earl Grey, which came out cloudy and weak.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the taste of this blend, it's a strong black tea with no real flavors to speak of. There's no citrus, no sweetness, nothing like that. If I was to compare it to coffee, it would be like a basic, black coffee with nothing added to it. Because of it's simple taste, this is a great anytime tea and a great replacement for coffee.

review/summary: Good green tea but skimpy on the bergamot flavor
review/text: The green tea itself is of good flavor and quality.  However, if I just wanted green tea, that is what I would have purchased.  For my taste buds, this green tea only has a "hint" of the bergamot flavor.  This company's jasmine green tea has the right amount of jasmine flavor and I love it.  I'd like to taste a little more bergamot flavor in their earl grey green tea.

review/text: It took me a long time to find a green tea that you could actually taste & had great flavor.  This is the one that fit the bill.  If you don't like a strong green tea flavor use a larger cup & walla 2 for 1.

review/summary: Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
review/text: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

review/summary: Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
review/text: These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!

review/summary: Bold BBQ taste that is not too spicy!
review/text: I love these Blue Diamond Almond snacks and I particularly like the bold flavors.  This flavor is very good and the smoky BBQ taste just sets off the flavor of the crunchy almond that it coats.  I like an evening snack while I read a book and these for me are just so much better than chips and other snack foods.  It gives you a chance to snack but still eat healthy.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat.

I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 7% of your daily intake of sodium and if you are on a salt restricted diet then make sure to watch your salt intake.  The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.<br /><br />This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!

review/summary: Crunchy almond treat with a sassy Jalapeno kick!
review/text: Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!

review/summary: A hot, bold and tasty snack!
review/text: I love Blue Diamond Almonds and this bold flavor gives you a spicy hot choice for a snack.  They are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and calcium while only being 170 calories for one serving.  They also add 3 grams of dietary fiber to your diet and 6 grams of protein while only adding 2 grams of sugar.<br /><br />They do contain 15 grams of fat but only 1 gram of saturated fat and 0 grams of trans fat. (Mostly they are the good stuff)  If you want a quick snack that is high in protein and low in sugar and sodium these are pretty good and spicy.<br /><br />While there are other flavors that I like more this one is still very good.  Just remember, they are addictive so you only get one serving!

review/summary: Great Flavor....
review/text: I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.

review/summary: Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting
review/text: The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.

review/text: I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the "bold" flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.

review/text: When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you.

review/text: The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.

review/text: I was concerned that these might be too hot, 'Habanero', but the heat is perfect as is the flavor... they are bold, if you like stuff plain--these are not for you... but if you like a robust flavor, a definite must!  Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend.
