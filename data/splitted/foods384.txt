review/summary: Best of the Best
review/text: The nutrition isn't the highest of all I've tried, but it's dang close.  The fiber content isn't the highest, but it's dang close.  The taste of these particular bars isn't the absolute best, but it's awfully close to the far less healthy bars.  I think I prefer the Almond flavored ones even more, and their taste is unbeatable, PLUS they're healthy (green wrapper ILO yellow).  To take a quick breakfast on the run, or just get a nutritious, fiber-filled snack, I recommend these Kashi bars far and away more than Fiber One, Kellogs, Quaker, Luna (yes, I know I'm not supposed to eat Lunas), Clif, Special K and Carnation, and probably a half-dozen others I can't remember that I've tried because I only tried them once ...  I think Kellogg's Smart Choice cereal would do well against these bars nutritionally, but the bars win the taste category, hand's down.  I buy these in boxes of 24 of each flavor, Peanut, Chocolate Chip, and Almond from Sam's Club now.  They rock!

review/summary: won't order again
review/text: I was looking for a replacement for Odwalla Chocolate Chip Peanut bars and tried these. I'd go back to the Odwalla Bars in a flash which have whole peanuts and whole choc chips. These bars are more like stale rice cripsy bars with a chocolate coated bottom. They are very hard (i.e. like they are stale)and do not have much of a peanut taste. Besides, they have too high a percentage of soy, but I was desperate (sigh).

review/summary: Fairly good tastye, although not as good as the chocolate
review/text: I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein. First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious. They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal. Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein. Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12). While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein. The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well. Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.<br /><br />Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried. As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either. Below is the main nutritional info:<br /><br />Calories 180<br />Total Fat 5g<br />Sat fat 2g<br />Sodium 250mg<br />Carbs 30g<br />FIBER 6g<br />PROTEIN 9g

review/text: Since these bars are always sold out at my local store, I've been buying them in bulk at Amazon.  But now they are NOT AVAILABLE??

Therefore, I guess I will be onto other web sites looking to buy these Chocolate Peanut ones.  Oh, Amazon, you have failed me!

review/text: I like the flavor of this product and it's a great way to eat salt without eating too much of it. The one caveat here is that you don't pour extra salt on to compensate for the lower strength of the flavor. This may sound silly if you haven't tried it, but it's very easy to catch yourself pouring more on which is just as bad as eating regular salt.

review/summary: Organic chia seeds: great nutritional profile
review/text: Nutiva raw, certified-organic, non-GMO chia seeds are a great low-carb, gluten-free, omega-3 containing, high-fiber source of protein.  When added to a liquid, after 5 minutes, chia thickens the liquid to a thin tapioca-like consistency while the tiny tan-to-brownish-grey seeds, which look like shiny, slightly elongated, flattened poppy seeds, develop a clear gel coat and stay crunchy. Chia seeds can also be added to baked goods, porridges, and smoothies. When eaten straight from the package, the chia seeds are crunchy, for the most part flavorless, and become slippery with a faint seedy, bitter finish, which is minimally noticeable if added to foods.<br />The Nutiva chia seeds received were in resealable, opaque, metallicized packages with a "packed on" date of 6/22/2010 and a "best before" date of 6/2012.  Great value 2-pack with Amazon Free Shipping.<br /><br />Nutritional facts on label: 1 tbsp = 60 calories (25% from fat),  3 g fat, 5 g total carb (5g dietary fiber=0 net carbs), 3 g protein, sodium 0 mg, potassium 60 mg<br />Of note, Nutiva chia seeds are a product of Ecuador

review/summary: #1 Superfood
review/text: Nutritional benefits of Chia seeds are amazing. Here are a few to start:<br /><br />*According to studies, Chia possesses the highest percentage of the polyunsaturated fatty acids(linolenic and linoleic) of all crops. Chia seeds contain 60% omega 3 fatty acids.<br /><br />*The protein content of Chia is higher that other nutritional grains. Unlike other grains, it is a complete protein, meaning that it has the appropriate balance of all essential amino acids. About 19 to 23% of chia seeds weight is protein.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are high in fiber, a 15 gm serving of chia seeds will provide 4 to 5 gm of fiber. Our body requires at least 35 gm of fiber a day to stay healthy.<br /><br />*Chia seeds contain boron which is essential for bone health.<br /><br />*Chia seeds are rich in calcium, about 2 oz of chia seeds contains 600 mg of Calcium, as compared to 120 mg for a cup of milk.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 2 times more potassium than banana.<br /><br />*Chia seeds have 3 times more antioxidants than blueberries<br /><br />Regardless of the astonishing nutritional values of Chia seeds, it also tastes very good. My girlfriend and I make a big pot of "steel cut" oatmeal at night (the quick way is throw a cup of oats in 4 cups of boiling water and just let it sit overnight), put in a good helping of Chia seeds, and the next morning you have a wonderful breakfast that could last all week depending on how many people are eating it. Feel free to add a little cinnamon, peanut butter, fruit, or your own oatmeal favorite additions.<br /><br />There are many other recipes for eating Chia, but oatmeal is my personal favorite.  I started eating Chia last year after reading the NY Times Bestseller 'Born to Run' about how a tribe of Mexicans that eat Chia will drink beer, smoke tobacco, and then run up to 500 miles in a footrace the following days.  One of the primary contributors to the tribal Mexicans' seemingly supernatural physical ability is that their diet is full of the nutrient-rich Chia seeds. I haven't put in 500 miles.  But after previously failing to finish a 26-mile marathon without chia in my diet, I added chia to my diet and my knees allowed me to finish my first 26-mile marathon!  Could the chia seeds have helped?  I think so.  I certainly had more energy and my joints felt better my second attempt at a marathon when "on" the chia.<br /><br />I started out paying an arm-and-a-leg at Whole Foods for Chia seeds, but have since started buying them on Amazon for a fraction of the price. Buy some Chia seeds and make a delicious bowl of oatmeal for one of the healthiest breakfasts possible.

review/text: I have tried out only two forms of chia seeds and I would have to say the texture of this one is by far the best.  The other two I have tried either still remained grainy/cold pressed and just felt them go down my throat.  But the texture on how these chia seeds smoothing out when mixed with liquid is the best.  Mixed with solid foods also doesn't give away any taste on how I may have cooked my meal.  I don't mind the small crunchiness and sprinkle them on just about everything I eat. Its great, I love them!

review/summary: Chia Fresca
review/text: The zip lock packaging makes it easy and convenient to use and store without spillage. The Chia is fresh and adds no taste. I use it to make Chia Fresca.  It's very hydrating and supplies me with sustained energy for hours. In a large blender carafe I blend for 30 seconds on low speed; 4 heaping tablespoons of chia, with 4 cups of distilled water, 1 peeled and seeded lemon, 10 drops vanilla stevia, and a few sprigs of fresh mint. After blending for 1 minute I let the mixture sit for 15 to 30 minutes and absorb the water and turn into a gel. I then blend the gel at high speed until it's smooth.  It tastes great and is good for you. Chia absorbs 10 times it's volume in water and can be dehydrating if you don't consume it with enough water.

review/text: I had bought pre-bottled drinks with chia seeds in them before, but didn't realize I could make them myself! If you soak these in water (or another liquid, we use milk) for about 15 minutes, they become somewhat gelatinous. They add a fantastic texture to any drink, from smoothies to coffee. They are even delicious in hot cocoa. In addition, they are healthy! I was looking for ways to up my fiber intake when I found these. In addition to adding fiber, they add a little protein, too.

review/text: I read the most negative & positive reviews before ordering this product. I have found not one single tiny pebble (in two bags) as mentioned in the negative reviews. What I have found is tiny, very resistant to hydrate/soften CHIA SEEDS. That's it, nothing less and certainly nothing more. I've only used mine for smoothies for a creamier consistancy; no puddings or hot cereals. But, in my smoothies, they are wonderful! Chia seeds add a little more thickness, lots more fiber & other proteins, vitamins & minerals that add that little extra boost of "good for you". The seeds when fully hydrated, remind me a little of tiny tapioca pearls (think bubble tea) with a slight crunch or bite, mouth feel to them. Unusual at first, but easy to get used to & actually quite nice once you're accustomed.

review/text: I love mixing chia seeds in with my apple juice, grape juice, or any kind of fruit juice. Just add some of the seeds into your cup and pour your favorite juice. Let the seeds soak for about 15 minutes and it will thicken slightly and the seeds soften up. The seeds are easy to drink and do not change the taste of the drink only makes the drink slightly thicker, more smoothie like almost. Chia seeds do have a slight nutty flavor, but doesn't really transfer to the juice. Chia seeds can be added to smoothies also or yogurt, oatmeal, very versatile product that's good for you.

The seeds are EXTREMELY FRESH and have an expiration date for about 10 months.  I'm using it daily with a few bottles of water and feel great taking it.  There is barely a taste and the gelled up seeds are extremely palatable.  I would recommend anyone who wants to add Chia to their diet to really consider this brand because it's a premium product.

review/text: These are a good alternative to chicken eggs. I soak 2 tbs. in 1/2 to 3/4 c. water for about 15 min. or till they're really gelatinous like an egg, then add them to baked goods recipes. They help moisten and bind gluten free baked goodies. 4 stars is because they're a bit bitter tasting (not too noticeable if mixed with molasses or honey though).

review/summary: got chia?
review/text: I'm a 27 year old girl who has been looking into alternative ways to live cleaner. I've incorporated cleaning with vinegar and cooking with coconut oil. Chia seeds were something I stumbled on to by accident and haven't looked back since! The easiest way I get some into my diet is by putting a scoop into a regular water bottle, letting it sit for ten minutes, a quick shake and you're good to go! I've incorporated Nature's Guru instant coconut water packets into my routine and the result is I can chug the whole thing and enjoy it. The benefits I've noticed is extreme regularity. You won't be irregular after two days of adding chia. It's a good thing for you to be ridding your intestines of all wastes. My lower stomach is flatter by virtue of everything fast tracking through. Chia seeds have many benefits which I won't get into here. They are like sesame seeds in shape and poppy seeds in color and texture. They will form a gel around them after being exposed to water and this is what will clean you out. I caution you from sprinkling them onto dry foods because they need moisture and will seek it from your insides if you're not sufficiently hydrated. Bear in mind to be sufficiently hydrated you should take your body weight and cut it in half and drink that in ounces, for example: 160 lbs is 80 ounces. For novice chia users try mixing it into juice or your favorite flavored drink. Shaking will distribute the gelled seeds the best. Stirring might produce uneven clumps that may turn you off. I hope this convinces someone to try chia. Taking care of your body is definitely the way to go.

review/summary: Chia is Great, but prices going up way too fast due to popularity
review/text: The short and sweet of it:<br />Chia seeds are very healthy.<br />Chia seeds can be added to just about any foods & recipes (tastes a little like nutty cracked pepper).<br />I trust and like Nutiva brand because they offer quality as well as full disclosure of where & when their products were packaged/harvested.<br />The price of Chia Seeds has gone up as much as 300% in the last 18 months due to popularity and is expected to rise even more very soon.<br /><br />I add them to my husbands meat dishes to give him the added nutrients and antioxidants he does not get otherwise.<br />I add them to just about all foods I eat, just a little in everything. I sprinkle them over Salads and Veggies like cracked pepper.<br /><br />I've added Chia Seeds to the following recipes/foods with great results:<br />Oatmeal<br />Meat Loaf & Meatballs (regular meat or tofu)<br />All Sauces & Gravies<br />Ice Creams, Sherbets, Sorbets<br />Soups<br />Scrambled Eggs & Omelets<br />Bread Crumbs<br /><br />I also sprinkle over Salads, Meats, and Veggies like cracked pepper.<br /><br />Use just a little and you can barely taste them (good for a start).<br />Use a bit more and it will have a nutty peppery flavor.<br />For example, I have to mix at least 1/2 cup of Chia seeds per 7 pounds of ground meat before my husband will even begin to taste it.<br />Keep in mind the idea of eating Chia seeds is not so much for the flavor as it is for the nutrients.<br /><br />If you grind the Chia seeds to a powder (using a coffer grinder or similar) this will release the nutrients and give you more benefit from them.<br /><br />Studies have shown adding Chia seeds to your daily diet can help fight cancer, boost your immune system, and flush toxins from your body.<br /><br />For those who want to (or need to) eat a grain-free diet, Chia seeds are not considered to be a true "cereal" grain, and therefore is an acceptable "grain" or seed to eat if you're on a Paleo or similar diet.<br /><br />Chia seeds are high in protein (it's a complete protein), omega 3 fatty acids, calcium, boron (for bone health), fiber, potassium, and antioxidants.

review/text: Let me share my reaction and compare it to my friend's reaction because we have very different eating habits and lifestyles. We both had a terrible reaction to this product and we both used it sparingly.<br /><br />I eat low-carb and have a sensitivity to sugar (insulin resistance), so I need good fiber in my diet. I eat raw and cooked vegetables and so I thought I could handle sprinkling some chia seeds in my plain yogurt once daily. What a mistake. I had a reaction that would have been humiliating if it happened outside the house. Good thing the bathroom was only a few feet away.<br /><br />My friend eats low-fat and is a personal fitness trainer. She eats very clean, high fiber, and she used this product sparingly as well. Her body's reaction wasn't as volitile, but she still felt pain and discomfort.<br /><br />If you want the benefits touted by the marketing of this product, I suggest you proceed with caution and do it over a few days where you won't be in a place where you can't get to a toilet within seconds.

review/summary: The ONLY way to make coffee
review/text: I use the Natural Brown, 2 cup Melitta filter paper and a Melitta cone to make the best coffee this side of anywhere. Of course, it is necessary to use the best coffee, and that can only be found at Peet's. The coffee must be ground very fine, and since I like strong coffee, I use two scoops to make one cup.<br />OK, here's the rest of the drill: First insert the filter paper in the cone, position it over the cup and fill with hot water. The hot water rinses the filter and preheats the cup. Next, add two scoops (or one and a half if you like your coffee weaker)and lightly tamp it down to pack it but do not tear the filter. Pour the hot water out of the cup. Replace the filter and coffee over the cup and add a small amount of hot water, wetting the grounds. DO NOT USE BOILING HOT WATER! Boiling hot water dissolves acids and makes the coffee bitter. The water temperature should be about 180 to 190 Fahrenheidt. After the first bit of water had drained into the cup, add more water.<br />Even if you have been used to adding sugar to your coffee, please try it without. There will be no bitterness and in fact, you can make the coffee stronger than you ever imagined and there'll be no bitterness.<br />You are welcome!

review/summary: Sometimes simple is better
review/text: We have come to the conclusion that making our coffee one cup at a time is so much better than a big bitter pot sitting and simmering. So we bought the Melitta coffee cones and use these filters. Although the #2 filters are made for the cones, I wish they were just slightly taller. You have to be careful not to overfill the filter with water. For this reason, I sometimes buy the #4 filters and trim them down a bit. In case you're thinking of buying the bleached white filters, I have two filter cones and tried them side by side with one white filter and one brown. The brown filters are MUCH faster and do not tend to clog up like the white ones do. Just an FYI.

review/summary: Clearly the best choice
review/text: My local grocer doesn't carry the Melitta brand unbleached coffee filters.  When I have asked him if he could, he says the demand isn't great enough to give them shelf space.  Yes, the Melitta unbleached coffee filters do cost a little more, but then if the end result is a much better cup of coffee why wouldn't someone pay the extra 1/2 cent or less for a better cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have used the unbleached coffee filters from Albertsons Or Krogers and they do not make as good a cup of coffee.  The competition's filters are thinner allowing the water to run through more quickly resulting in a weaker cup of coffee.  I think Melitta has this figured out and has gone the extra mile to produce the best cup of coffee available.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it.  Using the cone system and the unbleached coffee filters allows an individual to make the best cup of coffee allowable with the coffee beans of your choice.  I am not going to waste  my time explaining why the other systems for producing a cup of coffee are less desirable.  I bought two orders containing a total of 1200 coffee filters to get the free shipping.  Since I only drink one or two cups a day, that should last me almost three years.  The big saving for me is that I will not have to chase all over town trying to find filters every time I run out.  If the locals don't want to carry the Melitta brand, they are going to lose out to anyone and everyone who is internet savy and knows that Amazon carrys the Melitta brand.  This is just another example of our changing times and should be a lesson to the local merchants.  Get your act together or your going to be out of business.  Every sale you lose to the internet is dollars taken out of the community that will never be spent in your store.

review/text: Melitta invented this style of filter, so they're the standard to be judged by.  I'm glad I bought this particular quantity (600 filters) because it will be a long time before they run out.  I like some of the competitions filter idea of having a tab at one side so they're easier to open, but it's still not much of a problem.  I love my coffee and know that these filters will work better than any other for delivering the best coffee I can buy and grind.  It can't make cheap coffee better, but it will make the best coffee you can get out of what you put in.  Read some of the online sites about how to brew the best cup, because it's worth your time.

review/text: Here's a fun science experiment that you can try at home.<br /><br />Pour nearly-boiling water into this filter without coffee (just water) using a filter holder (such as the ones by Cilio or Melitta) and then look at the results in a cup. Notice that:<br /><br />1) The water is slightly brown<br />2) The water smells like the filter - some of the filter's "flavor" has gone into the water that went through it<br /><br />If you brew coffee using this filter you probably won't notice this because the coffee flavor and color is strong enough to overpower these two issues.<br />However, a filter's job is to remove impurities, not add them.

review/summary: Good for One Use
review/text: I like to brew myself a single cup of coffee every once in a while. I have the Melitta filters and a plastic cone holder. I place both on top of a coffee cup and pour in the hot water. This method works well once. If you plan to have a second cup of coffee, add a touch more coffee grounds, and run through another round of water, it will not work well. The flow is blocked and slow. Even if you move around the grounds with a spoon, the drip is too slow to warrant a second use.<br /><br />So these are good once. If you want to save on waste and cut down on your garbage creation, pick another method.<br /><br />I visited their website and couldn't find any information on their annual donations to forest conservation. I did eventually find them listed as a corporate partner (AKA donor) on the American Forests . org website. It's nice to see companies giving back to the environment.

We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AXU99E">TORANI LIME 750 ML</a> and other flavors all the time - but the watermelon is going out the door.

review/summary: DONT buy this product!!!
review/text: I love Watermelon! At work one day, a friend offered me a Dunkin Donuts Watermelon coolatta. I didnt think I would care for a slush drink - but it was fantastic and soon, I was buying one every day. I have a home snow cone and slushy maker, so I went in search of a good Watermelon Syrup.<br /><br />I tried Monin, Torani, DaVinci, and Best Bargain brands Watermelon syrup. Let me warn you so you dont waste your money like I did - DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. #1, not even one of these products contains ANY Watermelon. They are all basically the same with Sugar, Lemon juice, Melon flavoring (NOT Watermelon), and red dye. NOT one single bit of Watermelon in any of them. #2, They dont taste even remotely like Watermelon, and in fact all but Best Bargain have disgusting taste to them. I tried various quantities of the syrup from very little to a lot - and either way, they taste horrible! #3, you can EASILY make your own delicious Watermelon syrup. There are a number of recipies on the web. Some require rendering (boiling down) but you dont have to use those to get a very good homemade, TRUE tasting syrup.<br /><br />Avoid these products like the plague!!!<br /><br />Note - Dunkin Donuts does not seem to sell their syrup, however you can go to their web site and click the "Contact Us" button and send them a note that you would like to purchase their syrup (if you like it - and it is the best) and if you have a local shop, you can ask the manager if he/she wouldnt mind buying an extra one for you!<br /><br />Otherwise, make your own! Its the only way to get good taste. However, these products, Monin, Torani, DaVinci and Best Bargain are horrible and while they look like transmission fluid - I will wager THAT tastes better!

review/summary: Tastes Pretty good and helps fill you up in the morning.
review/text: I started eating this about 2 weeks ago (around July 24, 2010). The smell is a nice vanilla, but the taste and texture took a little getting used to. The first day I tried it, I thought is was a bit grainy and watery with too mild of a taste. Then, around my third morning of trying it, I found that I actually started to like it! I do think it is fairly filling, but I don't eat it alone. I always have at least a piece of fruit (or cup of berries) with it plus a coffee with 1TBSP of half-and-half. Sometimes I also have a poached egg (in microwave). All those together leave me satisfied for about 3 hours (with or without the egg).<br /><br />Since I've been eating the Kashi Hot Cereal fairly consistently, I decided to see how it would be to have cold cereal instead. So one morning I had 1.5 servings of Puffins cereal with 1/2 cup of skim milk and a piece of fruit. I was definitely hungry in about 60-90 minutes. I've been really focusing on paying attention to my hunger as I try to lose weight, and 60-90 minutes is not a long enough period for me. So I've been sticking with the hot cereal more often than cold cereal now.<br /><br />On a side note, in the past 2.5 weeks, I've lost about 11 pounds eating this for breakfast (but I changed ALL my eating habits, so don't conclude it was the hot cereal alone that did it! I also started eating ~5-6 serving of fruits and vegetables a day, eating high fiber foods, very little processed foods, almost no foods with sugar added, etc).  Also, due to back problems, I have not been able to exercise at all during this time - so it really was just changing my eating habits that led to the weight loss.<br /><br />I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars because while I think I kinda like it now, it's not that great tasting and the texture is still a bit funny. I will continue to purchase this product because I do like that it is filling (when I also include fruit) and high in fiber and protein (7g and 9g respectively).

review/summary: Please Stop Calling It Oatmeal!
review/text: I despise oatmeal.  This is absolutely NOT oatmeal.  That's why I can stand to eat it.  Not only that, it's actually delicious.  You can taste the vanilla - and I love vanilla.  I have a feeling those who found it disgusting probably didn't follow directions and tried simply pouring boiling water over the product - whereas it specifically says to microwave it.<br /><br />Normally I wait till I've actually purchased a product from Amazon before reviewing it - and I intend to order it as soon as I'm finished with the review.  But, after reading a few of these One-Star reviews, I just had to put in my two-cents.  This is a wonderful hot cereal - and, believe me, that's saying something!  Most hot cereals are hideous.<br /><br />I'm just glad I found it on Amazon because the one grocery store in my area that carried it doesn't have it anymore (I probably bought the last box).  The texture is probably closer to something like Ralston (if anyone remembers that) than it is to any kind of oatmeal-related concoction.  So, yeah, if you're into oatmeal, avoid this like the plague.  But if you're into something a little different - i.e., having flavor without being chock full of sugar - than you might like this.

review/summary: Tender, juicy, tasty!
review/text: I love these little steaks. I butterfly them on the grill and they come out perfect everytime. No fat. I find the shipping a bit pricey but if you buy more than one item from Omaha, the shipping cost stays the same so I did actually save $$. I do not buy meat from the grocery store anymore. I am hooked on all their products!!! Even their chicken is great, no muscle or fat, just a perfect breast.

review/summary: Great tasting steaks
review/text: I received 4 of these in my first ever order from OS. I was excited to try the top sirloins more than anything. I let 1 thaw out overnight, threw some salt and pepper on each side and put it on the Foreman grill for 10 minutes or so on medium high the following night. Turned out being delicious. Very tender, juicy and flavorful and that's even after the bag I was letting the steak thaw out in became almost half full with melted thawed out juices. I expected all flavor to be lost, but nope. The steak even kept its shape and didn't shrink all that much if at all. Overall, I'm pleased and I would recommend them. Just make sure you look at the sizes correctly. These were 4 oz, so if you're someone that likes to sit infront of a big huge steak, order a bigger size. To me, 4 oz is the perfect size portion for a steak. And people saying the quality of OS steaks are the same as supermarket meat...I just don't see it. Now, I don't have all THAT MUCH experience buying steaks from mainstream supermarkets, but I have done so from time to time over the years, mainly buying Lancaster brand steaks. But these OS top sirloins were far tastier, juicer and tender then any steak I've ever purchased or eaten that came from a supermarket. They might be "select" but I highly doubt a select steak from say a Walmart for example, would be anywhere near as good. These seem to be "high end" selects...if that makes any sense, lol. OS marketing suggests these are the same quality that you'd get at say a Ruths Chris steakhouse, but obviously that's just a marketing gimmick, which OS is all about. Overall, I would gladly eat these OS top sirloins again though as long as they were part of a nicely priced combo package. That's the key to ordering from OS. Wait for deals, low priced shipping, free gifts, etc. Are they overpriced? I guess so.  But to me, you're also paying for the simplicity and convenience of having frozen food shipped to your front door within a matter of days that you can stock your freezer up with.
