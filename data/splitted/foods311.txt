review/summary: Best Beef Jerkey and great price
review/text: I've had a lot of different types of jerky and this is clearly the best.  First of all the price is unbeatable for the amount of jerky you get (3/4 lb).  Also the jerky is incredibly fresh and tender, so you don't end up chewing on the same piece.  The flavor is also very good.  Bottom line is that I finished the bag in 2 days, and I will be re-ordering as soon as it is back in stock.  Highly Recommended!

review/summary: okay but not tasty
review/text: Bought this because the price is cheap but have good review.<br /><br />Pros: To some degree, this brand is tender than most other brands. The meat seems fresh. Better than some brand which looks like having been sitting in the warehouse for centuries...<br /><br />Cons: The tasty is not fantastic, just so-so. The most I don't like is that it tastes kind of sour. If a brand is tasty, you will just keep eating piece by piece until you are full. But for this brand, I am not desired to eat more than three pieces because of the sour.<br /><br />If you prefer tender and don't care about the sour, you have try this.

review/text: I've had horrible jerky and I've had amazing jerky... this jerky was just barely above average at best. The flavor was decent with a small hint of sweetness and a kick of black pepper and the texture ranged from a gentle chew to full on solid rock.<br /><br />To be honest, I feel like I've pampered my jerky tastes with Taste Of The West to compare to other jerkys.If you can, save your money and go for the higher quality stuff.<br /><br />TL;DR: You get what you paid for, cheap jerky tastes like its value.

review/text: I ordered this jerky because it was the best price per pound and I had never had Brown Sugar Jerky.  It was surprisingly good.  The jerky was not too dry and didn't have an overly sweet taste.  I would recommend this as an option on road trips or as a snack that increases your daily protein intake.  I have even added this to Amazon's program that automatically sends it to you each month.  I definitely got my money's worth.

review/summary: Tough as leather
review/text: This stuff is as tough as leather. I love jerky and of course I've tried jerky that is tough before but this stuff I literally could barely get my teeth through it. I thought I was going to have to microwave it in some water to soften it.<br /><br />I checked and made sure it was in date and that the packaging wasn't broken anywhere to let air in. Bag was in perfect condition and was well within expiration date.<br /><br />The taste was just average. I would never buy this again. It wasn't just this flavor. I also had a bag of the same brand but a different flavor and it was exactly the same.<br /><br />Worst jerky I have ever had, by far. I bought it because it is a little cheaper than Jack Link's jerky but I would much rather pay a little more and get jerky that is actually edible.

review/summary: Coffe shop quality capuccino at home
review/text: I love coffee. Usually I would not recommend Maxwell House as I consider it a "supermarket brand". I was very surprised with the quality of this cappuccino. My wife loves it too!<br /><br />Contrary to instructions, we brew milk first then the espresso, this makes it look very nice, especially on a transparent cup. The taste is smooth and velvety, with low acidity and aftertaste. You can buy extra espresso T-Discs separately and brew an extra shot if you really like your coffee bold (like I do).<br /><br />In about a minute, you have a cappuccino that is as good as that of many coffee shops. Yes, it is not nearly close to making my personal list of best coffees I have tested, but you can't beat the convenience and cost. We also use it a lot to entertain guests at our house. Works great with any dessert.<br /><br />Instead of buying them one box for 6 coffees at a time, this 5-pack from Amazon really saves us money. Each set comes with 16 T-Discs: 8 espresso and 8 milk. So this 5-pack will be good for 40 cappuccinos.

review/summary: Very,Very Good
review/text: This cappuccino is very good and tastes almost as good as Starbucks Latte Primo, T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers, 8 Count Packages (Pack of 2). The cream foams up well in the Tassimo machine. The only difference in taste between this Cappuccino drink and the Starbucks Latte Primo is that the coffee flavor is slightly stronger in the Starbucks product. Also, with the Cappuccino you brew the coffee first and then use the milk disc. With the Starbucks Latte Primo you brew the milk first then the coffee.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a bargain buy. As long as you are not looking for a slightly stronger coffee flavor, I'd suggest purchasing this instead of the Starbucks brand as both products use expresso coffee and milk discs.

review/text: Our kitty is spoiled she gets tuna, lunch meat, wet food, dry food and once in a while a little ice cream. :) But her all time favorite thing has to be temptation treats(all flavors). She will sprint across the house when I get home, jump on the bed and wait for her treats to be delivered. We were worried she was overweight but the vet says she's in great health and a little "fluff" is to be expected on a house cat.

review/text: All of our cats love this product, they anticipate it actually, and meow and meow until served! We've tried other products but have had limited success and repeatedly been surprised by gooey blobs of purged hairballs.  Since using Whiskas we have not had one cat purge a hairball and I am grateful, truly. I would love it if they would come in bulk, on our first shipment, none of the zip locks on the bags worked.  This second shipment seems better but I'd still rather empty them all into a larger container than deal with the zip lock.

review/summary: Really works for hairballs!
review/text: Since we have been following the package directions that say to feed 10 treats at one time, our cat rarely throws up at all and her stools are plumper. She has always had tiny, hard stools until we started feeding her these treats. We can tell by her stool if she hasn't had a 10 treat dose in a couple of days. She eats these as readily as any other packaged treat we give her. A great find as cleaning up grassy vomit almost every day was getting quite tedious! The auto ship feature is also a big plus. We can't always get these treats here on our island when we need them. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: My Cats Love These
review/text: Specifically they love this flavor.  I've taught them to do tricks using these treats because the cats want them so much that if they can figure out what I'm asking, they do it to get the treat!  But they are smart boys.<br /><br />I don't like some other treats because they are as small as kibble.  These are big enough for me to hold between two finger tips while the cats take them.<br /><br />My cats ask for these each night around treat time.  One of my cats eats dry food almost exclusively (no canned food, no meat scraps, etc) and he is often the first to ask for these treats.

review/summary: The only treats my cat will eat
review/text: So my Mom often buys bags of kitty treats for her "grandkitten"... and I find it so hilarious that if it isnt the Temptations treats in the yellow bag, he will NOT touch them. We can mix different brands together in a pile, and he will pull the Temptations treats out with his paw and leave the others. Its unreal. Either they just hit the jackpot with the perfect cat-seducing ingredients, or they have some sort of addictive substance in them.... who knows! :) I only give them 4 stars because they are not the "healthiest" treat for a cat, but honestly... he just loves them so much I cant say no.

review/text: I can make my cats do the silliest things to get these. I like to put cardboard boxes around the living room and toss treats into them at random. The cats will leap into the boxes, gobble the treat and then leap out waiting to hear where the next one will go. It's pretty dang entertaining. They sure don't do this for anything else. Something about these treats drives the cats crazy and I love it.

review/summary: Maybe too good, cats don't want anything else!
review/text: We occasionally feed a couple stray cats as they are good at keeping the mice and snakes away. Once in awhile we will give them some of these Temptations Cat Treats and they are crazy about them! They will only eat the regular cat food if their efforts at getting more of the Temptations Treats doesn't work. One of them will sit at the door and meow and meow but eventually goes and eats the regular food. We have tried all the different varieties of Temptations Treats and they don't have a preference, they like all of them. If you want something to really great to give your cat, try any variety of the Temptations Cat Treats but be prepared for your cat to start begging for these all the time. The one thing we cannot tell is how good nutritionally these are for cats, the package says 100% nutritionally complete but not sure what that means in this case. Even if you could feed a cat these alone, that would be way too expensive so for now I will balance a few treats with regular varieties of dry cat food.

review/text: My big Tuxedo cat loves these no end.  She will do tricks to get them and if offered she will eat them in large quantity.  My white cat MAY eat a couple if I don't ask to much attention in the process, otherwise he doesn't bother.  I don't know what the difference is but I like them because they don't stink and are easy to regulate piece by piece.

review/summary: Excellent cat treats
review/text: I've been buying cat treats for many years. Of the brands and types that are still on the market, I find that Whiskas Temptations is the one treat that all cats love. They come in several flavors. My cats like the Hearty Beef and Turkey flavors best. Pricing can be an issue as I have noticed continual price increases in this product for the last few years. Shop around and get them where you find the best price. Currently, the best price is about $1.35 per 3 oz. bag. But I,ve seen them at prices up to around $2 per bag.

review/summary: Cat's are fickel
review/text: My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever.

We tried every cat treat we could find and many large animal supply (and small) chain stores and neither Chester or Pumpkin would have anything to do with them except turn up their nose and walk away.  Then we came on "Temptations".  Now, unfortunately, they whine for them all day.  But, loving parents as we are, they usually get them.  An inexpensive and tasty treat.  They get the best food, and now thanks to "Temptation" the best treats.  All they need to get now is a JOB!

review/text: My 4 month old kitten usually eats another variety of Whiskas Temptations (Chicken Flavor Dentabites, which he LOVES!), but he's gotten into the habit of eating my hair that I've shed and that's fallen on the floor(gross, I know), so I decided to get him this hairball control variety of Whiskas Temptations.  The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.  I didn't notice this until after I bought and opened the package.  Hopefully, they'll stay fresh for another 2 months.

review/text: So my cat loves these things. She practically hisses at me at random times and jumps on the counter throws the bag on the floor and starts swatting the bag all over the house. I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

review/text: I found these in a local Petco and decided to try them with my friend's cat. The cat has gone crazy for these things! I've never seen this cat walk around on two legs, try to climb my arm to get to the treat in my hand, or reach into a bag to try to get to the contents before I gave her some of these. The name is very fitting, but the real temptation is for we humans to keep giving just *one* more treat to the cat over and over again to enjoy the fun reactions.

review/summary: My cat goes bananas for Temptations
review/text: I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much. I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations.

review/text: Of course, my cats deserve only the best so I began giving them treats to elicit a desired behavior in them.  Little did I know this would backfire and they would elicit a desired behavior in ME!<br /><br />Not only do they LOVE these (and a couple of other flavors), they have now learned when it 10pm, which is treat time and time to leave the bedroom.<br /><br />By 930pm the vultures are starting the circle me on bed while staring at me; at 945 they start to softly vocalize; by 10pm they hoist me on their little backs and carry me to the drawer where the treats live while in full complaining voice.  I obey and give them an equal number of treats in the hallway, quickly locking the bedroom door behind me. Why lock it?  We have lever type doorhandles and the male has learned to open the bedroom since "Treat Time" started, will march back in and demand more.<br /><br />Did Dr Frankenstein realized the monster he created?

review/summary: Does wonders for bad breath
review/text: We adopted a neighborhood cat a few months ago. She is very nice, but had horrible breath even after we started feeding her various special cat foods. Otherwise great cat, but when she would yawn in your lap, you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took "Dentabites" more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her, but well, thought let's try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites, we noticed her breath "improved" and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone, or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn't change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also, since then, we've been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn't returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product. Just a few treats a day make enormous difference. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cats love, I only like...
review/text: Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.

review/summary: Hairball reducer AND soft fur all in one!
review/text: My 13 year old cat has never liked cat treats.  I have tried a variety over the years, and she wouldn't have anything to do with them.  Until I found this one.  I was really happy to finally find something to reward her, or get her to come to me when called.  These treats have petroleum in them.  My cat loves Vaseline, so it makes sense that she likes these.  I have noticed a decrease in the frequency of her throwing up.  The great surprise that I found is that her fur has become softer!  I know it must be the petroleum in these that is coating her fur as well.  I have to feed her a special cat food because she has a tendancy towards the urinary tract infection, and since I have been doing that, her fur has been more coarse and dry.  These treats have brought back the softness to her fur.  I'm sold, and I will be buying these from now one.  My very picky cat loves them!

review/summary: All 5 of my Cats go CRAZY for these!
review/text: These are truly temptations for our cats and will have them running from any side of the house.  When you open the bag, they actually smell like "french fries" (two of us confirm this) so the smell from the human side is not bad.  We have tried so many other treats but the Whiskas Temptations Chicken flavor are definitely a favorite.<br /><br />They can put weight on your cat quickly and certainly are not meant to be a diet.  But for treats, they are great and our cats really love them.  If our 5 love them, the chances are high that your cats will love them too!

review/text: I was purchasing my cat other treats until I came upon this one. Ever since he tried he couldn't stop. He doesn't want any other kind of treats but the Creamy Dairy flavor ones. Acutally, when he was inside his mother, she ate them while she was pregnant, don't know if it had anything to do with it but cats love these! They should start making gigantic bags of these. I pretty much have to buy them by the dozen for my spoiled rotten cat.

review/text: I've been giving these to my 2 cats everyday after I give them wet food so that their teeth can be somewhat cleaned afterwards. They love the flavor, though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste. It's well known that cats who eat too much wet food without eating anything crunchy after are prone to tooth decay. This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety. Do yours?

review/text: Ok so my cat loves the flavor will eat them like they are going out of style. HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.

review/text: I got this to give to our cat as an occasional treat. Like many of the reviewers here my cat now acts like an addict. I don't know what they put in this stuff, but she wants it all day and all night. It's gotten so she has started pestering me non stop. I'm glad I found a treat she likes, but it's a nightmare if we run out. I just came on here to order another box. I'm not sure if I want to keep dealing with this. I might have to consider kitty cat rehab.

As for treats same thing, she would not eat every kind. I bought a pack of temptations to try her and she goes crazy for them, i once left a package of them on my coffee table and went out and when i got back the cat had knocked them off the table and ripped the bag open and ate them all. (i think that these are equivalent to smoking to humans) its very addictive to cats.. 5 stars.. *****

review/text: I've been giving my cat medication for a little over a year now and I just hate prying open his mouth and dropping the pill in.  If I get one of these treats ready beforehand it triggers his attention to the treat instead of the pill.  I give him his medication and then immediately give him the treat.  (not in the same fashion, however)  He used to run and hide every time I opened his pill case now at least he sticks around.  It makes it easier for me too.

Anytime I go into the kitchen, one or more of my cats follows me in, sits on a perch (each has his own spot so the other will not nibble from the plate of another) and waits for his/her Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treat. This makes it a lot easier to deal with a hairball problem.

review/text: I am sorry but the below reviewer is absolutely talking non-scence. I have 7 cats and 8 bags of these in my cabinets but I have gone days on end without giving these to ANY of my cats and they are absolutely fine. Also I run a shelter with a LOT of cats and have not had them acted like she sais.<br /><br />These cat treats have the ingredients on the label and just like any cat treat cats love them... My cats also love Party Mix, does that mean they are drugged product.<br /><br />That being said please do not listen to non-scence on these ratings.<br /><br />My cats do love these temptations... They do not beg for them,,,, but they do like them!<br /><br />I feed them each 10 treats at home at a time, the suggested ammount and of course they could go for more (because it is a snack)...<br /><br />I love that these taste good to the cats but they are also very healthy!!!!<br /><br />I have 7 cats. One of my cats will only eat 4-5 treats and she gets FULL easy and the rest can eat ALL that I put down........ My neighbor sais that her cats do not like them because they are spoiled on "people food"... I was shocked when she returned the bag I sent them for Christmas!<br /><br />I tried to get them to eat them also and they walked away, tried to also put one in there mouth...<br /><br />I also have 35 cats in our shelter and they ALL love these treats, they will eat as many as you give them.... We cannot afford to buy these for them all the time but we get it for them every few months.. We keep them all the time for our own cats!<br /><br />They are a great product, I like to buy the large bags because you are saving money!

review/summary: My cat loves it.. I don't know if I do.
review/text: Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.
