review/text: My 50lb, 1 year old dog loves these.  He gets excited when he sees the bag.  There have been no choking issues as other reviewers claimed.  I would definitely purchase again when the price drops as 30 count bag is a good offer between $11.00-$12.00.

review/summary: Stinks!
review/text: I bought this product despite the several choking hazard reviews. I vowed to stay near my dogs while they chewed, and put their chew away whenever I left the house or was very busy.<br /><br />To my dismay, neither my Border Collie/German Shepherd mix, nor my beagle will chew these. I had thought beagles would eat anything, until I actually caught a wiff of one of these things.<br /><br />They STINK!<br /><br />If you can get your dog to like them, I'm sure they're great. However, mine refuse to chew them.

review/summary: Best dental chews for the best price
review/text: My 2 year old Chow-Newfoundland mix loves these dental chews. I give him one each night after I brush his teeth. (His teeth are still sparkly white and people comment all the time on how white his teeth are.) And more importantly, even though it's a type of rawhide, it doesn't upset his stomach like normal rawhide chews AND he chews these. I tried other dental chews such as Greenies, but he just pretty much swallowed the Greenies whole which defeats the purpose of a dental chew. These also cost half as much as the Greenies. I have done price comparisons the last 4 times I have ordered these and each time Amazon had the best price. Note: I also use the CET toothpaste,which I have found to be the best after trying 6 different brands, but don't buy it via Amazon or you will pay a higher price and have to pay for shipping.

review/summary: My cutting edge diplomate Vet recommended these and they are terrific
review/text: I have a top notch Vet (UC Davis and UCLA trained, diplomate,exotic animal specialist, avian surgeon, treats dogs as well and uses a variety of tools including acupuncture and acupressure as well as natural health approach to her veterinary practice) and she suggested these for my 13 year old yellow lab.  Both he and our 7 month old lab puppy (who are both on a healthy diet that includes Nutro Ultra and Evo dog foods, a daily multivitamin, vitamin C and Joint Support from Trader Joe's) are given these to keep their teeth healthy.  They love them, the chips are large and easy to chew and digest and are completely non-toxic unlike many other conventional products on the market that claim to function the same way.  Buying them online means I get them very economically and they are shipped immediately - I sometimes get them the very next day without paying any rush charge.  I would suggest asking your Vet before trying them, just to be sure they are safe for your particular companion animal.

review/summary: These really work!
review/text: My Chesapeake Bay retriever was only 18 months old but had very bad tarter build up. We tried everything-- chew toys, greenies, cow hooves, denti-sticks. Nothing worked or was so expensive I wouldn't buy enough to see if they were effective. One of the vet techs at my vet's office suggested these. We give Curly one each night. It doesn't take him long to chew them enough to swallow it. Three months of eating them have made a huge difference in his teeth. I am not big on brushing dog teeth so I'm glad these work.

review/summary: ordered the wrong chews
review/text: I ordered the wrong chew. I meant to get one that had the "HEXTRA" coating (I think that's how you spell it) but got plain chews instead. However, it was disappointing that this product was a Canadian one. I think that it should have been clear on the website, Canadian import. Maybe it's there and I just didn't notice. I ended up sending it back. I will say that the store I bought it from (Entirely Pets) was very prompt in shipping it out, but not as prompt with the refund process. I had to call twice to find out what was going on. I had gotten a return authorization number prior to shipping it back, so I'm not sure what held up the process.

review/summary: Be careful.  May be good for teeth but present a choking hazard.
review/text: I have a 1 year old lab/Shepard mix and she is a very active chewer.  I ordered the CET chews to keep her teeth clean.  She absolutely loves the flavor, but because the rawhide is so thin, she tears them in half and tries to swallow them in large pieces.  The first time she did it, I thought maybe it was a one time deal.  I saw her choking and stuck my hand down her throat to remove a piece of rawhide blocking her throat.  Just today, she choked again, and I wasn't able to pull it out but in my efforts I must have shoved it down and she could breath again.  It is a very scary moment to see your dog choking and gasping for air.  My dog was looking to me for help and once her throat cleared she laid in my lap for 30 minutes...I am guessing it traumatized her.  I threw the rest of the bag in the trash.  My dog also has loose stool whenever she ate these, but she does have a sensitive stomach to certain foods so I am sure results will vary.  I will stick with brushing her teeth and getting her teeth annually by the vet.<br /><br />My dog - 70 pounds, 1 year old lab/Shepard mix.  She eats the beef Orijen food blended with California natural.<br /><br />Edit -<br /><br />My dog Taro is now three and a half and I see these chews at the Vet clinic I go to.  I also see that this product has really great reviews so I am sure that it works for most people's dogs and people love the product...I just urge you to be very cautious if you purchase this chew and stay with your dog when they are chewing on it.  I just wanted to edit this review because the risk is so high with these chews that I felt compelled to warn potential buyers of the product.<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should at a minimum put a strong warning on the front of the bag to warn owners that this can pose a major choking hazard to some dogs.  This would be the responsible thing to do.  Pet products are not regulated like products for human use.  Most people like me view their pets as children and essential to their lives.  If this were made for children, the danger of this product would make news and force the manufacturer to address the choking hazard.<br /><br />It also seems fishy that almost all of the 5 star reviews are from people with 1-4 reviews on other products.  Plus the number of "is this useful votes" is usually less than 5 votes.  It seems as these reviewers are fake...just seems fishy to me.  I hope this isn't the case because they would be toying with the danger of killing our dogs.

review/summary: Require intent supervision...
review/text: I loved these chews until today... and so did my 40 lb akita puppy. These are great for keeping your dogs teeth clean and my dog loves them! She runs to her cushion and sits down as soon as I grab the bag from the shelf. However, the major problem with them is that my dog attempts to swallow them as soon as she can and has almost choked on one twice now. The first time I easily pulled it out of her throat but today it almost killed her. I should have known better because I'd been told as much by many people at my vets (one dog even choked to death) but the reviews online were so good I didn't listen. I always watch my dog with chews but even under supervision she will try and swallow them ASAP. These are great for your dogs teeth but please watch your dog!<br /><br />Also, the sizes are very inconsistent... in the four bags I've ordered to date I've had to throw a large number out (basically one full bags worth) because they are too small to even attempt to give to my dog.

But, yesterday, I gave them each one to chew and my Chocolate Lab choked. He was gasping for breath, and fortunately threw up the chew and his breakfast. I say fortunately because I suspect he would have choked to death otherwise. My other Lab threw up over night, and I suspect it was from these chews. I'm getting rid of them and won't buy them again. These things should come with a warning label.

The other dog reacted by urinating and pooping in the house...VERY unusual for her to do either of these chores in the house.  Both dogs reacted within twenty minutes of ingesting these chews.  I have thrown them out and am writing a review, which is something I seldom do unless it's positive.  My advice:  don't take the chance with these, there are other alternatives.  For any pet owner who gives their dog(s) chews of any sort please google the method for giving your dog the heimlich maneuver in case the dog chokes...there's an easy way to perform this on a dog.

review/summary: Not Good For Mastiffs
review/text: I thought that I would give this a try as a way to keep my 2 Year old English Mastiff's teeth in good condition. I treat my dogs (the other is a rescue hound) homepathically (no chemical vaccinations, etc) and this I thought, would fall in line with not having to give him anesthesia for routine teeth cleaning.<br /><br />I found others who mentioned choking incidents to be right. My Mastiff can plow through a huge rawhide bone in no time and with this chip, he literally just sucked it in and kept regurgitating it to soften it. Not good...too scary for me. The large size is even too small for a Mastiff's huge mouth and I will not buy these again. I will just continue with teeth brushing--wlthough I hate doing it more than I think they do :-)<br /><br />I don't feel right giving it a 3 star rating, for me, I really need a not applicable rating. I don't think they are bad, they are just not good for my large breed dog. For others, these chips may be OK to use but I would still suggest being in the same room with them if you choose to use these.

review/summary: Something's not right
review/text: I'm not sure who's supplying these or where they're coming from. We've bought them several times on Amazon because it's convenient and cheaper than getting them at the vet. Our dog loves them. But I opened the lkast bag I got, and the dog would chew them but not with the same enthusiasm. Almost like someone getting a glass of milk that was going sour. I'd find half of one lying uneaten/unchewed. Then she chewed of the corner of one, left the rest, and seemed lethargic. Later that day she vomitted. All that came out was yellow bile and a piece of the chew. We, of course, haven't given her any more. My wife called the company to report what happened, and when she told them where we bought them, they said we couldn't have bough them through Amazon because they're only sold through veterinarians. We're not buying any more of them on line.

review/summary: Good for teeth but bad for stomach
review/text: These chews did indeed prove good for my dogs' teeth - one of them had severe tarter issues, and its much better now though to be fair, I used a lot of other products (like Greenies, enzymatic toothpaste etc) along with this. This does possess a choking hazard for dogs like labradors who are tempted to swallow food rather than patiently chew them, and must be given these chews only when monitored (as is the case with other chews like bully sticks).<br />But one major issue that I encountered with these chews is that they give a bad gas to my dogs - enough to drive the humans out of the house. Their stool is just fine, its just the extremely foul smelling gas. whenever I stop giving these for 2-3 days, the gas problem goes away, but as  soon as I start these again, the problem is back.

review/text: These have so far been the best option for our corgi although no replacement for brushing teeth, our vet never seems to be able to notice :]<br /><br />They are nicely textured and my dog really seems to love the way they taste.<br /><br />I'm a little perturbed by the poor ratings on these treats. Like most things some common knowledge on your pet makes you a better pet owner. The reason these things have the texture is that so your dogs are encouraged to chew them.<br /><br />If your dog cannot eat food without gulping it then everything can become a choking hazard.<br />And while I do understand the concern of concerned owners, I do not think that these are any more prone to choking than say - rawhide or a dog toy.<br /><br />Please supervise accordingly.

review/summary: Dog chews for clean teeth
review/text: We are trying to keep our dogs teeth as healthy as possible.  It costs appx $450 to have their teeth cleaned in our area.  Our vet recommended these chews.  We have a toy poodle and a miniature poodle.  We bought chews for LARGE dogs, which are quite big and we don't have to worry about our dogs choking because they are so big.  Our dogs love them and chew on them constantly.  Their teeth are definitely with less plaque and tartar, but then we use bully sticks and enzyme in their water.  Our dogs teeth are very white but not sure which product is working the most.  I think they love the bully sticks the most which we buy from Costco because they are a fraction of what they cost in a pet store or online(these dogs don't eat just anything and are very particular about what goes in their mouths).  We use them all to try to keep our dogs teeth healthy and save $450++.  So far it's working.  I would recommend these C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Chews but would get the largest possible even for toy dogs.  You don't have to worry so much about them choking when they are so big and you throw them away when they get small. Our dogs favorite are the bully sticks and they drink water with the enzyme material in it without any problem.

review/text: I have purchased this product before as my dogs' vet highly recommends enzyme chews to maintain dental health. I have 2 older beagles. The male's gums are in worse shape and he doesn't like to chew anything, so I soak these chews for a few hours and then he will chew them. The female loves these chews and devours them. The chews aid in breath freshening and tarter removal, but I also use an enzyme toothpaste periodically. As our pets live longer we must do more to help them maintain a healthier life style. My only negative comment is that the chews in the same bag come in many different sizes and thicknesses. (Neither of my dogs like the really thick pieces.) I would prefer a more uniform size as the prices and amounts for the same brand vary so much.

review/summary: CET Chews work, but lets be smart about this people...
review/text: I have 2 Siberian Husky puppies, now 5 months old, each weigh about 40lbs and they both have been using the C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for over 3 months.  I've consulted with my Vet, Animal Shelter, and Obedience Trainer who trained dogs in the military for 20 years; ALL agreed that this is a good and safe product BUT like anything else you give you puppy/dog SHOULD be supervised AND timed.  They also all agreed that the limit on giving these chews should be between 10-20 minutes and either taken away for future use, or the remainder thrown away.  If you are a SMART pet owner, you will be supervising the use of this product and if after 10 minutes, the product is beginning to be swallowed, I guess it makes sense to take the product away.  These work exactly for what they are intended, to reduce and remove tarter and plaque.  It is NOT a treat or toy!  As much as it CAN be digested, yes, some dogs will try to swallow too big a bite and begin to choke.  As pet owners, again, supervision is needed.  Remember, I have TWO pups, and after 15-20 minutes, all I need to say is "drop it" and they listen and do so because I am also a RESPONSIBLE pet owner and have already begun training them to listen.  If the chews aren't too badly mangled, I save for the next/another day, otherwise, they get trashed.  The only other note I will also agree on is the lack of consistency in size/shape of these chews.  Great product otherwise.

review/summary: Works well, but too much variation in size of pieces.
review/text: These chews do a great job! My nine-year-old yellow lab used to be prone to getting tartar build-up, especially on her back teeth.I have always brushed her teeth frequently with enzymatic toothpaste,but it wasn't enough.Now her teeth are tartar-free, and her gums are healthy too.<br /><br /> I had to train her to hold the treat under her paw, to keep her from gulping it down and then gagging it up. She was easy to train because she adores the taste,and would do anything to have her chewy delight.<br /><br />Amazon.com has the best price of any vendor for this product, and with their FREE SHIPPING for orders over $25,I save over 50% per bag, compared to what my vet charges.<br /><br />My only criticism of the product is that the chews in the Large Dog bag vary considerably in size. It would be nice if the pieces were more uniform in size, but this is a minor drawback when you consider how well the product works!

review/summary: Not worth the risk
review/text: Both of my Golden Retrievers love these.  The older one eats it perfectly, tearing off little pieces at a time, chewing, swallowing.  The younger one (2 yrs old) tears off large of pieces which end up lodged in her throat.  I knew this due to her licking the roof of her mouth after the treat was gone as if I gave her peanut butter.  I would reach in and pull the piece lodged in her throat.  This happened consistently until I gave up on these.  The product is vet recommended and the dogs do love them, but it's not worth the risk!

review/summary: Dogs love it, but caution advised
review/text: My dogs absolutely love these, and they do keep the teeth clean. Just do not give to dog unsupervised.<br />Our previous dog, a 60 lbs aussie would eat it down to the last inch, then would try to swallow that last bit whole.  I needed to keep an eye on her and take it away before she finished it off.  There is just no way for a dog to "hold and chew" when it gets down to such a small size.  Of course I always felt terrible taking it away from her, but I certainly did not want her to choke.<br />Just pay close attention to your dog!

review/summary: Bag of Dog Chews
review/text: The chews arrived on time, but they seem darker in color then the ones I ordered before. Plus they seem smaller and my 11 mos old black lab chewed on one and happened to eat it all because it was small and had softened up rather quickly before it could be taken away. He then threw up and his whole meal of dog food came up, but thankfully it was on the tile instead of the carpet. Don't think I'll be ordering from this company again. I specifically ordered large dog chews, but these seemed a bit smaller this time around. Plus the bag is just sitting in the pantry b/c I only gave him one out of the whole bag since I don't want to have a repeat of the throw up scenario.

review/summary: Collecting dust because my dog is spoiled.
review/text: I bought both the CET HEXtra premium oral hygiene chews and CET Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews to switch off so my dog doesnt get tired of chewing the same thing over and over. I have a 13 pound Chug (pug chihuahua mix) and I buy the large then cut them into 2 or 3 long pieces. At first I gave her the Enzymatic chew which lasted her a whole day or even two which is good because she usually goes threw chew treats within an hour. Then I gave her the HEXtra chew to try and she loves this one. Most of the pieces are thinner but still last a good day of chewing. I cant even get within 2 feet of her before she starts growling then she just runs away with it lol. I find that most of the chews for the HEXtra are much thinner and easier to cut with basic scissors. For the Enzymatic half the time I have to use a knife to cut it. After she had a taste of the HEXtra she slowly steers away from the Enzymatic each time we give her one. After 2 weeks whenever we give her the Enzymatic she just licks it a couple times and then walk away. For the HEXtra she still goes crazy over them! She goes through all the tricks I taught her without saying the commands lol. I dont know what the big health difference between the HEXtra and Enzymatic but if I had to recommend one I would suggest getting the HEXtra. Hands down your dog will love it. Now im stuck with a big bag of CET Enzymatic that my dog no longer likes because she prefers the HEXtra. Like anyone has mention well with any kind of chew treats remember to take it away when it gets small or it can be a chocking hazard.

review/summary: Chews are not safe for all dogs
review/text: At first my three dogs had no problem with these chews.  They love them and I think they are good for their teeth and to occupy them when they can't be outside running and playing.  But after a few of these treats, one of my German Shepherds started choking on it, and I had to pull it out of the back of her throat.  She wanted it back because she loves them so much, but it made me too nervous. I took them away from the other two immediately, even they were having no problem.  I wish they would come up with a chew that was safer.  I never give my dogs a chew unless I am right with them, but being there doesn't mean I would always be able to dislodge the piece that could potentially kill them.  Not worth it!

review/summary: My dog won't take it!!!
review/text: After reading so many positive reviews, I have really high hope on this products. My 3 year old Shihtzu has been taking Greenies and since it costs significantly higher, I thought I can replace it with C.E.T. But sadly, he won't eat it at all. He simply sniffed at it and then walked away. I've tried in several occasions and I am now giving up and am giving it to neighbor's dog. I do have to note that my dog is a very picky eater. Hence my suggestion: If yours is also a picker on food, then try to get a sample or buy a smaller pack first before getting a large bag like I did.

review/summary: Inconsistent Thickness a BIG Problem
review/text: First let me say my dog loves these, and I want to love them but the quality control on these remains a problem.  Every bad I have bought has at least 3 and often 6-7 chews that are about 3 times the thickness of the rest.  Anytime my dog has had one of the thicker ones, she has always vomited it up several hours later.  I contacted the co about this, and they said they're aware of this problem, and are changing the supplier.  I have continued to buy them and throwing away the thick ones, 10-30% of the bag over a period of several months, and the problem continues.  They are too expensive to throw so many away.  I don't understand why they don't correct this.  This would be a good product if this problem didn't continue.

review/summary: Choked & Barfed- see video
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>So this might be a gross video to watch... but I'm posting this so that others might see what they are in for.<br /><br />I have an adult boxer dog with dental problems (gum overgrowth, as do most boxers) so I bought several dental health products-including these chews.<br />I bought the large size chews, and for the first half of the chew (they are rectangular shaped), it worked great.<br />Then towards the last bit, he didnt know what to do with it. It wasnt firm enough that he could hold it and chew on it, he had to put the whole thing in his mouth and chew on it. He tried to swallow it, then realized it was too big, so kind of hacked it up, and kept chewing. I started filming during this part, to show how the hacking becomes problematic, but you can see that at the end of this video, he barfs the whole thing up.<br /><br />I think that in theory, enzyme-assisted dental care is great, but probably should stick with the toothbrushes/toothpaste so that it is controlled and doesnt become a choking hazard.<br />I think I will stick with tooth-brushing followed by a small mint-flavored treat to reward the toothbrushing.<br /><br />I wanted to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this should seem as much a hazard as any other rawhide/toy, however here is why I think that is wrong: This big flat rectangle shape seems to add problems to breaking down into smaller pieces, whereas the twisted rawhides allow for holding between their paws while gnawing down to a small piece. I will stick with the latter shape in the future.

review/summary: double duty!
review/text: I have a 4yr old 30lb male beagle mix who absolutely LOVES these chews. I had originally bought them for the sole purpose of promoting good dental health, thinking my dog might chew on them if he got bored or if it was the only chew I gave him. You see, he's usually very picky- he won't chew antlers or bones, unflavored rawhide, nylabones, and though he'll lick peanut butter out of a kong, he doesn't do much if I put a treat in there.  To my surprise, as soon as my dog smells these chews, he can hardly control himself, he get so excited! They smell a little funky (meaty), but I think that's all part of what makes my dog love these chews.<br /><br />This is great for us, since it means he gets an after-dinner treat he loves, they have helped keep his teeth relatively plaque free, and they help keep his breath from smelling bad. Of course, his mouth doesn't exactly smell like your favorite flower (unless your favorite flower smells like dog breath), but I have noticed that the distance at which I start to smell my dog's stinky dog-breath has shortened significantly, and his breath no longer causes people distress from a distance. Also nice is that these chews last a little while. For my dog, they will keep him occupied for around 15 minutes. This is great compared to the Kong brand fresh breath treats, which my dog chewed through right away, and they did very little for his teeth.<br /><br />To address other reviewers' comments, I should caution that my dog is somewhat small at 30lbs, and he is an incredibly patient chewer (though he will chew for very long periods of time). He will calmly chew his rawhides, etc, until he gets nice small pieces to swallow, and he avoids pieces that are too big to swallow, so these treats present little choking hazard for him. I understand the issue though, and I'd recommend that you treat these like any other thin rawhide squares, which is to say that they are a pretty big hazard for choking or for your dog swallowing large un-chewed pieces (which can cause an upset tummy). As with any rawhide-type treat, you should supervise your dog when you give these to them, especially the first few times. My biggest complaint of these chews is that I think they would last longer and be less of a choking hazard if they came as twists or rolls, instead of flat pieces, since the flat pieces are pretty easy to break.<br /><br />Since too much of a good thing is usually a bad thing, I also try to limit the number of these chews I give to my dog, since they appear to very similar to beef hide, and I don't want to give him too many hide chews. So, I give him one of these every other day, depending on the other treats he has had that day, and I alternate with greenies or other dental-type chews, so he has a variety of chews, but he gets some sort of dental health chew every day.

review/text: Our black lab mix almost choked to death on one of these. If I hadn't been sitting in the same room with her, we would have lost her. As the chew gets smaller, it becomes VERY slippery and it slid back into her throat and lodged there. I had to hold her mouth open and reach down and grab it - which, because it was so slippery - was not easy. I strongly suggest finding another way to keep your pups teeth clean. These simply are not worth the risk.

She loves them so much, she completely understands if we ask her if she wants a "new bone".  Also, we had to switch to the larger size so she wouldn't try to consume them fully, choke, spit them up, and scare us half to death.  I totally recommend these!!

review/summary: Baird approved
review/text: My Shetland Sheepdog, Baird, has some dirty teeth. He's also... weird... for a dog. He doesn't chew on ANYTHING really. I mean, as a puppy he chewed the wall once, but we sprayed that with some of that nasty tasting spray stuff and since then, no problem.<br /><br />He used to love to chew on cow hooves, but for some reason he just seems to enjoy licking them now (maybe he likes the pasture flavorings). He doesn't chew any of his chew toys.<br /><br />So how do you clean a dog's teeth if they don't chew on anything? The answer is brushing (which is always good regardless of whether your dog chews or not!) and not much else.<br /><br />While at the vet I saw the CET Enzymatic HEXTRA Premium chews. $30 a bag for 30 chews. It seemed excessive, but to keep from having to put Baird through the scary procedure of a full teeth cleaning, it seems a small price to pay. My fear was he wouldn't chew on them. Turns out... he LOVES them!<br /><br />The thing is, the $30 price tag really got me, so I decided to try to find something a little cheaper, when I happened upon Amazon and found the "one step down from top of the line" Virbac (makers of the CET chews), "C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Large Dogs, 30 Chews." It's not completely clear what the exact differences between these and the HEXTRA Premiums, but the chews do smell different (I think this has to do with the chicken flavoring on these which the Premiums don't have).<br /><br />And it turns out Baird loves these as well.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that if your dog has yellowed teeth, simple chews won't fix that. All you can do is get those teeth deep cleaned... however, this is just generally surface staining, so brushing and providing chews like these will actually clear the plaque. And the plaque is the part you are worried about, given that's what can cause health problems with your dogs.<br /><br />Over all, I'm happy that Baird's happy with these chews. If you can't brush your dog's teeth all the time, these make an OK alternative to brushing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P05K7W">C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexidine, Large Dogs, 30 Chews</a> are available as well, they are just a few dollars more. Next time I order I will most likely go with the Premiums out of nothing more than personal preference.

Apparently no quality control exists or it doesn't matter to the company what size chew goes in what size bag.

review/text: She thinks he's getting a treat. My vet sells them for more than double what amazon charges for the exact same product. They are a long lasting chew...he's not finished with them just in a few hours. More like a few days. They do not smell and are not messy. Do they work? I am pretty sure she has better breath than before she took them.

review/summary: Great chews, be careful
review/text: These chews work great for my dog.  I think the value and quality is a great deal on Amazon.<br /><br />Now on to the scary reviews about them being a choking hazard.  I was worried myself as my dog is an aggressive eater.  She inhales her dog food in less than a minute at her feedings and I was worried she would do the same with this item.  She does not, she chews it completely and really takes her time.  I can see how it works as a teeth cleaning agent as she can get about 5-10 minutes of chewing on it until she is finished.<br /><br />Because I never want to see it become a choking hazard I do only let her eat these in my presence and do not leave them as a treat when I leave in her crate.  Each dog will be different, so maybe buy a tester chew at a local store before investing in a bag of 30.

review/text: With any rawhide type of chew there can be some risk to choking. Monitor your dog while he is "brushing" his teeth and you should be all set. I also like these chews because they don't have any of that bizarre doggy antiseptic chemical in them. Just the enzymes, thank you very much!

review/summary: Really Cleans Teeth
review/text: We have three 100lb chocolate labs. They range in age from 2 years to 10 years. Although we give them rawhide regularly, their teeth are still funky. We just went through our first bag of these chews, and the teeth on all three dogs have improved. We like them so much that I just ordered another three bags.<br /><br />Regarding the choking hazard, all dogs need to chew, so you need to give them things so they can. Some dogs attempt to swallow pieces that are too large, and so they gag. As a dog owner, you MUST monitor your dog while it's chewing. Even dogs that gag usually learn after the first couple of times, so they don't gag again. But you still need to monitor your dog while they're chewing. This goes for anything they chew, not just these.

review/summary: Choking hazard
review/text: I gave my dog one of these every evening to clean her teeth and I noticed she would gulp abnormally loud to get them down, but I thought nothing of it. That is until tonight when she started choking on a piece that she tried to swallow, after she had been chewing on it for a while and softened it with her saliva. Reading other reviews about this product confirmed my suspicions that this was not a rare occurrence. One should always monitor and supervise their dogs when they are chewing something whether it is a toy or a treat, however, you should not expect your dog to choke on a chew treat under otherwise normal circumstances. I will throw this bag out and stick with dental chews like Greenies that she can chew into smaller pieces and not lodge into her airway. If you value your dog's life I would stay away from this product!

And if our big guy dawdles a bit, one of the girls (dedicated thieves both) are off with it the minute Gunner looks away.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these treats.<br /><br />Tom Carter

review/summary: Don't knock the product!  Think about your dog..
review/text: Any dog, no matter their age or size, should be supervised when chewing any edible toy.  Whether it be a rawhide, cow ear, meaty femur or even a stuffed KONG toy.  Dogs that love to chew & can eat a rawhide in a matter of minutes, should not be permitted to have rawhide because they are considered "aggressive chewers".  This does not mean that they are mean or naughty dogs, but more that they are persistent.  These dogs should only be allowed to chew on KONG toys or Nylabone (non-flexible) chews.  I have an aggressive chewer myself & those are the only toys he plays with for chewing purposes.<br /><br />I also have a non-aggressive chewer.  He will carry a stuffed toy in his mouth wherever he goes, he's not interested in ripping it to shreds.  He will only chew a rawhide or Nylabone for a few minutes before he gets bored.  Rawhides are safer for these types of dogs because they won't try to eat the piece whole, even still, supervision is a must.<br /><br />Please take into consideration what kind of chewer you have prior to purchasing this product.  With that said, this is a great product in that it promotes dental health!  They're a tasty treat for our four-legged family members and for those of us that don't have the time to brush our dog's teeth, they do what we can't.

review/summary: not for sensitive tummies
review/text: Our 8 month old Goldendoodle goes ga ga for these, and without a doubt they are very good for her teeth and mouth.... Problem: they give her THE WORST GAS we have ever smelled in our entire lives.  It took a while for us to figure out that these were what was giving her the gas because the vet recommended them, so we figured of course they must be legitimate.  But they are definitely the culprit. She might be the exception and maybe she just has a sensitive stomach, but I recommend you ask for a few samples at your vet to make sure your dog's stomach agrees with them before you buy the big bag.  Side note, our 5 month old Goldendoodle doesn't even like them, won't touch them, and he's a chewer!  I guess every dog is different.

review/summary: My 40 lb Mix Breed Loves These!
review/text: These chews have really helped with her bad breath! They help kill the bacteria (I'm guessing) and remove plaque (with enzymes). I give her 1 or 2 a day, and she absolutely loves them. She can chew through one pretty fast. They are about 5 to 6 inches long and range from thin and crispy to thicker and more hard (all inside the same bag). I like the variety, and I think my dog does as well. They don't stain the carpet (I have almost white carpet). I recommend these over regular bones as a treat because the enzymes inside the bone really help dogs with their teeth, and do not just cover up bad breath with a "doggie mint" I always like to supervise my dog when she is chewing a bone - give them to your dog when you are watching TV so or reading so you can keep an eye on your dog. Have fun :)

review/summary: My dog loves these chews
review/text: I normally don't give my dog rawhide, because they usually make him throw up.  However, based on the reviews here, I decided to try these since he is getting older now (9 years old) and does need some help keeping his teeth clean.  Here is my pro/con list:<br /><br />Pro:<br />- Amazon ships these to you fast<br />- dog loved these at first lick<br />- I ordered large size (my dog is ~80lbs) and it kept him busy for about 20-30mins.  A normal bone (busy bone, dentabone, etc) would normally only last 5mins<br />- Seems to make his breath smell better too<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Price, but for what you get, this might not really be a con<br />- I think it gives my dog gas<br /><br />I recommend trying this product, especially if you have tried normal rawhides with no success.

review/text: My vet recommended these chews to help with the tartar on my older dog's teeth and said she needed to come in in 3 months to see if she needed a teeth cleaning (over $100).I began feeding her one a day. After a month I looked and most all of the brown junk near her gums was gone. Little did I know that dogs do not have the enzyme to break down this stuff as humans do. Such a deal and my dog loves them. They are a little expensive but seem to do the job.

review/summary: Get these, NOT the CET HEXtra Premium chews!
review/text: I've been buying these chews for a long time for my two dogs.  They do a good job when used in conjunction with brushing their teeth with the CET toothpaste.  In an effort to more effectively clean my dogs' teeth and prolong the time between expensive dental cleanings, I purchased CET's HEXtra Premium chews.  While they were more expensive than the regular Enzymatic chews, I was willing to pay the additional cost for a more effective product.  The outcome was this:  one of my dogs wouldn't even touch the HEXtra chew and the other one threw up the first two chews I gave him.  I refused to give him any more of them.  Amazon was great and issued me a prompt refund when I expressed to them my dissatisfaction with the product.  For now on, I'm sticking with these Enzymatic chews.  My dogs beg for one every day as their after-dinner treat, my dogs can easily digest them, and it helps keep their teeth in good shape.

review/summary: Vet student recommends!
review/text: I am a veterinary student and I can say I really love these chews for dogs.  They are much better quality ingredients than the rawhides in the grocery store and most dogs like them much more.  I can say from experience that my dog prefers them over those.  My dog is a medium size dog but I buy the large chews--they aren't too big and you get more for your money.  He eats them SO fast that I know he really likes them and I can feel better about the quality of what he is eating.  At the end of chewing on these, some dogs can try and swallow a piece that is too large because they are being over-zealous but as long as you keep an eye on them this shouldn't be a problem. (I think everyone who gives their dog a rawhide should be observing their dog anyway)  If you say this is a choking hazard, then so are every other rawhide chewables out there.  These are great for their teeth and they love to eat them, so what's not to like about the product?  I would highly recommend!

review/text: I initially bought at these at the recommendation of my vet for my 50 lb, medium size Vizsla. Previously I had given her actual bones, which can cause a cracked tooth...which is not good. These help with the dental hygiene without that risk. The sizes of the chews in the bag do vary, probably because it is a natural product. I've read the other reviews about dogs choking on the chews. I can see where that could happen for a dog much larger than my girl, as she can devour the smaller ones pretty quickly. I suspect these would in inappropriate for a much larger dog.

review/summary: God's Gift to Fish Folk
review/text: This is miracle stuff!<br /><br />I've used it for years and have completely stopped 'searching' for anything else and even moreso - have stopped 'TRYING' anything else.<br /><br />This stuff cleans, clears, de-yellows, de-greens, and even helps alleviate certain disease issues before (and even after) they've started.  I've found this much less stressful on the fish when dealing with a 'dirty or diseased or medicated' fish tank. Changing the water (especially after meds) can sometimes create such a harmful blow on the fish... whereas this is so much more gentle on the fish; thus allowing a water change after-the-fact without the incredible stress or damage to delicate fish. Even if you're in need of adding meds, I've found this a fabulous 'pre-intervention' -- why, because many times this need only occurs due to lack of proper maintenance of the tank. By alleviating the 'nasties' before a small water change + adding meds; I personally have found this a lifesaver when it comes to those fish in 'not-to-happy' condition. I've seen many die, but I've seen less die when using this in combination of meds and H2O changes. Obviously, you're call.... but if you're looking for a helpful moment in time --this be it!!!<br /><br />Additionally, should one have issues with water quality, even after changing the water -- this will absolutely fix it!!! I still recommend however to start with this first (you'd be amazed at what clarity can occur while at work for even only 8 hours).<br /><br />If you have never used this stuff, I promise you, this WILL produce miracles beyond any fishkeepers expectations.<br /><br />Your fish will thank you!!! You will thank you!!<br /><br />This stuff is the 'bee's knees',<br />it's the 'holy grail',<br />it be the ying to any fish's yang!!<br /><br />You will never be sorry you purchased it,<br />It's worth every penny!<br />... that is, as long as the deals here don't suddenly change.<br />If so, as always, we the people shall figure out what it's made out of and then just wholesale penny it from an alt manufacturer.<br /><br />AND, this IS a DEAL! [...] has always strived to be one of the best priced places online... and here, they found their niche even moreso! I buy from them regularly, and shall continue. They 'quick ship', they honor their prices, and are happy to fix any faux pas.<br /><br />You just can't go wrong with:<br />1) this gift from 'the gods', and<br />2) buying anything from [...]<br /><br />I swear by this product and have yet to find anything else in 9 years of fishkeeping that even comes close to the miracle of this product.<br />.... yes Virginia - there is a Santa Fish somewhere out there and his name is PolyFilter!!!

Kishibori's color shows already a higher quality and the taste is deep, for supporting the taste of other dishes Usukuchi type can work better.<br /><br />Bad (and good): once you open you cannot keep long, but this is because of natural ingredients with no additives. That's the price of quality...

review/text: I was so excited when I found this product in my local grocery store!  I had recently purchased a "Garden Chile Pepper" blend paste from the refrigerated produce section and was pleased with the product, so I was not hesitant to buy another product from a tube.<br /><br />What a mistake.  I believe that the manufacturer made this pesto with dried basil.  It tased like dust and looked like it too.  I thought at least I could make some pesto butter to freeze if it wasn't good enough for sauces, but I ended up pitching the whole thing.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, here.  There's just no substitute for the taste of the real -fresh- thing!

review/summary: couldn't live without it!
review/text: This pesto paste is so incredibly convenient, tasty, and versatile. As someone who suffers from dairy sensitivity, I was enthused to find a GOOD VEGAN pesto product! This is coming from someone who is an authentic Italian who grew up on homemade goods. Maybe the previous users who disliked it weren't using good, quality olive oil? Just a thought. It makes the sauce. It's SO MUCH better than cheese-laden commercial crap...

review/text: As it turns out Basil is extremely healthy and is listed on the World's Healthiest Foods list (google it)<br />I haven't tried this as plain pesto but I have added it to<br />Marinara sauce, beef and barley soup, and chicken barley soup, black bean and tempeh burrito fillings, and probably more things as I just grab stuff as I cook.<br /><br />I also have the tomato paste in a tube and it is good too, so much better than those silly cans where you have to decide of you want to refrigerate the leftovers or use the whole can when the recipe only calls for 2 tbs.

review/text: We love Amore Pesto Paste because it is the only pesto I've found without 1)parmesan (which we are allergic to) and 2)soybean oil (which we are allergic to).  The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five is I think it lacks a bit of flavor.  But when we add salt to our finished product, it is quite good.

review/summary: Indispensible and good
review/text: I keep a tube in my fridge at all times to use as a quick seasoning for everything from scrambled eggs to salad dressing to something to smear on chicken breasts before sauteing --add some white wine to the pan and a bit of shallot or garlic and it's a lovely short-cut to a low-cal but tasty "gourmet-ish" entree.  I've never used it on pasta because I don't care for pasta.  But I use it as a seasoning. It's less heavy than the pestos that come in jars (that often have cheese already in them---thus not the high quality cheese I'd prefer). If I want this pesto spiked up with parmesan, I'll use a very good cheese--and it then makes a very good pesto!

review/text: I love this stuff! We use it all the time on back-country trips. It makes a great sauce on on dried pastas alone (or with a little cheese for the gourmet). And it really gives a lot of flavor to bland freeze-dried meals. Well worth its weight. I liked it so much that I even use it at home, now thats good camping food!

review/text: I have a picky-eater 4-year-old, but one of the foods he loves is pasta with pesto. Since starting him on a dairy-free diet last summer, I was hard-pressed to find an alternative for cheese-laden pesto sauce, since I can't easily make my own. Since I found this paste my problems are solved-- he loves it and eats it almost every day.

review/summary: Not Stellar Pesto, But Product Has Its Uses
review/text: This is the sort of thing that is handy to keep on hand for quickly doctoring up a simple meal.  It's definitely not awesome pesto; think of it more as a condiment, like mustard or ketchup.  What I typically use it for, in that regard, is as a spread on sandwiches, when I'm tired of the usual versions.  It works well in particular on sandwiches featuring cheese or poultry.  It doesn't have much kick on its own as a sauce for pasta; but it can be added to things like frozen pasta dinners or canned soups etc. to give them a little more flavor.<br /><br />One thing I want to mention too is that this product can "spit" and spatter when trying to squeeze it out.  When you are ready to open a tube, be sure you pierce the opening fully, so that any chunks within won't get stuck; and keep the bottom of the tube squeezed and rolled up to compact the remainder in the tube as best you can.

review/summary: Tastes like dust/ash
review/text: I was relieved to see that another reviewer felt the same way I did when they described this product as tasting like "dust."<br />The word I had in mind was "ash."<br /><br />Even when doctored with cheese, it's just very ashy.  You can drop your pasta or dip your bread in an used ash tray if you want to get an idea of the flavor this product provides.  Which is too bad, because the concept of pesto in a tube is great.  It gets bumped from 1 star to 2 for the concept alone.<br /><br />The formula needs serious work, if not a complete overhaul.

review/summary: Great on my homemade small pizzas or crusty breads
review/text: I love this stuff, and make great, small, homemade pizzas or crusty breads with this paste as part of the topping.<br /><br />First, in my cast iron skillet*, I grill each side of thick slices of Italian- or French-  bread or small rounds of store-bought pizza dough.<br /><br />Then I rub each side of each slice with peeled garlic clove.<br /><br />After that, I squirt extra-virgin olive oil on each side of the bread or pizza round.<br /><br />When the olive oil has had a chance to sink into the slices, I squeeze** a two- or three-inch ribbon of pesto paste on the top of each slice.<br /><br />Then, I top the slices with shredded cheese(s), a dash of smoked paprika and whatever else takes my fancy.<br /><br />Finally, I place the breads onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet which then goes into a preheated 375 degree oven for five to seven minutes, or until the cheese has melted.<br /><br />*Tip: I scrub my cast-iron grills and skillets with course salt to get them clean.<br /><br />**Tip: I don't squeeze the paste out from the top of the tube. Instead, I use my kitchen shears and cut the bottom open, and then I squeeze a two or three-inch long ribbon atop the pizza or bread.<br /><br />BE CAREFUL NOT TO CUT YOURSELF ON THE CUT EDGES OF THE METAL TUBE OF PASTE.  ENJOY!

review/text: *sigh* I kind of hate it, can't really bring myself to use it.  But I still haven't planted basil seeds for my own supply yet. This needs to be doctored with cheese but it is still too dark and oily to be recommended.  It may do in a pinch in lieu of dried basil (and who would use THAT anyway?)<br /><br />Don't buy it.
