review/text: These sour punch twist are now my favorite candy.  I have ordered them twice... which is a lot considering that every order has two containers of them.  They will last a long time.  If you like the normal sour punch straws you will definitely like these, I like them more.  They are individually wrapped... a good thing, I don't know how many times I have looked over and out of no where there's a mound of these wrappers.  Then comes the shame.

Buy the smaller one if you get it here. It'll be plenty for 5#s of meat. 4#s of sauce is about right for 25#s of meat. :)

review/summary: Yummy in the tummy!
review/text: To my pleasant surprise, these adorable, little brown mushrooms were absolutely delicious and even the 'juice' left from the water they are canned in is worth keeping and adding to soups and rice (which is rare since most canned mushrooms I've eaten have water that is totally unpalatable and tastes more like the can than the mushrooms). The mushrooms slice up very nicely and they aren't soggy or overly water-absorbed but they are rather slippery little suckers so be sure you have a very sharp knife.<br /><br />These were actually tasty enough to eat right out of the can, drained at room temperature with a little soy sauce. The texture of these mushrooms is silky smooth (almost buttery) and slightly squishy and the flavor is extra-mushroomy 'umami' goodness.<br /><br />There were a couple dented cans but nothing that ruined the product and these mushrooms were packaged very well.<br /><br />You get 96 ounces [6 pounds] of dry weight shiitake mushrooms at $15.21 with subscribe and save and free shipping which is a fair deal (and no need to rehydrate like dried mushrooms and obviously much more convenient). That rounds to about 63-cents a can.<br /><br />What's in the can:<br />Medium-small to small whole shiitake mushrooms<br />Water<br />Salt<br />Citric acid<br /><br />I rarely get over-the-moon about something as pedestrian as canned mushrooms but these tender little morsels are well worth the deserved kudos!<br /><br />Side Note:<br />These mushrooms *do* come from China (they are native to China though).

review/summary: Shiitake mushrooms are usually sold fresh or dried, not canned
review/text: Why aren't shiitake mushrooms canned more often?  If you buy this product, you will know why.  The salt water inside the can doesn't taste that good.  By contrast, the salt water inside cans of both button mushrooms and straw mushrooms is quite delicious and it's difficult to resist the temptation to drink it all down as if it were soup.  Apparently, shiitake mushrooms will make the fluid that they are soaked in taste bad.  But the shiitake mushrooms themselves can be quite delicious to eat.  Yes, up to half of these cans will arrive slightly dented - that's normal when buying canned foods from Amazon.com - but it should still be easy to open all of the cans.  Cans that are severely dented on both the top and bottom cannot be opened but that problem usually occurs only with very large cans and never with small cans like these.  The most delicious way to eat these canned juvenile shiitakes is to: (1)Wipe away any dust from just one side of the can - the side that you plan to open.  (2)Open the can with a can opener.  (3)Drain away all of the brine (salt water) by pressing down hard with the opened lid, just as you would when opening a can of tuna in water.  (4)Eat these small shiitakes as is.  You have now successfully squeezed away the bad taste from these mushrooms.  (5)To make these young mushrooms even more delicious, you can now add Worcestershire Sauce directly into the can but you would be reducing the healthfulness of this treat.  Product of China.

review/summary: Wow, it's ziti!
review/text: I was so happy to find this.  I've wanted to eat ziti for years.  Five stars for being real ziti!<br /><br />But now that I've had it, I'm going back to chopped up pieces of pasta that used to be ziti.  My largest pot is only 40 quarts.  A mere ten gallons of water.  My stove isn't powerful enough to bring that much water to a boil unlidded, but I have to fill it to the absolute brim to get most of the ziti into the water while it's still stiff and dry, so I can't lid it because it would boil over.  I also can't stir the ziti once it's in as I have nothing long enough to reach down to the bottom of the pot without submerging my hand in near boiling water.  I can't carry ten gallons of near boiling water to the sink, and even if I could, there is no possible way I could successfully pour it into a colander.  After the ziti softened and was down in the pot I did try bailing out the pot like it was a boat.  That sounded like a good idea, but bailing water and bailing near boiling water are two entirely different things.  I survived that with only minimal burns, and I got the water down to where I could use my tongs to stir it.  Once the ziti was cooked it was too long to successfully transfer into a bowl without it tearing into smaller pieces.<br /><br />So, in the end, I've eaten some ziti.  It was quite an adventure.  A bit too much adventure, really.  But I'm glad I did it.<br /><br />AG Ferrari packed my ziti amazingly well in lots of spray foam.  I have no idea why, as the pasta is so dry and so thick and so hard that I could probably use the package as a baseball bat.  All in all, this brand of pasta is absolutely amazing for its flavor and texture.

review/summary: I'm in love
review/text: For medical reasons, I can not eat gluten.  So, some years ago when I learned this, I thought oatmeal would be off my table for good.  For those who don't know, oats can be cross-contaminated with wheat crops, thereby rending them not gluten-free.  This means anyone who is gluten intolerant can not eat mainstream oatmeal products.  So one day a couple of months ago, I saw this new Glutenfreeda oatmeal at my local family-owned health food grocery.  I bought a package and immediately realized how blessed I was that Glutenfreeda introduced this product.  The flavors in the variety pack are all great.  My favorite is the maple raisin, which is out of this world delicious.  I have dedicated myself to eating a bowl of hot oatmeal every morning.  I prepare it by nuking it for one minute with a half cup water, stir it a bit, then I pour a bit of Alm...d Br..ze vanilla flavored non-dairy almond milk, then a light sprinkling of sugar.  Pure Heaven!  Please, I don't have any connection to this manufacturer, but I know it's difficult for small companies to navigate the rough economic cycles.  I beg you, PLEASE support Glutenfreeda by trying this product!  Try it locally, just buy a box.  Then when you realize how delicious, buy it like I do, by the case from Amazon, with S&S discount, and free shipping!

review/text: I have been gluten-free for over 5 years and dairy and soy-free for 9 months. My daughter has been corn-free for quite some time and gluten and dairy-free for the past 10 months. We were ecstatic when we learned about Glutenfreeda's Oatmeal being safe for both of us. It had been soooo long since I could make a packet of flavored oatmeal in a jiffy. And with my daughter's corn-allergy, it has been even longer for her. We are now in heaven and love all three flavors, but my daughter's favorite is the Maple Raisin. We eat it for breakfast, snacks, whatever. It isn't as sweet as we both like it, but a spoon of demerara organic sugar and we're both ready to enjoy.<br /><br />Anyone who can buy any brand or kind of instant oatmeal off the shelf just can not fathom our excitement, but it is truly a wonderful thing to be able to enjoy instant oatmeal again!!

(You can always add more sugar, but you can't take it out!) I can see where this is going to solve a major problem -- how to find a gluten-free breakfast away from home. And I appreciate the fact that every single item on the ingredients list is something I recognize and use in home cooking.<br /><br />But the real endorsement comes from picky seven-year-old, who is very difficult to please. "Not bad." Coming from her, that says a lot.

My husband who is not on the gluten free diet loves this oatmeal.He says the oats taste fresher. And for my Celiac college student this product has made his life so much easier.He can have a healthy breakfast in his dorm room or at the food court with no worry of cross-contamination.Like me he always has a packet in his backpack for snacks or a quick lunch.<br /><br />Thank you Glutenfreeda!

At all...<br /><br />I'm ashamed I even bought this jerky. Skip this flavor and try the BBQ or Pepper flavor. If original tastes like sugary bacon, I shudder when I think about how the terriyaki might taste like...

review/text: I tried several different brands and formulas, but all caused at least one of the two dogs to have severe upset stomach and associated issues.  I finally settled on this product when both dogs reacted well to it and love the taste.  As for the quality of the food, neither dog receives table scraps and less than 1 treat per week, yet the vet consistently gives them high marks for health.<br /><br />I don't know if this is the perfect choice for everyone, but it works out great for my dogs and I.

review/summary: Not very good.
review/text: We've been feeding this to our Great Dane and honestly it hasn't worked out too well.<br /><br />Our dog is just over a year old and at her annual vet visit the vet pointed out that she was developing a yeast infection in her ear.  He told me it was most likely from her food and asked what we feed her.  I told him we feed her IAMS Large Breed food, and he said that it was probably the problem.<br /><br />He said we didn't need to treat it at the level that it was at, but that if she got to where she was shaking her ears a lot, or pawing at them, or if we noticed other symptoms, we would want to try a better diet to see if it fixed it.<br /><br />So, our dog's ears got worse.  She was constantly shaking her ears.  Her skin developed really bad dandruff.  She used to be really obedient, but she became really naughty.  I called the vet's office and we're switching her to a wheat-free corn-free diet now.  Last week we transitioned her over and this week we have already seen a little improvement; she doesn't shake her ears much at all anymore.  We'll watch and see if the dandruff and behavior problems also go away.  I am hopeful that they will.<br /><br />Maybe some dogs can eat this and be fine--our dog LIKES eating IAMS food...but it's just really obvious that it hasn't been good for her.  Until her vet told me, I had no idea that dog foods have so much bad stuff in them.  Dogs are carnivores, so it makes sense that they have problems on a wheat and corn diet.  The vet didn't try to sell us any particular brand of food, he just suggested trying a wheat and corn free brand for a couple months to see how it goes.  We are trying Nutro Natural Choice now.<br /><br />Too bad.  $50-60/bag dog food for a Great Dane is going to add up.

review/summary: A very odd experience
review/text: I bought this product because of its decent price and relatively healthy nutritional contents. The reviews aren't bad either. When I opened the first pouch, I first noticed that it had a strong smell, and the smell was not of chicken. Being the hungry adventurous eater that I am, I consumed the whole pouch. The texture and appearance are actually not bad for chicken-in-a-bag, and it was satisfying going down. However I couldn't get over how odd the smell was - it smelled exactly like tuna. Also, the meat is cut into little cubes that smush easily so the texture actually tastes pretty similar to tuna as well. I thought I had gone crazy. I had to examine fibers to be sure it wasn't an error at the packaging plant that gave me tuna instead of chicken. When I gave two friends the sniff test with other pouches, they both said they smell tuna. Overall, this is not a huge problem because I like tuna, I may even make a chicken/tuna salad out of it, but I believe someone who hates tuna would find this product intolerable.

review/summary: Why is it so difficult to find all natural chicken?
review/text: I decided to try this as finding all natural chicken seems next to impossible unless you're willing to pay a ridiculous price. Overall, I'm very happy with the product, it is all natural, no unnecessary ingredients, and the taste is what you would expect of canned chicken. I know some people complain that it smells like tuna, but in reality, any canned chicken product you buy, that doesn't have added ingredients, will smell like tuna, that's just how it is.<br /><br />Valley fresh does offer their all natural canned chicken at the grocery store, but it's the improved flavor kind, and they use additional ingredients to make it taste better. While it is more tasty, one of the ingredients they use is potato based, and us health freaks, don't eat potatoes. So I had to try to find their old recipe.<br /><br />The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because of the price. I'm having to have to resort to their better flavor recipe as it is a lot more affordable. I decided that potatoes are better than chicken that is not all natural. I am hoping that valley fresh will eventually allow for both products to be available (better flavor and original), so that I can choose to eat this one more regularly with out worry about price.

review/summary: Tastes better than most regular root beers
review/text: I hate diet soda, so when I found out I had type 2 diabetes I was pretty depressed, as I drink alot of soda pop. All the diet drinks I was recommended as "you can't tell they are diet" turned out to be advise from people without taste buds. I can tell. Enter Sprecher Low-Cal. I have always thought that Sprecher made the best root beer out there so I gave the low-cal version a try. I'm not going to sit here and lie to you and say it is as good as the regular version, it's not. It is however better than alot of the regular root beers out there. There is no after taste. You could have served it to me and I would not have known it was a diet beverage. One more thing you should know, it is not a zero calorie drink. There is about 30 calories and 8 carbs in a 16oz bottle. You might not want to drink it everyday, but with those low numbers, a dieter or diabetic can surely fit this in as an occasional treat.

But it means five measly sandwiches for almost $19 dollars.  Seriously?!  That is almost $4 bucks a pop.

It is one of those popcorn poppers that actually uses corn oil and is not a cheap "air" popper.  Anyway, I tried a few different brands of popcorn, and by far, the best is the Orville Redenbacher yellow in the jar.  This stuff is not too bad, but after having the Orville for a few weeks, just did not cut it in my opinion.  It popped up big and fluffy, but there were a fair number of hard pieces and they had me worried for my teeth.  You get a lot less of that with the Orville popcorn.  This was very good value for the price, but seeing how long popcorn lasts, I'd rather pay a fair bit more for something better.

It will satisfy your taste for coffee.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004776JL6">Green Mountain Coffee French Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>

review/summary: Good moments with Good Earth
review/text: I am a big fan of tea. Here in Brazil it's not the favorite drink (coffee is), but I really like it. Specially Chai Tea, which is very hard to find of good quality. I came upon the Good Earth brand at a restaurant, and fell in love with it immediately. Besides being tasteful and organic, the package is very pretty, and the tea bag stubs come with a witty quote by a famous (or not) person.<br /><br />I like this tea hot, although it says you can drink it cold too. But my favourite is with milk. You can add the milk in the tea when it's ready, or you can infuse the tea directly in the milk -- works both ways for me!

review/summary: Truly bulk cashews
review/text: These arrived promptly.  Truly "bulk packed" in double plastic bag, then mailed in a priority mail envelope that didn't fare too well in transit. But bag unbroken. Appearance of cashews is not really like the photo.  While mostly whole, there are a lot of halves and a pretty good bit of pieces and crumbs settled in the bottom of the bag.  Dry roasted darker than the photo but I think that's probably a plus for taste.  Taste is actually quite good.  Just don't expect premium large whole cashews.  Overall good value.

review/text: This is the only thing my mother, who is 95, will eat for breakfast. She has them with her coffee and spreads them with cream cheese. I prefer them plain with hot tea. They are the best English bisquit available in the states, always fresh and delicious. Try them, you won't be disappointed. My only complaint is that they are often hard to find and since they are imported, sometimes they are out of stock on line. They are a flaky biscuit, not too sweet and are wonderful plain or with jam or cream cheese.

review/summary: One of the best biscuits I've ever eaten.
review/text: It's hard to describe these biscuits to someone who's never had this because there is no American counterpart to this type of biscuit. It's a very rough and unprocessed kind of biscuit. If you feel American biscuits are too processed, then these are the opposite. The comparison would be like American biscuits = white flour and Digestive Biscuits = whole wheat, but I'm only talking about the textural quality; they are very crunchy and feels a bit rough in the mouth.<br /><br />Tastewise, they are sweet, but not overly so. They're very wheatey tasting and grainy. If you're a biscuit lover, you should definitely give it a try. They are a very high quality biscuit. They used to be very difficult to buy in the US, but now, thanks to the wonders of the internet, you can buy them anytime you want.

They are extremely tasty but don't really compare to other foods.  They are somewhat like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but not as sugary and the texture is all wrong.  They are light and crispy, but not crunchy.<br /><br />I love that these are available in snack pack sizes.  I sometimes go on autopilot when eating so it is really helpful to not have to think about portion control. The temptation to binge on delicious food like this is best avoided.  I just eat what is in the bag because that is a reasonable amount of food.<br /><br />In any case, I think these are fantastic; the nutrition content makes you feel good about what you are putting in your body, and the taste makes you want to put them in your mouth!  This is healthy food that you can eat for the taste, rather than in spite of the taste.

Overall, I would definately recommend as a healthy light snack or another great way to get fiber!

review/summary: Excellent - low carb gluten free
review/text: From my wife Sarah: I enjoy the sweet cinnamon flavor and crunchy texture, and this product is great if you're:<br /><br />1. ON A DIET - I love the 1 ounce packs. They're portable and only 110 calories which is great for a snack or meal replacement if you're keeping low calories and you're out of the house. I find that by the end of the bag I'm very satisfied.<br /><br />2. LOOKING FOR A LOW CARB TREAT - I carry protein bars too, but these have crunch and it's oh so satisfying as a treat. They have a pleasant sweet flavor, and they feed my munch cravings. They only contain 15 carbs but when you subtract the 3 fiber grams that's 12 carbs, which for me is reasonable.<br /><br />3. EATING GLUTEN FREE - Speaks for itself!<br /><br />4. ON A LOW SUGAR DIET - Only 3 grams of sugar, and they don't contain the sweeteners that cause a laxative effect.<br /><br />5. NEEDING PROTEIN - 10 grams of protein makes this product a good pick-me-up.<br /><br />I recommend this product, and I think Amazon has a reasonable price - better than what they charge locally and on some other sites I saw. I have Amazon Prime so I don't pay additional shipping, so that helps keep it reasonable.

Well, in my opinion, these "cookie bites" taste a lot like cereal.After the first packet, I even decided they were better in milk.These "cookie bites" have a crisp,shredded wheat-like texture that is cinnamon flavored. The inside has a very slight change in flavor and consistency. I was hoping for a delicious, goey almond texture and flavor but that had to be left to my imagination.In summary, I wouldn't buy them again for the price.

review/text: How HEAVENLY are these? I can honestly say that Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are my VERY favorite candy! I absolutely LOVE these! Maybe it's because they remind me of childhood.  My mother used to always buy me candy once a week at the market and I could pick out whatever I wanted.  Guess what I picked week after week?  Yes! You guessed it, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!<br /><br />These are at a truly discounted price for a box of thirty-six (36) with two pieces in each package. (Just like if you bought them as a single package) Which actually makes a total of Seventy-Two (72) cups. This is definitely enough for the entire family to have for quite a while. And to be quite honest, I was worried at first that maybe they were discounted because they would come stale or smashed during shipping or broken. But, I thought at this price it was enough for me to want to take the chance.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that they were fresh, and delicious.  They came double boxed in the mail and very quickly.  I have dealt with this seller several times and have NEVER, not even ONCE had a problem.<br /><br />If you are thinking of ordering these, or any type of candy from this seller, do not hesitate.  They are always pleasant, prompt and very professional.  A *Perfect* transaction every single time.<br /><br />You can also freeze these, put them in the refrigerator or add them to ice cream.  We love these in a variety of ways.  Enjoy!

review/summary: PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!
review/text: Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)<br /><br />I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.<br /><br />Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually.

review/summary: Dog loves them
review/text: We purchased these for our poodle.  She is the smaller breed (appx. 10 pounds) so I was a little worried these might be too big.  As a whole piece, the treats might be a little large for her, but they can be broken in two very easily.  The bag actually shows you how to break them in two, of course it's pretty self-explanatory as each treat has a cut down the middle of them.  So, the actual size of the treat should not be an issue for those with large or small dogs!  As far as taste--of course I can only rely on how well our dog likes them-she loves them.  Of course she is a little piggy and likes everything, but she really seems to be more fond of these than cheaper treats we have given her.  Overall I am pleased with these treats and I would recommend them if asked!

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: My little cockapoo loves Newman's Own dog treats, especially the peanut butter flavor. She'll usually eat anything, but I feel better about giving her treats that are healthy, organic, and made with high-quality ingredients that I could eat. No by-products here! Great price & highly recommended.

review/summary: they're alright..
review/text: My dog can be a picky eater when it comes to organic/healthy treats and he only eats these about 75% of the time i offer it to him.. i guess it depends on his mood? I actually tried them myself (i try all the treats i buy him before subjecting him to them because i will NOT feed him anything I find disgusting) and they're not too bad - tastes a bit like oatmeal. I do love how you can actually see the pieces of apples and carrots in the treats and I love how the ingredients are certified organic :)<br />btw- the little story on the back of the bag "Newman Dog Tells All!!" is hilarious!!

review/summary: A+ from picky eater
review/text: In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't buy from Amazon - I bought these at PetSmart, but I wanted to do a product review because these treats are worth buying in bulk - they're amazing!<br /><br />These little treats are wonderful.  I am extremely picky about what my dog eats because he's had digestive problems in the past and also because I believe dogs shouldn't be fed the unwanted junk leftover from the corn/grain industry, food that has been irradiated, or food that is made in questionable countries (cough* China * cough cough).<br /><br />Not only are these Newman's Own treats a good price, they are a good size and are indeed made with quality ingredients.  As another reviewer said, you can literally see the oats and such in the baked treats (see the product picture I took).  Plus, they're shaped like little hearts - adorable!  The best things about these treats, however, are that (1) they're made in Canada from a company we all can trust, and (2) my dog absolutely loves them. These treats are made from certified organic ingredients with 7% fat (min).  With all the pet food recalls and my inherent distaste for low quality, Chinese, irradiated, or high fat treats these treats are a winner!<br /><br />Also, my dog is a terribly picky eater when it comes to treats (which is hilarious because he'd eat cat poop if I let him).  He has never eaten any biscuit that was not literally made in a bakery from a boutique.  This has cost me lots of money in the past (in finding treats he likes, and having to deal with the bags and bags of treats he didn't like such as Blue Buffalo, Mother Hubbard's, and Wellness bars).  I bought a 13oz bag of these at PetSmart today for 5.00 (far less than I spent on the other brands), and my dog will not leave me alone.  He literally dances to get my attention because he wants me to give him one of these treats.  It seems like neither of us could be happier with this product.  If I can remember, I will do an update once the bag is gone to see if this trend has continued.<br /><br />Is there anything Newman's Own cant do?

review/summary: Whats happened in Oct 2011  not 2009
review/text: Three years ago we found out our dog Bella had severe food allergies.Fish,potatos,veggies,fruit and a few other selected foods are all she can eat. I look and could only find Newmans Own Salmon&Potato treats for her to eat.Since then they come evey 2mths ,by Sub&save. Today when I opened the first package I was shocked. The normally,heart shaped treats that are light, airy, thick, and easy to break,were nothing but,dark,flat,hard to break rocks. So my question is "What Happened?" Not only was it one package but all six. If this is their new product,they lost a customer.But if it was a bad batch, I say how dare they send this out to consumers,take their money,and think its right.Today there are many treats made that she can eat,but I stuck with Newmans out of loyalty,because they were first in making a great product Bella could eat.And Bella really loves this treats.I hope Newmans can fix this.

review/summary: Great for dogs with allergies
review/text: My little terrier is allergic to wheat and corn, and it's hard to find treats without those ingredients (which aren't good for ANY dog, regardless of allergies).  Both of my dogs LOVE these treats, and they are very reasonably priced, especially here on Amazon.  I also like Newman's business model, so I'm more than happy to support them and buy their products!!
