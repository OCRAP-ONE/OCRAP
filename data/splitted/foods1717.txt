review/summary: Good and Good for You
review/text: Our daughter needs a gluten-free diet. We've "taste tested" lots of things. Lucky for us she isn't a picky eater, but she DOES know what she likes. And she LOVES these cookies. Great for lunches, great for snack! And we have the peace of mind that it's healthier than other (sugar laden) alternatives.

review/summary: NOT GLUTEN FREE
review/text: These cookies may be "wheat free", but they are made from Barley Flour which is NOT acceptable for Celiac folks on a gluten free diet.  They came up on my Gluten Free Cookie search and I almost ordered them before reading the ingredients. Please note that I have not tried the cookies since they are not gluten free; therefore my rating is not indicative of the taste or quality of this product  - the site would not let me post this without giving a rating so I just chose the middle of the scale rating.

review/summary: Best Animal Cookies!
review/text: I've been eating these for a couple of years now as they used to sell them in an organic supermarket I worked near.  They're extremely tasty and way better for you than most other cookies.  You would never know it was a healthier choice.  Now don't get me wrong, it's not replacing your veggies for the day or anything but it's definitely a smart snack choice when you're craving sweet... and the kind of snack you get hooked on!  It's also a great option for kids and even comes in snack packs for their lunches!

review/summary: Great snack, good ingredients, healthy alternative
review/text: So far we have tried vanilla, oatmeal and chocolate chip varieties of Barbara's Snackimals and like all of them.  Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.  Large 2+ ounce single servings are quite satisfying when you want something slightly sweet and crunchy with only 120 calories and modest fat content. The only change we have made to our auto-delivery schedule is to have them shipped more frequently.

review/summary: Flavor Not What I Was Expecting
review/text: I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.

review/text: Look, each pack contains two servings of 120 cal each, yet those servings serve up exactly zero taste.  They should make it one serving of the same number of calories but inject some taste.  They taste like someone forgot 1) salt and 2)sugar.  Wow.  Super bad.

review/text: not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.

review/summary: It tastes more like roasted garlic
review/text: I ordered it by accident and then decided to try it. It brings a good taste of garlic but not exactly like fresh garlic. It doesn't have the slight spicy in the fresh ones, and of course, without juice - which I expected. I feel it is more like roasted garlic, or in-between of roasted garlic and fresh garlic. The good thing is that it will give you a taste of garlic without the bad smell in your mouth. For garlic lovers, I will recommend this product. By the way, amazon is fast.

review/text: I absolutely love peanut butter but it's such a high calorie food that I really have to limit my consumption. My typical morning begins with a bowl of oatmeal which I like to mix about 150 calories worth of peanut butter into. I recently discovered this product and decided to give it a shot in hopes that I could shave a few calories off of my oatmeal and this product didn't disappoint! I admit it lacks the creaminess you get from real peanut butter but all the flavor is there at a fraction of the calories and fat! My morning oatmeal which used to be approx. 370 calories is now down to around 240 thanks to PB2! I haven't tried using it in anything else just yet but this one change in my diet has made the product worth it to me!

review/text: If you like your salad dressing a bit sweet (as I do) and have health problems (ditto) this is an answer to your prayers: Low calories, low sugar, low sodium and "lite" oil.  Low sodium salad dressings are few and far betwwen.  Both Annies Lite Honey Mustard and their Balsamic dressing are delicious and fit well in a sodium restricted diet.

review/summary: Fresh, tasty, herbal/salt blend
review/text: Herbs de Provence can bring many dishes to life. Baked chicken and root veggies are a good place to start, for those who are not familiar with this herb mix. Then expand the horizons by searching all the wonderful online recipes. Winter is coming; it's time to enhance those savory stews and one-pot dishes --- to take the plain to the extraordinary.<br /><br />I personally like this French gray salt and herb combination because I don't like to overdo it with the herbs. I prefer a more subtle flavor. However, if you prefer more herbal punch, you may want to stick with purchasing the herbs alone, or make your own mix, which is quite easy to do. Otherwise, you will be fighting with the salt.<br /><br />If you need to watch your sodium intake, you need to know that this product is heavy on the salt --- and the crystals are very large, so it is easy to over salt your dish. You will be fine, if you make adjustments for salt required for your particular recipe. This is just something to consider, when ordering this combo product.<br /><br />I can attest to the freshness of this product.  Upon opening the glass jar, the fragrance was very potent and lovely. I also prefer having the herbs in a jar with a twist-on-lid.  This will help maintain freshness.<br /><br />All said, I highly recommend this product, with the reservations mentioned. These concerns are manageable. Just remember that this product is predominately salt, with herbs as the secondary enhancement, but the herbs won't go unnoticed.

review/summary: Veg to Bowl makes my life so much easier and my dogs love it!
review/text: I may be the wrong person to ask, because everything from Dr. Harvey's is the best. I have tried almost all of their products and the quality is impeccable,always! But I recently found this vegetable mix and it has made my life so much easier. I feed raw to two of my dogs and slightly cooked meat to my other two, who are older and do better with the meat cooked. I used to spend 2 hours every Sunday cutting up vegetables to add to their meals. This product has really changed my life. It is so easy and my dogs love it. I know how important it is to add vegetables to my dogs' diet.  They are much healthier since I have changed their diet to an all natural regime. Finding Veg to Bowl was great. It has nothing but vegetables, no filler of any kind. I love this product and this company. Dr. Harvey's products can be trusted no matter what you chose. I also use all of Dr. Harvey's treats for my dogs and for my cat.

review/summary: great product cheaper elsewhere
review/text: i've been using Dr. Harvey's Veg-to-Bowl for about 6 months and my 2 dogs seem to love it. At least they eat it and finish most of what they get. A few words of wisdom. The product package says to let it rehydrate for 8-10 minutes. i have found this to not be enough time and really needs closer to about 20 mins or even longer. I like to put the hot water in upon waking up, walk the dogs and then have a cup of coffee when i get back and then feed them. It's about 20 minutes and enough time for the veggies to rehydrate. If they dont rehydrate completely they are harder, and while my dogs will eat them, you will see the undigested remains in their stool. I know, yuck, but hey it's just veggies. Sometimes I put the water in right before bed so when I wake they are fully rehydrated. Saves a little time in the morning. Last thing on the product, as much as I love Amazon, and I do, I get about 2-4 packages a week at times, their prices on this are MUCH higher than what i pay for it at Unleashed by Petco. I havent looked elsewhere for it but it's about $6 cheaper than the Amazon price. Not $6 off the retail price, the actual Amazon price. So for me it's a no brainer. Despite the convenience of home delivery, i'll walk the few blocks to my local store and buy the veggies there. If anyone from Amazon reads this, c'mon guys, you'er a big supplier, get with it and lower the price or this is one product i will continue to buy elsewhere.

review/summary: A good buy
review/text: I bought this product to help my allergic Yorkshire Terrier. He would vomit or have diarrhea frequently with many of the name brand holistic and "quality" brands I found on the market. When I switched him to this brand not only did he not go through any of the usual sickness when switching but he immediately loved it. His lack of willingness to eat a brand is what instigates the switch. I would try to wait out the vomiting if it wasn't too bad as I did not know if it was from switching or allergies. Anyway, his appitite for the this brand is strong and his vomiting is almost completely gone. Outside of when he runs too much, has an asthma attack, and pukes.<br /><br />One thing I must add is that because it is dried vegetables this product is best served the following day after mixing and adding meat. After I prepare enough food for about 3 days, the following day the vegetables are soft enough for my dog easily eat it. It takes much longer than the 8 minutes the website advertises. This is my only complaint, that they are not upfront about that. The food is quality as you control what your dog eats. I recommend it.

review/text: I'm only giving this two stars due to my dog being extremely finicky. I have a one and a half year old lab and he has been a picky eater since I brought him home at 8 weeks old. I tried this product because he suffers from chronic diarrhea and has skin and eye allergies.  Unfortunately I cannot rate this product fairly because my dog stuck his nose up at it and walked away. I was hoping to find a miracle product that he would eat and aid with his issues. This product has many great reviews so I am very disappointed that I won't get a chance to try it out. Please note that my review is not negative against the product, but due to my dog being an extremely picky eater.

The instructions on the package  would provide a 2-8 lb dog with 30 - 42 gms per day I believe.  I called Dr. Harvey and he said that 2 grams of protein per kilogram of weight isn't enough to keep a parakeet alive and to give Rexie 3 - 4 ounces of protein twice a day.

review/summary: Love Simpli OatShakes!
review/text: Simpli Oakshakes are simply delicious, healthy and a perfect addition to my smoothies or alone as an in-between meal snack.  I had surgery that left me unable to eat solid foods, so I drink smoothies and soup for all my meals, and I need to get creative.  I needed a healthy alternative for a snack in between the bigger calorie smoothies, or to add into a smoothie for extra healthy calories - this is it!  It's smooth, tastes wonderfully chocolate, and because it's made with oats, fills me up more than just plain almond or rice milk.  So happy to have found this product!  And they always include a handwritten thank you note and a couple of samples of their other products with each order - I love this company!  And now can't wait to try their coffee flavored oatshake.

review/summary: My family loves it
review/text: Smooth, creamy, chocolaty and dairy free. We have to buy dairy free in my family do to dairy allergies. We haven't been able to tolerate most chocolate food items because of the dairy. This has been the first chocolate food item that has not hurt our stomach or intestines.<br />Here are the ingredients: Water, oat fibers, sugar, cocoa powder, rapeseed oil, tricalcium phosphate, carageenan, gellan gum, salt, Vitamin D.<br />The taste is sweet and creamy. Way better than chocolate milk in my opinion.<br />A little expensive, but I'm getting used to having to pay for the out-of-the-ordinary items I have to buy for an allergenic family.

review/summary: Yummy!!
review/text: We got a sample of this at the L.A.T.E. ride in Chicago.  I grabbed one just because it said dairy-free and I have a young son with multiple allergies including dairy.  Nobody was grabbing these because well it was the middle of a long ride and chocolate milk just isn't the first thing you think to quench your thirst.  When I read through the label and saw my son may be able to have it, I decided to taste it to see if it was any good.  I LOVED it, I let everyone in our group taste it and they said it was good and they definitely finished it off because whatever crappy gatorade type drink they had there was nasty.  My son usually has to drink rice or coconut milk... And he's tried them all and we get his favorite but he just tolerates it with cereal, he would never just drink it alone. The sample (one 8.45 oz) that I brought him he liked! He's 3.5 and you have to remember he has never had milk before and he  drank about half of it, little by little... It is sweet and creamy and has no oat grits like I was expecting it to have which is good for him. It has a thicker consistency than milk or regular nesquick but it's great.  We all liked it so much I just spent $51 on 18 25.50oz. containers of it!  It's expensive but I've had to spend $4.99 for RiceDream before because that's how much they wanted at Meijer that particular week, so for under $3 each I'll take the yummy chocolate oat shake.

I'll order directly from maker next time; I'm not about to trust this company again.

review/summary: EVEN MY HUSBAND WILL EAT IT!
review/text: I've been an Annie's Naturals fan for a long while - we have an autistic child and she cannot eat anything with gluten or casein in it - which is present in many other salad dressings. She has a couple of favorites in the Annie's Naturals lines, and this is one of them.<br /><br />Until I found Annie's dressings she liked and that were GF.CF, my daughter had gotten used to just eating salads with lemon juice and a little salt - adequate, but hardly fun or savory. I bought a bottle of the Roasted garlic and she really liked it over most every other kind of dressing, She asked for it specifically, when to other kinds she would say, "Noooooo!"<br /><br />I love the taste - it is decidedly garlicky - so if you are not a fan of garlic stay away. but like roasted garlic should be, it has a sweetness to it that fresh garlic doesn't. It is savory and yet wonderfully mild. A very simple and classic taste - more like home made.<br /><br />But my husband just stuck with his Sam's brand ranch dressing. Ranch on salad, ranch for dipping, ranch, ranch, ranch! That is, until he decided to try and lose some weight. So, he picked up the Annie's Roasted Garlic and he just went nuts for it! (And he's picky - well, that is to say, he loves ranch and not much else!)<br /><br />So, now that you've got my husband sold, this product will always be found on our table.

review/summary: no more diarrhea!
review/text: I adopted my 4 1/2 year-old brown tabby, a little more than a month ago. According to his medical history from the shelter, he'd had frequent diarrhea and they gave him deworming medicine which apparently made him throw up and still didn't fix the problem. They told me the problem will soon go away since he had been just treated, so i didn't worry about it too much and took him home with me.<br /><br />The very next day, he had a very runny stool with dark blood spots at the end! Being a first time cat owner, I got scared and took him to the vet and she said his fecal exam result showed nothing out of ordinary and blood in stool is common for cats.I thought it would go away since I was starting to feed him good quality food, but it didn't.<br />I kept seeing blood and loose stools in his litter box and whenever he had normal poop occasionally, I would get very happy since it didn't happen so often. Oh, and he was one gassy cat!<br /><br />I did my research and tried to put him on a raw diet but being a student, I just couldn't afford the time and the money. I heard canned food is better than dry, so I got him all-natural premium canned food but it didn't solve the problem.<br />I have to admit he didn't seem to like it at first. He LOVED the previous food, but he just sniffed at the new food and walked away. It took him a couple days to get used to eating it. It's been about a week and no more diarrhea!! He's had healthy, normal poop for a week and I haven't detected any gas from him!! I still give him the same canned food, but he mostly eats the Natural Balance dry food. He doesn't go crazy over it but he seems pretty content with it, so I can't complain! It's a big, I mean BIG, relief!

review/summary: It works!
review/text: I have to admit up front that it has only been a week since my two cats have started eating this food exclusively.  I don't want to jinx it, but this food is amazing.  I have a 9-year old and a 13-year old, both with extremely sensitive stomachs and can never find food that works for both of them.  I've tried the super high-end natural food which was way too rich and greasy.  I've also tried the low- to mid-range food like Science Diet, Iams, Nutro, and Purina...all sensitive stomach formulas, all with the same result - puke everywhere.<br /><br />After trips to the vet, multiple food changes, trying wet food only diets, considering raw diets, I finally came upon Natural Balance Chicken and Pea formula.  It was on sale at Petco, and so I got a small bag thinking if it didn't work, at least it wasn't an expensive waste.  I was skeptical, but hopeful.  Day 1, no puke.  Day 2, no puke.  Days 3, 4, 5...NO PUKE!  I can't begin to tell you what a difference it has made!  The best part is that they both WANT to eat this food.  They will meow when their bowl is empty and get excited when they hear the kibbles hit the bowl.<br /><br />If you have kitties with sensitive stomachs and feel like you've tried everything, I really recommend giving this a shot.  It's very reasonably priced, has NO grains and is made for cats with allergies and sensitivies to fillers.  Give it a try!

review/summary: only food she will eat
review/text: My cat was adopted from Humane Society as an adult. She demonstrated signs of allergies by excessive grooming that created red bare  spots.  I moved her to a limited ingredient diet on suggestion of my vet, and it does seem to help. She has fewer times when she engages in this excessive grooming, and her fur is in much better condition. A major plus is that she will eat this food. I had tried previously to move her to other cat foods, including Blue Buffalo and Wellness Core without success.  She has been on this food for about two years and is just back from her annual check up with good marks for her health.

review/text: My bottle feed kitten has suffered from loose or runny stools for his whole life after being weaned off the bottle. We have tried many high dollar foods and all types of sensitive stomach foods. After reading good reviews for this food I decided to go ahead and give it a try. No more loose stools within 2 days!!!! If only we had tried this product earlier. It is also important to me that my pet's food doesn't have corn fillers in it which this food doesn't. Science Diet lists it as one of the main ingredients in most, if not all, of it's foods. This product has been miracle for our baby!

review/text: I have three cats, and two of them LOVE this food, one in particular. For one cat it really helped with her digestive tract issues, and whatever allergy issues she had...and for the other, he loves it and it's been a good way to keep his weight down (ironically, since it's made w/ duck). This also is made with natural ingredients (not a bunch of funky by-products), so I feel good feeding my pets Natural Balance...I highly highly recommend this (and the product line in general).

review/summary: Perfect for my allergic kitty
review/text: After my cat developed some crazy skin allergies on top of an overgrooming issue, my vet suggested I try a strictly no-corn diet with an alternative protein (no chicken or beef.) This was one of the few foods I could find without any of those things & decided to give it a try. It has worked FABULOUSLY.<br /><br />Her allergies have disappeared, her fur has grown in soft & thick and I've even noticed a reduction in the stink of her poo. I highly recommend to it anyone dealing with a super-sensitive kitty.

review/summary: My cats do not like it
review/text: We just moved, and can no longer buy the trader joe's cat food our two cats love. I ordered this because of the great reviews and healthy ingredients, hoping it would help one cat's health. (He recently had an overnight stay in a vet's office because of tummy issues.)<br /><br />Well, the first time I put it in their dishes, both cats just sniffed it and walked away. Later, one cat would take one in his mouth,then spit it out on the floor. These are cats who eat everything (including things they shouldn't) and get VERY excited for breakfast. Eventually, they stopped even walking toward their dishes when I poured more food in. One cat was barely eating anything. The other one (with tummy issues) suddenly became more interested in eating leaves tracked in the house. Finally, I broke down and bought them <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PJQWLQ">Purina One Indoor Advantage Cat Food, Hairball and Healthy Weight Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a> at the store and they LOVE it. Plus the first ingredient is chicken (not chicken meal or by-product), not green peas. Right now they're eating half natural balance and half purina one, until they use up the bag.<br /><br />I'm sure this is great healthy food, if your cats will eat it. I did notice that they have very healthy looking stools in the ole litter box when eating it (Gross, but important, I know. The things we do for our cats!)<br /><br />Hope this helps another person who really loves her cats.

review/summary: Good alternative!
review/text: One of my cats had food allergy. He vomited once to twice a week so my vet suggested to feed him Hill's Prescription Diet d/d - Duck & Green Pea Dry Food. It helped! My cat stopped vomiting but it didn't help my wallet!  That particular dry food is extremely pricey (3.5 lbs for $24. Yikes!!)  So I had to look for alternative.  Nature Balance Green Pea & Duck is a great replacement and much cheaper (although not as cheap as I hope but I accept the fact that premium food cost more).  The only downside is that it is not available in the stores near my house. Although it is convenient to order online but still, I like to be able to pick it up in the local store.

review/summary: Amazing cat food!
review/text: My 10 year old tabby (Buttons) had started developing some serious skin issues. Her fur was thinning, she had scabs all over and she had a pretty gnarly case of dandruff. She was also throwing up in random places throughout the house. I found out she had allergies, we aren't sure to what exactly but decided to change her food. After spending hours researching and reading reviews online I decided on the Natural Balance Limited Ingredient food. Buttons had never had duck formula cat food so I decided to try it.<br />Its only been three weeks and the difference is remarkable! My 10 year old cat is running amok like a kitten again. She has more vigor, has stopped vomiting and is back to chattering at me and looking for attention. Her whole personality has went from crabby and subdued to kitten-tastic, purr machine ball of fun. Her scabs are healing, she's no longer constantly itching, her eyes are clear and her cat box isn't a disaster area any longer. Not to mention, she gobbles up the food. I noticed that she doesn't eat as much as well.<br />Bottom line: I have my cat back!

review/text: He had developed allergies to something and just became miserable. The litter box was awful, his coat was falling out, constant gas and just began to look droopy, bumps on his stomach. I knew a trip to the vet would cost a lot so I decided after reading about this food to give it a try and it has been a true cat and money saver. He scarfed it down right away and the improvement started right away but now after a few months, he is super cat. His coat is gorgeous and the litter box has no smell I mean none and is much more solid. He never has gas now and always wants to play. It saved my cat from whatever was tearing at him and saved my wallet, after doing some quick math I made a trip to the cat toy section and gave him his cut.<br /><br />This has really turned out to be a great product for me and my cat.

So now, in order to continue paying for ridiculously priced cat food, I would have to spend an additional $60 office visit to get the prescription. Did some internet research and found this food. My cat has been on it for a a couple months and no allergic reactions. Her face use to swell and get puffy from normal cat food. So happy to be saving so much money, only wish I had done it sooner!

review/summary: Tainted food, Nov-Dec 2011
review/text: I was a big fan of Natural Balance because of the grain free formula, small kibble pieces, and competetive price.  That was until my cat became sick for a week and a $350 vet bill to determine the problem was this bag of kibble.  It was easy for the vet to diagnose: I changed my cat's food out on Monday.  By Tuesday, she was showing signs of nausea (non-social, lethargy, eating sparingly, licking her lips a lot).  On Thursday, I took her to the vet.  The vet said she had a fever and was nauseated.  She recommended I swap out the food which I did that day.  By Friday, she was showing signs of improvement, and by Saturday, she was back to her energetic self.  If you are like me and are willing to buy quality food because you love your cat, please avoid this formula.

review/summary: A Long time favorite
review/text: I've been buying this product for at least 10 years, and if they haven't changed it, it's simply fantastic. I add shrimps and baby corns and broccoli (sometimes a little cooked rice) and it's a super fast cold (or hot) weather meal in minutes.  If you like Thai food, don't hesitate to try it.<br /><br />When I find it, I always buy lots. I've just used my last packet since we moved to Canada, and I'm so glad to find it at Amazon.

review/summary: Thai Coconut Ginger Soup
review/text: "WOW"...My first time to try Thai Coconut Ginger Soup, I'm Hooked! This is really good, and so easy. I made it with chicken, added some precooked rice, a few mushroom slices, a can of chicken broth, and a can of coconut milk...The flavor is so good and rich. There are 12 packets with 2 packets of soup base mix in each one, for a total of 24.

review/text: This soup base does indeed make a lovely coconut ginger soup, and is much faster and easier than trying to make it from scratch.  I was intrigued by the instructions for making this into a rice dish, but thought the results were underwhelming.  While the soup has a wonderful flavor, the rice dish was rather bland and disappointing.  Still, I bought this to make soup, and do love the soup it makes so 4 stars.

review/summary: Great flavor, great product
review/text: This product is great mixing with rice as well. Though not organic,  the ingredient list is straight forward. To review by busternc about this not being natural: the ingredient is not hydrogenated oil as you suggest (which is bad for you, producing trans fat and potential health issues), but hydrolyzed soy oil. This is not the same at all, simply a break down of protein into baser amino acids, making it easier for your body to digest. Not a bad thing, actually. Check over your chemistry :). This product is also gluten free. Pricing here is a little better than at my local market, where it's approx $3 for a pack of two. Unless I can acquire an organic version here, I will continue to buy and enjoy!

review/summary: Thai'ed For First Place
review/text: This is my Husband's Favorite Soup..maybe tied for first place with Seafood Chowder. This is waaay easier to make though, and there are no Thai restaurants here in the tiny mountain town of Pagosa Springs. It makes a satisfying meal with  chicken, mushrooms, matchstick carrots, celery, and rice cooked in. We often have a toasted crunchy bread with it and a salad with a peanut/sesame vinagrette dressing for a great meal. I'm glad that I found a place to buy it on-line. I too have requested that my local supermarket stock it with no success. I signed up for auto-delivery, which also brings the price down and insures that I will not run out. Making this tomorrow...YUMMM!

review/summary: Only brand I feed my dogs
review/text: This is the only brand that I have confidence in. It's made in the USA and its ingredient sources are quality - there are 4-Ds of meat products found in typical pet food productss (dead, dying, diseased, or disabled sources). Halo does NOT use 4-d meat products in their pet foods. I haven't read that other pet foods follow that rule so I make sure to stick with this brand. One note though - there used to be visible blends of peas, carrots, herbs, and other veggie sources in there and they really scaled that back to just kibble now with maybe one pea or carrot in 8 cups of kibble -- so I have to wonder what else they skimped on. I wrote and complained and they basically offered me a coupon for my next purchase rather than discuss the change in quality of their product. And their price went up about $5 from what it was for the 30-lb bag since I purchased the month prior -- so what gives??? Hey, if you price shop, you can find deals that provide 10-15% off and free shipping so keep that in mind.

I should have known it was going to taste bad because I had eaten and not liked Kay's BBQ Snack Mix. I like the idea for this cereal and that it is gluten free. that is not enough to make it edible. The soy gives it a weird aftertaste that I can't tolerate. If you don't like soy, you probably want to avoid this cereal (soy is the first ingredient). This might taste better is the soy protein was replaced with whey or rice protein. I did get a refund, so that was good.

review/summary: Good intentions ... bad taste
review/text: I ordered this cereal with high hopes heading in, especially given the mostly positive reviews on the product.  But I just could not get over the taste of it.  The cereal is very grainy and gets soft very quickly when milk is poured over it.  It also has a very funky after-taste.  The "O's" look almost half-baked -- they have a bunch of craters and holes in them.  And this is hard to determine from looking at the picture posted.  If you are looking for that satisfying crunch you get from say a Honey Nut Cheerios, you're not going to find it here.  They could be very healthy for you, but unless the health benefits amount to some magic elixir, the poor taste and texture make eating the cereal almost unbearable.

review/text: I really like this product because I am on a lower carb diet and am gluten free. Amazon has the lowest price for a carton of 6 boxes and at least for me shipping was free. I save more than 50% over buying them at my local Low Carb Nation.

review/summary: Taste is great!
review/text: I love this cereal and any other Kay's Naturals products. I have tried their cereals, Almond Bites and Crackers. They offer a great taste and perfect balance of carbs, fat and protein. The almond taste is just enough. Team it up with almond milk and you've got an awesome bowl of cereal.
