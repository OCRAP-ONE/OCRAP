review/summary: Just a cutting board with a hole...
review/text: This worked fine for the idea, but I found it to be way too small to use for very much food. If I even wanted to chop up a sweet potato I ran out of room on the board. So, I would say it is not worth the money at all!

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: I LOVE my Baby Brezza, but I wouldn't recommend the cutting board.  The white surface absorbs colors and has cut marks all over it after only a few uses.  If I had to do it all over again, I would simply continue to use my regular wood board instead of spending money on this one.  The fit over the machine is handy, but not a necessity.  Generally, I would need to put the cut up items in a separate bowl while waiting for a previous batch to finish in the Brezza anyway, so the handy "fit" doesn't really do me much good.  A good idea, but would be better if made from a more durable, non-staining material.

review/text: I am really impressed with this cutting board.  As first I thought I wouldn't like it much (it was a gift). But, I have found I really like using it.  The hole is really helpful for putting the food into the brezza unit or blender.  I really like the grooves, too, because they really make cutting the fruit so much simpler.  The nonskid bottom really works well, too.  It's now one of my favorite kitchen items.

review/summary: Nice warm light, good value
review/text: I just got my first set of these light bulbs and replaced all the 75W GE bulbs in the house that were lasting 2-3 months on average. The house is not quite as bright, but close enough. The light is about the same warm color as the incandescents.<br /><br />These bulbs also also pretty quick to start. Even though they don't reach their full brightness right away, they switch on instantly, which is what matters to me.<br /><br />I'm pretty hopeful that I won't have to replace the bulbs as often as I did before. Even if they don't last as long as stated, they come with a 7 year warrantee, so I'm pretty much guaranteed to cut down spending for light bulbs. At just $3.5 each, they add up to $0.5/year/bulb, compared to the $6/year/bulb I've been spending on GE incandescents.<br /><br />And this is without counting the savings on the electricity bill. Looking forward to the next bill when it comes!

review/summary: Earthmate Mini Spiral
review/text: Not too crazy about this product. It says 20-watts but actually gives off 60 watts of light. Incandescent bulbs when 20 watts are soft and low light but these seem even brighter than regular 60 watt bulbs. They should be in kitchens, garages and work areas where bright light is needed. Put the lights in and within a week, two of the six lights burnt out and so I gave it 3 stars. Replaced the two burnt out lights and they seem to be holding. Like the idea of less power but the trade off is they are really ugly in my etched glass lamps that cry out for soft, delicately tapered incandescent lights that don't burn out.

review/summary: awesome blue potato chips
review/text: Terra Blue potato chips are everything they say they are: delicious and so good that they're practically addictive, lower in fat than most other types of potato chips with zero tans fats, and they have a neat bluish color with just a touch of black here and there that gives them an aesthetic appeal. As another reviewer notes, it's very, VERY easy to eat a whole bag of these at once--they're only one ounce bags and even if the bags were larger these chips are as good as can be!<br /><br />They do contain salt and some carbs, so check the nutrition label if these are concerns for you. They are also kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />Overall, these chips are the best! I highly recommend them.

review/text: So after seeing the wild prices for plain popchips, I looked for an alternative.  Blue potato chips?  Well, it's more like purple.  Love the fact that they are thicker cut and are quite crispy, plus seem similar to a regular potato chip but have a bit of a nutty tone to the flavor.  Plus, I just read somewhere that blue potatoes are high in antioxidants (but who knows how well that holds up under whatever process they use to make the chips).  For the price, taste, and texture, these are great and will be on repeat rotation for me.

review/summary: Superior to any regular potato chip
review/text: A few years ago I switched to a hyper healthy diet, but part of that diet is still incorporating healthier versions of the "bad foods" that I like.  Switching from regular potato chips to Terra Blues was extremely easy.  Whatever oil they use makes these chips taste better the usual and the potatoes they use give it more texture and a better crunch.  They're still chips, so not all the healthy, but they are healthIER and since they're so much more satisfying I find I don't eat nearly as much in a sitting.  Great snacking chip.

review/summary: Best Chips Ever!
review/text: Right off the bat I must tell you that I do not like potato chips at all.  My husband wanted to try them and dealnews.com had an Amazon link a few weeks ago to get the 24 one-ounce bags for $21.00 with free shipping (prime).  I now wish I had bought several boxes because Amazon is having trouble keeping these in stock and their price has gone up and there is no free shipping.  Someone has this same 24 one-ounce pack on E-Bay for over $71.00!<br /><br />My husband kept saying how good they were and after he compared the label to the sweet potato chips he threw the sweet potato chips away!  The one ounce serving has 40% less fat than regular potato chips, zero sugar, three grams of fiber, and 130 calories.  He kept raving about them to the point that I finally tried one.  They were awesome!  With food, it is always about texture for me - no matter how good something tastes, if I don't like the texture I won't eat it.  I like the thicker texture of these Terra Blues chips - yet they are still cripsy.  I also like the single serving one ounce bags because they are so good that it would be hard to stop after a serving.  Yet, because of the fiber, with a small piece of fruit and half a sandwich, you will find that you are not hungry until your next meal.  Because of that, I can find a way to put them in my diet plan.<br /><br />Because I see the quantity at Amazon is running low, I ordered another box as I know my college age daughter who will be home this weekend will be planning to take some back to school with her.  I am thinking that the pricing has gone up since they were featured on Dr. Oz a few weeks ago.  I hope after all the Oz-mania dies down that Amazon brings the price back down and once again offers free shipping (prime).  This would make a great subscribe and save product,<br /><br />You will love, love, love these chips!

My mom and dad love these potato chips and looked for them everywhere (Wegman's, Genuardi's, etc.) but to no avail. Until, and to my delight,  I found them on Amazon.com and I am so happy to have them delivered every month to my house for a super price!! If you have not tried them yet, please give them a chance, you will be shocked and amazed at how tasty they are! It's tough to stop after 1 bag too! I've had my whole family taste them, around 40 people, and only 2 people said they were just okay. The rest raved about them and so will you.

review/summary: Good product!
review/text: These chips are wonderful. My whole family loves them. However, when I ordered them a few days ago, they were $21.00 for a case of 24 with free shipping through Amazon Prime. Now I see they have went up in price to $26.00 with a shipping cost of over eight dollars and they are no longer Amazon Prime. I won't order them again because of that--just hope I can find them elsewhere. They really are very good chips.

review/summary: A Japanese favorite
review/text: S&B curry and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ATZQ68">House Curry</a> are two of the major brands of roux, and if you want to experience the Japanese twist on curry, this product is the perfect way to do it. This is the same product you'll find in Japanese homes and supermarkets.<br /><br />Many people are unaware of just how popular curry is in Japan. Frequently served in homes, restaurants, and schools, curry rice is so commonly-eaten and loved that it can be considered a third national dish, right after sushi and ramen. Introduced to Japan during the Meiji Era (1860's) by the British, curry was at first only affordable to the wealthy, appearing in gourmet restaurants in Ginza and other fine dining establishments, but now it's very ubiquitous and eaten frequently by young and old. Curry is filling, easy to make, nutritious, versatile, and can feed many people for very little money, not to mention delicious.<br /><br />Inside the box are solid, dry cubes of roux, arranged sort of like an ice cube tray. Preparation is so easy that kids often make this on camping trips. You simply break off as many pieces as you need, brown some meat (usually pork when I was living in Tokyo), add the roux and water, then simmer it with your choice of vegetables until tender. Usually, this is carrots, potatoes, onions. Sometimes apples are added.<br /><br />Japanese curry is more liquidy than curries served in typical Indian restaurants in the US, sort of like a rich brown gravy. It goes over rice, or sometimes udon. When served on rice, it is accompanied by a heaping spoonful of chopped pickles like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019LDFRE">Daikon Takuan Pickle -7oz</a>. Japanese levels of spiciness are typically much lower than American tolerances, so "Hot" is not really that hot.<br /><br />The Amazon price is reasonable, especially if you live outside of large East Asian urban centers, where Japanese foodstuffs can be hard to find.

review/summary: Delicious and Easy
review/text: This is the easiest way to make curry and it's delicious.<br /><br />Just cook some onions and some chicken (and any other veggies you might want).  Put everything together in a deep pan, add a can of chicken stock and chop up the cubes (4 cubes = half of the box -- I cook this with about 6 - 8 chicken breasts) and put it in the liquid once it is boiling.<br /><br />Stir it together and bring to a boil, then simmer.<br />For added flavour, try adding some coconut milk.<br /><br />I make this with short grain rice cooked in chicken stock with curry powder for some flavour and a bit of a bite.<br /><br />The hot is not really hot.  It has a LOT of flavour, not heat.

review/text: I bought these for any discomfort not so much for pleasure. Peppermint/Mint Medley for indigestion or any digestive problems, even headaches! Chamomile/ Sweet Dreams for my anxiety. Lemon Ginger/I &lt;3 Lemon for nausea or when I crave lemons, basically. Peach/Raspberry are very yummy for random drinkings and makes great iced tea! The combination of all four are perfect and a must for your pantry. Each comes in their little wrapper so they won't spoil or catch funny smells. Too much boxes? Put them all in a container/Ziploc bag or something. Expiration date of my purchase is 8/2014. Can't find these anywhere else but here and the price is super good so by all means, purchase this even if you are not excited to expect this delivery but like I said, this is not so much for your pleasure tea drinking but more for your well-being and must be in your pantry. :)<br />- Gigita

review/summary: Heavy, dark-roast taste, but it works pretty well
review/text: I usually avoid Starbucks coffees since I find them to be over-roasted to the point where the burnt or charcoal taste is all that comes through. That may work well if you put milk in your coffee, but if you drink it black it's not all that enjoyable.<br /><br />I saw this on the Amazon warehouse at a great price, so thought I'd give it a shot. Although this decaf Sumatra is also a dark roast, it works pretty well. The sweetness of the Sumatra beans are balanced by the dark roast, resulting in a heavy-body, earthy taste that is enjoyable when drunk black.<br /><br />My favorite decaf Sumatra remains the medium roast version from coffee bean direct (they also offer a dark roasted version on Amazon), but the Starbucks decaf Sumatra makes a decent cup. Not perfect, but better than I expected.

review/summary: Calling all freshly ground black pepper lovers
review/text: If you like freshly ground pepper, you will love green peppercorns in brine.  The taste is different and more intense than black pepper.  You can use these anywhere you would find freshly ground black pepper appealing.<br /><br />My favorite use for this is atop salads.  I am the type that finds plain old lettuce absolutely boring and used to use gobs of blue cheese dressing or other heavy salad dressings to force myself to eat salad.  Green peppercorns sprinkled atop a salad give it incredible zing and I use substantially less dressing now, as this gives such a sharp, vivid flavor.  Peppercorns also make steak and cooked vegetables totally delicious.<br /><br />All that said, I do think that this is one of those products that you will either love or hate.  But if you are a fan of freshly-ground black pepper, or if you enjoy the difference in taste among black, pink, and white peppercorns, I suspect you will like this product as much as I do.  A pack of 12 is a bit much in my opinion, but a 6 pack would be reasonable.<br /><br />By the way, Gaban Co., Ltd (a Japanese brand which may or may not be available in the US, sorry not sure... maybe an Asian supermarket?) discontinued its line of green peppercorns for a while and just brought them back about a year ago.  They are FABULOUS.  Absolutely stunning (it's the quality of the brine).  So go with the Gaban brand first and foremost whenever possible, and barring that, try these.

review/summary: Unhealthy... Look at the Ingredients
review/text: I fed my dog Iams Proactive Health for five years before realizing that it is a very unhealthy, low-quality, and species-innappropriate dog food.<br /><br />The package states "No fillers."  However, take a look at the first five ingredients...chicken, corn meal, ground whole grain sorghum, chicken byproduct meal, dried beet pulp.  The last four of the first five ingredients are fillers!  Also, the first ingredient, chicken, probably occupies a lower position on the list because, after cooking, most of the moisture is lost and chicken is about 80% moisture. [1][2]<br /><br />As to being species-inappropriate, have you ever heard of a wolf attacking a corn stalk?<br /><br />After I started researching dog food, I switched my dog to Taste of the Wild, a grain-free kibble, and Bravo Balance, raw dog food.  When my dog was eating Iams, she often left food in her bowl for several hours.  Now she eats her food as soon as I give it to her.  Also, her coat is softer and she doesn't get constipated anymore (she did every now and then eating Iams).<br /><br />Yes, Iams is "vet-recommended" and my vet approved of it.  However, I have reason to believe that many vets have been improperly and undereducated in nutrition, and the education that they do receive is biased.  Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., which makes "Hill's Science Diet" with similar ingredients to Iams, has created and distributes a nutrition curriculum to vet schools around the world.  They also administer the Hill's vet school graduate feeding program, which provides pet food to students at no charge that they can resell for a profit.  In addition to providing course materials to veterinary students, Hills's, Iams, Purina, and other well-known manufacturers also offer additional perks for students. [3][4]<br /><br />Please, do not believe pet food companies' claims without looking at the ingredients for yourself!  It's a pay now or pay later situation.  If you feed your dog a high-quality, wholesome food now you will have to pay less in vet bills later.

These bulbs arrived in a cardboard box and each one was small enough to get into my 14" light fixture.  I replaced 6 100W incandescent bulbs with these 6 23W CFLs.  Not bad and I did not need to have all of that plastic packaging.  The bulbs do come on immediately, but as with most, they need about 120s to full hit maximum light output.  I liked these so much, I'm thinking about buying the candelabra six pack for another fixture.<br /><br />Now only time will tell if this was a good investment.  Will they really last?  I hope so.

review/summary: Very Bright, The Right Light
review/text: I received 2 sets of these super compact bulbs already and about to order another dozen.  The light is soft, unlike the typical "daylight" fluorescent bulbs and gives out even bright light.  As you turn the lights on, it has to "warm" up I guess as the light starts off a little less bright and over a minute or so, gets to full brightness... small price to pay for something that is so energy efficient.<br /><br />I have a dimmer on a light in my living room and no, it doesn't work in a dimmer and only turns on and off, but, I keep them in anyway and the change in current doesn't seem to affect the bulbs negatively.<br /><br />Well recommended.  I currently use them in my ceiling fans (6 bulbs) my living room light (4 bulbs) my bedroom (3 lights) and 2 sets of standing lamps (6 bulbs) obviously I like them.  I am considering trying the higher wattage for a brighter light, but they don't seem to be super compacts, just the compacts, so they would work fine in just about any fixture.  Great product.

review/text: These are great bulbs, but 2 of the 6 arrived broken.  I can't ship them back - it's illegal to ship toxic materials, and CFLs qualify.  Further, having received them broken, who knows how and where the mercury that was in them went?  I unpacked carefully and left the broken ones in their boxes, but..... I imagine it's still in the packaging somewhere.<br /><br />It's illegal to toss these in the trash in MI (and a number of other states) - and immoral.  Yet because I purchased them from Amazon, instead of locally (can't find them locally) it seems I can't take them in to the retailer, as I'm supposed to be able to do for disposal.<br /><br />So now I have 2 broken bulbs and no idea of how to properly handle their disposal.<br /><br />That doesn't even address the problem that I paid for 6 and got 4.

review/text: ORIGINAL REVIEW: Don't you hate how standard 100W (equivalent) CFL bulbs are always HUGE and won't fit into a normal lamp or overhead fixture?  Well, look no further than this product!<br /><br />Finally a COMPACT 100W (equivalent) CFL Light bulb!<br /><br />These bulbs put out equivalent light to 100W bulbs (using only 23W) and are very compact!  They are the same physical size as a NORMAL light bulb!  I needed these for several of my overhead lights and lamps which couldn't take a larger sized bulb, but that I still wanted to put a BRIGHT CFL bulb into.  These bulbs produce a comfortable "warm" white color that is not blue at all!  The color is perfect, almost identical to an incandescent bulb.<br /><br />According to the packaging, these bulbs are supposed to last for 10,000 hours! (That's much longer than the lifespan of a standard bulb) Also, all six bulbs arrived very well packaged and all of them work great so far. (None were broken)<br /><br />UPDATE: After 5 months of light use, one of these bulbs started flickering and turning off randomly (while the switch was in the "on" position).  I replaced it with another of the same type of bulb, and the problem went away.  Am now questioning the supposed "10,000 hour lifespan" that these are supposed to deliver...<br /><br />UPDATE 2: After 7 months of normal use, another bulb has started flickering and turning off randomly, just like the first one that went bad, and had to be replaced also!  STAY AWAY FROM THESE BULBS!  They don't last anything close to 10,000 hours!  More like 1,000 hours...<br /><br />Frankly, for the price I paid for these, I expected better quality.

review/summary: Economical Ecological "Yellow Mellow" Bulbs +++
review/text: I am immediately very happy with the great quality of these fine Earthmate 23 Watt Super Mini-Spiral 2700K Bulbs. They are constructed very solidly, yet are compact, about the same size as a small regular older-tech 100 Watt bulb. I was able to immediately replace most of my overhead light-fixture bulbs with these. The 2700K color is so nice, I did so, after trying-out the first one. They seem cool to the touch as compared to my older bulbs -- I got burned a bit when un-screwing an older 60 Watt bulb that had been on for only twenty minutes. Yet, these 23 Watt bulbs seem easily as bright as my older 100 Watt ones. But, at only 23 Watts, I am going to replace almost every older bulb with these Earthmate 23 Watt ones. They are bright, yet yellow mellow [slightly-golden creamy-white], good for about any indoor fixtures I have. I retain a newer-tech [hallogen] floodlamp for my reading chair -- but may change even that one for one of these CFL Super Mini-Spirals as they are so bright and cheerful. These are at once economical, ecological and cheerful. If they really last as long as claimed I will be a long-term user of them +++

review/summary: Compact and nice color but not instant on
review/text: If you are just starting out with CFL's this is a great bulb to begin with. It has that similar warm color to the traditional incandescent bulbs you are used to and not that "white" light that many other CFL's put out. So if you have never used CFL's before these are great and the one to start with. Plus they are the super mini size, not just compact, which means they are so small they fit in just about every light fixture. These are way better than any bulb I purchased from my local home improvement store, and less expensive too. My only complaint is that they are advertised as "instant on" but they are not. I guess it depends on what you mean by instant on. Yes, they do turn on right away, but they are very dim and don't get up to a descent brightness for at least 20 seconds, maybe 30. So keep that in mind as to where you use them, as this is a big negative if used in certain areas where you need immediate light. If they did turn on at full brightness right away I would have given this 5 stars. Still, it's well built, nice packaging, 1/4 the mercury in other CFL bulbs, very small super mini size, and the normal incandescent color you are used to - this is a fantastic bulb.

review/summary: Thrilled with the small size, but iffy quality.
review/text: Bought 2 sets of 6, needed 8.  None arrived broken, but one did not work at all, and one blew out the next day, so I'm really wondering if they will last anything near the 7 years promised.<br />I am however thrilled to find CFL's that both fit in my small (maybe 12", 2 bulb) overhead fixtures and give a nice amount of light.  Previous attempts either resulted in cracked bulbs as we tried to fit the fixture cover around them, or those that were small enough to fit, gave out so little light that my dog was asking for a seeing eye dog.<br />So, even though the power use savings is probably negated by the dud bulbs, I would be pleased if these last a few years because they give off great light, and not having to change the bulbs in the tricky overhead lights for years would be worth the cost!

review/summary: Good  - but beware - labelled incorrectly as dimmable on Amazon
review/text: These lamps were at first look very good & bright as well as energy efficient<br />(I remember my old man would only use 25w light bulbs when we were kids as "they saved energy and money" - little did I know he was predicting a future path we needed to take so the hole in the ozone layer wasn't bigger than Australia)<br />Unfortunately I bought these for the purpose of using them in dimmable fixtures - to allow situation lighting as well as energy efficiency and reducing my carbon footprint.  They are labelled as dimmable on Amazon (still are as at date of this review!) and are in fact not - and as such they cannot be used in dimmable circuits without risk of fire or early failure (fire according to info I have read).  I sent them back & Amazon happily refunded my money - I will search for real dimmable flouros now...

review/summary: Excellent energy saver mini CFL lightbulbs
review/text: Bought these 23-Watt and also the 20-Watt for several fixtures. The compact size is perfect and they are very bright, which is what we needed. The 14-Watt bulbs you see at all the stores don't always provide enough light, but these do and they are the same size.<br /><br />Also, the environmentally responsible packaging makes these a much better "green" purchase.

review/summary: It's not very "green" to have to throw out toxic broken bulbs...or buy replacements for them!
review/text: These bulbs DO have a lovely, bright light that is much warmer and enjoyable than the traditional eco flourescent bulbs with their cold blue light. That's what I usually hated about the compact flourescents, so I was super excited about these bulbs. But with Amazon's terrible packaging, plus Earthmate's equally terrible packaging, I got *3* of 6 bulbs broken on arrival! What a waste. I have a baby around and besides the inconvenience of a return, it's dangerous to have these shards pouring out of my package as soon as I open it. Not to mention apparently these things are toxic once broken. So a big fat thumbs-down on this purchase, despite the beautiful light of the remaining three. I will be looking for another site to purchase them from, one where the packaging has a better reputation. On Amazon's good side, though, is that the customer service was very helpful and I got a full refund with one phone call.<br /><br />Yeah, PS - It's hard (impossible?) to find anywhere to dispose of BROKEN mercury-containing CFL bulbs. So I tried to contact Earthmate to figure out what to do. Guess what - no phone number on their website. Not even an email address unless you want to be a wholesaler for them! So a word to the wise...NEVER TRUST A 7-YEAR WARRANTY FROM A COMPANY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE NUMBER!!<br /><br />I did some detective work and these lights are made by a parent company called Litetronics (not to be confused with the apparently reputable Lightronics). Their number is (800) 860-3392 if you would like to pursue a similar complaint.

review/text: We've used compact fluorescent bulbs all over the house for years.  They save money on the electric bill, and they save time.  They last much longer than incandescent bulbs, so we don't have to replace them nearly as often.  In addition, they exude far less heat, which decreases the need for air conditioning in the summer.

review/text: These worked great - at first.  I used two of them to replace bulbs in a drop ceiling, and they fit fine, came on right away (although at a dimmer setting), and reached full brightness relatively quickly.<br /><br />The problem is that they did not last "nine years" as advertised. In fact both bulbs burnt out within a few days of each other, after approximately 10 months of light use.  Considering that these are priced as if you would replace them after nine years of use, I paid way, way too much for these bulbs.

review/summary: Great bulbs, but too bright for me
review/text: I had originally bought this pack of 6 hoping to replace the recessed lighting in my new kitchen. Read prior reviews saying that 23 watt would not be bright enough, even though this is generating an equivalent of 100 watts. I have four recessed spots in kitchen, and after installing, figured they were way too bright. When I say TOO bright, they were eye-piercing bright. So I instead got the 15 watt ones instead, and they were more than enough. Unless, you are showcasing something inside or are using it outside on the patio, the 13 watt or 15 watt CFLS should be more than enough.

review/summary: So far, so good.
review/text: My initial response to the lamp is very favorable - 1650 lumens @ 23 watts, reasonable price, promise of long life. It brightens up my area of use as hoped.<br />I chose the 3-star rating at this point because it is really too early to review a product  purported to last 7 years. If its performance remains close to the initial for a long time, it would rate 5 stars. Who knows?  My prior experience with "7-year" compact fluorescents isn't as compelling as the manufacturer's<br />advertising.  Amazon.com, of course, doesn't guarantee products for 7 years, but they referred me to the manufacturer, LITETRONICS, which says it does<br />stand by the Earthmate lamps.  I asked them about how a customer accesses the guarantee, if necessary, in the future.  They had to have a corporate<br />discussion, or something, before they responded,  but I received useful information. If any other purchaser is concerned about the guarantee, I suggest a<br />phone call or e-mail to Litetronics.  I learned from my discussion that one should be diffident about "stockpiling" a bunch of lamps for future use.  The<br />guarantee begins on the date of purchase.  [Save your Amazon sales receipt (for up to 7 years, if you wish).]

review/summary: Not what I expected
review/text: Since being introduced to gelato some years back, I set out recently to find a way to make authentic gelato at home. The process of doing so can be somewhat time consuming. Most recipes call for the creation of a custard base, which can sometimes be a little tricky to achieve without curdling the egg yolks, and also requires the base to chill for several hours (or more) before making the gelato. The finished gelato itself, then, will also need to sit in the freezer for several hours (or more) before it arrives at its perfect frozen state.<br /><br />So when I saw this product on Amazon, I was very excited about the prospect of shaving several hours off the process. I could not find an ingredients list, or much information at all, about what I would ACTUALLY find in the canister, but I made an assumption , and indeed was hoping, that the egg yolks in pasteurized and powdered form, along with the flavorings and sweetener, would be there so it would yield all the rich texture while saving time.<br /><br />My assumption was wrong. Here is what the canister holds, in order: sugar, Bellagio premium cocoa powder, natural flavoring. No eggs. Each canister contains two foil pouches (yielding about a quart of ice cream) and a small booklet that includes a recipe for making mousse in addition to gelato. It also includes ideas for add-ins, infusions, and mix-ins.<br /><br />Surprised but still hopeful and wanting to see how the recipe would turn out, I made it in my Delonghi gelato maker. Here is my verdict on the finished product: It is tasty (the chocolate taste is good and dense though more milk chocolate than I'd expected) but lacks the rich texture of gelato. It is more like an ice milk. I may see if I can make the recipe a little closer to the way I usually make gelato, by heating the cocoa mixture in the milk/cream, then tempering the egg yolks, and mixing them together. But doing so almost completely wipes out any advantage of using the gelato starter. I suppose it might save a step or two along the way, but it really will not save much time.<br /><br />I bought a two-pack of the Decadent Chocolate and a two-pack of the vanilla bean variety. In retrospect, I would not have bought them. But I will try making the mousse so that I can use up the remainder of my purchase. And I will probably try adapting the starter with egg yolks (as mentioned above) to see if it yields a truer gelato. But all in all, I am unhappy with this product and regret purchasing it.

review/text: I ordered the full dozen gourmet dipped strawberries for my wife for Valentine's day and did so online. I also qualified for a double order because of a promotion. The order I received stated my wife would receive the berries on or before 2/14. Valentine's day came and went, no berries. The next day I tried to use the tracking number through UPS. It didn't work. I called their customer service number and after giving my name, my email address, my home address, and the order number the woman wanted to know who the "recipient" was. I said it was my wife. She said that was incorrect. This went back and forth for a while during which the customer service person was being ruder and ruder and stated that I needed the "magic name" of whom was to receive the package and she couldn't help me unless I gave that. This went on for five minutes until I just stated my own name which was the correct response. If she had asked what name was on the package as generated by the computer when one clicks, "ship to same name and address as billing information," that might have been clearer.<br />After more exchanges, I just asked for my credit card to be credited back and that I did not want their product. The present was late and pretty much pointless as a Valentine's day gift a day after and given the package was shipped in dry ice, it was not likely to be fresh. Eventually, the customer service lady said she credited back my card and let me know after waiting 5 minutes for that to clear. She said I should see it back on my card in 5 to seven days. The berries did arrive but the ice was melted and we opted not to eat the berries as they were room temperature. So while they "gifted" the berries, there wasn't anything to "gift." And, the double order that was part of the promotion was not in the box.<br />Bottom line, they made a promise to have the gift to my wife on or before Valentine's day, they did not deliver. My wife was a good sport about it but it was very disappointing. I can overlook quite a bit but it has been a long time since I was treated so rudely by a customer service person and I would never buy anything from "Shari's Berries" again. Caveat emptor!

review/summary: Only 11 in the box
review/text: Very yummy, but the gift I received was supposed to be a dozen but I only received 11! I really feel as though my friend was taken advantage of when purchasing this gift for me. When you pay this much for a dozen you should get a dozen, not 11.

review/summary: EPIC FAILURE!
review/text: I ordered a dozen strawberries hoping for a tasty treat to share on valentines day.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when instead I received a dozen multicolored roses and small box of 5 chocolates. This is the second item I ordered and received today that was not what I ordered.<br /><br />THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!! EPIC FAIL!!!

review/summary: Poor Product, Poor Customer Service Response
review/text: Double order on a promotion.  Arrived on time, with ice somewhat intact, but berries were poor quality, some so green they were crunchy,  some with an odd chemical taste that seemed to be associated with a clear liquid that oozed from inside the coating around the berries, some with grey discolorations. The chocolate /candy coatings seemed tasteless, but may have been overwhelmed by the chemical taste.  We sampled half of them, threw them all out.  Note to customer service generated no response, not even an apology which would have been good enough. I am so glad I ordered these sent to me instead of directly to the intended recipient.  Feel as tho I dodged a bullet there

review/summary: hidden charges. late delivery. poor quality
review/text: not happy when a gift is embarrassing in terms of how cheap / lousy it is.  This vendor is counting that the sender never sees the product.  To add insult to injury...they keep on sending junk mail despite my repeated asking to be removed from their email list

review/text: I ordered two dozen for my daughters wedding shower, they were huge and very good, would recommend them, I have sent two more orders this Easter, so am waiting to hear how the recipients liked them. I personally don't like flowers so this was a good alternative. My fingers are crossed.

review/summary: not really chocolate
review/text: no cocoa butter: this (and all other products by this vendor) and not made with milk, white or dark chocolate, at best some of it can be called chocolate flavored.<br /><br />The FDA has rules on what can be called milk, white or dark chocolate, these can not be called that because there is no cocoa butter. It can't be called chocolate flavored either because the white substance contains zero ingredients from the cocoa bean.<br /><br />An internet search for this vendor will show what the product really looks like, berries without leaves at times, easy saver fraud and so much more. There are a lot of other companies that really do make chocolate strawberries: this is not one of them.

review/summary: Don't waste your money
review/text: These berries are mediocre at best. The berries aren't that good, and the chocolate is more like chocolate topping than real chocolate. We ate them, yes, but will definitely look elsewhere next time. Incidentally, my friend just told me that Shari's Berries is owned by the same company that owns ProFlowers. I do like ProFlowers, but will be boycotting them and all companies affiliated with them due to their continued support of Rush Limbaugh's views.

review/summary: Low-Carb Brownies
review/text: It's hard to call this a mix because you have to add so much stuff like baking chocolate, heavy cream, and more.  You can certainly tell they are not the real thing, but in the end it's great to have something that is almost a brownie.  They taste best if you dip them in fat free cool whip to mask that "low-carb" taste.

review/summary: These are Great!
review/text: I was a little sceptical when I bought these, normally I find diet food unappealing. These are great though, They have the exact texture of a brownie and a rich chocolate taste. They are not sweet but I don't mind that at all, just sprinkle a little splenda on them or low carb whip cream and there you go! The BEST thing of all is that there are no sugar alcohols! I love this b/c sugar alcolhols don't agree with me and I try to avoid them. I will keep buying these and want to try more from Dixie if they are as good as these brownies.
