review/summary: Great product
review/text: I thought I would try these as a last attempt at getting my dogs to take Glucosamine willingly- It worked even for my 3 lb chihuahua who won't eat any treats!!! I have 3 chihuahuas and a doberman and they all love these!! I will warn you- they smell horrible, but I have found the worse a treat smells the more the pups like them!! lol. I will be buying these again!

review/summary: My dog actually liked the flavor!
review/text: Very happy to see a product that actually backed up what they said about the flavor.  Have purchased other products that stated they were "bacon" flavored and dogs love them.  Couldn't get my dogs to eat them (one of them usually eats anything).  I have no problem getting my dogs to eat the Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dogs Treats.  I've noticed a slight improvement in their movement.  Haven't been using the product that long so it will be good to see how their movement improves over time.

review/summary: Absolute must in my house
review/text: Both of my dogs have torn their ACL's in their life, with that came the process of PT and a diet change. We started to give these once a day to the girls, and they couldn't LOVE it more. which makes me LOVE it because they take these easily and are getting great vitamins in the process. I wish I knew about these sooner, I would absolutely  give them to all future dogs I have as well. I was so sad when my local stores stopped selling them, and now solely get them through amazon. The service is so quick and easy. Overall I couldn't say enough great things about this product!

review/summary: Great product, dogs love them
review/text: My dogs love these treats.  I've been giving them these treats for several years now.  They go nuts when they know they are going to get one, and my vet recommends the supplements for them as they get older.  They are a bit pricey, but I think they are worth it.  Much better now that Amazon is carrying them directly.  I can also say that the manufacturer stands by their products 100%.  I used to buy these in a 3 pack from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon.  On my last shipment, it was very noticeable that in all 3 bags, the treats were very hard and brittle, despite being well before the use by date printed on the bag and the packaging being intact (no holes).  I emailed the manufacturer, and within just a few days they shipped me 3 new bags without any hassle.  Now that is Customer Service!

review/summary: I like them. My dog doesn't like them so much.lol.
review/text: I have an 8 year old female German Shepherd. Lately I have been noticing she has a bit of a difficult time getting up and her hips always seem to be stiff.<br />Since I don't know anything about dog vitamins, I decided to take the route of these treats. I would much rather give her something she might possibly like over giving her a pill.<br /><br />Thing is, she doesn't really like these very much. I usually have to try 2 or 3 times to get her to eat. Bright side is that I can get her to eat them after a little hassle.<br /><br />The even brighter side to these treats (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3) is the fact that they do seem to be helping her stiff joints. I have only gone through one 6 oz bag of these treats and I have noticed a difference in how she stands up, walks and runs. For the first time in a while her legs don't look so stiff.<br /><br />P.S. you can get these treats cheaper on Linens and Things website(LNT.COM). You don't have to pay shipping. I paid 12.21 for a pound of these treats.

Both have had various hip and joint problems in the past, but have not had any problems since they've been taking these.  And they love them!  I've tried all the flavors, and have not had a problem with them eating it.  They think it's a yummy treat, and get excited when I pull them out.  I would definitely recommend for anyone with older dogs.

review/summary: Best way to give glucosamine that I've found
review/text: My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.<br /><br />The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight. But so far "over-medicating" has not been a problem (especially if you break them in half).<br /><br />I've been really amping up my dog's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring, and so far he's not only limp-free, but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced. All in all, we're both really happy with these. I'll be buying them again, and I'll be trying out more of Zuke's other treats.

review/text: I bought these for my 13 year old pug, who has very bad hips and arthritis, and very few teeth.<br /><br />Poor ole girl, she's a sweetheart, but getting around was hard on her.  These are soft, so she can chew them with no problem, and while she's still stiff if she's been sleeping a long time, she loosens right up once she starts moving.<br /><br />She was on Metacam, which worked just about the same, but is waaaay more expensive.  I love that these are made in the USA and part of the profits are donated to the Dog and Cat Research Fund.  These are just a win-win-win all around for us!<br /><br />Almost for got to mention....she loves them!

review/summary: Boppy gives it 5 stars
review/text: Boppy gets overly excited when Rodan (grey crane) flies up from the creek, or a squirrel raids the bird feeder.  She has torn her ACL more than once - when she takes off at top speed.  So I now get her treats with glucosamine - so much easier than trying to get a pill in her.  She like the chicken flavor best - she tried beef too.  I like that it is made in the USA.  She does much better with her hips and joints - vet tells me it is really her knee that has ACL problems.  Zukes has a great product here that I like to give her, and she enjoys the good-for-her treat.

No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages, no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products.

review/text: My elderly lab suffers from arthritis.  Her pain is greatly diminished by taking glucosamine and chondroitin.  Unfortunately she is not a fan of the gravy, chewable tablets or pill forms.  Hip Action has been a fantastic find because she actually wants her meds.  You can set a clock by her these days at 8 pm she goes into the kitchen and stares at the cupboard where we store the Hip Action and waits for her two treats.

And he loved them!<br />They are also a great value - I actually took the time and counted the number of treats in a 1 lb bag - and I got 64, which means more than 2 months of hip protection for dogs under 46 lb (you only need to give one a day).

It comes in one and a half inch squares.  It's a little big for us so we cut into smaller, bite-size pieces that are great for training.  We are still young so can't comment on the hip action part yet. I just want to give my dog a good quality treat and I think this is worth the price.

review/text: My mom purchased a variety of treats for my dog to try.  He does not have any hip problems but we needed a treat that he would not turn his nose up at and not choke on.  The pieces are 1 x 1 squares, about 3/4 of a centimeter thick.  They smell like fruity beef bullion to me even though the formula says it is chicken.  I have a Bichon Frise (5 yrs old) and he likes these treats.  The texture reminds me of a Lara Bar but just a tad firmer/dryer.

review/summary: Zukes HipAction for Dogs - Works
review/text: I have a 12 year old Corgi that has been having problems going up and down stairs, has had no interest in playing with toys over the last year.  Went to the Vet and they gave him Rimadyl.  This helped some but still was having issues, and having to carry him up and down stairs.<br /><br />Started giving him the Zukes on a whim after seeing it in the local pet store.  This stuff WORKS I am sold.  He is playing with other dogs now, goes up and down the stairs, brings toys for us to play with him again.  He is like his old self again.

The large size makes is a hearty meal and it fits perfectly into my cup holder. So, when I get to college in the morning at 7am, I can eat this wholesome breakfast and feel full most of the morning until class ends at 12:30 pm. Not too much sugar yet still flavorful. Good texture, too.<br /><br />I prefer this over the other flavors.

review/summary: Hearty, very pleasant instant oatmeal with fruity bits--a big serving, too
review/text: First thing you notice when you stir up the cup of cereal with the requisite water is that there are whole raspberries in there, not just raspberry flavoring or bits. Real fruit. Nice.<br /><br />I cooked it a bit longer (10 seconds) than the suggested time (1 minute, 45 seconds), and I let it sit three minutes. It came out fine. The texture is nice--you have real chewability here. Not mush. Real bite. And the sweetness is great for adults--not cloying, unlike cereals would appeal more to kids.<br /><br />The size is quite generous. In fact, I wish it was a bit smaller size, honestly. It's 300 calories for the whole cup (8 grams of fiber total). I find that I eat 2/3 of it and am fine. Besides, I like a variety type breakfast (ie, eggs with toast and juice, oatmeal and an egg white scramble with veggies, etc). I don't just like ONE thing (ie, oatmeal or just toast or just eggs). So, I eat part of this, save the rest to use as a dessert after dinner: I add canned peaches (or frozen) over it, sprinkle with cinnamon and add some honey, nuke it--my own little superfast peach cobbler. :)<br /><br />If you want a convenience hot cereal, this is a good choice if you like oats, barley and some subtle real fruit flavor and sweetness.<br /><br />This does have soy, though, in case you're sensitive. No dairy, though.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: "Steel-Cut Oatmeal" Veteran
review/text: Wow! Wow! What a great product. I am 70 and have been slow cooking steel-cut oatmeal for over 50 years. Now, that my 96 year old Mom is living with me and I am her caretaker, I have been looking for some nutritious short cuts and decided to give this a try. I was dubious because even some of my favorite brands like Trader Joe's Instant Oatmeal were dismal. This is the real McCoy. We both like chewy, filling hot cereal without a lot of sweet taste and this is simply delicious. One cup provides two servings - one for each of us. How thrifty is that! I still slow cook a quart of oatmeal 2x a month but am going to Subscribe & Save on this one regularly.

It adds to the texture of the product.<br /><br />-great to throw in a bag for breakfast at the office. Very convenient - add boiling water and steep several minutes, or add water and microwave the cup!<br /><br />-Great portion size: about the size of two single serve packets of oatmeal all in one<br /><br />-8 grams of fiber per cup and fairly low in sugars<br /><br />-Vegan and fairly non processed

review/text: I read the other reviews before buying.  But this cup really has whole berries in it and large chunks of peach.  I was amazed!  Great flavor and texture.  Very easy to prepare and my selective 4 1/2 yr old ate it all up!  I just wish it had less sugar.  Given that any person who makes this cup will eat it all most likely and thus has 2 servings or 18grams of sugar!  Way too much, I wish this was available in a lite sugar version.  I will have this for the kids once in a while since it is very flavorful and they eat it.  But I try not to serve that much sugar.  Whole grains are important to our bodies health, but having too much sugar is as bad as not having the whole grain.  Be sure to add an extra 20 minutes to your run time each day and you can enjoy these cups without worry!

review/summary: Real oatmeal
review/text: I've always hated instant oatmeal.  I like old fashioned thick cut rolled oats or I like steel cut.  Whenever I've tried instant versions of oatmeal in the past I've found them entirely inedible. Thin. watery, and no texture or real oatmeal flavor.  Mcdougalls oatmeal cups are so close to the "real" thing there is barely any difference.  After an initial try I ordered the 6 pack of my 3 favorite flavors.  I've been really happy with my breakfast every morning of oatmeal and tea.  My only issues are the small amount of soy used and freshness.  I'd prefer they used something else or at least be sure the soy is organic. I did find a couple of rancid cups in the batch so they need to be sure these are fresh.  Overall a great product though.

The barley ads texture an instant oatmeal lacks, while the real fruit ads a sweet and flavor that is pleasant and not too sweet or artificial. I'm trying not to burn out on these, but I crave them.  Even if I was not in a rush, I would eat them. Perfect size to make you feel pretty satisfied. "Cooking" time is long, but for the result, its very little effort. I'm subscribing to these!

review/text: I loved this cereal. I'm not much of an oatmeal fan, but this really blew me away. The peaches and raspberries inside really add to the flavor and make it absolutely delicious. It has a really fresh taste which makes it seem a lot like homemade oatmeal that takes 3 hours to make. But it only takes 5 minutes after you add boiling water. I highly recommend this oatmeal to people who don't like oatmeal because it is unbelievably tasty and much healthier than the sugar-laden cereals or donuts people sometimes will eat for breakfast.

But I do like oatmeal, and have enjoyed other Dr. McDougall's products, so I gave this a shot.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed. It tastes better than most other instant oatmeals. The fruit bits add plenty of sweetness and there are enough to get some in every bite. The portion size is substantial and has 300 calories for the whole cup which is not too much for breakfast.<br /><br />My only advisory is that if you do not like your oatmeal too "soupy" add less than the recommended amount of water.

review/text: I know how healthy oatmeal is supposed to be for you, but I have never found a brand with a flavor much less a texture that I could ever tolerate. No matter how much I doctored it up, it was still slimy stuff with pieces of other stuff in it.<br />  I thought I would give it one more try, and lo and behold, this is the best oatmeal I have EVER EATEN in my ENTIRE LIFE. And I am in my 60's!!!! If you have ever had an aversion to oatmeal as I have, you WILL be able to eat this oatmeal.  Perhaps it is the mixture of the barley and dried fruit that does it.<br />  My first cup I tried straight up, and it was sweet and delightful.  Next cup I tried adding some brown sugar, but you know, I think it was a bit too sweet, and I decided it was just fine all on its own.<br />  The portion is large and very filling, it makes a satisfying breakfast.<br />Bottom line, I am hooked for life on this stuff.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed. 8-)

The ginger ale is a little bland, and the raspberry tea is very pungent. this orange is just right, fruity and citrusy. perfect! I love this drink!

review/summary: I like all the Celsius Drinks
review/text: Celsius drinks are low carbonated and that is important to me.  My very favorites are the orange and the wildberry.  Thay do not burn calories.  They burn calories if you exercise and eat right.  I think that is quite funny but also misleading if you don't read the fine print.

review/summary: Celsius "YES", but Orange Flavor is a "NO" for me
review/text: I started drinking one 12 ounce can of Celsius 15 minutes prior to weight and cardio workouts, and have found Celsius brand to be far superior to Monster in the energy boost it gives me.  Each 12 ounce can has 200mg of caffeine (check out the Celsius website...) so I don't drink any coffee on the mornings I'm off to the gym as when I do drink both, I tend to get jittery instead of 'boosted'.<br /><br />Celsius' fat burning claims come from the thermogenesis angle.  Meaning it will keep your metabolism fired up for a longer period of time (up to 3 hours post-workout) and thus you can potentially burn up to 100 extra calories.  It has ginger, chromium and green tea - all favored for their 'fat burning' properties, along with high vitamin C and B vitamins.  No sugar, no carbs, no preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup, no trans fats and very low sodium (6mg) make this a good energy drink choice in my book.  THIS flavor however, makes me want to gag!<br /><br />Orange flavor is a 'sparkling' version of Celsius.  Slightly carbonated, it could taste like a soda - Fresca would be the closest thing to it in my mind - but for me it simply tastes bitter and tough to swallow.  I do generally like orange flavored drinks, so this surprised me. I also found I had an upset stomach after drinking it.<br /><br />I do like two of the non-sparkling Celsius drinks and would recommend you try a few flavors before buying a case of them.  My favorite so far is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSVOLM">Celsius�, Raspberry Acai, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and if I can't find that one, I'll drink <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RSRUPG">Celsius�, Peach Mango, 12 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  Neither tastes bitter to me, nor overly sweet.  There is no aftertaste and my stomach tolerated them well.<br /><br />One thing to note when using this supplement, it does seem to act as a diuretic.  I have to urinate a lot for several hours after drinking just one.  They say on the website that you can drink up to 3 a day (that's 600mg of caffeine a day...) and do not recommend this drink to anyone who is 12 or under, or caffeine intolerant.<br /><br />Check out their website for studies relating to fat loss and this product.

review/summary: Replace the "black cup of coffee"
review/text: I am in my mid 20s, approx height 5'8". For a good part of my college years I was 220-250lbs, I have since dropped down to 175 (weight loss not related to this drink). I began a rigorous workout routine once I reached my ideal weight to eliminate the love handles. Working full time and attending Masters Degree classes part time, with a few hours a week spent at the gym, really takes a toll on the energy level. Preworkout I drink Jack3d with A-Akg powder. That product let me tell you is the best thing since slice bread. I am big on Monster Absolute Zero, and if that is not available Monster Low Carb. So when I dropped by the Vitamin Shop a few days ago and the salesman who most certainly knows what he is talking about, dudes rock solid, suggested I try Celsius. Handed me 4 cans of this flavor, "Sparkling Orange". Upon initial taste results, it reminds me of Soda. I have not drank soda in upwards of 2 years. This brought all those couch potato memories back, till I rotated the can and read the ingredients. That quickly made the lazy days disappear once more. This drink is loaded with the energy stuff you will expect from a drink such as monster, BUT with a change of pace in taste. It does not taste anything like a redbull or monster or even rockstar, this unique taste separates it from all the energy boosters I've tasted in the passed. Long story short, this does pack a kick. Today is a perfect example, I worked a full shift on 8 hours of sleep, 8am-4pm, worked out at the gym from 9pm-11pm, slept 2 hours, and got up to go into work at 4am, pickup a few hours of overtime, drank a can and I am feeling GREAT. The energy boost is enlightening. So if you are looking for a good energy booster at a better price than most, this is it for you. I love Monster Absolute zero, but it is more than twice the price per can.

review/summary: Weight Loss vs. Energy Drink
review/text: If you are looking for a product that is going to help you lose weight, then perhaps look elsewhere. This drink has a lot of good ingredients in it, but like nearly everything out there on the market, it chiefly relies on thermogenics, with the main active of caffeine. Caffeine's effectiveness is affected by the fact that your body builds a tolerance to it, so as a weightloss "program," the effectiveness of this product decreases over time (and you're only talking maybe 2 weeks here, depending on how often you take it).<br /><br />If, however, you are looking for an energy drink, I'd HIGHLY recommend Celsius. I started drinking this stuff a few years back before its distribution was up, and I've not been disappointed. It will definitely ramp you up, and because its very low sugar, you don't have the associated crash you get with drinks like Monster and Rockstar. Plus, the Ginger is a nice touch. I typically have big energy dips after meals, but it I drink one of these before or during a meal (like lunch), I don't experience the dip. My educated guess is that the ginger (which aids in digestion) is a big part of this, and it's an ingredient you don't find in other drinks.<br /><br />Tastes, vary from person to person, but I find Celsius's flavor strangely addictive. I drink the Wild Berry and the Sparkling Orange.<br /><br />Overall, this product gets my highest praises, and the shipping on it is lightning fast (like, 2 days to get to my door on regular shipping). Just know what you are putting into your body, and realize there is a fairly heavy dose of caffeine in this stuff (200 mg).

review/text: I really love this stuff!  It tasted kind of weird at first but I got used to it real quick and now I look forward to drinking them.

I had been getting up at 4:30 am to make myself walk a couple of miles on the treadmill but now I take one of these with me and by mile 2 I just don't want to quit walking.  I started this about 2 weeks ago and have lost 5 lbs so far, and that's even with partying in Reno for 3 days.<br /><br />I feel great, full of energy!  I'm up to 4 miles on the treadmill in about an hour. I will drink another celsius around lunch time and it keeps me going for the rest of the afternoon.  I highly recommend this drink.

review/summary: Effective Energy Drink - Recommended
review/text: Celsius Calorie Burner Orange is every bit (or more so) as energizing as any of the other energy drinks (Monster, AMP, etc), and it has a fairly good orange flavor. We tried this after trying the very good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00153B3KW">Celsius Calorie Burner, Cola, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and it comes in close second in taste.<br /><br />While I can't really confirm that this actually burns 100 Calories just by drinking a whole can, it certainly would not surprise me since this does pack a serious kick. I drink a can of Celsius about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking "too much" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my son tried one before his workout and got "jittery". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is an effective energy drink but it isn't as good tasting as the Cola flavor (which I even put it on automatic reorder) but is much better than the Green Tea Raspberry version (which other people seem to like).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: I do my workouts in the morning and this celsius flavor is definitely my "workout partner". It tastes more like ginger ale then an orange drink. I have tried a bunch of flavors but this one is my favorite and it's easy to find elsewhere like publix, vitamin shoppe, and costco... however amazon.com has the best prices! I have tried to workout in the morning without having one and my performance/energy is literally nonexistent. For beachbody workouts like Insanity, Chalean Extreme and now I'm doing TurboFire this is a great energy drink to have that only has 10 calories and no sugar/aspartame. I also like to have one in the afternoon if I need a pick-me-up. I keep wondering if it is too good to be true- I highly recommend!

review/summary: Celsius does what it says for me.
review/text: I bought some of this stuff at Costco. Then I drank about 3/4 of an 8oz can before I went to Ballys.  Wow what a difference it made for me.  Up to now, I always would take an cytomax drink with me because I would get the sugar shakes and/or have an energy lag or crash during my workout that the extra carbs in the drink would mitigate.  Anyway, I did not use one this day and I felt so energized that I swore that this product would be taken off the market for being too good.  I am 62 and I felt like this was a drink from the fountain of youth.  I did not get a low sugar crash even though I worked out longer and harder then I have for ages.  (I usually work out 2 or 3 times a week). While I was riding high during my workout I thought that I would pay an energy price later.  Nope! I was just energized the rest of the day and was able to sleep fine when I went to bed at night.  This stuff worked for me.

My favorite so far are sparkling orange and peach mango green tea. Both are enjoyable and rewarding with the results I get from drinking one a day. They are the major reason i'm back in great shape and can perform at the highest ability in anything active.

review/text: I have been drinking Celsius now for around 6-8 months. Prior to that, I had tried several of the other energy drinks out there, and always regretted it later because of all the extra calories in them. When I first found Celsius, I figured it was too good to be true (it claims to actually burn up to 100 calories per can). While I cannot comment on the calorie burning effect, I do find it has a great taste, the best of any energy drink out there that I have tried, and does give me a "boost" of energy. I drink one every morning.<br /><br />Overall, I love this product. I will purchasing this from Amazon (which was almost $20 cheaper for the 24 pack than the store I normally go to) on a regular basis from now on.

review/text: OK truth is, I do believe these help somewhat because I will be needing to go to the bathroom more and I WILL be sweating a lot more during my work outs.  But one flaw that it looks like some disagree with me on.  The taste is bloody awful!<br /><br />Let me say I am addicted to soda.... REALLY REALLY REALLY addicted to soda, so when these first came out a few years ago in cola, ginger ale and Lemon/lime i was quick to give these a try... The taste gave me nightmares, yes the taste actually gave me nightmares.  So after i finished the case i bought I was thinking i'd never drink them again.  But as of last year I got really serious with  my diet and remembered that these did indeed get me to sweat alot more, so i went ahead and ordered a 24 pack of these orange flavored ones.  Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach/Mango are the better ones.  They all taste awful to me and they give me a reason to keep going with my diet so i never have to consider drinking these again.<br /><br />So yeah they help, but the worst tasting drink ever in my opinion.

review/summary: UPDATED: RECIEVED RANCID OIL
review/text: I recieved this oil last week and it is rancid. It smells and tastes like rotten tomatos or avacados and there is no way I could eat this on any type of salad. Both cans arrived in perfect condition and neither are near the expiration date on the bottle. I recommend purchasing from a local retailer so it can be taken back if its rancid. Its too much of a gamble buying from Amazon when you cannot return food items. Lesson learned.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/05/2011: After reading so many reviews about how good this product was I contacted La Tourangelle through their email system and told them about the situation and asked how this avocado oil was supposed to taste. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to taste the way it did or not. I didn't ask for replacements or anything because I know a lot of companies will not back their product if sold by Amazon. That is not the case with La Tourangelle. I was contacted by Diane through email about a week later asking for the batch numbers. I gave them and didn't hear anything back, until today. About an hour ago UPS delivered a box that contained two large cans of oil; one can of Avocado oil and one can of Hazelnut oil. I was so surprised because I didn't even remember giving them my address, but now recall it was required on their email submission form. At any rate La Tourangelle went above and beyond and they will be getting my business in the future, but only in a B&M store or through their website. That is the only place I can recommend anyone buy these products because Amazon will not take back food items.<br /><br />As far as the oil, the new Avocado oil tastes like real Avocados with no rancid taste or smell and the Hazelnut is out of this world. I plan to try them all out now, from the La Tourangelle website. Companies that go above and beyond will always get my business because they actually care about their product. Thank you La Tourangelle!

review/summary: A flavorful alternative to extra virgin olive oil for high temperature cooking
review/text: I bought Avocado Oil specifically for two reasons: one, because it is very similar to olive oil in texture and smell, yet brings a new flavor component to my cooking, and secondly and most importantly for me . . . it has a much higher smoke/burn point than extra virgin olive oil--even higher than Canola oil, grapeseed oil and yes, even safflower oil. I've also read that it's just as healthy. The smoke point of avocado oil is somewhere north of 500F! Roughly 520F in fact. That's amazing, and gives me the versatility I need to quick-fire or sear virtually anything under high heat. La Tourangelle's Avocado Oil, one of the few I've tried, tastes great! Fresh and subtly aromatic.<br /><br />Basically, this has been the cure to my burned olive oil blues. That's an especially nice thing, since I have a hyper-sensitive smoke detector and have little room for error when it comes to smoke. To sum it up, though I don't always cook with it (I still use olive oil for low and medium temperature cooking), I love having avocado oil close at hand, for those times when I need it. It actually won't replace your olive oil though, because it has a somewhat different flavor, but it is a flavor I love. Avocado oil is ingenious (and a somewhat new discovery), and La Tourangelle is a trusted producer of the finest of fine edible oils. I trust their brand for some other less well-known oils as well.<br /><br />Highly and enthusiastically recommended--to the point that I'm trying to persuade my family and friends to start cooking with Avocado oil.

review/summary: This is really a 10-STAR item--go buy it right now!
review/text: Although olive oil is healthy for you, I guess I've never found one I really loved the flavor of--either NO flavor or tastes a bit like paint thinner--or the price was astronomical; whatever the case I'd become quite frustrated in my search.  Then I learned that when an oil smokes, it releases carcinogens into the air and free radicals within the oil.  Olive oil should NOT be heated beyond 325 degrees F.  So, in searching for an oil with a higher smoke point PLUS staying within a "paleo" eating way of life I discovered Avocado Oil.  This is my new holy grail of oils:  it's got a smoke point of 510 degrees F, tastes wonderful, is made from a healthy fat, looks gorgeous in a homemade vinaigrette due to its beautiful green color.<br /><br />This oil should be refrigerated when opened; the cans have an expiration date of 8/2011--they'll be long used up by then.  When my cans arrived, they had dented in a little bit--which I promptly got out by gently squeezing the cans (the metal is quite pliant).  I did advise Amazon that they need to wrap the cans in heavy bubble wrap to prevent this.  Somehow this oil is not yet well known--but it should and will be.  Hope Amazon keeps stocking it.<br /><br />I would DEFINITELY, HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!

review/summary: Great Product,poor shipping package
review/text: The product is wonderful. However, the package contents were all bent and dinged when it arrived. I suspect the lack of expertise and lack of air-packets in packaging. One can was almost bent to a point of puncture.

review/summary: Great Oil but.......
review/text: Love this oil. Use for everything from cooking to cosmetic use. Makes a great (out of the sun) moisturizer for my face and a wonderful hair treatment oil. But I just found a website that sells in larger quantities for a better price. Example: They charge $24.15 for a gallon and $11.65 for shipping. That's less that $40.00. Where here you pay for more. Don't know if I can put up the site.....but it is located in Tucson AZ and search for avocado oil bio genesis. Please let them know if you are buying for cooking or cosmetic use. I buy cooking and use for both.

review/summary: THE highest smoke point of any oil out there!
review/text: I only recently started cooking steaks on a cast-iron skillet and I'm not sure I want to cook future steaks any other way!<br /><br />Well, when you go down this road, you will quickly learn that olive oil, canola oil, have relatively low smoke points.  A smoke point is the highest temperature you can heat your oil before your smoke detector goes off. ;-)<br /><br />Olive oil is around 325 deg.F.  Avocado oil is the highest at 520 deg.F. !<br /><br />Now I still produce smoke, but nothing like before.  The only downside of searing steaks in a super heated cast iron skillet was the smoke produced, now I can lessen the smoke and enjoy some amazing steaks.  Win/Win! Oh and as I understand it, avocado oil has less saturated fats than even olive oil, but I'm sure eating all this extra red meat doesn't really help. :-P

review/summary: The Best Cooking Oil -- EVER!
review/text: I still can't believe this isn't sold at my local supermarket. We use this oil on virtually everything! Baked chicken tenders taste like fried with a little spritz of this stuff. It gives everything we put it on a buttery taste that so isn't butter. I have bought 4 units, and can expect to purchase more for not only our own use, but for gifts to our healthy friends. Thank you, Amazon, for supporting this product!

review/summary: Rancid
review/text: Upon receiving the item, I noticed it had a slightly pungent smell.  I tasted it plain, and it tasted like rotten tomatoes. It was obviously rancid. I emailed customer service, yet received no reply. I threw the can in the trash. I'm very disappointed in the product, and will buy a different brand in the future.
