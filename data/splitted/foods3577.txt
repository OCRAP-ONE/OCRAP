review/summary: PetGuard Venison and Rice Dinner for Cats
review/text: This is a superior quality item, arrived in very good condition.  However, my cats refused to eat it!  It's far healthier than the food one can find in local department stores.  My cats DO eat the more routine flavors in PetGuard brand--chicken, beef, seafood, etc.... but venison--absolutely not!  I think they'd have done better with it, if they'd been more accustomed to the flavor.  Perhaps if you have younger cats..... still a great product.

review/summary: Salty Enough to give you Hypertension
review/text: These are not at all spicy, so little wasabi taste it should be named "MSG peas". If you hate the spicy taste of wasabi then this is the thing for you(but then why are you ordering 'wasabi peas' in the first place!?)They are so salty I stopped after a few and I usually finishes a whole can in one sitting. And they are hard so watch out for your teeth. Overall, disappointed.

review/text: The orchid came in great shape and I expect to see it putting out beautiful blooms as soon as it is mature enough to bloom. It came before its suggested arrival time period began and was securely packed. It should be quite beautiful when it blooms. I have 5 other phals of various colors and this should combine with them to give me a beautiful living bouquet. If you want a good plant to add to your collection or as a stand alone specimen I believe this is a plant worthy of your consideration.

review/summary: Vinegar And Feet
review/text: Yet another of my long winded reviews. Beware Ye of little attention and patience.<br /><br />Vinegar has many uses.<br /><br />A surprising and pleasurable use of the simplest white wine vinegar is to use it to soak your feet.<br />Feet which have had an unacceptable odor will become completely neutral in smell.<br />Vinegar is mildly antimicrobial and acidic. It kills the smelly bugs living on your feet and (probably, I'm not a doctor) will also help your body combat a minor cut or wound on the feet.<br />Toenail jam which normally is like cement cleans out easily.<br />The nails on my big toes can normally only be trimmed with a pair of Klein Mechanics' 8" side cutting pliers are cut with the usual nail tools.<br /><br />Here's some of my details:<br /><br />You will need:<br />A comfortable place to sit tight for at least a half hour.<br />1 gallon of any old white vinegar. This may be the hardest task of this project. Surprisingly, even here in Manhattan where all people seem to do is try to get rich trading Derivatives and eat Food, it can be tough to find cheap, large plastic 1 gallon jugs of vinegar. Smaller supermarket chains usually don't stock the big jugs but I've had good luck getting them to bring them in. Getting them on Da Net is possible but the shipping kills you. "Pint's a pound, the world round". Five dollars a gallon, delivered into my apartment, is the best I have been able to do.<br />A tub of some sort which will comfortably allow you to put both feet into. Rubbermaid makes inexpensive new ones which can be bought from Amazon. Minimum 10 - 12 gallons. Don't use some old junk tub as there will be a fair amount of water which can cause damage.<br />A smaller decanter for filling and emptying the tub.<br />A few old towels.<br />A small plastic drop cloth for good wood floors and/or carpeting.<br />Some way to determine the water temperature. A candy thermometer works fine.<br />One clean, dry towel.<br /><br />Procedure:<br />This whole thing is good to do if you have a minimum of an hour where you are parked and going nowhere. I read or do computer work.<br />Plan ahead.<br />Be very safety conscious. If there is any possibility of electricity mixing with water, then do what I do. Raise every electrical wire, splitter, computer etc which is nearby off the floor. Use short pieces of cheap 2 by 4 lumber. The higher off the floor the better. Don't be stupid. Do not ignore my advice. The medical coroner will be amused at your clean, dead feet if you don't. Do not allow this to happen. Don't be stupid. I don't think I can bang on enough about this danger.<br />My white oak flooring was nice when I installed it about 25 years ago but now its got a bunch of stains and I just don't care. If you have nice flooring, put down a little plastic in the area where you will sit. If you are a complete accident prone putz then get a larger tub to hold the smaller one (the one your feet will fit in). Tubs are cheap insurance, especially if you have other tenants living under you.<br />Make sure both tubs can hold the full amount of fluid which is a minimum of 5 gallons.<br />Keep everything you may need handy so that you don't have to go traipsing around with wet feet.<br />Put down some old towels under and around the your tub. There will be some splash when you're done and when you are emptying the tub. The tub will be at least 40 pounds of soiled water. I use a smaller decanter with yet another tub with a handle to empty the whole shebang.<br />Pour your gallon of vinegar into the tub. Room temperature is fine. I believe a minimum  ratio of 1 to 4 (1 gallon vinegar and 4 gallons of water) is fine. I acquired an old mop bucket which holds a fair amount more water. Warm water up past my ankles, very nice. The amount of water is not too important as long as you use 1 gallon of vinegar.<br />Next, you have to determine the highest temperature yo' feets can take. I have a fancy pants Fluke 65 infrared thermometer and 110 degrees (F) is about the limit of what my feet can take. Interesting, my hands tolerate much higher limits.<br />You can do a little experimentation with a simple, cheap candy thermometer to find a high limit.<br />Remember, the temperature of your tub water starts to cool down immediately. I have found it to drop 5 to 10 degrees after a half an hour which is fine.<br />Use the highest temperature you can take.<br />My faucets spews out water at about 150 to 160 degrees (F) so it's easy for me to fill the tub. You may have to heat up some water to get past 110 degrees (F). I recommend no more than 3 gallons (24 pounds) of very hot water for a single person to handle.<br />Unless I'm really bored and/or drinking, a minimum half an hour soak is perfect.<br />Maintenance on stubborn toenails is easy at this point.<br />After a soak, the whole house smells mildly of vinegar. This may or not bother you. Not much different from making a salad dressing.<br />Amazingly, if you dry your feet with a fresh, clean towel, the vinegar smell disappears by time you empty your tub.<br />If you have an ultra sensitive beezer, by all means rinse your feet in the shower.<br />You now have clean and sanitary tootsies, very suitable for further attention of all sorts.<br /><br />BTW, the first time I did all of this, an entire afternoon had disappeared. Now I can do it all in about an hour, once a week or so. It's not a bad idea to sprinkle some fancy, disinfecting foot powder into your stinky shoes every now and then.<br />I know I have droned on with cautions. They're for your safety and my conscience.<br /><br />Enjoy and prosper.

review/summary: Authentic Flavor Made Easy
review/text: For years I made my own Kung Pao sauce and after the vegetable and meat prep, making the sauce too pushed me over the edge and into take out far more often than I care to admit. That said, once I found this sauce, calls for take out all but disappeared!  Then my local grocery stopped carrying it and I was devastated - once again Amazon came to my rescue.  I now get all my Lee Kum Kee sauces from Amazon.<br /><br />As with any store bought item, you generally have to modify it to suit your tastes (at least I do). I have found that to get an authentic Chinese flavor stir fry I always have to start with garlic and ginger in the wok and just a touch of sesame oil.  For the Kung Pao, I also add peanuts and the traditional red chili peppers and chili oil to get the desired heat.  If you're interested, I brown the peanuts, peppers and chili oil in about a tsp of peanut oil then set aside to add back in at the last minute.<br /><br />I don't know what the previous reviewer is used to, but this is NOT a particularly hot sauce and is full of the flavor one seeks in a Kung Pao sauce.  Since discovering this sauce Kung Pao Chicken has become one of the most requested meals from my family and we have it at least once every couple weeks!

review/summary: HOT! HOT! HOT!
review/text: I've tasted Kung Pao sauce before at various Chinese food restaurants and Kung Pao<br />sauce has a spicy hot taste with a tangy flavor to it.<br />I tried to duplicate the flavor, but it is somewhat time-consuming.<br /><br />So, for those times, when I didn't feel like making my own sauce, I decided<br />to buy it from the bottle.<br /><br />Upon opening up the bottle of sauce, I noticed it was a bit thick and somewhat<br />difficult to smooth it evenly into the vegetables. Then, upon trying the<br />sauce......<br /><br />Ouch! It was pure heat radiating from my mouth and I quickly grabbed a glass<br />of water. If I wanted just hot pepper sauce, I would have bought it.<br />This sauce tasted only of hot peppers.<br /><br />To use this sauce, I had to add honey and vinegar to make it right.<br />If I am going to do that, I just as well make my own.<br /><br />If you like just HOT HOT HOT peppers, this is the sauce for you.

Our 1 year old girl absolutely loves the multigrain super greens and she shrieks with impatience until we give her the next bite. No heating necessary. I feel so good that she's getting extra greens and fiber, to balance out the other baby and adult food she snacks on. It's also really easy to take to go, we just bring along an extra baby spoon or disposable plastic spoon. It may just be personal preference... I wouldn't take a bite myself just because I really hate eating greens myself, but you gotta do good by your baby, right?

review/summary: Great organic option
review/text: I bought a single pack of this 1st to try and it was alot less 'horrifying' then some reviews lead you to believe. I just mixed with plums spinach peas and pear to loosen it up some as it's a bit thick because of the grains and barley but after mixing it becomes a hearty nutritious organic option that my baby doesn't mind..and she's picky! Just mix with something your child likes and it's a great healthy addition!

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: I'm not sure why some of their food pouches are so watery that it won't stay on the spoon and, like this one, so thick that my baby just gags on it and throws up whatever he already ate.  There is no taste to it.  I wouldn't eat it, so it's no wonder that my baby won't either no matter how exciting I tried to make his mealtime.  I ended up doctoring it up with some fruit, like applesauce, and/or adding some formula or breastmilk in order to thin it out.  I tried the other food pouches as well, and the taste just wasn't there.<br /><br />I prefer and recommend the HappyBaby products (like "Chick Chick" or "Gobble Gobble", because they surpass Plum in both taste and texture.  I find that I can serve it straight out of the pouch without having to add anything like cereal to thicken or fruit/milk to thin.

review/summary: Looks & smells disgusting and she likes it....
review/text: Found this at the dollar or 99  or 98 cent store (one of those) I checked the date and it was all good so I figured I'd give it a try... Never really thought my baby would go for this but she really liked it! I used to make all of her food, now I probably make about 50%, she has never had any sugary foods other than fruit either but greens have always been harder to get her to eat. The sodium is a little high, compared to happy baby products, but the only thing they have close to this is Ratatouille, which she has grown to love. Anyway, I may use this to switch thing up a bit now and then.

review/summary: Smooth, nutritious, mom & baby love it!
review/text: I have tried nearly every Plum, Happy Baby, and Sprout meal out on my son.  Even at 15 months, he still eats purees along with finger food, but doesn't like chunky purees.  This puree is smooth in the mouth, despite a chunky look, and my son loves it.  He has always liked greens though, and eats a few other purees with nutty grains, so perhaps not all babies will like it (as mentioned in the 1 star reviews.)  If you don't like the strong taste/aroma of dark greens and grains, this might not be for you, but my picky baby scarfs it down, so give it a try.  It's a really nutritious combo, with great ingredients too, and one that wouldn't be easy to make on your own and puree this smooth.

review/text: I loooooooooove this tea! It is simply delicious; I have shared it with many friends, and it's always a hit. Anyone who loves ginger will love it. The Tulsi adds a wonderful depth to the flavour that seems to mix very well with the ginger (I have also ordered the Organic India Tulsi Jasmine tea and was very disappointed; the Tulsi tasted kind of odd... I got used to it, but it was far from 'delicious'.) If you like sweet things, add honey. One word of caution: it takes a little trial and error to get the brewing length right for this tea; if you steep it too long it can (like any ginger tea, in fact) develop an unpleasant bitter taste.

review/text: Pleased with the product.<br /><br />Last Christmas I purchased my son a Carousel Jutebox Gumball Machine from Amazon.  He needed refill gumballs so I purchased these as a birthday present along with many other items from Amazon.  When checking out I only looked at the total of my order.  These gumballs shipped seperately from all of my other items from Candy Crate.  I was amazed when I discovered on my order confirmation how much the shipping was ... $12.95 AND it took three days longer than the rest of my items from Amazon.  My 5 other items, which came in a MUCH larger box and weighed much more, only cost $15.84 for shipping and was received in two days.

review/text: I think we've all experienced those gum balls that lose their flavor after about 10 seconds, then turn so hard that your jaw starts to get tired.  These are a step above that.  First of all, they are the smaller gum balls, which I didn't expect.  Second, they lose their flavor pretty quickly.  I would eat one, then pop another one in a few seconds later to try to elongate my chewing experience but after about 30 seconds, I had to spit it out.  They're not bad tasting, but I probably wouldn't order them again.

review/text: These are my favorite type of gumball. I love the fruity flavors, and they are a good size. But I'm not sure if it was just the box I received or what, but the gum becomes very hard almost immediately. After chewing for around 20 seconds, the gum is almost too hard to chew. The flavor lasts for a couple minutes, but the gum is so tough that it's almost difficult to keep chewing. I hope that isn't a problem with the gum overall because I love the flavor and size.

The FDA has issued warnings against mysterious dog illnesses and deaths from chicken jerky imported from China.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />There used to be a lot of Amazon reviews on this product from people's dogs having severe reactions to these such as bloody vomit and diarrhea - for some reason, those reviews have been removed.<br /><br />Not worth the risk in my opinion. One would think Kingdom Pets could produce a safe product for not much more money, raising their chickens here instead of paying to import possibly tainted meat and risking the health of our beloved pups.

review/summary: Great Dog treat
review/text: Great dog treat. A little spendy but very fresh and my dog loves both the chicken and lamb products. Since there are no fillers  and it is simply dehydrated meat, I don't worry about feeding her more than the recommened 2 pieces each day.  Sometimes it's all she will eat.  Would be nice, once in a while, to have reduced S&H to lessen the expense

review/summary: Happy Hips
review/text: My 13-year-old poodle was having problems getting around and I was starting to have to carry her out to do her business.  After a cortisone shot and a week of anti-inflammatories, I started her on happy hips.  She's getting around just fine now and we've not had a recurrence of the stiffness.  And she absolutely LOVES them!

review/text: My little Westie was diagnosed with Legs Calf Perth Disease at the age of 5 months.  After a year, the diseased bone calcified and she was able to walk without pain, but she limped and could not jump.  I take Glucosamine/Chondroitin for myself and when I saw these treats - all natural with these supplements I decided to try them.  Louise can now run, jump, and play like any normal 3 year old.  I advise anyone with an animal with joint problems to give these a try.

review/summary: Dogs love them....but a caveat before buying.
review/text: There's no doubt these are probably my dog's favorite treat. My cat loves them too! I do generally break small pieces off as they both try to eat them too fast and they are fairly crunchy strips of dried chicken. I do have a major concern with these and that is that they are made in China. We are seeing reports of dogs getting ill from other brands of chicken strips from China so it is hard for me to trust that these are 100% safe. The company does seem reputable and hopefully does oversee their production, but I would prefer if they used a US source for making them.

She has been on Happy Hips, daily, for a little over a year and has not so much as even limped during that time. My husband even takes one little bite every morning and claims his knees feel better!! :)

review/text: As a dog lover, I'm compelled to write a objective review regarding this product.<br />I fed my dogs one stick each of this product which caused both of my dogs to have symptoms of diarrhea.<br />I immediately stopped feeding them this product and symptoms subsided.<br />Also, one other concern that I think it's worth mentioning is the fact that the "Made in China" printed on the package was concealed with another UPC code.<br />Weary from bad and harmful products from China, I looked all over the packaging only to see it hidden beneath the new label without info on the country of origin.<br /><br />Perhaps this is an isolated incident and I hope it is, but I hope better QC is implemented, even if it raises the cost of the product which any dog lover would prefer over having a sick dog!

review/text: Bought something similar at a big box store around the holidays, my dog enjoyed them. Ordered these, and he LOVES them. Roots around in my purse, in the bag, any way he can to get more. There's a lot of jerky wrapped around the rawhide and it looks like much better quality than the ones I bought at the big box store. My dog is a 65 lb Aussie who is an old rescue and has few teeth, and it takes him about 5 minutes to get through these. Not long lasting for heavy chewers, but perfect for my old man!

review/summary: SUPER delicious! Beautiful tea for a dinner party!
review/text: I LOVE hibiscus tea and was a loyal customer to another brand that I frequently purchased on Amazon.  They changed the formula so I had to go on the hunt for another brand.<br /><br />I couldn't find a replacement tea with good reviews until I found this one.  It is expensive to me though - About $1 per tea bag.  I bought it anyway because I had my heart set on hibiscus tea for a summer dinner party I was throwing.  I'm so glad I did! It is REALLY delicious!<br /><br />This tea looks so beautiful in a clear glass pitcher with fresh oranges, sliced in wheels, floating in it. I also serve it over ice in water goblets with an orange or lemon wheel as it's garnish. It kind of looks like wine or a mixed drink, so it is a nice non-alcoholic option to have on hand.<br /><br />I've heard a lot of friends say they don't know how to make hibiscus tea taste like the tropical libation they've had in other places.  Below is my recipe for Hibiscus tea by the pitcher in case it is helpful for others.<br /><br />Hibiscus Tea by the Pitcher<br /><br />48 ounces water<br />8 - 10 hibiscus tea bags (I use 10)<br />2 whole cinnamon sticks<br />1/8 cup sugar (or 6-8 packs of stevia)<br />1 small orange, sliced in wheels (or 2 clementines)<br />ice<br />1 lemon, cut into wheels<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />Bring water to light boil, turn off heat add the hibiscus flower tea bags and cinnamon sticks. Cover and steep for 20 minutes.<br /><br />Strain tea into desired container, add sugar and orange slices.<br /><br />Serve tea in a nice glass over ice.<br /><br />Garnish each glass with a lemon wheel.<br /><br />This tea recipe can easily be doubled for a larger serving. When using hibiscus flowers in tea making, longer is not better. Heating the hibiscus for an extended time can release unfavorable qualities and bitterness. The key is to add MORE hibiscus to strengthen the flavor.

review/text: I have tried several Hibiscus teas--loose and bagged. Ambassador Hibiscus tea is far and away the very best. While others I tried were tart--almost sour-- this brand of hibiscus tea is smooth and highly drinkable. The bags themselves are beautiful-- staple free and silky. I decided to try hibiscus tea for its purported health benefits, primarily related to lowering blood pressure, but found other brands so difficult to drink, I almost gave up on the whole idea of drinking this kind of tea. Ambassador brand hibiscus tea is a complete pleasure to drink. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good cuppa tea.

review/summary: Yummy Tea
review/text: First began drinking this when I had a cold, and it was like I couldn't get enough of it. Very sharp taste--not exactly tart, but just this side of it. Satisfying is the word that comes to mind. I don't add sweetener or anything--think it is perfect just the way it is. I can get three cups of tea out of one tea bag, although the last cup isn't quite as dark colored. This tea delivers on a lot of levels, because it not only tastes great, but is also a beautiful, deep-vibrant red. I've read Hibiscus is very good for a person, but even if it wasn't, I would still drink it for the taste. The fact it is organic just about makes it perfect in my eyes.

review/summary: worst I've had of this kind of snack
review/text: Maybe it's the whole wheat, not sure, but I've had peanut butter pretzels that taste way better than these.  They were extremely hard, almost stale like and then there was a really tiny wad of peanut butter inside an otherwise empty pretzel hole.  The pretzel shell was thin compared to other brands I've had with like a mostly empty hole in the middle and it cost like 10 times more though. Of course I just assumed how bad could a simple snack like this be and ordered a box of 12 and I don't eat them so not sure what to do with them, if like I could bring a few anytime I go to the city and offer them out to the homeless asking me for money instead of money or just with money? I mean if they truly are hungry they should take it right?  It might not be the best tasting, but I guess the term beggars can't be choosers would be very apro pos. I just thought I should try it rather than throw food out.  I thought it'd be great if healthier due to the whole wheat, but if it tastes that bad then give me the regular ones again bec I know you can still get no salt or low sodium in regular wheat pretzels.
