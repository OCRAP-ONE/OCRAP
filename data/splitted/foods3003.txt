review/summary: Made in China?
review/text: My brother had told me about these bars so I went on to Amazon to order them,  I totally love the flavor but when my sister told me they were made in China I about died.  I called my brother to tell him and he said "well that is it for Mrs. Mays"  I totally agree.  Can't believe we can't get almonds, blueberries etc. here in the good USA.  Will not buy again.

review/summary: Do Your Homework
review/text: A friend of mine knows that I like to watch what I eat as far as the chemicals and un-necessary processing so she turned me on to these bars.  First let me say, they are awesome. They have next to no processing, ZERO chemicals, and are very tastey.  Yes, they are hard.  What do you expect?? They're nuts!!! Nuts are hard!!!  The little pieces of the dried fruit they put in add a little sweetness but, they're still nuts and therefore crunchy. It's just like putting a handful of almonds in your mouth.<br /><br />In regards to the fat content, any health related magazine, doctor, and/or website will tell you that some of the ABSOLUTE best items to eat to help weight management and a live a healthy lifestyle are nuts and seeds.  They contain all of the good fat that you're body needs while hopefully, helping you stay away from the man-created/altered fats that destroy our cholestrol, hearts and general well-being. Just like coconut, high in fat, but one the best things you could possibly put into your body. Remember, everything in moderation.<br /><br />In regards to the size, yes they're small.  They are not a meal replacement bar but it is a decent amount of protein and good fats to satisfy you for a few hours until you can sit down and enjoy a healthy dinner.  While I try to eat 5 small meals a day, in my line of work, it's just not possible so I snack on one of these during the times I just can't have a decent meal and they get me through.  And have you checked out the price of nuts lately????  Any good raw nut costs upwards of $6.00lb, I've seen some as high as $18.00lb.  So, to have this bar prepared, shipped packaged and sold for about a $1.00 (just buy them in bulk, Costco is even cheaper) seems like a good deal to me.<br /><br />In regards to manufacturing, while I do wish they were put together closer to home, first and foremost, they are a business.  They have to watch their bottom line just like any of us.  If you do your research you will find that very few of the ingredients come from China (only some seeds and rice malt, I believe because they can't get them anywhere else).  Most of the ingredients come from the US then are shipped to China for manufacturing in a facility built specifically for Mrs. Mays.  Think about it.  If you can pay the same amount and have either 20 people or 1 person do a job, and those 20 people are being paid a good wage in their country, which makes more business sense.  Now, I don't like it, but I can understand it. Considering labor costs in this country, imagaine how much these bars would cost if manufactured here? And given the issues coming out of China recently, do you really think anyone manufacturing there would risk doing anything less than spectacular??? Not if they want to stay in business.<br />Check out their website for their safety and health inspection related info.<br /><br />What it boils down to is this, if you want a great little, portable, and extremely healthy snack and you're nuts about nuts, then you will love these bars.  Do we all wish they were made in the US, sure.  But barring that, they are a great product for any health conscious individual as well as vegetarians and vegans alike.  Like I said earlier, they're awesome!!

review/summary: Very Good!
review/text: We like these Mrs. May's Trio Natural Bars.  These are a little on the chewy, sticky side, so beware, if you have dental problems (chew carefully).  Packaged in an almost indestructible cello package.  The ingredients are as follows:  Cashews, Almonds, Pistachios, Blueberries, Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds, Dates, Raisins, Rice Malt, Natural Flavors, Cane Juice, Sea Salt.  That's it!  There are 24 bars in a 28.8 oz or 840 gram box.  Each bar is 1.2 oz or 35 grams.  The box says:  vegan/no trans fat/no additives/no preservatives/no cholesterol/gluten free/diary free/wheat free/non-GMO/kosher and product of China (that worries me more than a little).  Calories 170 each, 100 calories from fat, 12 grams total fat, 1.5 grams saturated fat, 0mg cholesterol, 45mg sodium, 15g total carbohydrate, 2g dietary fiber, 6g sugar, 5g protein, 2% calcium, 8% iron, 0% vitamins A & C.  Yummy flavor, can taste the nuts and blueberries, not too sweet for most people, certainly a lot less sweet than any other granola/snack/breakfast/protein type bar we've tried.  Wish they were bigger, pretty small. Otherwise, very good bars.

There is nothing worse than strugling with a package and tearing it open and having crumbs fall out on you.  Considering the composition of the bar, a new, more easily openable package would be great.<br />Everybody buy some, so they can make more and sell them for less!!

review/summary: Great Product, Bogus Price
review/text: These are very good nut bars, far superior to anything that you can buy from the big food conglomerates. Wonderful for breakfast or anytime you feel like some nuts. Lightly sugared, so not overwhelming in that department.<br /><br />However, I can buy a box of 24 bars for $16 locally. So this is not something you want to buy from Amazon unless you are house-bound and have no other way to get them, or you can't find a local store that carries them. Hint: look at alternative markets, not at your standard cookie-cutter supermarket.<br /><br />So three stars for a great product that is grossly overpriced in this venue.

review/text: These bars are delicious and nutritious. They are a great snack, providing great protein and the good fats from nuts and seeds. The blueberries and raisins give it just enough sweetness without making it too sweet. I initially purchased the variety pack at Costco and while it was a few dollars cheaper than on Amazon, I don't care for all the flavors....I don't like the tropical flavor. Save a few dollars and sign up for an Amazon subscription with free shipping.

review/text: These are tasty bars and overall have pretty good nutrition. When ordering, take note of the SIZE - we had bought these in bulk packaging before (Costco) and these bars on Amazon were slightly smaller in size. No big deal - it doesn't matter, we just didn't look at the size so they were slightly smaller than WE expected.

review/summary: Look Kids, It's Food!
review/text: I love these bars! The only reason I was turned off at first was that the fat content seemed high at 12g of fat 1.5 of which is saturated fat but a 1 ounce serving of cashews has 12g of fat, 2 of which are saturated fat - so that kind of puts it into perspective.<br /><br />I, like most people these days, am trying to eat healthier and for me that includes not just watching the calories and fat but being aware of what is in all these snack bars and meal replacement bars. I'm trying to avoid processed foods and things with chemical names I can't pronounce, spell and/or recongnize the root words of. So these are nutritious, delicious and have a limited number of ingredients all of which I recongnize as actual food stuffs. Yippee. All of my requirements have been met and I am free to snack happily away. Thanks, Mrs. May.

review/text: They were giving away samples at Costco. My daughter is 5 and has never had a nut allergy but she did with this product. So even though she doesn't have a peanut allergy, she must be allergic to one of the other nuts in this bar. It started with major stomach pains then she started itching and got a HORRIBLE rash all over her body. Then her breathing sounded as if she was having an asthma attack (which she doesn't have asthma but that's what it sounded like). Luckily I realized it before she went to bed and gave her some benedryl but it was a very scary moment for us.

review/summary: The Good Stuff
review/text: It certainly is a paradox. Though Gabby and Piper don't hesitate to seek out and eat all kinds of yucky, unsavory stuff they find on the side of the road or in the backyard, I still like to feed them the best of foods and treats. Always on the hunt for those products with meat as the first ingredient and an absence of fillers and artificials, I recently discovered a food that seems to have a great pedigree and is worthy of our two girls.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this food. The first ingredient is organic chicken followed by chicken meal and more quality ingredients. Of course, I'd like to see a potato component, but we can't have everything.<br />I like that this food is designed for your dog's skin and coat, joints and bones, digestive system, and the immune system.<br />Our two dogs liked this food from the first piece of kibble. It's a food that's crunchy without being overly hard or too big for the little mouths of  Piper shih Tzu or Gabby Bolognese. Since Health Extension is a bit pricey, we choose to mix it half and half with their regular foods, Blue and Royal Canin.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.

I remembered how good it tasted and I remembered I had some Maple syrup ice cream while there, sooooo. I got on line and found this 1/2 gallon, price wasn't bad  (here at a local store a pint of REAL Maple syrup will cost $12.00) and it had free shipping. I had it in a few days, and made the ice cream right away. By the way I also made pancakes and sausage for dinner, and this here Maple syrup was as good if not better than what I had 8 years ago. VERY well packaged, and really fast shipping. Nice bouqet, great light amber color, great job to the cooker. Oh yea, by the way, the ice cream came out wonderfully.

review/text: So far, this Crepe Myrtle has not shown one flower, nor the potential for any flowers, and, in fact it did not look good when I got it, about 30 days ago.  I will provide an update if it starts looking healthier and beautiful like the picture.  Product did arrive quickly.  Also, the greenery is not near as full as the picture shown.

review/summary: Poor quality dead and very poor customer service
review/text: On March 21, 2011, I purchased a Brussel's DT9049DCM Crepe Myrtle Bonsai tree through Amazon.  The tree received in a dormant state (No leaves or signs of growth).  In mid April 2010 I became concerned about the lack of growth (Only about six leaves) on the entire tree and all those leaves on a coupe branches only.  I telephoned Brussel's to determine if tree was late to thrive or what.  I received a return call from Brussel's Bonsia Master who stated that it was normal that their trees was just now starting to grow and to give it two to four weeks and call him back with the status.  Upon request I e-mailed them six protographs of the tree.  After a couple weeks all signs of life on the tree were gone.  An additional six photographs were sent and with the exchange of several emails where they indicated they would replace the item.  On May 17, 2001, I received an email indicating you purchase the item from Amazon so go through them for a replacement or you can buy a new one directly from them.  Now I have never returned an item through Amazon, but to say I am very disappointed in this matter is an understatement.  Is there any assistance Amazon can provide in this matter??????  Try and find a phone number to call Amazon.  I sent an email through their system without any response.  Buyer beware, if you want to be treated like a second class system buy from Brussel's through Amazon.  After the purchase of eleven trees through Brussels and about seven of them through Brussel's has lost a CUSTOMEr.  As well if I can't get any response through Amazon they have lost a CUSTOMER as well!!!!!!!!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DGG8D">Brussel's DT9049DCM Crepe Myrtle Bonsai</a> I was totally disappointed with this product! Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I ordered it, which taught me a lesson. The picture showed beautiful, purple flowers...when mine arrived, it barely had any leaves, let alone flowers! Also, the instructions that came with the "plant" said it was for outdoors, & there was nothing about that in the description. Amazon was wonderful about giving me a refund, but I think they probably had a lot of practice giving refunds for this one! I also learned not to order plants through the mail. I would not recomend this product.

review/text: This is the second bonzai tree that I received and just like the 1st one, this one does not look like it's going to make it for very long.  I thought maybe it was something I did or didn't do but regardless...  No plant should be that difficult to maintain considering it started to look very dried out and droopy come day two.  The soil was very hard & dry and packed way too tight into the pot that it made watering the plant nearly impossible.

review/summary: Jaw dropping gorgeous tree!!
review/text: One word. WOW.<br /><br />This tree was much larger than I expected, and it was fully leafed out, with a few blooms just starting to emerge (WHICH IS OK, AS CREPE MYRTLE BLOOM LATE SUMMER). Every leaf is glossy and green.<br /><br />I'm sure this tree will be in full bloom later this year, and I bet it will be amazing. This is the best bonsai tree I've ever seen for the price.<br /><br />AND LET ME MAKE IT KNOWN, FOR ALL THE BONSAI NOOBS OUT THERE, THIS TREE WILL DROP EVERY SINGLE LEAF IN THE WINTER AND NOT GROW A SINGLE LEAF BACK UNTIL LATE SPRING. It naturally goes dormant in the winter, and is commonly one of the last trees to leaf out in the spring. It can take a good chill, as it's zone 7 hardy, so 10-15 degrees shouldn't hurt it.<br /><br />I will upload a picture sometime soon, probably when it flowers. Don't let the negative reviews turn you off. Only idiots who buy this thinking it can be kept indoors will be disappointed.

review/summary: After taste
review/text: These were a great price that's why I gobbled some up [lemon, toffee, chocolate & strawberry].  I've tried the lemon in some of the WuLong tea [ick..guess I should try a better tasting tea?] noticed the after taste, as usual.  I've also tried the strawberry in some carbonated water [suggestion from the 101 Recipes for the HCG protocol] and that's not too bad.  Definitely something you gotta get use to...because of the after taste. [I know this product and other Stevia products are natural so this taste doesn't mentally affect me as does the Aspartame, Splenda and other man-made sweeteners - those are just plain bad for us but the after taste of these Stevita products remind me of those man-made sweeteners - ICK].  I've actually had a little better luck with the Nu-Stevia powder, as long as I am careful on the amount [for example I use it in my smoothies, i.e. 1 packet for a 16-20oz smoothie].  So the '3' rating is for the taste...and after-taste.  :-(

I definitely won't be buying it at 3x the cost of what I had previously paid for it.  I'll stick to the larger bottles of Sweet Leaf Berry flavor, which taste better and are available on my Prime shipping.

I've never seen cats (I have 3) like any treat like they love these.  The older cat needs medication a few times a day and nothing is more miserable than giving cats pills (should be an olympic event IMHO). I had discovered "Greenies" which are like little cat carmels with a hole in the middle to hide the pills that had great success with him. He really liked the Greenie caramels, HOWEVER from the moment I gave him the little crave hearts, he would no longer take the Greenies (sigh).  We've resorted to chopping the Greenies in half, embedding the pills AND A CRAVE HEART to get him to take them again!  I don't know what it is in these goodies but I wish it came in a bottle!

He was not happy about that, of course. For ten days, twice a day, my little guy had to endure my fingers shoving 2 pills down his throat almost causing him to puke each time. I felt so bad for him that after the first couple of times I started rewarding him with these treats. Well, after a couple of days he was coming up to me, asking for his pills because he knew these treats would soon follow!<br /><br />If your cat will let you shove pills down his throat just so he can have these treats - that speaks volumes!!

review/summary: Addictive...
review/text: These are my favorite caramels that do not contain chocolate. They are not too sticky, and shouldn't interfere with most dental work. The sea salt was sprinkled into the finished caramel, not simply added to the recipe and allowed to melt and blend. So every now and then you will bite into a large piece of salt while chewing the caramel and the contrasting salty flavor bursts in your mouth, accentuating the gooey sweetness. The salt lends a perfect balance and these caramels taste like heaven in my mouth!<br /><br />I order a larger bag of these every month (directly from the company now) and have put on and extra few pounds because of this habit, but hey! Life is short, and these caramels are worth it!<br /><br />Once, during particularly hot summer weather, I got a bag in which some of the caramels had melted and were stuck together. I emailed their customer service department and they promptly rushed a replacement. I highly recommend these caramels along with the company who makes them. There are other flavors in their catalog and I am sure they are wonderful too, but for now I am in love with the Celtic Sea Salt.

The caramels are not ridiculously sweet nor noticeably salty; they are just the perfect in between.  They also aren't chewy; my teeth don't feel like they are going to be pulled out when eating them.

The occasional crunch of sea salt balances the sweetness nicely. I love chocolate but it is nice to find a salted caramel without it. I don't want anything to get in the way of this incredible caramel flavor. The presentation is nice too so I will be buying more of these bags in the future as gifts.

I am not paid for this review. When I took my first bite my first impression was that the Bunny Bar was sweet. I did not like the texture, it was nether crunchy or soft, but kinda hard to chew. I could taste a bit of cherry, but not a hole lot which is not good in my opinion. The chocolate didn't seem to be of a very good quality, but it might be because it was semi melted due to the extreme heat we have right now in CA.

I told them that was unacceptable and had to actually ask for a manager to get anything straightened out. It almost doesn't matter how good the cakes or other products are if the company is unreliable.

review/text: I was given six months of cakes for Christmas this year.  I've gotten two of them and they were very good!  When I opened the first I was afraid I wasn't going to like it very much - pumpkin cake - but it was lovely, dense, moist and yummy.  The cakes travel well, keep nicely, and are not filled with artificial ingredients.  My first choice would have been six months of wedding cakes but, in light of the impracticality of that, these cakes have been surprisingly good.

Even for the price of both packs together, it should have been a third of the listing price because they are so small. I didn't get to open the packaging yet to see what the cards inside look like because it's a gift for someone else. I'd rather have waited to go to the HP Theme park and purchased a chocolate frog from there. The shipping charge was over priced considering the packages were not that heavy.

review/text: While I think that the wizard card that accompanies each chocolate frog is really interesting, I'm not so impressed with the chocolate.  It's plain chocolate, not extremely flavorful, with the crispy rice.  I found that the chocolate was kind of thick and it felt like it left a greasy residue on the inside of my mouth.  The shape of the frog is very fun and my kids loved them.<br /><br />The wizard cards, however, are very interesting.  They have images of the different wizards mentioned in the Harry Potter books.  On the opposite side, they're printed with information that is in addition to what is mentioned in the series.  They're very cute and worth collecting.
