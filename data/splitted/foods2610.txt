review/summary: MY DOG LOVES IT
review/text: After searching high and low for a healthy dog food that my little one would actually eat and not break my wallet, I found this brand.  My little Bella LOVES it and can't get enough.  She is a picky eater and I find that she actually licks the plate clean afterward.  She has been eating the holistic brand for adult dogs for 2 months now and does not seem to hesitate when eating it.  BUY IT!!!

review/summary: Great nutricious blend and priced well - but the dogs won't touch it
review/text: Searched for a while for a great protein blend that the dogs would love and so would my wallet.  I hoped to find it organic but could not find the combination of animal protein, grain free, great price and dog's taste appeal.  My dogs would not touch the dry version of this food but devoured the can version.  Yeahhh I shouted but then in just a few days they would touch the canned food.  I tried for more than week and even mixed in real chicken at the end but they would pick out the chicken and leave the Nutro.  After trying at least 10 different foods over the past few years, Ziwipeak is very expensive but the only quality and convenient dog food that seems to check off the most on my list and my dogs never leave a bit of it the bowl.

review/text: Very good and very tasty organic Chamomile, I also take great concern about our planet, and I like the fact that the product is boxed in what appear to be paper/recycled materials with no plastic present, plus pesticide FREE. Very good price ratio with "subscribe and save", 4 whole oz in weight of any bulk dried tea goes a long way for a great non-caffeinated tea which is good for the mind and body. "Google" Chamomile for its many health benefits!

review/summary: break easily- would NOT recommend
review/text: I really like all the other Green Sprouts products, but these are a no-go. Both the spoon and fork were broken easily by my 9 month-old baby. The spoon he easily snapped in half and the fork was shattered by him pounding it on the high chair tray. Luckily I was right there because the utensils broken and shattered into small pieces that were very sharp. I think they could be very dangerous if he swallowed a shard or put the broken end in his mouth. I would not recommend these at all. Instead try the Green Sprouts silicone toddler spoon. It is soft and flexible and has not yet broken for me.

review/summary: Perfection in a can!
review/text: Even my own Mom doesn't make collards or turnip greens by scratch anymore since she was<br />introduced to Glory Foods.<br /><br />This stuff is so good you'll keep finding new and unique ways to find excuses to add it<br />to your meals. For example, I put these collard greens in take-out Hot n'Sour soup, its<br />great in homemade vegetable soup as a finisher, tried it in roasted garlic soup and it was<br />fantastic, so as a garnish this stuff is amazing. But where it really shines is with simple<br />dishes alongside fried corn, pintos, and some cornbread and maybe a pork chop or twelve!<br /><br />Hard to believe this stuff is made in Ohio, but the consistency and flavor are perfect. Just<br />add pepper vinegar or your favorite hot sauce.

These are the very best flavor, so close to what I recall.  I cannot myself duplicate that true taste, so I am sticking with GLORY FOODS on this item.

review/summary: Super tasty DARK chocolate.
review/text: If you do not like sugared dark chocolate, you will not like this one.  The other reveiw, I would guess, was not a dark fan.  I LOVE dark chocolate!  I recently found I can't tolerate refined sugar any more.  However, I will not eat fake sweeteners either.  Hence, my elation when I found this chocolate on Amazon.  I ordered the plain version from here.<br /><br />For folks with allergies, specifically, peanut, do not order theses bars!<br /><br />All the chocolate is processed in a facility that handles peanuts.  I emailed the company, they were very helpful in my questions.  They can custom make batches in their kitchen that are peanut free.  I tried the orange, mint and chipotle flavors, as well as the plain.<br /><br />I like the mint and plain the best.  I plan on ordering more custom to prevent peanut contamination.<br /><br />If you use stevia, this chocolate will be wonderful!

review/summary: Healthy Chocolate!
review/text: Delicious, deep chocolate without the insidious bad effects of white sugar.  I voted the Orange flavor in this brand a 5.  Refined white sugar should be banned!  It's pretty much the only thing that makes baking and candy unhealthy.  Finally, chocolate -- which is healthful to begin with, as ALL food should be --sweetened with stevia! A natural sweetener made from the bark of a tree, with 0 calories and low glycemic index. Yes, NO BAD EFFECTS of white refined sugar.  This is good chocolate and I hope enough people buy it that it doesn't have to keep being pricey. In the meantime, it is worth the price.  As for flavor, this is not super "minty" in my opinion (so giving it 4 start).  Wish I could give it 4.5 because it's almost there! It has a rich, dark cocoa taste, nice crunch to the consistency, and just the right amount of sweet..healthy sweetness.

This one, made with stevia, is hard, chalky, bitter, very dark chocolate.  I know, it's 83% cocoa, but to me, it's just too bitter.  If you like bitter choc, this may be for you!  I'm going to try cooking/baking with it.

review/summary: Picky Pet Carnivores Love It: Clean Smelling, No Grains, No Cheap  Fillers
review/text: In my search for a healthful food my cats really love and will thrive on, I've tried giving them many different premium brands of cat foods...grain free, and using only animal proteins (no plant proteins like soy products). My cats have sampled brands that include vegetables and sometimes rice, but no other grains in the recipe. I've done taste test trials on them comparing other brands with Fussy Cat.  My cats (adults as well as weaned kittens) absolutely prefer the Fussy Cat Chicken & Tuna recipe. In comparison to the other Fussy Cat flavors, the Chicken & Tuna takes top honors with my cats.<br /><br />After doing research on cat (and dog) diets, I agree with the results of recent studies that conclude that cats (and dogs) are biologically evolved dedicated carnivores who require animal based proteins.  Therefore I avoid, as much as possible, cat (and dog) foods that use plant based proteins, grains, and plant based fillers.  Plant proteins do not contain all the essential amino acids that carnivores like cats (and dogs) require. Additionally, plant proteins are difficult for cats (and dogs) to digest. Over time the difficulty and stress on the animal's digestive system can result in health issues and a shorter life span.<br /><br />Bearing in mind that animal protein quality is diminished with high temperature cooking (used in preparing dry kibble and most canned pet foods), I supplement my cats' Fussy Cat meals with some cooked organic egg yolk, and sometimes with an added tablespoon of raw organic beef hamburger (sold at Costco in Novato, CA).  To ensure their fur remains soft and shiny, I always add to their food the contents of a 1000mg capsule of Pure Alaska Omega brand 100% Natural Omega-3 Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil.  Just puncture the capsule and squeeze the contents onto their food and stir thoroughly.<br /><br />I take my animals to a holisitic veterinarian (Pamela Bouchard, DVM of Tender Care Veterinary Hospital, San Rafael, CA), who strongly believes that diet is an essential foundation for maintaining optimum health and longevity in animals. With each bi-annual check-up, we review the diet of each of my pets. Depending on the results of the always thorough exam (including blood work, etc.), my veterinarian may recommend certain supplements and holistic remedies tailored to meet each pet's requirements.<br /><br />Now if I could find a human medical doctor who would do the same for me with as much care and compassion, I'd be a happy cat.

review/text: Between my cat's food allergies and his fussiness about food, I was going crazy trying to find something he could eat and didn't get tired of. Fussie Cat is it! He won't eat anything else anymore, and he doesn't get tired of it. (I do rotate among 4 flavors.) My neighbor was having similar problems with her cats. I convinced her to try Fussie Cat and her cats love it too. The ingredients get a thumbs up from my vet as well.

It isn't all runny and gloppy like some we have bought, and it's not his everyday food, just his treat.  Loves it.  Assuming that he is an average cat and nothing particularly out of the ordinary, it's reasonable to assume that your favorite feline will also like it.

review/summary: Fussy eater Himalayan-Manx mix won't touch anything else (well, almost anything...he likes my organic slow roasted chicken).
review/text: I have this on order through Amazon's subscripion program.  I could buy it cheaper at a store here, but the amount of gas I burn (full size minivan which holds two x-large Midwest brand dog crates and dog training paraphanalia) to get to that store and back home makes the final tally more than the subscription price from Amazon.com.<br /><br />My Manx kitty gets a tin of Fussy Cat Premium Tuna w/ Chicken Canned Cat Food with each meal (2x/day), plus the crunchiness of 1 Cup of EVO brand cat kibble.  Manx kitty comes running when I call  "dinner time!" and gulps down every last bit of this Fussy Cat recipe.<br /><br />He doesn't like products with beef.<br /><br />I used to wonder why.<br /><br />Then I tried to imagine how a cat...or a whole big gang of determined domestic house cats...would bring home a cow to eat.  I can imagine a gang of cats bringing home a turkey, a chicken, a fish, a rabbit and of course the usual mouse/rat meal.  I just couldn't picture my cat and all his buddies hunting and bringing down a full size cow or calf and then dragging it home to my doorstep.

Than they change bowls to see if the other left something :-) I have been feeding this brand for over 9 months now and even my kitty with Inflammatory Bowel Disease does well on it. It's because the ingredients are from good sources, their coats are shiny, their eyes clean and their stools firm. Plus they love it and there is such a great variety to choose from. I have it on automatic delivery from Amazon and am never without. What more do you want? Very convenient!<br /><br />Highly recommend this brand of cat food.

Actually, it's more like:  curry for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Since we eat it so fast, I stock up on several bottles on each order.  Even the organic at our local markets doesn't even come close.  I'm not big on having to buy food online which is why I wait and try different brands, but nothing compares.  Definitely worth trying.

It's really not that difficult, and you'll end up with a better-tasting final product than Mauna Loa's.<br /><br />In any case, it looks like plenty of people do like this brand.  My recommendation is to find a single can some place to try them out before you purchase a 6-pack.

review/text: I discovered these Honey Roasted ones while in Hawaii.  Since I could not find them locally, I bought these.  AND it's a better deal than anything I could find ANYWHERE else (even in Hawaii).  Be careful though, these things are majorly addicting.

It could have been a bad batch but I wouldn't take any chances. The only good thing about this deal was a full refund with no problems. Sorry but the facts are the facts.

review/summary: Good Popcorn!
review/text: I know why the last reviewer didn't like this popcorn.  It's make with canola oil which definitely has a different smell and taste. It's pretty tasty though and I got past the initial different smell. I originally bought this to try because I have family with heart issues and canola oil is supposed to be more heart healthy than other types of oil. So, if you're looking for a healthier popcorn that doesn't use coconut or vegetable or hydrogenated oils, this one is pretty good.

review/summary: The best chipotle sauce I have found
review/text: I have used El Yucateco chipotle sauce on an almost daily basis for a few years.  Other brands such as Buffalo don't hold a candle to it.  It was previously available at WalMart stores for well under $2 per bottle.  They have quit selling it, (only have the red and green habanero sauces by El Yucateco) but I have found a mid-west chain, Meijer's that sells it for $1.79 per 5 0z. bottle.<br /><br />The most tasty uses I have found are egg-Mac-Muffins from Mac Donald's, chile, and tacos of the U.S. variety.  It may not be for everyone but my son and his friends have discovered it and are constantly walking off with each other's bottles.

review/summary: A Wonderful Blend. One of my top two Chipotle based hot sauces
review/text: Everyone needs a hobby. I've been blind taste testing hot sauces for over 6 months. I have about 40 hot sauces in my house. I taste test them raw, and then with food; write up some notes and then a week or so later do the same thing again and then compare all my notes. I repeat this process again and again. Like I said: everyone needs a hobby. Frankly I wanted to settle on a few excellent brands because I love hot foods. So for about $75.00 I have a cabinet filled with hot sauces.<br /><br />The first thing that everyone needs to know is that a Chipotle based hot sauce is a sub-category within the hot sauce universe. The chipotle is a smoked jalape&ntilde;o pepper, relatively mild and it has a rich, almost sweet flavor, and it is not that hot. I happen to love its taste but I have discovered there are a number of inferior sauces based on this pepper.<br /><br />The El Yucateco is at the very top of my list for this type of pepper. It has a rich smokey (almost sweet) flavor with some heat. Keep in mind, no chipotle based sauce has searing heat. This blend adds some sugar and even a bit of tomato to its blend. It's only competitor, according to my taste testing, would be Tabasco's Chipotle based sauce which is also excellent. Tabasco adds some vinegar to its blend while El Yucateco adds sugar, corn syrup and tomato paste to theirs. Both seem equally sweet and both have a decent amount of heat. The El Yucateco adds a hint of tomato while the Tabasco adds a fair amount of vinegar. Either one of these brands is vastly superior to all the other Chipotle sauces I have taste tested.<br /><br />FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS YOU SHOULD TRY THIS ONE but watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price per bottle combined with high shipping charges, even when you order many bottles at the same time.<br /><br />Watch out for Amazon sellers that offer a low price but then charge a very high shipping charge on A PER BOTTLE BASIS. In other words, even if you order 6 bottles at the same time - a very high shipping charge will apply - based on the single bottle shipping rate. One way to game the Amazon system is to offer a low price but correspondingly high shipping charges. Buyer beware!

This is the next best thing to a can of chipotles in adobe and a lot easier to deal with when you need a little something in a recipe. I use it in all kinds of things to add depth of flavor: soups, roasts, greens, dressings, mashed potatoes, marinades, bloody Marys.  I could go on for a long time but you get the idea. It's not that spicy. That's what makes it so versatile.

review/summary: Fantastic chipotle sauce
review/text: I always like to try new hot sauces, and I picked up a bottle of this "El Yucateco Chipolte Hot Sauce" at my local Mexican grocer.  Like most human beings who like things that taste good, I love chipotle and use the flavor when I am cooking all the time.<br /><br />I was surprised at my first pour.  This hot sauce wasn't thick like most, but was runny and came pouring out of the bottle.  I gave it a taste, and fell instantly in love.  This little bottle has all the goodness of a can of chipotle in adobe sauce.  It is strong, flavorful, and smoky.  There is almost no heat--at least not to me--and I mixed it with a drop of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DID5R">Dave's Insanity Sauce</a> to give it a little bite.  Even then, I could pour gallons of this onto my food.<br /><br />That is the danger, of course.  Because this sauce is liquid-like, you can run through an entire bottle at a sitting.  And because it tastes so good, you just might want to.

When cooking the canned <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000GGHU6">La Costena Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce, 7 oz.</a> chopped up with my Ninja gives a much stronger kick. I've tried all the different brands available in grocery stores but they were all tangy. This brand so far has been the closest to the true flavor of Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce used by many restaurant's. I also use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JVTT6">McCormick Gourmet Collection Cocoa Chile Blend - 3 Pack</a> in my coffee to add a little smokiness. If you enjoy the wonderful smokey flavor of Chipotle i'd definitely suggest giving this sauce a try.

review/text: What this product needs is one of those jumbo 20-40 oz plastic ketchup-style squirt bottles. Whenever i throw a chili event, I haul out five or six various bottles of stuff. No matter what's on the table, the yucateco gets drained and I'm heartbroken.<br /><br />Its decently hot, but not overwhelming. Doesnt have that hideous acrid vinegar taste that most hot sauces have. Lots of flavor, works with everything, the only way to use it is to upend the little bottle and use a big gob. Basically, anywhere ketchup is good, yucateco is better. I go to wal mart for mine, buy four bottles at a time.

review/summary: Not just another Chipotle
review/text: A little while back, no one had ever heard of chipotle, other than the people who make them.  Then suddenly the dam burst and chipotle came flooding into our land like a spicy tide.  We all love those smokey peppers, and at this point there really isn't anything you can't get with chipotle in it.  Chipotle peanut butter, chipotle caramel corn, chipotle coffee beans... we have been inundated by chipotle.<br /><br />So you might think that this is just another chipotle hot sauce.  How quaint, you think, a chipotle product that actually seems like it should have chipotle in it.  You look at your friends and you all say "Hey, let's be retro and buy some chipotle hot sauce."  You buy a bottle, take it home, and put some on your microwave burrito while watching Championship Poker on ESPN.<br /><br />Suddenly your eyes widen, your burrito slips from your hands, and you rise, zombie-like, all thoughts of televised card games forgotten.  For you see, this stuff is much better than "just another chipotle" hot sauce.  If that's what you're looking for, there are plenty out there, usually overpriced and drab.  This stuff is totally different.<br /><br />The taste sensation is difficult to describe.  It's spicy, very spicy, but the burn is coated with a sweet smokey flavor that makes you eat far too much of it before you realize your throat has burst into flames.  And I say sweet because I mean it.  It's sweet, like chipotle honey, not bitter as many hot sauces based in vinegar (which is great too, just different) are.<br /><br />And by gum, it's good on microwave burritos.  You don't have to live in shame.  Pour it on.  If you can find it in a store, it's cheap too.  What more can you ask for?  Buy it now!  Do it!

review/text: I ordered this sauce because I love the smokey delicate taste that the Chipotle chile is known for. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. This sauce didn't have much to offer. For starters it wasn't very hot. It's flavor was saturated with way too much vinegar and its was to sweet making it difficult to mix well with any Mexican food. Now I grew up with at least 5 home-made sauces and salsa on the table at all times so I've had my sure of hot sauces and I place this sauce right below "Tapatio". Let this be a Warning to all Mexicans your moms sauce is probably better! Or If you want the real stuff gets some Chipotles and eat them right out of a can.... If you can handle it.

In tasting the Hoisin I realized this is the stuff my favorite Chinese restaurant uses on their delicious BBQ ribs;  probably right out of the bottle too.  After using only 1/2 of this bottle of Lee Kum Kee Hoisin Sauce, I immediately got online and ordered 3 more as our local grocer doesn't carry it. Sure wouldn't want to run out of this delicious sauce.  I'm invisioning this on poultry and beef as well as pork. This is our new alternate BBQ sauce; has about the same thickness.  Wonderful, complex flavor. This is what teriyaki would like to be when it grows up. I confess I am now hooked on Hoisin.

review/summary: The best of the Taboulis
review/text: Having tried numerous brands over the years, I find this the absolute best of all Tabouli mixes.  Every year or two when a new brand comes out I try it, and every time without exception I go back to Casbah.  So now I've gotten to the point of not even bothering to try new competitors.  When I've found Casbah on sale I've bought 20 or 30 boxes at a time, but now that is unnecessary due to Amazon's great price.<br /><br />My favorite tabouli preparation is to mix in the juice of one fresh lemon, decreasing recommended water a little accordingly, then adding a diced small tomato, chopped green onions (or regular onion if green unavailable), and fresh cilantro.  Enough cilantro for a moderate amount in every bite or two - but cilantro can overwhelm if too much is put in.  Occasionally I'll add some garlic or green garlic for variety.  And when I really want variety I add jalapeno or some sort of hot chile pepper.

review/summary: Healthy side dish
review/text: I make this according to instructions and it seems to work fine. Additional ingredients are recommended depending on your needs or tastes.<br />For example, sometimes I add fresh tomatoes or sweet onions, cucumber, olives, celery . . . whatever. Usually fresh lemon if it is available.<br />The added ingredients lift the flavors and give it more character.  If you want even more depth, use hot broth instead of water to reconstitute the dehydrated ingredients.

review/text: I have purchased this same product in grocery stores, but got a much better deal by purchasing it at Amazon.  I don't turn on my oven more than I have to during the summer, so tabouli is a staple in my fridge.  This brand tastes good and is easy to make.  Buying a case of this mix should keep me in tabouli through this summer!

review/text: I did not know what to expect when I ordered this product online but was extremely pleased when I first tried it.<br />I had Tabouli years ago and when I moved to South Texas, I could not find it anywhere. It tasted as good as that which I had previously grown to love years ago. I think adding the tomatoes makes it work even better and you could not find too many better foods to eat in the hot summer in South Texas like Tabouli,that is so good for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more Casbah Tabouli through Amazon. It came in the mail so fast, I couldn't believe it.<br />Thanks for the great experience.<br /><br />Marilyn

review/summary: Reasonable Tabouli mix
review/text: I live in a rural area, where the local grocery store does not carry bulgar or even parsley (most of the time the lemons are iffy too).  The mix is not as good as fresh tabouli, primarily due to the texture of the parsley.  When I made it with some fresh parsley mixed in, it was much better.  You can't beat the convenience factor though, 5 minutes of work and a couple of hours refrigeration is all it takes.

Number 2, follow the directions on the box and they will have you put 1/3 of a cup of olive oil in the mix....way too much olive oil.  Next time I will try only a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.  Best bet is to buy Near East Taboule....much better!

review/summary: More Ovaltine Please
review/text: As a child I did not care for Ovaltine.  It was too malty.  I  received a sample of this in the mail and was pleasantly surprised.  It had a good chocolate flavor with just a hint of malt.  I purchased a cannister and found that it mixes well with both soy and almond milk.  You can make a decent smoothie with it and it makes a hearty cup of hot cocoa.  Enriched with 12 vitamins and minerals, it has no artificial sweeteners or flavors. I would suggest using less than the package recommends and then adjusting for taste. For those who prefer the malty version, try either the classic malt or chocolate malt.  The maltines is understated in the rich chocolate flavor which,in my opinion, is an improvment.

review/text: I have to say that it has been many years since I was a kid watching cartoons on a Saturday morning with my glass of chocolate milk.  But I still enjoy a good glass of chocolate milk and even an occasional cartoon.  I was not fortunate enough to be introduced to Ovaltine as a child so I am making up for it as an adult.  I enjoy the flavor of all three of their versions, but in my opinion Malt is the best.  You will save money per container by buying a case of Amazon instead of in the stores.  They shipped in a timely manner and arrived safely.  The nice thing about Ovaltine is that besides tasting good it also has vitamins and minerals.  If you are drinking the original flavor you can try adding flavored creamer to give it a kick.

review/text: Tasty, but arrived crushed. No, I did not order other heavy things with this item, it was the only thing in there, yet I opened the box to find the corn in several pieces in the bag. It looked like it was the candy corn no one wanted to buy after Halloween, if you know what i mean. There was not one perfect looking corn in there. For me, this was a huge bust because I was going to make candy corn cupcakes for Halloween, and these were going to be the decoration on top. 2 stars though because it tastes good. Not the best ive ever tasted, but it makes for a good snack. Again though, it really was disappointing for all of them to be crushed. I'll probably just take the 4 mile drive to buy some for a bit cheaper next time. Those I know won't be crumbled.

review/text: I used to buy pods at Starbucks, but I started longing for something a little more authentic. Luckily, my fiancee bought me the PodMerchant Megasampler as a Christmas present. I was overwhelmed!<br /><br />I never knew there were so many different kinds of espresso pods available, especially from one store. The selection in this sampler is huge, and it includes both caffeinated and decaf pods.  (There is also the Super Sampler but it doesn't include decaf, which is nice sometimes in the evening).<br /><br />After trying these pods we found which espressos we liked best and have been buying those, but it all started with the Mega sampler. The shipping was also very fast.<br /><br />If you're looking to expand your coffee horizons and have an espresso pod machine, you'll almost certainly find some new favorites in here.

review/text: Let me start off by thanking PodMerchant for doing the right thing because they did not have to.  So Thanks PodMerchant.  I have purchased their samplers before and been very satisfied.  This time I went for the big one...the Mega Sampler, 46 different pods (92 total as they double each pod in the package). Somewhere in the fine print they mention that some decaf pods will be included.  When I received my package, alas, the total number of decaf pods equaled roughly 30% of the total order.  Not drinking espresso for the decaf-thrill I emailed them my thoughts.  They emailed back telling me if I returned the decaf (in the original packaging) they would send me regular pods as replacements.  Much appreciated.  I was also informed that in the future I should probably not buy the Mega sampler as decaf pods are part of the deal.  Now a simple solution to this problem is a check box letting me decide if I want decaf or not. I proposed this idea.  I have not heard back regarding the brilliance of my thinking. :)<br />So BEWARE, if you order the Mega Sampler you will receive about 28 decaf pods...great if you like to knock back an espresso before bed.

This is my dad's favorite and is a staple for Christmas, his birthday and Father's Day.  The seller was great too!  He called to tell me when he was shipping the package, so I could keep an eye out for it.  Will order again!

review/summary: Great BBQ sauce!
review/text: I bought this BBQ sauce about 2 years ago in Key West, brought it home and it sat on the shelf for a few months. Once I opened it and tried it I was hooked. I love the hot spicy taste. I eat a lot of chicken and it goes great on chicken. I go through a bottle a month now.

review/summary: liked it
review/text: The bottle was much larger than I was imagining it would be. The sauce is very sweet and is not overly hot. No overpowering whisky taste, just a nice flavorful sweet barbecue sauce with hints of heat and undertones of bourbon. It is really nice actually and I thoroughly enjoyed it. What a pleasant surprise indeed.

review/text: Delivery was quick. However, when it arrived the lid was completely broken even though it looked securely wrapped in bubble wrap. Very disappointed that the product was damaged.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: After purchasing some of the 3 moon at a local store, I was very impressed.  I liked it so much I decided to get a 5 lb bag.  Unfortunately what I got in the  5 pound bad was quite inferior to what I had purchased in the store (Earth Fare is where I purchased my two 1lb bags).  The 5 lb bag might as well have been labeled "Stale Folgers".  Really disappointed in the consistency of product quality.

review/summary: A coffee that always tastes great
review/text: This is my first review I have after written.  I had purchased the 12oz variety 3 pack and they all tasted good.  But I have to say the 3 Moon Peru was so good that I did the subscrbe and save and buy in 5 pound bags. This coffee s very smooth and pleasing to the palate.

review/summary: Pretty good coffee...
review/text: All was as expected.  The flavor was good, not my favorite, but that's a subjective thing so won't ding the review too much for that.  The beans were fresh and did the job!  I would order Larry's again, but probably a different flavor.

review/summary: decent medium roast
review/text: We are finicky fans of dark roast coffee & our favorite local coffee shop has an unbelievable dark roast they call Peru.  So we decided to give Larry's Beans 3 Moon Peru a try.  While we can certainly attest that it is not a dark roast, it is quite pleasant for a medium roast brew.  Fair trade, shade grown, organic coffee... how can you go wrong (unless of course, you are stuck on dark roast coffee)?!  Cheers
