review/summary: more of candy treat vs a cookie- MESSY !
review/text: love peanut and chocolate and was pleased to try these cookies... Well they are very similar to Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies with peanut butter filling vs mint.<br />That said I would consider these more of candy treat vs a cookie.. Very thin wafer cookie topped with sm amt of lightly flavored peanut butter and the whole thing encased in very chocolaty coating.<br /><br />Just 1-2 is more than enough and I wouldn't serve these as a after dinner cookie but perhaps a mid meal light treat with large glass of milk but only occasionally. Not as peanutty as I expected but very clearly peanut flavored.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled with the packaging. it has a new type of pull tab opening that flips open the whole top of the cookie package exposing all of the cookies at once.. when opened more than 1/3 of the cookies had flipped out of their slots in the cookie holder and some were smashed against each other and had to be pulled apart. Can't imagine this would survive in the heat of summer if it can't make it through this mild spring weather.. Looks like they might be a melty mess in warm weather..<br /><br />I enjoyed these but not sure would be a repeat order for us. Due to the candy-like nature of the treat. and we live in a warm climate and this just looks like a mess in the making for our climate..

review/summary: Not much Oreo flavor, slight artificial aftertaste
review/text: I love love LOVE regular Oreos, the Oreo Mint Fudge Covered Limited Edition Chocolate Sandwich Cookies are to die for, and I love peanut butter...so I wanted to love these...but I didn't.<br /><br />If I didn't know it was an Oreo cookie piece, I'd never be able to tell it's an Oreo. The thin peanut butter layer is smooth and creamy, but leaves a faintly artificial aftertaste. They reminded me slightly of the old school Girl Scout cookies called Hoedowns (now called Tagalongs) but not nearly as thick or as rich tasting. Maybe if it had a thicker cookie layer it would taste more like an Oreo.<br /><br />So overall, three stars for a "meh" rating. I'm not going to toss the package I have, but I wouldn't likely buy them again.

review/summary: Why compromise a classic?
review/text: There is a certain aesthetic appeal to eating an Oreo cookie.  The twisting apart.  The dunking first one half or the other in a glass of milk.  Unless, of course, you prefer to keep the cookie whole and dunk it in like that.  They have made an entire industry on the concept with so many commercials reminding us about the rituals of eating Oreo cookies.<br /><br />So why would they create this cookie?  Okay.  It has an Oreo bit to it, only one cookie.  No twisting apart.  The filling is there, except this time it's peanut butter and not that snowy white filling one typically associates with a classic Oreo cookie.  Then this mutation-one-sided cookie with flavored filling-is covered in chocolate.  This doesn't exactly inspire one to dip it in a glass of milk because the cookie would go untouched, covered as it is in chocolate.  If the cookie can't soak up the milk, there's really no point in dunking.<br /><br />Three different people tried this new variation on a theme and all three of us shrugged.  It's a good cookie but we've all had better.  And one of us is an Oreo cookie fan.  He said he wouldn't buy these.  He'd rather not have his Oreo covered in chocolate and he definitely wanted both cookies with the cream filling sandwiched in between.<br /><br />None of us, truth be told, would buy these cookies.<br /><br />This was a disappointment.  An overly sweet one.  And for those Oreo cookie eaters who take delight in the ritual of eating an Oreo, this cookie simply will not suffice.

review/text: Blindfold someone, and they may not be able to tell the difference between this cookie and a girl scout tagalong. I guess if you are deathly seriously about your cookies, you'll notice some small difference. Not me. I don't know what this has to do with Oreos. No cream stuffing. Big deal, if you like chocolate and peanut butter you'll like this.

review/summary: Tastes good to me but probably not great for health
review/text: It does taste fine to me. It has a good peanut butter flavor yet at the same time tastes like Oreo. However, look at the ingredient list. The top ingredient is sugar, followed by oil (the third ingredient is flour). Eat/buy with moderation. I like the packaging, which allows you to seal the package after taking out some cookies - great idea. This helps keeps the cookies fresher longer.

review/summary: Look out, Girlscouts
review/text: This is a review for the Oreo Peanut Butter Fudge Creme cookies:<br />These cookies invite the obvious comparison to Girlscout Tagalongs.  I'll detail the differences so my fellow Tagalong junkies will know what to expect.<br />1.  The cookie in the Oreo offering is a single chocolate wafer.  If memory serves, a Tagalog cookie is not chocolate<br />2.  The peanut butter in the Oreo is more a peanut butter flavored creme than straight peanut butter.  Personally I'd rather have more peanut butter and less creme.<br />3.  The Oreo cookie is quite a bit thinner than a Tagalong-less cookie and peanut butter both.<br />4.  The Oreo has a faint aftertaste that is reminiscent of Crisco.<br /><br />In summation- these were yummy but not "to die for".  I really expected a traditional two-layer peanut butter filled Oreo dipped in Chocolate.  That would have been great and more in keeping with the Oreo brand.  Don't get me wrong though, we had no problem polishing off the box in lightning speed!

review/summary: Not what I expected.
review/text: When I first opened up the packages, I was kind of disappointed because they weren't as big as I thought they would be, I think the packaging is a bit misleading. It is like one of those burger king commercials where they show a mouth watering thick hamburger and when you go to order it you get a thin soggy looking thing. That is how I felt.<br /><br />It is a thin oreo wafer, then a thin layer of peanut butter wrapped in fudge. The oreo is not a regular size oreo, and the peanut butter isn't even the thickness of the regular white creme in an oreo. Because the peanut butter and fudge is so sweet the oreo almost tastes a bit salty to me. It does kind of taste like those girl scout cookies the Tagalong, but I am pretty sure you get more peanut in those.<br /><br />Overall taste I do like, maybe a tad bit sweet. But if you have a craving for chocolate and peanut butter this will sure do the trick!

review/summary: Not that great.  Shouldn't be labeled oreos as they really aren't.
review/text: This review is for the peanut butter fudge oreos. Evidently they may have the same code as the fudge cremes as this is the link I was given to review them from the Vine program. The peanut butter fudge oreos are not really oreos in my opinion. They really shouldn't use the name Oreo as I personally think it implies that they have an oreo taste somewhere in them. Yes there is a VERY thin oreo crust cookie in them but that taste is overwhelmed by the peanut butter and fudge. It hardly has any taste of oreo at all. Also, these cookies are very thin and there aren't as many as I expected in the package. Nobody in my household likes these cookies. Everyone who has tried them says they are nothing special and are a very forgettable cookie. I'm sure there are some people who like them, just not us.

review/text: These are our puggle's favorite treat!  We discovered the cheese snacks at a small boutique pet store and the dog fell in love with them -- he loves anything made of cheese.  I was thrilled to find them at Amazon in the two pack at a savings!  The treats themselves are small -- about the size of a nickel -- so they are better for smaller dogs.  They even smell good!  Only drawback is that there seems to be a lot of broken pieces and cheese "dust" at the bottom of the bag.

review/summary: My super picky puppy LOVES it!
review/text: I have a super picky Cavalier King Charles puppy who refuses to eat dry food, and even some wet food. Generally she has to be coaxed to eat her meals. We had her on an expensive brand of canned food, which she mostly liked, but in an effort to save some money, I switched her to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Puppy canned food. SHE LOVES IT. I do not have to even try to get her to eat- she devours it the minute I put the bowl down. It is still a very "healthy" food, and it saves me $15 every time I order! Highly recommend, super, super happy!!

review/summary: Great! My favorite flavor!
review/text: These are my favorite type of Jelly Bellies. I had been eyeing this product for some time. After a few glasses of wine, I decided that this was a must buy because its price per pound was much lower than a single pound of this flavor. The price is still pretty high, but it is about the same price as buying 5 single pounds. I have been snacking on these for a few months. They are still around, and I still love them.<br /><br />The product arrived in a cardboard box with the jelly beans directly in the box. No plastic bag or anything, just the shipping box filled with jelly beans. I am not a huge germaphobe, but would have preferred a better container than the shipping box. This was the only reason why I docked it a star.

Very different from the canned corned beef I grew up with, the fine textured kind, like Libbys or Hormel.<br /><br />But, you must shop around for price. Prices vary considerably. Also, if you live in an area with good Asian grocery stores you can often find it there and avoid paying for shipping.<br /><br />Cooking tip. The meat has a fair amount of moisture and fat. I heat it gently in a sauce pan until the fat & moisture separate, dump it into a wire strainer & then back in the pan. Makes for a much leaner and tastier result.

I am glad I did because it tastes very good. And the fudge is just the right amount of sweetness without going overboard. If you are dieting this is the perfect amount to satisfy your cravings. The real test is limiting yourself to just the one package a serving.

review/summary: These disappeared real fast in my household!
review/text: I swear a box of these lasted for three days between my boyfriend and me.  It's a very tasty snack and I don't normally like caramel popcorn.  For the price, I would prefer the popcorn just in a large bag inside so I could put whatever amount I wanted in sandwich bag.  I find all this "convenience" packaging a bit hard for my green side to take.  I don't think I would buy this item due to its price, even when it is on sale at my local grocery.  They had them two boxes for $5 which comes out to 50 cents a bag.  If I bought a bag of popcorn or even popped it at home, I could make a bag of it to take on trips for a fraction of the cost.  Overall, the box did disappear in my household rather fast, so if you don't mind extra packaging and want to pay a bit more for the convenience, then this is probably a product for you if you like popcorn as much as I do.

review/summary: Portion control and taste!
review/text: It's difficult for me not to be a little conflicted about Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn.  On one hand, there is no denying the fact that they taste delicious!  On the other hand, there is the misperception of many that just because it's Snackwells, it's better for you than a "regular" snack.  That's not necessarily the case.<br /><br />The advantage to this product is the portion control.  One packet totals 130 calories and there is no question that they are delicious!  Just don't eat 5 packets of them and think that you're adhering to your diet.

review/text: This popcorn is so delicious I would compare it to gourmet popcorns that retail for quite a lot. I also have a hard time believing that this product is so low calorie! An excellent afternoon indulgence, this popcorn is generously drizzled with a sweet and creamy fudge. The carmel coating gives the popcorn a satisfying crunch. This popcorn satisfied my desire for a salty sweet treat and didn't overload me on calories. Highly recommend!

review/summary: Be Careful... They are Deliciously Sweet and Yummy
review/text: I didn't know what to expect from a "SnackWell's" carmel corn product, but I was delightfully surprised! This is a delicious snack, just the right amount of caramel and chocolate. However, I would never classify this as healthy or a "diet" food. It is simply packaged in small individual serving size packets, with 130 cal. per packet. And guess what... you need to have enough willpower to keep from opening two or three of the packets at one time, as I did when I first tried these delectable treats! So, they do taste great, but don't fool yourself into thinking it's something healthy. If you can manage to eat one serving occasionally (in moderation as we should with all high-sugar snacks), then go for it!

review/text: I love popcorn<br />I love chocolate<br />and I love sugar<br /><br />This box arrived with six small bags of chocolate drizzled caramel popcorn.  Generally prepackaged popcorn has a stale taste to it, but this stuff was fantastic.  VERY sugary which may be a turn off to some, and a little pricey for what is essentially crunch n munch with chocolate on it... but this stuff was good.  So good that between my boyfriend and I the entire box didn't last 12 hours.  At our rate of consumption the bags were too small, but if you were looking for something to have as a small snack or to add to a lunch then these are perfect.  I'll wait for the jumbo size to come out and buy those :)

Sweet caramel popcorn and rich chocolate are such a great combination, and I love that this is so convenient I can throw it into my purse or lunchbag and know that I will have a satisfying and delicious treat later.  Will definitely buy again and am excited about trying out different flavors!

review/summary: Very, very sweet, not diet food
review/text: I love caramel popcorn, and I assumed these were a "diet" version, but they're not.  What it is is a portion control item made from full caloried ingredients.  Brown sugar is the first ingredient, for example.  They're actually quite good, although the chocolate has little flavor.  The buttery caramel part is tasty.  I liked them as a portion control item, but they won't work for most "diet" regimes due to the amount of sugar.  I might buy them to toss in lunches.

review/summary: Caramel Corn = YUM! (fudge drizzle = meh.)
review/text: These crunchy sweet golden nuggets are tasty, and thankfully for those of us with poor impulse control, in small portion pouches (one 130 calorie pouch = 3 Weight Watchers Points Plus).<br /><br />I wasn't that thrilled with the Fudge drizzle; it didn't taste bad, it just didn't have much taste. An occasional hint of chocolate, but mostly just waxy blandness. Thankfully, it's just a light "drizzle", and not a full coating.<br /><br />I don't know if they offer this option, but I would prefer just the plain caramel corn; without the fudge drizzle, they could increase the portion size a little for the same calorie/points value.

review/text: "Snackwell fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn" is a good treat for calorie-counting sweet fiends, with each box containing five individually-wrapped portions at 130 calories each. However, I can't distinguish between the fudge and caramel taste...all I get from each bite is an overpowering taste of generic, artificial-tasting sweetness.<br /><br />Still, if you have a strong sweet-tooth and are watching your weight, you'll probably dig this, as the packaging is certainly convenient and the price is fair for what you get.

review/summary: a light snack, but very sweet and high in sugar
review/text: I love popcorn, corn snacks, any snacks made out of popcorn or corn -- so I wanted to give these a try. As a popcorn snack, it's very hearty and yet relatively light, even though these are "caramel" and "chocolate drizzled" pieces of popcorn. It helps satisfy a sweet snacking urge.<br /><br />The popcorn itself is well-popped, with no hard pieces or excess bits of kernels. It's fluffy and airy. I really wish I knew how they can get popcorn this "perfect". Each piece is coated in caramel, and drizzled in chocolate, and some pieces are coated on the bottom with chocolate.<br /><br />And therein lies the problem. Although this is a "SnackWells" snack, and meant to be a healthy choice, each 1.06 ounce package (the box contains 5 packages) clocks in at 130 calories with 3g of fat, 2.5g of which are saturated. Additionally, each package contains 18g of sugar. Sure, it tastes good, but that's a lot of sugar for a "healthy" snack. Two of the first three ingredients are "brown sugar" and "sugar". If you're trying to avoid sugar for any reason, this really isn't a good option.<br /><br />I got through one box and enjoyed it, having it usually with a cup of tea in the afternoon. But I won't pick this up again. It isn't worthy of a "healthy" snacking label, although it really does taste good. If you just want a low calorie snack regardless of sugar content, then I recommend it.

review/text: If you love caramel popcorn drizzled in chocolate you will love this! Not much else to say about it than that. The only reservation I have about this product is the name "Snackwell" makes you think you are eating a health product. Not so! The packaging is in 130 calorie packs to prevent you from over eating the food, but other than that, this is a standard high sugar snack. 18 g of sugar in one small pack (30g). After eating one pack, there will be a serious temptation to devour the remaining 4 packs.

review/summary: Better than expected
review/text: I really did not have very high expectations for Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, so I was surprised when it turned out to be a tasty, satisfying snack. Nabisco has managed to strike a balance between the popcorn, the caramel coating, and the fudge drizzle. They are fairly sweet, but the sweetness is offset by a slight saltiness. I did not detect any stale or old taste in the popcorn. I found the 130-calorie portion to be adequate and satisfying, but I don't have much of a sweet tooth; my weakness is salty snacks.<br /><br />According to an article in the New York Times, "All of the new SnackWell's products have a suggested retail price of $3.19 for a box of five servings.". This works out to about 64 cents a serving, which seems in line with a lot of portion-controlled snacks. I expect they will available from time-to-time at a deep discount at many grocers and mass merchandisers such as Target and Walmart. There is a white fudge version of this product and two varieties of brownie bits being rolled out at the same time.<br /><br />Shipping note: It was in the 80's the day these were delivered. The package had spent at least a couple of hours in a postal van with no air-conditioning and sat in the sun on my porch for about five minutes after being dropped by the carrier. I opened one pack right away and found the chocolate to be gooey, but not melted. I put the opened pack and the box in the refrigerator immediately. Later when I tried the cooled packs I found a little clumping in a couple of the packs. I think if it had been much warmer or if I had left the parcel on the porch much longer, I might have ended up with five individually-wrapped popcorn balls.

review/text: These yummy popcorn snacks are definitely addictive, offering a pleasing combination of crunchy and sweet.They contain no artificial ingredients which I think is why they don't taste like "junk" food. The individual packages are only 130 calories which makes them a good choice for a quick but sweet snack when you don't want to  "go all the way" with a calorie loaded candy bar! For those who follow Weight Watchers, these packs are equal to 3 points. I will definitely buy more of these snacks.

Even our candy-loving child declared these are too sweet and it is hard to consume one whole packet.

review/text: This caramel corn really does taste great with the fudge drizzle, the chocolate flavor is aparent but not overpowering, so you get to taste both caramel and chocolate.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant about them being in pre-packaged, 130 calorie sizes, as most of those 100cal pack snacks are very very small bags, and the bag I pulled out of the box looked no different, very small.  But I was surprised to find out that you do actually get a decent amount of caramel corn per bag (apparently they just LOOK small, they actually hold quite a bit), and they are well suited for bag lunches and snacks.<br /><br />Reccommended.

review/summary: Good flavor but not filling and very sweet
review/text: This is not the perfect snack, but it does have several benefits.  On the upside, Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn has good flavor.  The chocolate and caramel flavors taste rich and real.  The popcorn is nice and crisp and not at all stale like some popcorn snacks.  On the downside, this snack is high in sugar (the carb count is 24 grams, 18 grams of which is sugar).  Because of the high sugar content and the fact that this snack is only 130 calories, the serving size is quite small--about 1/2 cup.<br /><br />In my opinion, there are many other snack choices that are more substantial and filling for the same or fewer calories.  A mini-bag of light popcorn, for example, is only 100 calories for about 3 cups of popcorn.  The Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn would be a good choice for an after-dinner treat when you want something sweet but aren't particularly hungry after dinner.  For afternoon hunger pangs, however, this snack is likely to be unsatisfying.

review/text: This snack isn't bad, but it isn't much more than average either.  The combination of sweet and salty is one I like, but the sugar content is pretty high for such a small snack (18 grams), so to balance it out, it seems the salty taste is pretty high too.  I did not notice much of a chocolate flavor at all. On the other hand, my husband, who is not a big chocolate fan and loves his salty snacks, thought the flavors were well balanced.  I received these to try through the Vine program but probably won't buy them for myself.

review/summary: Depends on What You're Looking For...
review/text: There are three ways you can judge Nabisco's SnackWell's Caramel Drizzle Popcorn:  taste, health/diet concerns, and price.  On the first count, these are excellent.  Given it mixes caramel and popcorn, there will inevitably be some similarly to Cracker Jack, but these have a far better flavor in my book.  On the diet/health side, the only major concern is the high sugar content but then the pluses elsewhere are likely achieved by the small package side more than anything.  Where it lets down is in the pricing.  $35 for a half dozen small bags of popcorn??  I might expect that in a movie theatre but not in the marketplace.  So give it 5 stars on taste, 3 on health/diet, and 1 on pricing.

review/summary: Tasty and indulgent
review/text: These nifty little snacks are tasty and convenient--the chocolate and caramel combines with the popcorn to create a very pleasant (and relatively healthy) treat. Each box contains five 130 calorie packs (I think 100 calorie packs would have worked just as well), and each package is a convenient way to include a "dessert" in the brown bag or lunchbox you or your kids bring to work or school each day. There's not much nutrition here, but at least the treat doesn't cost you too much in the way of saturated fat (only 2.5 g per package), and only 25 of the calories come from fat.<br /><br />The fudge-drizzled caramel popcorn packs are a good fit for the SnackWell's line (which seems to have disappeared over the years--does this product mark some sort of a renaissance for the brand?). My only criticism--the foil packages are a bit narrow at the top, so it becomes somewhat challenging to reach the treats as you get to the bottom of the pack--a more square and less rectangular package might have worked better.

review/text: This is individual packs of fudge drizzled popcorn.  It reminds me of crackerjacks with fudge drizzled on it.  It is very sweet - it has caramel and chocolate - but if you like crackerjacks, which I grew up loving, then you should like this.  Thankfully the package is just over one ounce - small enough to limit the calories to 130.<br /><br />I am not sure I would want or need more than one pack at a time.  It would be easy to overload on the sugar.<br /><br />It is popcorn and it can get stuck between your teeth.  But I did not find any un-popped kernels in the package.<br /><br />The chocolate is fairly good, but not overly thick.<br /><br />If you don't like crackerjacks or you don't like really sweet snacks, stay away from these.  If you love crackerjacks and/or want a really sweet snack, this is might hit the spot for you.<br /><br />Overall a very tasty treat but beware it is on the sweet side.

review/text: I love popcorn, and I love caramel popcorn, but I have avoided this kind of snack for years as best I can because of the loaded calories and sugar, but now I can once again enjoy this treat!<br /><br />Snackwell and Nabisco are trusted in the industry for items that are known for being on the healthy side of indulgence, and they have scored again with the FUDGE drizzled CARAMEL POPCORN - just wonderful - and only 130 caolries per serving. It is not too salty, not too sweet. There is no lingering chemical taste from sweetners that some low calorie or diet products have. The popcorn is fresh and crunchy, which means that caramel is not so overpowering that everything sticks.<br />Also, the caramel is light enough that it does not pull teeth out of your head! This snack is just the right combination of sweet flavors and crunch.<br /><br />Also, I like that there are 5 individually wrapped servings in the box...it slows me down from eating the entire thing in one sitting! It also ensures for those more disciplined than me that the reamining product will be fresh when it is time for another snack.<br /><br />These are easy to pack in a luch bag or box or slip in a purse or in the glove compartment of your car. The only problem is that there are only five packages in the box. I hope the company produces a bigger box with more packages for those of us with families and kids.<br /><br />Besides the low 130 calories, there is ZERO cholesterol, only 3 grams of fat, and relatively low sodium and sugars, especially in comparison to less healthy products.

review/summary: Delicious and Different
review/text: Most of us have tried some variation of this type of gourmet popcorn. There are brands with caramel, brands with nuts, some with cinammon, or even zesty spices.<br /><br />What I liked best about this SnackWell's popcorn was the VARIETY of tastes in each little bite.  First, there's the fluffy popcorn, nice and fresh tasting, and then there's the sweet caramel which is enhanced by just the right amount of salty flavor. It's all topped off by a rich, light drizzle of chocolate. The total flavor is a delicious blending of all of the above!<br /><br />A few other facts:<br /><br />Calories--130<br />Total fat--3g<br />Sodium--190 mg<br />Price--up there!<br /><br />Price aside, I'd recommend this as a special treat for anyone who craves a snack that's delicious and different than the "same-old" popcorn.

review/summary: Expensive, but Delicious Delicacy!
review/text: I may be nit-picking, and everyone has a right to decide what they can afford, but Snackwell's Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is unaffordable right now as a regular reward snack.  (I can get truffles for about the same price from Wyoming for a little bit less.)<br /><br />Having gotten that off my chest, the rest of you, who can throw caution or money to the wind would do well to treat yourself to one of the freshest and tastiest gourmet dainties that have ever reached my lips!  The drizzled chocolate is perfection:  Not enough to drown the carmel, and not too little to tease.<br /><br />Forget about those large tins of carmel, cinnamon, and cheese popcorn you get for Christmas.  This is about a hundred times tastier, ten times fresher, and exponentially more expensive.  (And, I, for one, won't complain about those Christmas tins!)<br /><br />Not only do Snackwell's assume you are worth pampering, but the label says each packet has 130 calories per pack, so if you can afford such a richly deserved set of nibbles, time truly IS money.<br /><br />In a word, this Nabisco product is the caviar of snacks!  Forget the fig newtons, et al, they've come a long way!

review/summary: Very Tasty and Convenient Snack
review/text: Nabisco's Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn are individually wrapped packages of chocolate drizzled caramel corn.  The individual bags are approximately 1oz each and have 130 calories which I think is just about right for snacking.<br /><br />I found the Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn to have an excellent caramel flavor and a good crunchy consistency.  I personally was not able to taste the chocolate very much but I shared them with some folks in the office and they thought they had a nice, chocolaty flavor.  I like caramel corn and found the taste to be very good.  The individually wrapped Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn are a convenient and tasty snack and I would buy they again.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  I did not consider price in making my recommendation.

review/summary: Crackerjacks with a chocolate drizzle
review/text: If you are a fan of caramel corn (or crackerjacks), you will enjoy these. Essentially, they are a heavily covered caramel corn, drizzled over with just the right amount of chocolate.<br /><br />I am trying to be specific about the level of caramel, since the brand I have been using is actually "kettle corn" with the chocolate, and taste quite different than these do. These are much sweeter, and really hit home when it comes to having a "sweet tooth."<br /><br />Since they have 150 calories, you will need to be cautious about including them in your diet, but if you are a caramel corn fan, it will be well worth finding a place for these.

review/summary: You can't snack "well" with corn syrup
review/text: Maintaining a healthy diet is always about choices.  I can choose potato chips to go with my sandwich or apple slices.  I love both, but choosing the apples will have a nutritional benefit.  The chips will not.<br /><br />Having said that, I understand that Nabisco is trying to offer not a 'more healthy' snack but a if-you-must-snack-at-least-lower-the-fat-and-calories choice with this product.  I appreciate that.  I do have those stressful days when my attitude is one of survival--as in, "I need something sweet and decadent to survive this day."  On those days, I reach for something other than apple slices.  And this caramel popcorn, given it's crunchiness and flavor (and fudge drizzlings!) would be perfect--except for the corn syrup.<br /><br />Had Nabisco chosen another sweetener, I'd be a convert to this popcorn and would be buying boxes to keep in my cupboard at work.  But the corn syrup is a deal breaker for me.  If it's not for you, try these!

review/summary: Nice snack
review/text: The Packaging: I box has 5 packs in it. Each pack has about maybe 50-75% as much popcorn in it as those small 99c bags of popcorn chips. The packs themselves are smaller than a 99c bag of chips; very portable.<br /><br />Taste: The fudge and caramel mix nicely. Its not overly sweet, and you get a nice fudge aftertaste as it melts in your mouth. Its not salty and doesnt leave any sticky residue on your fingers. Its alittle too crunchy and occasionally you run into uneatable bits of popcorn, which may be normal in regular popcorn but really shouldnt be in a sweet snack.<br /><br />Health: Each pack in the box has 130 calories, with 3g Fat, 24g Carbs, 18g Sugars.<br /><br />Verdict: There are healthier snacks that are cheaper than this but if you like popcorn, fudge, and caramel give it a try.

review/text: My fiancee and I thoroughly enjoyed this product.  It's a good light snack and the bag actually has a good amount of popcorn in it for having only 130 calories.  It tastes like Fiddle-Faddle except it's a little more chocolatey and there are no nuts in it. It's probably not as healthy as Cheerios to snack on, but even with the chocolate on it, I bet it's healthier than non-baked potato chips.  Healthier than Fiddle-Faddle too I bet.

review/text: It's exactly what is pictured on the box (how often does THAT happen?): caramel popcorn striped with hard chocolate icing.  The flavor is a great balance of butter, caramel and fudge with just a touch of salt and "roasted" flavor.  A few nuts would have been nice, and added some protein, but the absence of nuts means kids can take this to school, camp and other nut-free zones.  Pouches are very easy to open.  No, it's not health food, just a little treat when you want something sweet and fruit just doesn't cut it.

review/summary: Sweet and Salty Goodness
review/text: I love most Snackwell products, so I was looking forward to trying this one.  The popcorn is just right, fresh and crunchy, and has the right balance of caramel drizzled with just a bit of chocolate. I enjoyed the flavors together; this type of combo (sweet/salty) is a favorite of mine. One 130 calorie bag is just enough to hit the spot when you need a little something to satisfy the between meal hunger pangs.  I love their single serving bags; they are easy to toss in a lunchbox or purse for when you are on the go. My husband even liked it, and he's hesitant to try the lower calorie pack snacks. I'm glad I tried the popcorn; this snack is a winner!

review/text: Snackwell's is known as one of first producers of healthier snacks and this fudge drizzle caramel popcorn is no exception.  It's delicious and each bag only has 130 calories.  Since it's just drizzled, it's not very sweet but you can still taste the fudge and caramel.  The box comes with 6 5.3 oz bags, which to me is just the right size.  I think portion control is just as important as calorie count.  I find one bag is enough to satisfy a snack craving.

review/summary: Nice and fun snack
review/text: I have to say I enjoyed these. They are a nice balance of sweet, salty, and of course the drizzle of chocolate! There was enough in the bag for it to be a good snack. Funny to say, but at times there was a tad too much chocolate drizzle that over powered the popcorn taste. I would be willing to add these to my snack rotation. Of course, this isn't a snack that can stand alone for a few hours - it is more of something to stave off the 3:00 hunger pains that get you in trouble before dinner.<br />Just 4 stars instead of 5 because it would be nice if it were 100 calories instead of the 130. I start to feel guilty if a snack is over 110 calories. Maybe holding back a bit on the chocolate would help. Overall - a great snack though.

review/summary: A Pretty Tasty Snack...
review/text: I chose this from the Vine program because I rather like caramel popcorn.  As far as caramel popcorn goes, this is a pretty tasty snack.  Flavor-wise, I thought it had a very good caramel taste, but I felt like the chocolate drizzle was a bit overkill.  I just felt like the chocolate didn't add anything good to the flavor (plus the chocolate itself doesn't taste all that good).  What else to say about these?  Well, they come in little "130 calorie packs".  This is useful and convenient for those on a diet but honestly that would be the only reason to get this particular product.  It's probably ten million times cheaper to get a regular large size bag of caramel popcorn than to buy this thing, so the only thing it would be good for is counting calories precisely.  If you need it for that purpose, then this product is good enough, but if you're not on a diet or anything, just get a regular bag of caramel popcorn and chow down on that instead.

review/summary: Perfect mid-afternoon snack!
review/text: I love popcorn, caramel, and fudge, so I figured I'd enjoy Snackwell's Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn. I was right! The caramel flavor is absolutely fantastic--no hint of a burned flavor like some other purchased caramel popcorn has. The portion size is perfect; at first I thought the bags were pretty small, but the popcorn is sweet enough that you wouldn't want to eat much more than one serving. I took this to my office and passed bags out to my coworkers, and everyone agreed that this is a tasty snack. My only criticism (which my coworkers also mentioned) is that the fudge drizzle isn't a prominent enough flavor. The caramel is very sweet and strong, and it completely overpowers the chocolate. I'd prefer to have this without the fudge and save those calories since I couldn't really taste it anyway. Still, this is a snack I could see myself enjoying again and again!

review/summary: A melt in my mouth surprise!!
review/text: I have been a fan of Nabisco 100 calorie packs for the last 2 years, for to me they complement my eating habits and snacking craves. So when I decided to give Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn a chance, I opened my 1st bag wondering how they would compare to my favorite low calorie snack. I have to say that I was surprised on the portion size, the fudge flavor, the sweet meets salty, and the simple fact that when I put them into my mouth they just melted away.<br /><br />The portion size was just right for me, and even I could have had a little bit less in my bag since I am use too small portions. But when watching a movie, I would have to say that this size would be perfect to snack on. The sweet fudge taste meets salty popcorn did for me, but I am sweet meets salty person and overall enjoyed the taste. On another note, I can add for those of you who are not chocoholics the fudge is not overpowering. I am not a true chocolate fan and in fact would rather have another type of sweet over chocolate so for me the fudge is very mellow and just the right amount. But hands down my favorite part is the fact that this just melted away in my mouth.<br /><br />As my BF tried his own bag he decided he not only wanted to try them by themselves but also as an ice cream topper! He thought it was a great ice cream topper, reminding him of a sundae with that hint of caramel and fudge.<br /><br />Eat them straight out of the bag, or get creative with them. Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is a great portion controlled snack that is a flavor melt in your mouth.<br /><br />A little tip for others who might be watching their snack cravings: Remember to only eat 1 bag at a time.

review/summary: Snack Tastes More Like Popcorn, Not Chocolate, Yet Sticks Together
review/text: All you taste is the popcorn and salt. There's a whiff of chocolate fudge or caramel but it's too subtle to make me want more. I might as well have popped my own popcorn and sprinkled cocoa over it. Cracker Jacks and Swiss Miss Hot chocolate have more flavor than this. Even when bits of fudge fell off and I sampled it, there was no sugary sweetness, just a curious flatness and blandness reminiscent of tofu (soy is listed as an ingredient). The label also lists cocoa and brown sugar rather than milk chocolate. No wonder! Yet the drizzle is thick enough to make several popcorn kernals stick togehther in one huge lump. It will make you lose weight,however - there's not enough flavor to make me want to eat more.

review/text: I recently began a high-protein, low-sugar diet, and it has been really painful to completely avoid all the delicious, bready snacks I had previously enjoyed.  These popcorn packets are just wonderful as a once-a-day indulgence, just enough sweetness to take the edge off without ruining all my hard work.  They have a wonderful caramel flavor and the "chocolate" drizzle is enough to give you the texture of chocolate while not tasting obviously fake.  I'm a big fan of the calorie-labels and pre-measured servings on all of the 100-etc calorie packs and this one is no exception.  It's very easy to add into your routine and there's no worry that you'll overindulge, unless you bring the whole box with you.

review/text: These are a great snack for when you need something sweet, yet portion controlled. At 130 calories per pack, it isn't too bad considering it satisfies a chocolate craving. And they have only 3 grams of fat per bag. They don't have any significant fiber or other nutrients, but they're better on calories than most snacks.<br /><br />I liked how classy they looked with the chocolate drizzled over the caramel corn. It made them seem more like candy than popcorn. It's a good thing they are portioned in single serve bags, or it would be easy to eat too much!<br /><br />The only drawback is that there are only 6 packages in a box and they might be a little pricey for a snack. However, if you think of them purchasing candy in a single serve pack, then it isn't so bad.

The flavor is incredible, and would be easy to over-indulge if it weren't for the perfectly portioned (calorie-wise) pouches. As a popcorn-lover, I highly recommend this sweet treat. It's almost as good has mom's homemade caramel corn.

review/summary: Healthy, Crunchy, Sweet!
review/text: Snackwell's Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is a snack that is both light and filling. Not overly sweet, but it has a nice milk chocolate and caramel flavor combined with a satisfying crunchiness. I do tend to enjoy a fair amount of caramel corn snacks which almost always have more sugar and chemicals. This is a much healthier alternative. Each bag is consistent, with no hulls or seeds. A very portable, enjoyable and high quality snack. Enjoy!

review/summary: You Can't eat just one pack!
review/text: I thought that this popcorn would taste like a diet food but I soon realized that they were extremely sweet and you won't stop at just one pack (I didn't) besides them being really sweet I really enjoyed this popcorn and I will have to try the other flavors soon.<br /><br />The popcorn doesn't travel well because the chocolate melts  easily, so you have to keep them in a cool area in order for you to enjoy them without the mess. The packaging is smart and idea for a quick snack if you don't want to over indulge(like I did). I think that this is a convient snack without so much guilt.<br /><br />I think that this is a little more healthier than Poppycock or Crunch-N-Munch but I think that the reason it is healthier has to do with the small package that the popcorn comes in and not the actual popcorn itself. I think that it's an overall great snack and I would recommend this for just a little pick me up for dieters who need a reward but want to stay on track.

review/summary: not much healthier than "regular" caramel popcorn
review/text: i'm a big fan of poppycock caramel popcorn, but i don't eat them very much. in fact, i haven't had any in about a decade since the only sweet candy i regularly buy is 73% dark chocolate bars. since i was able to pick an item to review via the vine program, i figured i'd get some free caramel popcorn.<br /><br />i remember when the snackwell's big sell was being under 100 calories, but i guess 100 calories was too restrictive for the current american diet; therefore, the 100-calorie ceiling had to be broken. the best thing about these snackwell's is the ability to portion-control, even though the extra packaging is terrible for the environment. it's kind of sad that people aren't able to resist eating food which is super-engineered to be unnaturally yummy these days, myself included. oh well. anyway, i compared the nutritional value of this to the original poppycock popcorn, serving-per-serving.<br /><br />- one serving of snackwell's is 1.06oz, and one serving of poppycock is 1.1oz, though that could have been rounded up from 1.06oz. basically, they're about the same, but it's easy to eat more than 1/2 cup of poppycock when they come in the huge canister.<br /><br />- snackwell's has 130 calories, and poppycock has 160 calories. so that's good that the healthier version has lower calories.<br /><br />- snackwell's has 3g of fat, 2.5g as saturated. poppycock as 8g of fat, 2g as saturated. clearly, snackwell's has lower fat, but then poppycock also has nuts.<br /><br />- snackwell's has 190mg of sodium. poppycock has 90mg.<br /><br />- snackwell's has 24g of carbohydrates, 18g in sugars. poppycock has 20g of carbohydrates, 13g in sugar.<br /><br />this makes me conclude that this snackwell's item achieved its lower caloric content by reducing fat, but increasing sugar and salt to compensate for the lost fat. in a way, snackwell's would be worse for anyone in danger of developing diabetes, though such people shouldn't be consuming caramel popcorn. actually, no one should, but most of us like to indulge with food. the snackwell's is very light and crispy, but (though my memory of poppycock is distant), i wasn't blown away by the snackwell's like i was by poppycock. since the difference in calories between the two brands is only 30 calories, i would choose the poppycock which tastes better, has nuts, and has lower sugar and salt content. but most people will not be able to stop eating the poppycock after just 1/2 cup (1/1oz), so portion control for cravings is the genius concept behind snackwell's. if you're not disciplined or need to save 30 calories, then pick the snackwell's.<br /><br />btw, crunch n munch (another ConAgra brand) has similar nutritional content as poppycock. and no, i'm not a ConAgra representative. cracker jack also has similar nutritional content, though i was never a fan since it's not as crunchy.

review/text: These have just the right amount of sweets on the popcorn - not saturated with chocolate or excess sugar so you don't gasp for a drink after eating them. Packaging has just enough for a snack to satisfy a mid morning desire for some food.  Calorie count will appease everyone.  I try not to have anything over 150 calories since I had breakfast, and will eat lunch, just need something in between.<br /><br />No cons at all.  Winner product here.

review/text: SnackWells Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn 130 Calorie Packs (5 packages)is a nice light snack when you're on the go.  It has that lovely salty-sweet flavor that I love in my snacks and the little bit of fudge drizzle keeps it feeling a little sinful without the guilt.  The packaging is nice with a green-and-yellow zebra-stripe pattern and the packs inside the box are labelled as well which is a big thing for me.<br />I give this snack four stars for being tasty and well-packaged.

review/summary: Dangerously good
review/text: People who are weight-conscious know that plain popcorn is a relatively harmless, low-calorie snack. Since this is not *plain* popcorn, it is not so harmless. It is, however, delicious. And one of these snack-sized bags will not be enough to satiate most people. Tastewise, this is good stuff. The nutrition information on the bag says it is only 130 calories, which is a good thing. But it also lists brown sugar as the primary ingredient - not such a good thing. SnackWell has a reputation for being (relatively) healthy snack food, and if you consider the serving size in these 130-calorie bags, it's not bad. But with this brand name, I was hoping for a slightly healthier mix of ingredients. That's the reason I don't give it 5 stars. Otherwise, it's extremely yummy, and I definitely want more than one bag.

review/text: The popcorn is crisp, sweet, and good tasting. Each pack is enough for an ample and satisfying sweet treat. Also, at only 130 calories, I could see this being very popular with dieters, or anyone who feels they are due a little self-indulgence; it really doesn't taste like a diet snack.

Usually diet foods taste diet but this didn't. I felt like I was having a treat. This would be a great afternoon snack or addition to the lunch box. I will be buying more soon.

review/text: I love popcorn & recently tried different flavors of popcorn. I'm hooked on a couple Popcorn Indiana flavors that I purchase locally.<br /><br />SnackWell's Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is on the sweet side; the fudge drizzle doesn't have much of a chocolate flavor.  The popcorn is fresh & crispy...yum. I would prefer it to be less sweet with more chocolate flavor.<br /><br />All in all, this is a tasty snack; the flavor could be improved.  It was a hit with everyone who tasted it.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br />1 30g pack = 130 calories<br />Total Fat 3g<br />~Sat.

review/text: This is popcorn that comes in 5 sealed "snack bags". The popcorn is lightly covered in a dark chocolate and caramel. Sweet. Crunchy. No peanuts. Rather high in saturated fat (bad fat) at %13 per 1.06 oz. bag. About 130 cals per 1.06 oz. bag. Definitely not health food, but it tastes very good.

review/summary: YUMMY!
review/text: Okay, I am NOT a food critic.  I don't know all the fancy words and such for describing tastes in new and interesting ways.  So here's my modest reaction.  THIS WAS A TASTY SNACK.  The flavor reminded my very much of cracker jacks, which isn't surprising, since this is basically caramel-drizzled popcorn.  But it was more satisfying.  The Caramel covering felt rich and had a nice texture.  The popcorn was consistently well-popped.  I had modest expectations that this would be an "okay" snack...just something mindless to munch on in front of the TV.  In fact, I was very pleasantly surprised with how tasty it was.<br /><br />This comes in 130 calorie packs...not the 100 cal packs we see so many things served in these days.  It tastes WAY better than any 100 calorie snack I've tried (and we've had quite a few over the years).  The extra 30 calories are worth it, IMO.  Now the trick is:  how do I stop at just one pack.  It's so tasty!!

review/text: I loved these Snackwell's Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn snacks!  The combination of the caramel corn with a hint of chocolate is really good.  I was most surprised by the fact that the popcorn was nice and fluffy and tasted really fresh.  I expected to find a lot of hard kernels but I didn't. I didn't find a lot of those pesky shells of husks either.<br /><br />The size of the bag is about what I expected from a portion controlled product - a little on the small size but enough to satisfy that afternoon sweet tooth without blowing the diet.  I passed out a couple of samples among friends and everyone really liked them.

review/text: This is good!  A little weak on the chocolate, but the caramel flavor is delicious.  It's a nice big bag too for only 130 calorie and satisfied my sweet tooth.  This popcorn is very sweet though so it might not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it.  It's missing a bit of saltiness that I think would cut down the sweet a bit.  But it's got a nice crunch, a nice flavor and is a great portion of popcorn.

review/summary: good crunch, a little too sweet
review/text: I quite liked this product, but cannot give it five stars primarily for two reasons:<br /><br />1.  The chocolate flavor is a little too subtle.  It would be better if the chocolate was darker/bittersweet to counterbalance the caramel.<br /><br />2.  Even for my sweet tooth, I find this product a little too sweet.  Every kernel of popcorn is entirely covered with caramel and then drizzled with some cocoa mixture.  To give you an idea, each 30 gram bag of this product has 18 grams of sugars.<br /><br />Still, if I were in the mood for a sweet popcorn snack, I would consider purchasing this brand.

review/summary: If you like other caramel popcorns, you'll like this, too.
review/text: There's not a lot to say about this product that will surprise anyone.  It tastes just like any other caramel popcorn product I've ever had (with a small amount of chocolate added).  So, I would say there's definitely no downside or "defect" to describe about Snackwell popcorn vs. similar products.  As far as advantages this product has that others don't, the packaging could (depending on your eating habits) definitely be seen as an advantage.  Other caramel popcorns are packaged in one large box, or even a huge tin, that (once it's opened) allows the entire contents to be exposed to outside air and to become stale quickly.  Because the Snackwells product comes in smaller packets within each package you can only open one at a time, thus keeping the remaining packets fresh.  If you only eat a small amount of popcorn at a time, that's a very big advantage.  However, if you are a big snacker, you would need to open multiple packets at one time - making the packaging inconvenient for you.  So, I guess the bottom line would be - if you like caramel popcorn, but not a lot all at once - this is the right product for you.

review/text: There is not a whole lot I can write in a review about this aside from it tastes awesome.  It is so good that it is very difficult to eat just one bag.  It is comparable to a Cracker Jack or carmel corn with a small amount of chocolate drizzle on it.  It is a very refreshing afternoon snack.

review/text: Traditionally I am not a big fan of Snack Well products, so I was a little skeptical when I decided to try this new item. The box contains 5 (1.06 oz) packages of snack-size caramel popcorn. The taste is sweet and salty. The perfect combination! Honestly, I couldn't tell it was a low calorie snack. Even my husband and two teenage boys loved them! It's the perfect treat for on-the-go. I would definitely buy this product again. It's yummy!

review/text: Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is different than other "drizzled" or dipped or coated popcorn I have tasted in the past.  It seems to have just the right amount of fudge and caramel so as to not turn it into a cookie or on the skimpy side a dusted corn pop.  I liked it and would probably look to buy it in the future.  Just one packet satisfied my evening desert appetite with only 130 calories.  Went well with my cup of tea.

review/summary: Reminded Me Of Cracker Jacks More Than Anything
review/text: As a perpetual dieter, I'm always on the lookout for low calorie snacks that offer a taste that seems more "sinful" than it is. So presented with the chance to try Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn, I was thrilled. After all, some of my favorite words -- "fudge" and "caramel" -- were in the name so it seemed to have promise. In addition, I'm a huge fan of Dale and Thomas Chocolate Chunk and Caramel Popcorn, though I can never really justify the calories. If this snack was even halfway as good as the Dale and Thomas, it would be a winner in my eyes.<br /><br />However, after eating a few bags, this snack reminded me of Cracker Jacks but without the peanuts. The fudge/chocolate taste is barely present. Although you can SEE the chocolate, it didn't really register in the mouth. The dominant taste is definitely caramel. To me, it tasted exactly like Cracker Jacks, which I happen to like but it wasn't the taste I was expecting. I was expecting chocolate and caramel and the chocolate taste didn't come through at all.<br /><br />Because I wanted some other opinions to share, I asked my husband, neighbors and our kids to try the snack too. Here is their feedback:<br /><br />From my husband who uses Weight Watchers: Texture is more like a rice cake than popcorn. Taste the caramel but not the chocolate. It "costs" 3 Weight Watchers Plus points and I wouldn't want to use that many points for this.<br /><br />From my female neighbor who also counts calories: Quite tasty but very sweet. Would like more of a salty taste for a snack like this. Taste the caramel but not the chocolate. Would prefer that it had 100 calories instead of 130; I'm used to expecting these types of snacks to be just 100 calories. Would like to see less sugar if I was going to give it to my kids for a snack. 18 grams of sugar seems like a lot for a snack like this.<br /><br />The kids: All the kids liked it and wanted more and said they would eat it as a snack.<br /><br />Everyone agreed that quantity in the bags was enough. I poured the bag out in my hand and got a full handful and then some. My neighbor said she wouldn't mind if they put less in the bag to get to that "magic" 100 calorie mark.<br /><br />In the end, the consensus was that the snack tasted good but tasted more like caramel popcorn, not fudge-drizzle caramel popcorn. The adults thought they would probably not buy it again. The kids said they would eat it, but both sets of parents thought there might be better snacks with less sugar in it. If you're a dieter who is looking for a sugary snack fix, this might do it for you but don't look for the fudge drizzle to show up in the flavor; it was missing in action in the bags we tasted. Think smaller pack of Cracker Jacks (minus the peanuts) and I think you have a good idea of what this snack tastes like.<br /><br />A Side Note: Both of the moms thought the packaging was very attractive and would make us buy it if we saw it in the grocery store.

review/summary: totally delicious BUT....
review/text: Okay, if all you are looking for is a GREAT tasting portion controlled snack and don't care about anything else then this is it!  I also like that the ingredients are pretty good, brown sugar, corn syrup, cocoa, popcorn, oil, vanilla, whey, noting terrible and all pretty darn natural.  BUT, we will not be buying these again which is why despite amazing taste and good ingredients I am only  giving it 3 stars.  First off, each box only has 5 pouches, so for a family of four one box is gone like in an instant.  Next and foremost, we try to limit sugar per serving on our sweetened cereals and snacks to no more than 9 grams, each of these Snackwell pouches has 18 grams of sugar!  We are used to eating Angie's Caramel Corn which for a whopping 2.5 cups serving size has only 9 grams of sugar and 150 calories.  If Snackwell really wanted people to 'snack well' they'd take Angie's caramel corn and drizzle fudge on that and put it into their little pouches to reduce the sugar per serving.
