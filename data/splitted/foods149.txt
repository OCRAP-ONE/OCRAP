review/text: Good quality sprinkles.  Pricing seems pretty decent.  Love the way they make my cupcakes look - takes me back to my elementary school days, long ago!  Only gripes: the "partially-hydrogenated" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting.

I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/summary: No more like lemon zest than wood shavings
review/text: This product is NOT lemon zest.  Bears no resemblance to lemon zest - does not look like lemon zest, does not smell like lemon zest, nor does it taste like lemon zest.  In fact the label says 'Contains granules of dehydrated lemon peel'.  The picture of lush, juicy lemons is hugely misleading and if I was able to give this product no stars, I would.  I thought I would give it a try, but the consistency of the rehydrated whatever it is was mushy, tasteless and without smell.  I did not risk putting it in my ginger cookies and had to make a quick trip to the store to get some real lemons.  Don't waste your money as I did.

review/summary: Got lemons .... make toothpaste?
review/text: I use lemon zest for cooking, when I don't make my own. It is great in Mediterranean dishes.<br />I decided to get this for a new toothpaste recipe I picked up. Yeah, that sounds strange, but if you make your own toothpaste you don't have to worry about how much fluoride you are getting in it, and it is probably one-eighth the cost of commercially prepared products.<br />I decided if I was getting fluoride in tap water, I didn't need it in my toothpaste also. And now I am not sure I need it at all. It sure didn't seem to prevent cavities for me. So, since I can't find non-fluoridated toothpaste under $6 a tube at the store, I am going to be going for the Zesty life. Their orange zest is great also!

review/summary: Okay but not Cake Mate
review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

review/summary: Clowns who down rate this clearly miss the point...
review/text: First of all I happen to think this is delicious. It has no diet after taste as with most artificially sweetened sodas. Anyway the people who downward this are missing the point that this is NOT using poison to sweeten it. Stevia is natural. I have extremely sensitive taste buds and a sophisticated pallet and I can tell you that there's not much of a difference in flavor between say Sucralose(which is awful for you) and Stevia which is 100% safe.<br />So if u want to trash this and keep feeding you and your kids garbage and poison by all means. Google what artificial sweeteners do to the immune system. I used to be good for three colds per year and two sinus infections per year. Since eliminating all artificial sweeteners(from drinks gums candies etc they sneak it in everything now. Start reading labels) I have not been sick ONCE in 4 Yeats since eliminating it. So I'll stick to Blue sky when I choose to have a soda. It's delicious.

review/text: The reviews complaining of aftertaste, and just labeling it the "New age Natural sweeteners" Have never tasted real root beer, made with real birch root and not just flavoring. The aftertaste they are complaining about with this soda is the complex Birch oil aftertaste (in any real old recipe). I used to live in Quarryville, Pennsylvania and my neighbor showed me and my family how to make Birch brew with the cleaned roots, and the aftertaste is the same here. We live in a society with everything watered down to the point it all tastes like nothing with sugar added.  This is the best commercial root beer I have tasted sugar or not.

review/summary: Still contains artificial sweetener
review/text: I never, ever drink 'diet' sodas and try to avoid most soda in general.  However, I do really enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBW50G">Blue Sky Organic New Century Cola</a> and was curious to try a sugar-free version.  Ultimately, I decided to go with the root beer 'free' soda over a cola because I figured the stronger taste would better cover any strange stevia taste or aftertaste.  I don't buy or consume stevia in other products so I'm not really sure how it tastes on its own, but it's really not bad in this soda.  It also doesn't dry out your mouth like other sweeteners.  This soda definitely has a unique taste but, as another reviewer pointed out, I think you are mostly tasting the "french sweet birch oil" per the ingredient list.  It also lists tahitian vanilla, hence the 'creamy' aspect.  The ingredients are quality and while it still has zero nutritional value, it's a better bet over regular or other diet sodas by a long shot.<br /><br />One thing I do not like is the misleading description: yes the soda does contain stevia as a sweetener but it is the second to last ingredient on the list.  The second ingredient out of seven is erythritol, which is a sugar alcohol, and NOT how this product is advertised to be sweetened.  Via wikipedia, it is "60-70% as sweet as table sugar yet it is almost non-caloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is absorbed by the body, therefore unlikely to cause gastric side effects unlike other sugar alcohols."  However, I bought this product because I wanted a natural (Stevia leaf) sweetened product rather than another lab-generated chemical.  Disappointed.  I'll probably continue to drink them over time, but will not be reordering.  The stevia content is minimal at best, with the main ingredients being filtered water and erythritol.  I'd rather consume 100 more calories and drink the natural and organic regular Blue Sky cola or root beer.<br /><br />You ARE still consuming an artificially-sweetened-with-chemicals drink!  If you're okay with that, the taste is nice.  But if, like me, that is exactly what you are trying to avoid, this product is not it.

review/text: I gave up artificial sweeteners a few years ago but still crave the occasional bubbly drink. I love this root beer. We moved to a smaller town about 6 months ago, and I was unable to find it locally. Amazon to the rescue! It is great having it delivered automatically.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: This stuff is good, and I mean REALLY good. My husband drinks diet soda which contains aspartame, a known neurological toxin, and I wanted to provide a much safer alternative. I found this at PCC and he loved it. I can't STAND the taste of artificially sweetened things and I usually end up with a nasty migraine, and this didn't bother me one bit. The taste is fantastic in my opinion, but this seems to be a flavor you will either love or hate, which is why I would recommend picking up a 6 pack at the market before ordering a pack of 24.

review/summary: I really love the taste
review/text: I tried this Root beer for the first time about a week ago. I had been drinking Zevia Root Beer (which is really good, too), but decided to start buying this brand, instead. I love the taste of both, but this one has a creamy taste to it which I prefer. I was so glad to find sugar-free sodas that didn't have all those nasty artificial sweeteners in them!! I highly recommend Blue Sky Free (and Zevia, as well). Oh, and the Blue Sky Free Cherry Vanilla Creme is awesome!! The only ones I don't personally recommend are the colas in either Zevia or Blue Sky free brand.. they are bleh, but that's just me.

review/text: I appreciate the effort for going the healthy route, unfortunately this totally destroys the taste.  I had the regular root beer by Blue Sky before, at least it was decent.  While the taste of this is so bland that I don't know how to describe it, the only way to make it bearable is by adding a packet of Splenda for every can.

review/text: Not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about.  This root beer tasted fine.  Not the best I've ever had, but husband has a bad reaction to artificial sweeteners EXCEPT for Truvia.  He drank most of the 24 pack that we bought and wants me to buy 48 more cans, which I will after I post this.  It's a bit expensive, but the Truvia is worth it for us.

review/text: Being a root beer lover I was excited to see Sky Blue Free at my local Earth Fare market. I mean, you can't go wrong with a natural soda, right? Wrong! Like the the other one-star reviewer, I thought it was bitter, had a chemical smell and ended with a horrible after taste. I've had good diet root beer and bad and this ranks as miles below the absolute worst. I'll stick with Diet Barq's, which is far cheaper and frankly is the best rootbeer, period!

review/text: Seafood ramen... I love having these sodium/msg-packed instant noodles every once in awhile when I'm too lazy to make lunch or dinner. I don't know if you'd actually call these "seafood" flavored, though there are little dried fish cakes and plenty of seaweed in them, but they are somehow indescribably good. I actually like the original flavor better, but since these were cheaper, I went with it.<br /><br />I've seen these with cheaper prices at asian supermarkets when it's on sale, but if you "subscribe" to this on amazon, it's worth an extra dollar or two not to make a trip to the market. When I cook these, I usually add an egg, some veggies, and leftover meat (or whatever is in the fridge). The seafood flavor packet is strong so it adds lots of flavor to everything else.<br /><br />When I got these delivered, none of my ramen were crushed, so it really depends on how carefully your delivery company treats the boxes. Anyway, I'd suggest buying one packet at a store first to try it before committing to a whole box.

review/summary: Positive on Noodle - Negative on crushed Delivery.
review/text: Price - I generally get this at an Asian market store so I have to say if you can't get it locally, then having it delivered seems like a great idea unless Amazon throws out a deal which makes it better.  I jumped on a deal with mixed results.<br /><br />Taste - this is one of my picks for this type of noodle ( Udon )thicker type.  It is on the spicy side.  Yes, have to agree it is seafood but a blended taste.  The dried seaweed / dried little fish disks ( like those imitation crab legs made of ground fish sticks )gives it more appeal.<br /><br />Delivery - I write this because you'll get noodle that are crushed on both sides.  I cringe at the thought of the other box I haven't opened yet.  Basically, your product condition is your selling point.  The problem is somehow in delivery or I suspect before boxing, the noodles are crushed so you end up something along the lines of a pill capsule shape.  Every one opened so far and these are along the edge of the box not the center yet.  When the significant other opened one and said said it was crushed, I thought well, time to post this so no one else is surprised.

review/summary: Delicious! But theres a catch...
review/text: This product is quite delicious. I'm eating a bowl as I type this review!<br /><br />The noodles come in a circular disc, like most ramen. There are two little packets included. One has dried "vegetables." This packet includes seaweed, what looks like kimche, and a whole load of circular processed fish discs. The second packet is seafood flavoring.<br /><br />The noodles are of good quality, and the veggies are very good too! There is a very very mild hint of spice to it, but not enough for me! (I added hot sauce, mmm mmmm delicious!)<br /><br />There is a catch however. Your ramen will most likely come in broken pieces. The one I am eating now was broken into 3-4 pieces. The one I had before this was also broken into 2-3 pieces. The one before that wasn;t broken at all. (Out of a pack of 20 packages...) No big deal, I usually crush the heck out of them before I add to the water anyways.<br /><br />5 stars. I have Amazon shipping me 1 of these every other month. Mmmmmm! (The whole house smells like lobster!!!)

I buy a ton of this product around finals. This is the best price I've found and I like it enough that I took the time to see if I could find it cheaper. It's about $3 for one at the store.<br /><br />ADDED: After writing this review I really searched hard on if this water contains fluoride. I found out it does if your on the east coast. If you dont know how bad Fluoride is for your brain, specifically the pineal gland, you need to do some research. I highly doubt I will ever buy this product again. If you don't mind fluoride and it's harmfull effects on your sleep or intelligence, buy some.<br /><br />But I will say if you take the fluoride out, it's a really great product.

My Italian Mom and I have both tried nearly all the other popular brands of olive oil for making spaghetti sauce, but this one gives the sauce the best flavor.  Pompeian has a strong flavor and yet it is milder than many of the  locally produced olive oils that I have tried.  Pomeian is best for cooking.  I feel so sad that I can't get it in my local grocery store.

And I use it to make infused oils to make herbal healing salves once the herbs have soaked in it (infused) for a week or more, then strained and low-heat melted to combine it with a little bit of bees wax (1:16). Oh, and if you want an awesome infused oil for light low heat cooking, infuse fresh crushed garlic in it for a few days - yummy! You can use that with or without the garlic left in it.  I add that to my mashed potatoes instead of butter or cream at the very end while they are cooling - soooo good!

review/summary: Olive Oil...
review/text: This is not organic and priced on the high side. It tastes great but olive oil is not something that it tastes the same since it is a natural product and final product taste depends to the season and origin which olives are produced from. Pomperian is an old name that has changed many hands during 100 years of its business history. It is a brand with reputation in Baltimore. I purchased a bottle of their olive oil produced in Chilli that was lighter color but it tasted so great that seemed like I was having olives straight from the tree and amazingly I paid only $6.49. I have been consuming olives and olive oil for years and years for its nutritional value. I cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since I need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet. All vegetable oils are processed and diluted including LIGHT or EXTRA LIGHT olive oil which is a highly refined oil without the nutritional value. I use much more expensive EXTRA VIRGIN olive oils which taste very fruity and sharp from EU but I have been to their farms and know the product real well and trust the producer as well. Unfortunately, olive oil being the gold standard of the cooking oil is produced and mixed with other oils and adulterated by many for financial gain but not this one since it is pure olive oil from a reputable seller but as I said it is not organic. Only EXTRA VIRGIN, the first round of olives that have been pressed have the 200 antioxidants, not refined or mixed with other oils. I keep the oils in the freezer, away from heat and light all the time. Bravo.

review/summary: Essential for your Cheese & Pickle Sandwiches
review/text: For you Yanks who don't know, a cheese & pickle sandwich is a staple of the British pub scene.  Good cheddar cheese on farmhouse bread with a nice layer of Branston pickle, maybe add some ham and lettuce, cannot be beaten.  Living back in the USA after a long stint in the UK, we were pining for pickle.  This is not your usual Nalley's or Vlasic stuff - Branston Pickle is it's own animal.<br /><br />We found this large jar available through Amazon Marketplace.  It arrived nicely packaged, no damage.  We have had it with our cheese sandwiches, alongside pork roast and roast/grilled chicken.  It is one of those great sweet-tangy flavors with lots of vegetable pieces.  You really should try it - it is a taste sensation!  Don't be put off by the dark color, just think of it as being like a chutney made with good balsamic vinegar.  The taste is very similar to balsamic in dressings.

review/text: I learned about cheese and pickle sandwiches watching a British TV series on Netflix. At first I thought cheese and pickles would be awful! But it isn't pickles it's "pickle" which I guess means relish. Anyway, I ordered a jar and it is absolutely fantastic!! Because the flavor is so unique it is difficult to describe. It has a tangy/sweet/crunchy/spicy flavor and ingredients include cauliflower, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, rutabagas, apples, and dates. Cheese, onion and "pickle" sandwiches have become a lunch favorite of mine. If you like a sort of tangy/spicy/sweet flavor you will love this product. I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered it.

review/text: Golden Roasted Flax Seed, whole seeds: If you like the taste and smell of roasted nuts (peanuts, almonds, cashews, etc.), then you'll most likely enjoy TJ's Golden Roasted product.<br /><br />Upon opening a bag, the oh so very seductive toasted nutty aroma wafts out, and it's heavenly. You know it's going to be good. I keep a coffee grinder on my kitchen counter. Personally I like to grind the seeds and add them to whey protein smoothies with chocolate, coffee, coconut, vanilla spice flavors. Toasted flax pairs very well with those flavors. Also delicious in yogurt with a drizzle of raw honey or maple syrup. I also love to mix together 2 Tbsp of ground seeds, 1 tsp of coconut sugar, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of cardamom and ginger to sprinkle on top of a bowl of creamy porridge. It makes a great nutty topping for cereals. Can be added to baked goods as well.<br /><br />I love this product! Not only does it taste phenomenal, but I also feel good about the nutritional punch of Omega-3, lignans, and fiber. Scientific research points to flax having a balancing effect on hormones and breast health.<br /><br />When I recently ran out of this TJ product, I tried another product to COMPARE quality, Spectrum's Organic Dry Roasted Premium Flaxseed, and was very disappointed -- twice. Just today (5/9/2012), I opened yet another bag of Spectrum (2nd try), and again the product not only smells rancid, but tastes inferior. Expiration date on the bag is 8/9/2013. Spectrum also adds salt to improve the taste. Salt does not help the Spectrum product, and I won't be trying it again.<br /><br />If you're going to try whole *roasted* flax seeds for the first time, then you should try this Trader Joe product first. The taste and aroma won't disappoint, and there is no added salt. TJ's is just pure whole, roasted flax seed. Pure nutty yummy goodness. Net wt is 15 oz (425g).<br /><br />Nutritional Facts (on the bag)<br />Serving Size 2 Tbsp (15g); serving per bag about 28<br />Calories 90<br />Calories from fat 60<br />Total Fat 7g (11%)<br />Saturated Fat 0.5g (3%)<br />Trans Fat 0g<br />Polyunsaturated Fat 5g<br />Monounsaturated Fat 1g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 0mg<br />Total Carbohydrates 4g (1%)<br />Dietary Fiber 4g (16%)<br />Protein 3g<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 2%

review/summary: Great combo of yummy + healthy
review/text: These bars taste great and are good for you. They aren't loaded with sugars and preservatives like the ones on the grocery shelves. Instead, they're loaded with healthy stuff that I appreciate, but for my 5-year-old it's all about the yummy factor. (I have trouble getting him to eat breakfast before school, but he happily devours one of these in the morning.) Just out of the package is great, but heat in the microwave for a few seconds to make it even better. Crumble in yogurt (or ice cream!) or eat it on the run. Looking forward to trying the other flavors. FYI - The smaller, square bars are also quite good, but the planks get my top rating.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: Another over-priced "plank" by Ernest.  Why do people like these?  This is the 2nd flavor I've tried and find them to be big, thick "planks" of puffed up cereal with a few almonds sprinkled in and a few dried fruit pieces.  When these are gone I'll never repurchase.  High sugar and carbs, way too much money and not worth it.  Any chewy granola bar is a better deal.  2 Servings each?  Then double the fat content to 14 grams and nearly 60 grams of carbs and 28 grams of sugar if you indulge and eat the whole thing!  Holy..  Anyway, at only 6 per box you are ransoming your mother to buy these.

review/summary: Good GF white flour replacement
review/text: I never used white flour much prior to becoming gluten free but there are some recipes that simply don't turn out as well with any other type of flour. One of those is dutch babies which turns out light and fluffy made with this flour blend:<br />4 EGGS, 1 cup MILK, 1 cup MAMA'S FLOUR BLEND with 1/2 tsp XANTHAN GUM (always add xanthan when using a GF flour). Add ingredients one by one (in order) to a blender until blended well then pour slowly into the middle of a 10-12 inch iron skillet pre-heated in 425 oven until 1/4-1/2 cube BUTTER is (just) melted in it then swirled to cover sides. Bake for 18-20 minutes and serve immediately. Good with sauteed apples and cinnamon topped with sour cream or yogurt with a sprinkle of brown sugar or (my favorite and the easiest) LEMON WEDGES squeezed over with a sprinkle of POWERED SUGAR.

review/summary: Not what it seems
review/text: Although this is marketed as a coconut product, it really isn't. People seem to be having success baking with this. Now, coconut flour is delicious and tastes great in many substitute recipes, but does not have the same consistency or taste as wheat flour. When I saw all these success stories I grew suspicious.<br /><br />I looked up the ingredients for this and the first one is white rice flour. Coconut flour is the fourth ingredient (after potato starch!). Each serving packs a walloping 46g of carbs.<br /><br />If you are not necessarily gluten-intolerant but just living a low-carb lifestyle (Primal, Paleo, Atkins, Ketogenic, etc.), you'll want to avoid this.

review/summary: An excellent fiber-rich gluten free flour blend
review/text: This blended flour is wonderful for those on a GF diet and works well in baked goods, giving a richness without excessive coconut flavor. To determine if this product is right for you, it is important to consider how you plan to use it.  If you are looking to add a little fiber to smoothies or sauces or soups, you may want 100% coconut flour. If you are wanting it for flavorful baked goods recipes with fiber, this should work perfectly! If you are making your own flour blend and wanting a flour that will not effect blood sugar so much, this is not what you need.<br /><br />If you read the reviews elsewhere on Amazon for pure 100% coconut flours--which this product is not--you will find some users were expecting the benefits of coconut flour with the ease of all-purpose wheat flour. There are good reasons for blending other flours with coconut flour:coconut flour alone can be difficult and expensive to use because it requires a lot of liquid--usually in the form of eggs and oils--to make a recipe work properly. This product "Gluten Free Mama, Mama's Coconut Blend Flour" has solved some of that problem by blending in other flours.  If you are trying to avoid carbs, this likely is not the flour for you. HOWEVER, if like me you are trying to avoid gluten while also adding fiber in your diet, this may be exactly what you seek. Note again, this is a blend of several flours, so if you did not catch the word "blend" in the description above as some reviewers did not, take note. Each of the flours in the blend brings something to the table, but if you seek the benefits of 100% coconut flour, look elsewhere on Amazon--but before purchasing it do read the reviews from people who expected it to work like all-purpose flour in their baking. (Most of the poor reviews for both products are not the fault of the product but of the purchasers.)

It makes great cookies and other sweet baked goods you start to miss when going GF. I noticed a lot of the negative reviews were complaining about it not being plain coconut flour or having more carbs than they wanted. The beauty of this flour is it's made by a mom with a celiac daughter. A lot of us are just looking for a way to make our kids (or ourselves) the baked goods everyone else enjoys and this blend is an amazing substitute!

review/text: I bought this flour because I thought it would be low carb.  It is 43 net carbs per 2 oz serving.  This product this not suitable for diabetics or those on a low glycemic diet.  The first ingredient is white rice flour, coconut flour is the forth ingredient.  Also, to use this flour in gluten free recipes, you need xanthan gum.  All of this should have been in the product description.

review/text: contrary to all of the glowing reviews this is the worst Earl Grey tea I've ever had - and that is comparing against bagged tea from the grocery store in addition to other loose leaf brands.<br /><br />The smell is way too perfume like yet still a bit pleasant, but the taste is nothing like the smell.  Way too astringent for me - yuck.  I've tried various weights and water temps to no avail.  The first steeping is not good, the second is more drinkable for me, 3rd steeping is not worth the effort.<br /><br />I've choked down the first can and a half.  I'm going to gift the 3rd unopened can to someone who might enjoy it more than myself.<br /><br />This tea is so bad I wonder if Rishi is all marketing, packaging, and setting price points to brand a sub-par product and then have a team post positive reviews all over the net.  I'm not saying its so, but it does make one wonder . . .<br /><br />2 stars only because I didn't horque it up.

review/summary: Not that bold
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>Earl Grey is one of my favorite teas. Rishi Earl Grey Tea is good, aromatic and flavorful. The tea is not that strong for an Earl Grey, definitely not bold, but it is strong enough (just add another tablespoon to make it stronger). I steeped this tea for a long time (forgot about it) and it never became that bitter (I never add anything to my tea). It never felt strong or bold for that matter. The taste is long lasting though. Borrowing from the wine world, it has a long finish. The tea has a faint yellow ring in the cup and a brownish-orangy color.<br /><br />The tea is very aromatic and the container contains an extra lid to keep the aroma and freshness of the tea.<br /><br />It is a bit overpriced but, at least you can reuse the leaves a few times. This is also a fair trade organic product.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the video. Please let me know if you want any more info.

It makes the higher price tag a little more palatable - but keep in mind this is organic and fair trade too, which always adds a little to the price tag.<br /><br />It's tea that tastes great and that you can feel good about drinking.

review/summary: Not my favorite but pretty good
review/text: I drink a lot of Earl Grey tea and have tried four or five brands over the years, Bigelow being my favorite.  I've been trying this organic Rishi tea for two weeks now and have experimented with different amounts of tea to get the flavor right and have not been able to. It is just okay for me. This tea is advertised as a bold tea and I see that many reviewers agree but I do not.  If I add too much tea to try to make it stronger it adversely affects the taste unlike other loose teas I use.  Also, this tea requires 1 TBL of dry tea per 8oz of water; I need to use twice that amount for it not to be weak, whereas other loose teas I use only require 1 1/2 tsp. for the same strength, so this Rishi tea would be much more expensive to use regularly.  I may prepare it occasionally just to have a change once in awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful.  It is packed in a very nice earthy looking tin and is slender and tall so fits in the cabinet nicely.  The big plus with this tea is that it's organic.

review/text: This tea has an interesting scent in the can.  It's like bergamot overlaid with jasmine or some other unusual flower.  As a brewed tea it's all right but sniffing the dry tea was unpleasant.  I think we will stick with Republic of Tea or Yorkshire Gold.

review/summary: Yummy Organic Black Tea!
review/text: Rishi lives up to their name with their Earl Grey tea:  The leaves are full, dark, long, & curled up on themselves.  No crappy pieces of tea leaves that some companies like to call loose leaf tea!<br />The killer tin is packed to the top with these sweet smelling leaves!  I hardly needed any tea to brew a sweet tasting & pleasantly aromatic cup!  I have a tendency to overbrew my tea & I probably let this brew for about 15 to 20 min. & it wasn't the least bit bitter! Very enjoyable!  Great with honey, better with honey and cream!  YUM! I have a feeling this tin is going to last me a long while!<br />I have one slight problem, it says it contains "natural essential bergamont oil".  Why isn't it organic????<br />Fortunately the tea itself is 100% Organic Fair Trade certified. Fair Trade means workers get paid a fair wage for their work/product instead of getting mere pennies a day.<br />Love your body & go organic whenever you can.  If you don't buy organic tea, you are ingesting A LOT of pesticides & chemicals in concentrated forms - brewing the chemicals right into your cup!  Yuck!

review/summary: Understated Earl Grey tea
review/text: Rishi Tea Organic Earl Grey Loose Tea will appeal to those wishing a more subtle use of bergamot than other brands that overwhelm the tea drinker with perfumed aroma. Personally, I prefer my Earl Grey to be somewhat more aggressive. The attractive packaging and the fact that the tea is organically grown by farmers who are fairly compensated are pluses.<br /><br />Incidentally, I tried this tea first with no sweetener; and it tastes fine "straight"; however, because the bergamot is not strong, I found that I preferred it with a sweetener. Honey did not work for me with this tea; however, I found aspertame to work surprisingly well (Aspertame is usually one of my least favorite sweeteners).<br /><br />The brewing instructions are simple and work well.<br /><br />It would be nice to have the option of buying this tea in tea-bag form.<br /><br />To sum up, this tea is a quality product with good taste, from a good source, but otherwise unexceptional.

review/summary: I actually like tea!
review/text: First and foremost I am not a tea drinker. I've tried for years to like tea and every tea I've ever tasted was bitter or had some nasty after taste (some were just nasty from the get go). So when I had the opportunity to taste this tea I said why not, maybe this will be different, and sure enough it was.<br /><br />When you first open the container you are hit with this blast of fragrances, ranging from flower like scents, to sweet citrus, something I have NEVER had with tea. I guess I've been drinking (at least trying to drink) the wrong teas...<br /><br />I took a couple of pinches of the tea (about two teaspoons worth) and put it in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CFPXYA">Norpro Mesh Tea Ball with Cup Rest Handle</a>. After steeping the tea for a minute or so, I took my first taste and OH MY! It tasted nothing like any tea I have EVER had. No bitterness, after taste, or anything, just a very flavorful cup of tea. The citrus/orange flavor from the bergamot oil is extremely flavorful and aromatic, and again NOT the least bit bitter or harsh.<br /><br />If this is how tea is suppose to taste, I've been missing out for years and years and I am glad to say that I am not hooked on loose leaf teas. Move over coffee, I now have a new favorite warm beverage!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Extremely flavorful.<br />No bitter/harsh taste.<br />Organic (if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br />A fair trade product (again if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price, though compared to other loose leaf teas it's a pretty good price...
