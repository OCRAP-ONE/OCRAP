review/summary: Excellent Canine Appetite Enhancer, only from Amazon.com
review/text: After trying several different products to entice our beloved canine to eat his food, including a veterinary prescription that included a hormone that was strongly disfavored (condemned) by a Veterinarian School, the Sniffers Shake-Ins have provided a convenient, dry, enticement product to stimulate our canine's appetite with consistent success.  We initially purchased the Sergeant's Sniffers Shake-Ins 9-Ounce Dog Meal Enhancer, Chicken product on a Veterinary Warehouse clearance sale, and have only tried the Chicken flavor although other flavors are also offered; we are as hooked on this product as is our beloved canine.

review/text: I have a Yorkshire Terrier who has been a finicky eater. He really enjoys having this "seasoning" added to his food occasionally. It has helped him get used to new foods, and I don't have to put it into every meal, or even more than once or twice a week, now. I can't speak for any other dog, but for my little guy, this product has been a winner.

review/text: I couldn't believe my taste buds when I brewed my first cup of this coffee. It was amazing, simply amazing. It is an extremely smooth coffee with very low acidity and a delicious citrus like undertone to it. It reminds me of the dessert coffee used by TGIF restaurants, which is what Ive been searching for for the last few months. It tastes great in a drip maker, French press, as well as when used in a Keurig machine. Highly recommended for all coffee lovers. Goes especially great with dessert, particularly chocolate.

review/summary: Not as tasty as I had hoped!
review/text: These arrived just a few months before becoming outdated!  It's hard to use up 12 good sized canasters in just a couple of months so I know I'll either be using them  beyond their expiration date or discarding them. The later will probably be more likely because as far as their flavor goes....they really don't have much flavor.  I guess I am just use to the regular raisins from Newman's Own or that other company.  I tried baking them in a homemade raisin bread but all they did was dry it out..unlike the other raisins I usually buy.  It was so DRY that I ended up throwing out over half the bread.  Why eat something that does not taste good!!!  Eating raisins out of the box use to be a favorite treat for me but NOT with these raisins.  I don't know why but they just are not very good on their own.  They are made from Thompson's seedless raisins and I know that variety is very sweet since I've grown grapes in the past but these defy this grape's normal strong sweetness and deliciousness.  I know I will not be buying these raisins again but you may like them so I'd suggest you buy a small box locally to try them first.  Perhaps if Amazon sent items that were not outdated or close to it I would have a different opinion but....buy these at your own risk!

review/text: Very tasty.  These raisins are large, moist, and meaty, not small and dried out like your typical raisin.  Excellent flavor.  Although these are golden raisins the color is just a tad lighter than a "regular" raisin.  Although I ate them right out of the box I would guess that they would be very impressive in baked goods such as cookies or raisin bread.

I don't use creamers, etc., so I enjoy a medium to mild roast.  The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend is by far the best I've ever tasted. It has a rich, full-bodied taste without any bitterness. I buy both regular and decaf and can't tell the difference in taste.

Although the box is a metal box and came un-bumped, 1/3 of the cookies inside were broken to pieces.  Others were broken in half.  For $25, the galettes became very expensive crumbs that can only be used as a crust.  Expensive crust...  Wishing I could upload the pictures of the state of the cookies.  It's probably not a packing issue as much as a systemic problem.  Broken pieces/crumbs tasted great though.  I guess I'll be looking for alternative gifts now.

review/summary: A cherished childhood memory...
review/text: I loved Root Beer Fizzies as a kid. I bought some of these Fizzies because I wanted my kids to have the "Fizzies" experience.<br /><br />I know the Fizzies of old weren't great. That wasn't the point. They were fun entertainment. They were basically Root Beer flavored Alka Seltzer (without the aspirin). But they were drinkable.<br /><br />When I got these, my kids were excited. I opened one up. The packaging was similar to what I remembered. The Fizzie was about the same size. When I put it into the water it did its Fizzie thing. It even smelled like the old Root Beer Fizzies.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it doesn't taste like the Fizzies of old. There is no sugar in these. It uses Sorbital instead. I guess that makes these mom friendly. However, they don't taste very good.  In fact, they are pretty bad.<br /><br />Again, the old Fizzies weren't great. The fun was in the "making" of the Fizzies. But at least the old Fizzies where sort of drinkable. These aren't. I wouldn't recommend the "New" Fizzies unless you want your childhood memories destroyed.

review/summary: Formula change
review/text: I had been buying these for several years.  As other reviewers stated, it usually took 3 tablets in a large glass of water to obtain the desired taste. The flavor was indeed ROOTBEER, without the effervescence. They were palatable, and tasted fine well chilled. Must have been satisfactory as I continued to purchase them in bulk (5-6 of the 6-12 pack boxes 2-3 times per year).<br /><br />The recent batch however, was a different story.  The concoction is now cloudy when mixed up. The flavor is what I would expect from gatorade if it had not flavoring added--the salty electrolyte with an aftertaste. Negative rootbeer flavoring, but a VERY faint taste of COLA.  It was simply dreadful.<br /><br />I am still awaiting a response from Fizzies as to what happened

review/summary: Not like they used to be
review/text: Sadly I ended up discarding the unused tablets. Very weak flavor, I had to use 2 or 3 tablets for a glass of water. Also artificially 'sweetened' so be prepared to add some more sweetener of your choice. Not what they used to be, which is sad and strange considering the original recipe was a winner for decades! But someone had to improve it, and in the process destroyed a classic. Save your money, and treasured memories. Pass this one up.

review/summary: Not the original!
review/text: I loved Fizzies as a kid and my own kids loved them when I could find them 10-15 years ago.  When we saw these we looked forward to having the fun drink again, but we are disappointed!  These do not have the same full taste as the originals used to have.  We have tried to double the amount we put in one glass of water and still the taste is off.  These have nothing in them, no calories, no sugar, no caffeine, no (good) taste!  If you've never had Fizzies before these might be okay, but they are a washed out version of the original.

review/summary: Fizzies Fizzled
review/text: We were talking about candies that were around when we were children and Fizzies were mentioned. I use to love Rootbeer flavored Fizzies when I was a kid. I couldn't get them out of my mind. I checked on Amazon to see if they were still being made and to my surprise they were available. I bought a 6 pack. When they arrived, I was ready to enjoy my first Fizzie in 40 years, but discovered I hated the taste  of them. I remember them being sweet and tasting good without having to add anything. These were not good tasting to me. I gave a pack to a friend and she disliked them too. I threw the rest away. Sorry makers of Fizzies, who ever you are, you should have kept the orginal formula. What a disappointment!

review/summary: Nothing like the original
review/text: You have got to be kidding. This is a bad practical joke. These taste more like library paste than the Root Beer Fizzies we grew up with. Absolutely undrinkable. You can measure the water as directed, you can double them up to make them twice as strong as directed, you can add sweeteners not mentioned in the instructions...none of this will help them taste like the original Root Beer Fizzies. Save your money.

review/text: I bought these knowing it was not going to be tasty.<br /><br />The purchase is just for old time's sake, to have a bit of fun watching the tablets fizz.<br /><br />I'll be mailing these to friends for the same reason, so we can have a bit of fun from years ago.<br /><br />It is as remembered, a moment of fun followed by a drink that is, well, not one that would make you purchase box after box :)<br /><br />Still good fun and glad to "play" a bit with something that was fascinating long ago.<br /><br />Another factor in the purchase, it is made in MN per the box. Still "home made".  :)

review/text: I purchased this with the intent of using it to add a bit of flavor to my daily salads without bumping up the calories I was taking in. While capturing a true bacon flavor is difficult, this product did and adequate job of it and produced an enjoyable flavor. This was just right, a smokey, bacon flavor that adds a nice note to my salads without over powering them. It's kind of like using bacon bits but with no calories. Obviously be wary of the sodium if you use this frequently, otherwise enjoy! I look forward to trying their other versions of bacon salt in the future.

review/text: Be aware that these treats are made in China. We received the mini twistz as a Christmas gift for our dogs and one of our dogs started having petit mal seizures about once a week after Christmas. We couldn't figure out what was going on but when a friend pointed out that these treats were from China we tossed them real fast and sure enough the seizures have stopped. Of course I can't prove that the seizures were caused from these treats but I can't help think there's a connection.

review/text: This oatmeal is OK, probably better than prepackaged store brands,  but it's not as good as the bulk oatmeal I buy from the Health Nuts stores in Manhattan, and it's a bit more expensive.  Also, I don't think it is organic if that is important to you.  I think the difference might be size of flakes; the bigger the better, the texture is better.

review/summary: Tastes great, beats fatigue and brain fog
review/text: I am a woman with Multiple Sclerosis who was first introduced to Red Bull by a fellow MS'er because of intense fatigue.  Fatigue and brain fog (cognitive issues) can be a huge part of those people who suffer with MS.  I am not condoning the long-term use of Red Bull to beat the kind of fatigue that MS'ers (or people with other medical problems face) but for me, it got me through several hours in a day when I needed my mojo on and worked for in a large corporate environment under huge stressors.  There was a period in my life where "a Red Bull a day kept the sleepies away" and I was able to function in an IT job that was very stressful at times.<br /><br />Red Bull helped me survive.  While I do not drink it as regularly as I used to (I use a medication called Provigil to handle the regular fatigue caused by MS), I do use it on occasion when I need to feel sharp quickly.  When in Las Vegas and playing at the Craps table, Red Bull comes in EXTREMELY HANDY.  I also enjoy a Red Bull and Vodka every now and then.<br /><br />I have tried others such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2O1XG">Rockstar Energy Drink-Double Strength Energy Drink 16oz, 24 Pack</a> but still just love the taste of Red Bull.  The taste wins me every time.  It's something you will either love or hate.  There is also the 12 Pack - Red Bull Energy Shot - 2oz. for a quick, low calorie boost.

review/summary: Seems to really make a difference
review/text: I got this tea because I am pumping for an adoptive couple in addition to feeding my own 3 month old.  Originally, I was pumping 10 oz extra a day.  I started drinking one cup of this in the morning and I usually am pumping 15 to 20 extra ounces a day (in additional to my own son being at the 92% on the growth chart).  So, it's worked well for me.  I can tell when I've forgotten to drink it for a day.<br /><br />As far as the taste goes, I don't think it's bad at all. I'm not a huge tea drinker, but I do something drink blueberry tea or other fruity things.  This is fine for me.  I don't add sugar or anything and I drink it just fine.<br /><br />It's certainly worth a try if you're trying to boost your supply a bit.  I know with my first, my supply dwindled a bit when she was around 6 months, and this might have been the perfect solution!<br /><br />Also, my friend drank this tea right after she gave birth because she was worried about her supply taking too long to come in (jaundice and all that) -- and her milk came in within 24 hours.  Now, she said she was drinking cup after cup, but still -- to not have to wait for the milk to come in, it would be worth it!

review/text: If you want to improve your milk production, this tea's ingredients will definitely work. However, I much prefer the taste of Traditional Medicinals Mother's Milk Tea, which has more of an anise taste that I would drink even if it didn't come with the benefits. The Earth Mama version tastes more medicinal and lately the aftertaste reminds me of onions (yuck). I'll still finish the box because it's good for me (and baby), but I'm sticking with Traditional Medicinals instead. I do love Earth Mama Angel Baby bath and body products, though - they are awesome.

review/text: I've tried this EMAB's Milkmaid Tea, Yogi's Nursing Support, Traditional Medicine's Mother's Milk, and a couple other brands I don't remember from a local healthfoods store.  This is by far the tastiest in my opinion and I wouldn't even mind drinking it if I weren't nursing. It's the only brand I bought again. I stopped drinking it when it was clear I had an oversupply and only use it when I'm pumping more often, which usually hinders my supply (versus nursing).

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.

review/text: Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup is excellent!  There isn't anything on the label that states that this is from anywhere else but Vermont...(some syrups that claim to be pure maple syrup also have labels that state that they may be a product of Canada or Vermont).  The price per oz. is about 81 cents and as I use at least one ounce on my waffles, this bottle will last for about 16 servings.  I will be buying this one again!

review/summary: Rich maple flavor, good value
review/text: I ordered the Grade B Hidden Springs Syrup -- Grade B is my favorite for baking.  I love the strong, rich maple flavor.  This is my favorite amongst several maple syrups that I've ordered from Amazon.  Maple syrup is understandably expensive, but this syrup is a good value among its' competitors.

review/text: Living on Guam can at times leave much to be desired. We were sitting here talking about when we visited our family in Wisconsin and had some home made ice cream at an Amish farm. I remembered how good it tasted and I remembered I had some Maple syrup ice cream while there, sooooo. I got on line and found this 1/2 gallon, price wasn't bad  (here at a local store a pint of REAL Maple syrup will cost $12.00) and it had free shipping. I had it in a few days, and made the ice cream right away. By the way I also made pancakes and sausage for dinner, and this here Maple syrup was as good if not better than what I had 8 years ago. VERY well packaged, and really fast shipping. Nice bouqet, great light amber color, great job to the cooker. Oh yea, by the way, the ice cream came out wonderfully.

review/summary: Travel-Size SteviaClear
review/text: This is a perfect size to take with you to Starbucks or your favorite restaurant - fits discreetly in your purse, briefcase, diaper bag, back-pack, man-bag, fanny pack, even your little watch pocket (just keep lid tightened!)! Much useful history and information can be obtained at http://www.sweetleaf.com/  Since I quit using bleached sugar, and I never liked the various chemically modified sweeteners, I've had much better results using Stevia (no headaches!). It is diabetic-friendly, dieter friendly, zero calories, low glycemic index, and easy to use! Not sure if it can be carried on board for airline trips, since this is a liquid, but you could look on Amazon for the SweetLeaf packets of powdered stevia to take with you - the powdered stevia is just as sweet and comes in individual packets. I find for most 10-12 ounce mugs of coffee or tea, I like two packets, but it's all based on individual taste.

review/text: SweetLeaf Stevia is one of the few stevia products that does not contain alcohol and is considered a "higher quality" stevia product among consumers of organic foods.<br /><br />The Stevia itself is sweetness at just the right level, and these little travel size bottles are great for home, office and in my purse on the go.<br /><br />Those that are considering this product might want to take a look at other SweetLeaf Stevia in other flavors. The Vanilla Cream is FANTASTIC and the raspberry chocolate, Valencia orange and Lemon Drop are also tasty.<br /><br />Sweetness at it's best, all natural and nothing artificial...After trying this product I refuse to use anything else.

review/summary: Stevia-Good Powder, but good liquid?
review/text: I have used Stevia packets for a long time and they work beautifully in warm beverages. But, with the beginning of summer, I found that they didn't mix as well in iced tea.  So I bought these drops. They are a convenient size to carry in my pocketbook. I find the taste of the liquid a little different than the powdered product, but it may just take me time to get used to it and to figure out just how many drops to use. If you are a Stevia user I urge you to try it to see how it works for you and don't give up with the first try. You may find that adjusting the amount will make it just right and it will mix so much easier in cold drinks.

review/summary: This is my favorite Vanilla, AND yes, it is NOT an Extract
review/text: I have been using Singing Dog Vanilla Pure Vanilla for several years now. It is my favorite Vanilla.  I just love when I first open the bottle and a wonderful smell of real vanilla comes at you with NO Alcohol smell.  It's just pure Vanilla.  Ingredient facts are: Water, Glycerin and Vanilla Bean Extracts.  No Alcohol, None, so those who have Corn Allergies don't have to worry about what's left in the Alcohol extracts. Most Alcohol Extracts are made for distilled ferminted corn and some protiens can be left behind. Singing Dog Vanilla is also Gluten Free, which is another plus for me.  I have used Singing Dog Vanilla in many different application and I have not found it lacking in taste, not even in smoothies.  In fact, I have been adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla in a pint of water that is mixed with 1 tablespoon Great Lakes Gelatin to help get rid of gelatin taste. AND I like the taste it gives to this drink. (This drink is NOT a smoothie is just water, Gelatin and Vanilla period. It's for the purposes of helping in the process of healing ones leaky gut, used twice a day)<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not sure what the last reviewer was looking for in taste, but I do not find Singing Dog Vanilla lacking at all.  But everyone is different.  If she is talking about Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Extract having a stronger vanilla taste, she is correct, BUT Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Pure Vanilla Extract also adds sugar for sweetness.  I DON'T want added sugar to my vanilla, I just want Vanilla and that's what you get with Singing Dog Vanilla Pure Vanilla.  Another Brand that's up there with Sing Dog Vanilla is Frontier's  Vanilla Flavor (no Alcohol).  It too is very good, and it has a slightly different texture, but really great taste.  Anyway, I had to write a review, because I disagree with an earlier persons review and hope others will give Singing Dog Vanilla a try.  Oh and one more thing, this is a really safe Vanilla for those doing the SCD Diet and the GAP Diet, or the Candidas which I am on.  AS I've said before this vanilla is really safe too NO added sugar cane or corn Alcohol extracts, which is wonderful.  Have a great day. Cathi G. Ventura, CA<br /><br />(PS:  I do bake and cook with Singing Dog Pure Vanilla and it DOES NOT loose its flavor in the process either! :-))

Maybe it's a better product for cooking, but not for smoothies. I tasted a little on its own and the alcohol base is what overwhelmingly stood out to me over any vanilla flavor. I'm going to keep looking. Hoping to find something natural with a big vanilla bang for my buck and little to no added chemicals. Fingers crossed!

review/text: I literally could not live without the Monthly Comfort tea. A friend recommended it to me for "the time of the month" and I tried it skeptically - especially as I am not a mother, a soon to be mother, or motherly at all. I start drinking at least a cup of this three to four days before my cycle, and find that most of the monthly annoyance of being a woman subsides. What was a week of unpleasantness, with two days of insomnia because the pain is so bad has no turned into a day or two max of light cramps, with no bloating either.<br /><br />To me it tastes like cinnamon and ginger, with raspberry undertones. It tastes delicious enough that I often have it all month long, not just on my cycle. It's especially pleasant on a chilly morning.<br /><br />I buy this in bulk now, because running out is simply not an option!

review/summary: Exceptional product!
review/text: I've battled horrific periods for years, especially after the birth of my second child.  I wish I would have known about this many years ago!  This tea is absolutely fantastic.  I typically have issues with gaining upwards of 10 lbs of water weight during my menstrual cycle - not this time.  Cramping is significantly reduced, water weight is non-existent, even my husband commented on my much improved monthly demeanor.<br /><br />The tea is easy to make, though I would certainly recommend steeping for a solid 15 minutes for best results.  I drink two cups of this tea each day (morning and afternoon) starting a few days before my cycle and all the way through.  I do not normally enjoy tea, but I have to say, this is delicious.  I didn't even need to add sugar or other sweetener to mask the taste.<br /><br />I have used most of the Earth Mama tea products, and have been impressed by the high quality, delicious flavors, and natural remedies for my ails.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.
