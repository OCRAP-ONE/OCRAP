review/text: I have been easily able to substitute Himalayan Salt with regular table salt for cooking, baking and flavoring my food at the table. I was on a special diet for esophagitis and starting using Himalayan Salt for its healing benefits. And because I was avoiding spicy food, it was the one "condiment" I could enjoy.

review/summary: Excellent Source Of Omega3 And Many Health Benefits
review/text: I'm so glad to have found this product on Amazon. I have been using flax seed for 12 years. I was grinding my own in a coffee grinder.  Then I found Spectrum Cold Milled Organic Ground Premium Flaxseed.  I sprinkle a tablespoon full on my morning oatmeal every day. When I make smoothies, I add a tablespoon or two to my blender.  My husband has recently started adding flaxseed to his oatmeal because he takes pain meds which are constipating. Flaxseeds help with constipation as they provide an excellent source of fiber.  Flaxseeds can be added to many foods. They have a very slight nutty flavor if you taste it out of the bag. Personally, I cannot taste them at all when I add them to food. I love the convenience of having my flaxseeds ready to add to my food without having to drag out the grinder and clean it afterward.  I keep my flaxseed in the freezer and use it directly from there. Omega3 oils are prone to becoming rancid and should be stored in the refrigerator or freezer once opened. I love the fact that these flaxseeds are organic. I also love that these flaxseeds are cold milled, which means they are not exposed to heat which would promote rancidity and destroy the nutritive value. I have read grinding your own flaxseeds subject the seeds to more heat than seeds which are commercially cold milled.I should add that my HDL cholesterol is double the norm. HDL is the good cholesterol. Most people average 40. My HDL is 86. Flaxseeds are the highest vegetarian source of Omega3 essential fatty acids and are attributed to many health benefits including heart health, diabetes, cancer, inflammation, pms, menopause and constipation. Amazon is offering this product at an excellent price. It is a staple in my house and I plan to order this on a regular basis.

Buy it here in the 4-pack because at the grocery or health food store, it's $7 - $9 per package and through Amazon, it works out to just over $5 per package and since I'm a Prime member, I received free shipping (and no tax) also.

review/summary: More expensive, but carefully manufactured and fine quality
review/text: When I asked one of the most energetic people I have ever known what his number one recommendation would be diet-wise for maintaining good energy levels, he recommended ground flaxseed. He has eaten the Trader Joe's brand for years, but that's not easy for me to get so I've been eating the Spectrum ground flaxseed for six months. I truly believe there is a noticeable benefit in terms of maintaining a better energy curve through most of a work day. (I've crossed age 60 and maintaining good energy levels is definitely getting harder.) The Spectrum product is fairly expensive compared to the stone ground products, but it's prepared in a different and certainly more expensive way: they slice the seeds into minuscule slices in order to reduce surface area and the oxidation that diminishes nutritional value very quickly. The package has a ziplock resealer that is of much higher quality than usual -- it works perfectly all the way to the last serving -- so be sure to make sure the packet is resealed properly after each use. To further maintain freshness prior to opening, they flush the package with an "inert gas." In order to help keep it fresher after opening, I keep the package in a quart-size reasonably airtight canister in the refrigerator. The Spectrum product is delicious -- I actually look forward to it each morning. I use three heaped teaspoons in my cereal and make sure it's saturated. There's what seems to be a genuine freshness in the taste.

review/summary: Constipated?????
review/text: Not sure how many of you have this problem, but I was frequently constipated and struggled to find a healthy way to deal with it without laxatives. My brother mentioned that flaxseed worked for him.  Spectrum Essentials Organic Ground Flaxseed has a texture similar to corn meal. My brother adds it to his oatmeal for breakfast. I have heard others make oatmeal cookies with flaxseed added. I wanted to do something a little more hardcore that would take less time and effort, allowing me to be consistant. So after hearing that apple juice, or aloe vera juice also helps with constipation, I chose to simply add 2 tablespoons to 1/2 a glass of apple juice and I drink that grainy concoction first thing in the morning, and also when I get home after work. It took some getting use to, but now I am a pro and do it religiously. Taking it makes me more regular (most times now going once a day, sometimes I miss a day but in the past I could go a week before getting relief). Try a recipe that works in your diet and schedule, but just get it in daily for results.  You have to remember to drink 8 glasses of water per day. Side effects for me were all positive, I feel fuller and don't have food cravings, so I shed about 8 pounds naturally without changing anything else. I am 5'4" and before the flaxseed regimen I weighed 125-6 lbs, now I am down to 118 lbs. I never thought I could lose that annoying 5 pounds I had tried to lose for many years, and with flax seed it just happened and has not returned over a 6 month period and I have a 2-3 pound cushion. The product is great but the price varies. On Amazon I pay about $4 per bag, in the grocery stores I have seen it for $8.99 a bag. My brother buys 16 oz bags of Bob's Red Mill Whole Ground Flaxseed Meal at "Big Lots" for $2.50. So shop around. The product is a 5 star product, I give it 4 because of the price, I kicked myself when I found out my brotehr found a comparable product for $1.50 less than I could gt it for on Amazon. But I actually love it.....

review/summary: Great addition to smoothies plus you can make "crackers"
review/text: If your blender doesn't grind flax seeds thoroughly, this flaxseed meal is a handy way to add flaxseed to your smoothies or baked goods. I typically throw in a scoop into a yogurt smoothie or some juiced vegetables. The smaller packet is good because flaxseed oils go rancid, so a large sack of pre-ground flaxseed can spoil before you use it all up. This is the right size.<br /><br />You can include this in bread recipes, and you can make a vegetable "raw" cracker with this meal by mixing pureed tomato, onion, garlic, parsley and carrot together with this meal and make a sort of batter. Dehydrate it on teflon sheets in a dehydrator and cut the dried batter up into "crackers." No gluten, lower carb and very tasty as a snack.

Although I  haven't had too much luck  baking with it (probably because I make all of my own recipes), I'm still going to keep buying it.  It tends to produce a dense baked good (I made delicious peanut flour brownies with this) so make sure to use leavening, such as baking powder or eggs.<br /><br />Since I love using this flour, I find that buying the 32oz package is a better deal than the 16oz package.

review/summary: Hooked on Lakerol!
review/text: I never liked gum!  I'd chew it for about 5 minutes until the flavor was all gone and that would be it.  So I'm  not a gum chewer, and not much on hard candies, either.  Then I discovered Lakerol!  A cross between gum and candy, and the flavor is great and lasts.  The perfect confection!  Wish they weren't quite so pricey, but a case lasts me almost a year.  And while there are different flavors, and I've tried most of them, I'm stuck on the original - and never tire of it.  Just the perfect, refreshing chew at work, while driving, etc. - and freshens the breath a bit, too.  Thanks Lakerol!

review/text: this is a smooth, mild black tea with prominent peppery notes.  the cinnamon grown in Sri Lanka is more mild and complex than what you will find in chai from anywhere else. (google ceylon cinnamon)  if you like your chai with cinnamon as its most prominent feature then perhaps this is not for you.<br /><br />it's rare to find a fair trade product like this which is also priced fairly for the consumer.<br /><br />i should also add that the quality of this tea is superior to the much more popular Tazo brand IMHO.

I kept switching foods - changed to ceramic bowl etc etc... He ate ALL of the weruva food - every day - empties his bowl - looks forward to it. I was skeptical to try other flavors as he loved the paw lickin chicken - but he loves the other ones as well - now mealtime is fun. THank you weruva and amazon for offering.

review/text: Weruva appears to be a high-quality, human grade food.  My cats just love it!  My only gripe is when Amazon does not specifiy if it is cat food or dog food.  When they don't, it usually means its dog food, even when I do a specific search for "Weruva canned cat food".  And then the Amazon representative tries to tell my the cat and dog food is the same!  NOT!

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: We just recently added a corgi to our family, and I started researching different types of wet and dry foods for our pup. After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner. I won't feed my dog anything else.

She even refused a stranger trying to feed her real meat!(She doesn't trust strangers I guess...)  After months of trying every type in the market.  I'm saying all of this to say that she is super pickyk.  She'll only eat real chicken breast jerky, dingo brand bone with chicken in the middle, and the weruva brand wet food.  (And fresh vegies and fruit... mystery)  Anyhoo, of all the dog food/treat in the market, she LOVES this one the best.  That says a lot.

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: Please ignore the 1 star review.  That's an Amazon mistake and this terrific dog food doesn't deserve a one star because of an Amazon tagging error.  Weruva is one of the only genuinely human grade dog food products available.  My three pugs had totally gone off their food for days until I tried this brand .... I was going to buy Merrick (which they don't like very much) and found this instead.  It is spectacular.  Doesn't even smell like dogfood.  And, Amazon's price is very reasonable compared to my local retailer.  THIS IS A GREAT DOGFOOD PRODUCT and really worth trying out if you are an animal lover.  BTW - I now give it to my cats too and they are the fussiest eaters in the world -- they love it too.

review/text: I ordered both this type and the Paella for our Akita, and I have to say hands down, this is the only food that she gets excited about about EVERY time. She is a picky eater, and sometimes the other food, has to be put in the refrigerator because I don't want it to spoil. I don't give her this "flavor" all the time though, because I want it to be more of a reward type meal. Have not tried the Kobe flavors yet, but am looking forward to...am waiting for the economy to pick up a bit more to try these ones just in case she is not as crazy about these as she is the pork version.

review/text: While the ingredients look good (though the water content is 80% while most of the better brands have 78%) this food has managed to get two of my dogs sick!  Vomiting and uncontrollable bowel movements.  One dog is 17 yrs old and the other 4 yrs old.  I stopped feeding the older girl this food some time ago but discovered I still had cans so I gave a can to the 4 yr old.  After two days on the food he became sick.  He is now on rice and chicken for the next few days.  I cannot recommend this food to anyone.

While they've always been healthy cats, their coats have gotten even shinier since I've started feeding them an all-wet diet (including Weruva), and they're maintaining a healthy weight and activity level. I'd highly recommend this food to other pet owners, and Amazon's price (with the free shipping) is the best I've seen.

review/summary: decent dog food, but Fromm's is better
review/text: This brand is not bad, the ingredients are all good. However, compared to Fromm's canned dog food, I was not impressed. There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.

When I tried to return it, I found that This food has a NO RETURN policy. I ended up paying more than $10.00 a can for those 5 cans. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened. Instead of throwing money away like this, I will pay a little more and pick it up myself! Buyers, please be aware of this NO RETURN policy!!!!

review/summary: Good food, easy delivery
review/text: I have two small-ish dogs (both should weigh about 12-15 pounds each), who are 9 and 11 years old. Feeding them never used to be an issue; we used a nice quality dry food, and they ate out of one bowl together. A few years ago, though, one of them became dangerously ill, and is now diabetic with heavy cataracts in both eyes, so being sure she gets enough to eat at the right times has become much more important. I mix a quarter of a can with a half cup of our dry dog food for each dog twice a day. This gives both of them the right calories (the other dog is more plump because when food falls, she is the only one who can see it!), and the wet food ensures that my diabetic pup eats everything in her bowl. Amazon's price is better than what I pay locally, and it arrives sooner than what the delivery-by date is.

review/summary: My pup's favorite brand of canned food
review/text: My pup, a corgi/chi mix who rarely gets people food yet somehow is so very picky, LOVES weruva. He has tried other very high quality brands and has now been turning his nose up to those after he has tried this. He has so far tried and loved the paw-lickin chicken, grandma's chicken soup, and wok the dog.  These are especially great if you like to have something to mix in with kibble because they have a good amount of sauce in it, though not too much in my opinion to feel like you're getting jipped.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased them from amazon so I cannot comment on the shipping quality.  Although I have bought online elsewhere and it arrived via fedex, some a little dented but all cans still useable.  Glad to see weruva is on amazon, will have to order from here next time I need to purchase.

It's ok, but Plum Organics and Happy Baby pouches are much better for travel because you can squeeze it directly into your baby's mouth.  Sprout still requires a spoon.  So, if you're buying for travel convenience, (unless these flavors are the only ones your kid will eat), there are better options.

review/summary: Tasty Mellow blend
review/text: When I was coffee shopping, the two conflicting reviews of this coffee confused me.  With Google, I was able to find Reggie's website, and read about this company's background:<br /><br />"H. "Reggie" ChungLoy is a Jamaican-born general and vascular surgeon in private practice in Central New Jersey who received his medical degree from Howard University in Washington, DC, and completed surgical training at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.<br /><br />"Having spent his early years in the shadows of the Blue Mountains whilst growing up in the parishes of Portland and St. Andrew, Reggie, like most Jamaicans grew accustomed to the unusually sweet and mild Java from the overlying hills. While residing in Manhattan, this delicious Java could be found only in the most exotic coffee establishments in NYC, usually sporadically, and often of questionable authenticity, freshness and quality. In a stroke of good fortune, Reggie acquired an old coffee farm in the Blue Mountains in the 1990's, with mature coffee trees essentially growing wild. Thus was born the Gentleman Farmer and the creation of MIRE Enterprises. MIRE Enterprises has since acquired and developed a second coffee farm in the Blue Mountains."<br /><br />With a story like this, I wanted to taste this coffee for myself. Having finished the first of three vac-packed containers of the whole bean coffee, I can say that, for the price, this is great coffee, and I can believe that this is the product of a coffee-lover's nostalgia for the brew of his youth.<br /><br />This "house blend" is not the Jamaican Blue that originally inspired Reggie, but I look forward to exploring that and the many other varieties on offer from Reggie.

review/text: Unfortunately, two out of my three bottles were smashed.  They went through the trouble of wrapping them in bubble wrap and putting them in a medium box with lots of air pillows, but because the three bottles were all put together inside  of one bubble wrapped bag,  they were broken.  It's very disappointing that they haven't resolved the packing issues, what a waste.  The glass bottles need to be individually wrapped.  It was a mess to clean up -  tiny shards of glass and extract everywhere.  Smelled fantastic, though. It's clearly a good product. I'd love to give it a higher rating.

review/text: Based on what two other reviewers said, the packaging is STILL terrible. My first order didn't even make it to my doorstop. UPS deemed it "undeliverable". The bottles were probably poorly packaged and smashed en route. Emailed amazon and they immediately sent me a new order with 1-day shipping. Great but while they arrived intact, all 3 bottles were wrapped together and clicking musically together in a medium sized box stuff with filler. I'm surprised that it made it here intact as the box looked slightly damaged.<br /><br />The product itself is terrific. I'm surprised at how strong the extract is, much stronger than any store bought brand! But the subscribe and save feature makes it impossible to pass up. If it weren't for the poor packaging, I'd give this 6 stars!

review/summary: I WOULD USE Rold Gold or Tostitos Scoops Instead
review/text: LONG STORY SHORT: These cost too much, are not good for dipping, and suffer from the tiniest bit of humidity. Do not buy.<br /><br />THE WHOLE STORY:<br /><br />I was so excited when I saw these Rothchild Pretzel Dippers for sale. I was having a little get together with the swanky ladies down the block and I wanted to be certain that what I had to offer for our Book Club snack items were up to snuff. I ordered some Rothchild Red Pepper Dip <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045DO9QY">Red Pepper Dip</a>and got out my Mother's antique China snack plates and was all set to go. I even had matching crystal pieces, one for the Pretzels and a smaller one for the Red Pepper Dip. As suits the snooty lady image, our book of the month was SOUL BY SOUL: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674005392">Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market</a>.<br /><br />Now, I am neither particularly swanky, snooty, nor snobby. I had moved into a new neighborhood and wanted to make a decent impression on the nice ladies that invited me to join their book club. I wore my Blue Jeans, a top with some "hip" sequins and my blue sandals. That's it. It's me, just me, and I will try to give you some good food, be polite, and see if we can all have a good time.<br /><br />So, I had various snack type foods available, a bit of wine, some Iced Tea with Peaches, a little Perrier for looks and off we went. It is a good thing the other ladies were QUITE POLITE because the Pretzel Dippers were a flop. They looked and tasted pretty much like the square Snyder's Pretzels that can be purchased at the local cut rate grocery store: a. The square snaps:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7V3K8">Snyder's of Hanover Pretzel Snaps, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a> or b.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XOYSTE">Snyder's of Hanover - Old Fashioned Dipping Stix Pretzels - 10-oz. Bag (Pack of 3)</a>. Actually, Snyder's dipping pretzels are the stick kind while Rothchild's resemble Snyder's little square ones with square holes in them.<br /><br />DRIPPERS INSTEAD OF DIPPERS: So, you can figure out right away, that Rothchild's Dipping Pretzels with holes allow all but the sturdiest of dip to drip or squish through the holes. My Snyders Red Pepper Dip had enough substance to it that the peppers DID stay on the pretzel, but the liquid that was associated with the Pepper Dip dripped right through. Good we had Mom's china to catch the drips. Paper plates would have inevitable become soggy. Thankfully, I had also made a Cream Cheese Based Dip and it DID stay on the Pretzels without any dripping. But, exactly what was the point? Making a sweet cream cheese dips that ends up being tried on Pretzels, instead of the intended bagel chips, was kind of a waste. So, I did not like these dippers because they would have been more appropriately labeled DRIPPERS.<br /><br />TASTE: The Rothchild taste was very Plain. Snyder's Pretzel taste, in my opinion, is much superior. I thought for the price that Rothschild might have thrown in a secret taste ingredient that made them worth the price. That was not so. Basically, they tasted like your usual prtzel with a little less salt.<br /><br />SOGGINESS: DID THEY STAND THE TEST OF TIME: I live in Arizona where the humidity is almost nil. Snyders Pretzels, The regular Rold Golds, and even those tubs of pretzels that the boss buys and sets out in the office hold up and stay fresh for 2 or 3 months with no problem. Not Rothschid Dippers. By day 5 after the party, these Rothchild Pretzels were starting to give, bend, and show signs of initial sogginess.<br /><br />MY SUGGESTION: Skip the Pricey Rothchild Pretzels. If it has to be Pretzels, you may as well go with the regular old Rold Golds. But, my real and truest suggestion, if dip is coming into play, Use Tostitos Scoops tortillia Chips. They are built for dipping and scooping and the nice ladies won't think you wasted your money on some high priced doo dad that is mostly for looks. Instead, they will think you are a smart, frugal little gal who fits right in with the crowd.  On the other hand, if you want it to look like you spent a bundle on a snack food with no redemptive taste, use as a dipper, or an item that makes it price worth the money, go ahead, buy the Rothchilds. I found them to be tasteless and a total waste of money. No recommendation from me!

review/text: The grape and the peach both come through OK, but there is a hint of something else that I can't quite identify.  It's not unpleasant, though not quite consistent with the grape and peach flavor that is supposed to be dominant.  Looking at the label, it's likely the pear juice that's blended in.<br /><br />Though I won't have any problem drinking the full case that we purchased, it is probably not a flavor combination I'd personally want to try again - I like a slightly "stronger" taste, and this is a bit subtle to me.  It may well be just what someone else wants, however.  I do think it deserves four stars, since it's above average, and beats some store-labeled brands hands down.
