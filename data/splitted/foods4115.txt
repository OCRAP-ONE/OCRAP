review/summary: even the stray cat outside wasn't interested!
review/text: Since my cats have always loved Cosmic Catnip, I figured they might also enjoy the treats.  What a disappointment!  Neither cat even nibbled, and when I left some outside for the neighborhood stray, he even passed!  Save your money and just buy grocery store treats.

review/summary: "Is this supposed to be a treat?" (What my kitties would ask if they could talk)
review/text: I've been purchasing Cosmic catnip and scratching pads for as long as I've been a cat owner, and I've never been disappointed.  When I saw the cute, colorful packaging and the variety of flavors available for these treats, I couldn't resist.<br /><br />Sadly, my cats won't even acknowledge these as food.  They won't even smell them, let alone taste them.  Maybe I just got a bad batch, but my cats will usually eat anything that is offered to them at least once.  Even one of my dogs, who does anything to sneak a bite of the kitty food, wasn't too eager to eat one of these Philly Cheesesteak treats.<br /><br />The treats arrived somewhat hard, but it is obvious that they are the type that should be soft.  I don't know if this was Amazon's error for selling a stale product, or if the cold weather had something to do with it (it's getting down to the 20's at night where I live).<br /><br />For nearly the same price as these treats, buy your kitties a tub of Cosmic catnip...I am almost certain they will LOVE you for it!

review/summary: Favorite Treat!
review/text: These are our puggle's favorite treat!  We discovered the cheese snacks at a small boutique pet store and the dog fell in love with them -- he loves anything made of cheese.  I was thrilled to find them at Amazon in the two pack at a savings!  The treats themselves are small -- about the size of a nickel -- so they are better for smaller dogs.  They even smell good!  Only drawback is that there seems to be a lot of broken pieces and cheese "dust" at the bottom of the bag.

review/summary: Decent Instant Coffee
review/text: I love coffee - good coffee - so am hesitant to even review an instant coffee.  However, there are times when I'm not up for brewing (especially not decaf) and this brand of instant works well.  If you don't think of it as coffee, and consider it more like another kind of hot drink, then it's not bad.<br />It's worth the cost, especially if you subscribe and get the 15% discount.

review/summary: TASTES LIKE REAL COFFEE!!! It's a miracle!
review/text: OMG This is so delicious! I'm fine with spending money at Starbucks for some overpriced coffee from time to time, and even buying fancy beans at Whole Foods or something... but when it came to decaf, I just never found it to be worth my while to get beans, or grounds, or buy a cup at a cafe. (Why spend money on something that has no return value????)<br /><br />Anyway, I figured I could buy some instant decaf coffee for those nights when I just want a taste of coffee, but without the consequences of staying up tossing and turning in bed all jittery and craycray.<br /><br />Nescafe Clasico Decaf is DELICIOUS. It has a very smooth, almost honey-like taste, not at all bitter/acidic/sour like almost all instant coffee usually is, but also not hecka expensive like Starbucks VIA coffee is.<br /><br />I took off one star because there really isn't clear instructions as to how much grounds you should put for how much hot water, so the first few tries I was basically experimenting blindly, which was a bit annoying.

review/text: So glad I read various reviews of other products sold here at Amazon before choosing the Spice Hunter brand.  I wanted a chipotle chile that did not contain a mixture of other spices and salt, and that is what this product offers.  Perfect smokey heat!  And yes, use your spice or coffee grinder if you want a more powdery substance as opposed to the crushed seeds that this contains.  The aroma, the flavor, the heat - Oh, my! This stuff is great!

The kids call them "Clifford Juice."<br /><br />Amazon's price is about 30% less than what we have found at the local (major) grocery store chain. This one has become a 'subscribe and save' staple in our household.

review/text: I first purchased these nuts on a trip to Lake Tahoe from a small specialty shop at an inversely proportional large price. The nuts are tasty and have enough heat to get your attention but not enough to scare you away. My son says they are addictive. However, at specialty shop prices this is an addiction that would soon land you in the poor house. The six pack sale I purchased at Amazon was spot on for value. Unfortunately it is not the regular purchase price. I look forward to seeing this item on sale in the future and will surely purchase again.

review/summary: Caution: Can Become Addicting!
review/text: My oldest daughter lives in Kansas City. Since I'm a huge salsa fan, she takes me to Original Juan's factory outlet store every time I visit to stock up on some of my favorite salsas.<br /><br />The last time I was there, I picked up an 8 oz. can of Da'Bomb Ghost Pepper Nuts. (Original Juan manufactures and distributes this product.) They had an in-store sampling, and they were amazing.  Spicy?  Yes, but not so hot that you can't enjoy them. (I had earlier bought a bottle of their Da'Bomb salsa, and it was way too hot for my taste.) These peanuts are, however, hot but not overpoweringly so. Ingredients include ghost chili peppers and habanero peppers. And while they are also salty (180 mg per 1 oz. serving), they are no more salty than most other salted nuts.<br /><br />And what I really like about them is that my wife thinks they are TOO hot, so I don't have to share. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

review/text: For MMORPG junkies, I heard the heat index for these best described as "A DOT that stacks."<br /><br />For the rest of you, that basically means that a few of these wonderful li'l things don't seem so bad. "Heck" you'll say to yourself in false confidence "these things aren't even hot!." To which the natural response is to shovel a handful into your mouth. That, my fellow heat-seekers, is where the fun begins! These things get hotter as you eat more of them and they are loaded with flavor. Do yourself a service and buy some for yourself, then give a handful to some unsuspecting victim and tell him they're "mild at best."

review/summary: Smokey and with a zing
review/text: There's no reason to explain hot foods, either you love them or you don't.<br /><br />I've had Dave's Burning Nuts (most well known for Dave's Insanity Sauce) prior but they stopped selling them at the local grocery store. I imagine I may have been the only buyer but much like Da' Bomb Ghost Pepper Nuts, they're a simple mix of peanuts and spices. The big seller here is the inclusion of Bhut Jolokia (Also known as Naga Jolokia and Ghost Chilis), an impossibly hot super pepper, with a scoville rating of roughly 1,000,000. Its clear that the Da' Bomb dilutes it heavily, for the sake of eatiblity.  They're hotter than Dave's Burning Nuts, but certainly shy of the hot sauces like Dave's Insanity or even temporary insanity. They could pack a little more punch but they're the right amount to be eatable (at least to me, everyone's tolerance is different and my definition of hot certainly a few standard deviations outside of the norm).<br /><br />They have a nice smokey taste, and little less salty than Dave's, closer to a BBQ taste than Dave's Burning Nuts. The heat takes awhile, to kick in, mostly after you've had a few handfuls and it lingers pleasantly, but never painful.<br /><br />I will say however, perhaps someone unknown ingredient causes some reaction, where they don't exactly digest pleasantly. Usually hot foods don't bother my stomach but these are a bit different. I really like them, but its hard to justify eating them.  Too bad, they're worth buying, or at least checking or gifting to someone other soul who loves hot food.

review/summary: My Favorite Granola
review/text: This wonderful organic granola has become my favorite granola. It is just perfectly crunchy and goes well with milk or can be sprinkled on top of yogurt. I like the crunchiness of the pumpkin seeds and they mix well with the oats and flax seeds. This is sweetened with evaporated cane juice instead of regular sugar or corn syrup. It is also high in fiber, low in sodium and has six grams of protein per serving. Give it a try I think you'll love it.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

We ran out of maple syrup (the organic Canadian variety, no offense to anyone; that's what we like)  one pancake-Sunday, and in desperation I made a syrup of water, honey, sugar and some of this bitter-almond essence. WOW. I have not been allowed to buy maple syrup ever since.

review/text: If you've never tried Kona coffee, Aloha Island is definitely the one to start with.  <p>Kona coffee is grown in the Kona district of the Big Island and regarded by some to be the best coffee in the world.  I'm not a coffee aficionado by any means, but you can taste the difference with Kona coffee - it's full and rich and almost mocha-ish.  I always reserve Kona for lazy weekend brunches or to serve with dessert after a lovely dinner.  <p>Aloha Island operates the only quality management program in Kona, so their coffees are certified as 100% Kona.  Which just means that you're guaranteed to get quality Kona coffee if you order from them. <p>Keep in mind that Aloha Island has three grades of Kona coffee that they sell - gold, platinum, and diamond (which is supposed to be their private reserve).  Obviously, it gets more expensive as you go up the ladder.  The gold is very good and a great place to start sampling their fare.

Moreover,if you've tried a lot of "kona" coffees like I have, you know how widely the taste and quality can vary.

review/text: I can see why plenty of people will think this is the best coffee ever. It's some of the smoothest, least bitter coffee I've ever tasted. The aroma is also delicious. Opening the bag and taking a whiff right away is a must if you want to try this.<br /><br />But I'm the type of coffee drinker who loves it black, so I need a coffee with a rich flavour on its own. I don't wanter bitterness, but I love coffee with kick to it.<br /><br />I'd call it too mild but that's kind of oversimplifying it. It's worth a try to make up your own mind though.

review/summary: Inferior Coffee
review/text: Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage. I would never buy anything from Aloha Island Coffee company again.

But then you smell something like scrambled eggs, fried oignon rings and above all the strong scent of espresso...<br /><br />This is strong coffee like the Italian espresso. Take care you don't boil the water, otherwise it will loses its flavor. The water should be between warm and hot. I use it black with a small lump of brown sugar. A real amateur will tell you that the use of any sugar is sacrilege. But what can I do? The flesh is weak.

review/summary: Good for high temperature cooking
review/text: One of our regular Tofu recipes calls for cooking the Tofu in very hot oil. One characteristic of this product comes from the language on the bottle: "This light, delicate oil seals in the flavors of meat & poultry at high temperatures. . ." I have gone through almost one complete bottle (only 8.45 ounces per bottle), and am very satisfied. Despite using it for higher temperature cooking, it doesn't smoke and it sustains sauteeing quite well.<br /><br />I have only been using this for a couple months, but it has become a component in my kitchen that I want to retain over time. So, as this bottle is emptying, it's time for me to purchase another and keep this an active part of my cooking regime.

review/summary: Demi Glac&eacute; Gold
review/text: My husband wanted to make a peppercorn sauce to go with our steaks.  We used a recipe from a 5 star restaurant in New York.  When we found this recipe, the chef talked about how he used the product Demi Glac&eacute; Gold instead of making his own demi glac&eacute;.  When I looked up how to make my own demi glac&eacute;, I realized I would never take the time to do this.  We ordered the Demi Glac&eacute; Gold and followed the peppercorn recipe.  It was so easy and the best peppercorn sauce I've ever had.  I've also added this product to a beef stroganoff that we love.  I would like to purchase this product in a larger container but haven't found out how long it lasts once opened or if you can freeze it.

review/text: I can't eat full on tomato soups that often, as I flush and get itchy, but sometimes, it's worth the suffering for a nice bowl of tomato bisque--one of my all time fave soups, particularly if made fresh.<br /><br />I really like Amy's lower sodium version. It has bits of tomato, not tasteless like some lower salt soups can be, very tomatoey, and with some whole grain pasta tossed in for "bite" and a sprinkle of parmesan, it's a complete lunch. Add a salad or side of veggies and it's supper.<br /><br />If you like  a creamier bisque, it's real easy to mix in one or two tablespoons of half-n-half and stir (not while bubbling, though). Granted, that makes it a less healthful option, but sometimes, I have a craving for a really creamy bisque. That does it for me.<br /><br />I may only be able to have tomato bisque a couple times a year due to my sensitivity, but this one satisfies.

review/summary: Absolutely Love It ! !
review/text: When I was a kid I used to get a brand of beef jerky that doesn't exist anymore and I absolutely loved it to death (well, not really to death, but...).  I have tried so many different brands of jerky and have not really found a good substitute to that old brand until a month or so ago I found THIS brand in a small grocery store in the middle of nowhere U.S.A. and bought it on a whim.  I couldn't contain myself because I had FINALLY found a substitute to that old brand, and I just had to get more of it and fast.  So I came online to find it and Amazon.com had it so I ordered a WHOLE case.  It got here in great time and was packaged very well.  I now have a standing order to receive this product every so often and am loving snack time again.<br /><br />This is not the kind of Jerky that makes you feel like you just ripped a hunk of meat off a dead cow, it's been ground up and processed and then made into strips, but that's the kind I LOVE.  Thank you Amazon, and thank you Lowery's!<br /><br />Signed by a VERY satisfied customer.

review/summary: Occasionally moldy but otherwise good
review/text: We used to buy the canisters of these until they disappeared from retail stores.  They were addicting but later became hit-and-miss.  Some was tender and fresh, while some was too stale or smoky-tasting and would get left unfinished.  The expiration dates were at least 6 months ahead, so that wasn't the problem.<br /><br />Anyway, we recently ordered the bags and were pleasantly surprised.  They're not quite as tender and tasty as the first canisters we opened years ago, but they're worth the price.  The only problem we've had is that out of 6 shipments and 72 bags, 4 bags contained mold -- from 3 different shipments.  Three bags had just a couple spots of mold but were a little stale and tasted funny.  The fourth bag had about half the surface area of the jerky covered in white mold, and the smell was pretty bad.  We're still eating more but checking for mold first -- not something we should have to do.<br /><br />As someone else mentioned, the Amazon's product photo and nutrition information are old.  The bag now advertises 16 grams of protein, not 21.  Fat content is increased from 10 g to 14.

review/text: In these tough economic times, we long for a bygone era when things were easy.  Receiving this instantly transported me to my grade-school cafeteria.  I had no bills to bay.  I had no worries and I had Lowerys Beef Jerky.  I was 5 again for just a moment.  The recipe is the same.  The only thing that has changed is the packaging.  I remember each stick having it's own plastic packaging and there being an indian on the front of the tube that held all of the packages.

review/text: This product was okay; in other words, it was edible. It was very reasonably priced. However, it was very greasy. I don't care for greasy foods.

However, I won't be purchasing it for personal consumption in the future.

review/summary: High fat jerky
review/text: I got a bag of jerky at the drug store a few weeks ago because it was on sale and I wanted a low-fat, low-carb, high-protein snack.  It was pretty good but a bit expensive so I decided to get some at amazon.com with a subscribe and save deal.<br /><br />Sad to say, I shopped based on price because I thought jerky was jerky.  That was a mistake.<br /><br />This Lawry's jerky is tender and easy to chew but the fat content is almost as high as the protein content.  This is low-budget, low-quality jerky.  My kids like it but I would prefer to pay a little extra and get them healthier stuff.<br /><br />I canceled the subscribe and save.  I will look for something different.

It reminds me of the "parts is parts" commercial that used to run on TV about all the bad pieces being pressed together to make a totally unpalatable piece of food.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: OMG, these Lowrey's Jerky Treats are sooooo YUMMY! I've been addicted to these since my high school days in the mid 80's when they used to make them so dry that they about broke your jawbone. So much better these days with the same taste but not so dried out like dog treats. But, they seem to be really hard to find until I found them months ago at our local grocery store but others must have liked them as much as we do that they instantly sold out. They restocked them and days later they were gone once again. Argh! So I went onto their website where they directed me to Amazon where I ended up buying 2 sets (16) canisters so we'll have some for months to come. I just hope Amazon continues to carry these since we can't find these anywhere anymore. Thank Heaven for Amazon! : )

review/summary: Jerky-esque.....
review/text: I can only call this stuff "jerky-esque," because it is really not like any "real" jerky that I've ever had before. Easy to bite through and chew, but extremely processed and pressed into form. As alluded to in another review, the look and texture of the these is very reminiscent of jerky-treats that are made for dogs. Overall, I'd give the texture 2.5-3 stars....different...a bit odd...ok, but not really "meaty."<br /><br />Taste, I'd give 2 stars. They rate as edible, but certainly not good. Eating a full serving at one time tends to feel like a chore, so that should tell you right there that these things aren't too great. Not horrible, but not something I'd prefer to eat...<br /><br />Value. Decent, but in a subjective sense. You get a lot of product for the price....which is great if you happen to like them....but nothing to crow about if you don't....

review/text: This was actually a little nasty.  I love beef jerky.  When I purchased this I thought: I like cheap jerky from Walmart, so how bad could it be?  It actually pretty bad.  It may be cheap, but still not worth it.  Put a few dollars with it and buy a different brand that tastes a little better.<br /><br />(This stuff is also full of MSG and gave me a headache after an ounce of it.  Other jerky might have MSG too, but this brand's amount was more noticeable to me.)

review/summary: Very good, very crunchy cereal
review/text: I've had Kashi cereals in the past and this was certainly the crunchiest of them all. Kashi managed to perfectly sweeten this cereal just the way I like and I found this cereal to be extremely filling. When I eat other brands as a meal I normally feel like I need to eat two bowls, but with Kashi GOLEAN Crunch! I was very satisfied with less than a bowlful. I find this cereal is best when I let it sit in the bowl of milk for about 5 minutes before eating it to soften the crunchiness a bit. The grains were full size and easily identifiable in each cluster.

review/summary: This cereal is a life saver!
review/text: I had to start eating more healthy and after years of eating poorly, it's just not easy to change. I had to learn to add more protein and fiber into my diet but watch the calories and fat. So bacon and sausage for protein at breakfast was totally off the table. Finding a GOOD tasting cereal that gave a significant amount of protein wasn't easy. Then add to that one with good fiber content too! And lets not forget the most important fact....I had to like it! Eating healthy is NOT easy! You need to do your research! I finally found Kashi Go Lean, Honey Almond after 6 months. At the store near me, they don't keep it in the cereal section so I just happened to see it off in the corner one day and gave it a look. I thought I was going to HATE it so it sat in the cabinet for a couple of weeks.....but was I surprised when I finally had some! It has the right amount of sweet and a one cup portion is so filling! I'm fulfilling my protein and fiber requirements and it doesn't even have to hurt! It also makes an awesome snack too....and its good for me!<br /><br />I'm currently trying to get my grandchildren to eat more healthy too before its too late. (2 yr old and 4 yr old boys) This cereal is awesome mixed with some oatmeal and they love it. They also love snacking on it. I also see a big difference after taking them off those sugar charged breakfast cereals they used to eat.<br /><br />Honestly, Kashi Go Lean saved my life. With it's help I've lost 80 pounds and am near my goal weight. It helps my sweet tooth and the fiber helps in ways we all know! Thank you Kashi!

review/summary: Keeps the Hunger away for up to 6 hours!
review/text: I've been hooked on this cereal ever since my girlfriend, now wife, introduced me to it. We now eat it every morning (a little less than a cup) with a quarter apple and half an organic banana each, mixed with Vanilla Soymilk and topped with just a table spoon of a chocolate-flake cereal and it keeps us full from 6:30 AM to about Noon with no urge to snack (if we keep ourselves hydrated). With two people we go through a box every four to five days, about 9-10 servings. We even eat it on weekends, too, and I'm happy with the price and the convenience of subscribe & save. One less thing to worry about and our grocery store sells it for the equivalent of seventy cents more per four-pack so I'm happy with the price too. Occasionally my wife has complained about it being too crunchy and too hard on the roof of her mouth, but that only seems to have been a problem occasionally. The other nice thing about this cereal is that it takes quite a while (hours) to get mushy in case you forgot about it after already mixing it with milk. Great value, great taste, great nutrition, and it keeps me away from mid-morning snacks. Great value for the money!
