review/text: Fit Fruit and Veg. wash, is a wonderful product...It washes off all the wax and cleans the vegetables so well I would recommend to everyone. I have always purchased it at my local Wal-mart but in the last couple months all of a sudden wal-mart has stopped carrying it. so I looked it up on Amazon.com . Kathi D. in Georgetown TX

review/summary: Long time Fit user says thumbs up
review/text: About ten years ago P&G developed Fit to clean fruits and vegtables. It was sold in many stores and that was my first source.<br /><br />Sine P&G is noted for their R&D, I have to believe that the product is effective and safe. Our family uses Fit to clean all of our produce. It does get the dirt off and yes you can see the junk in the bottom of the bowl.<br /><br />About six years ago I started to buy Fit directly from the company that acquired the brand, and more recently through Amazon. I am convinced that it works and leaves no noticeable taste or residue.

review/text: Don't use this product if you want the added benefit of "better living through chemistry"! There are a lot of toxic herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides, being fogged and sprayed, on your produce in the field where it is then harvested and BAGGED or BOXED (also IN THE FIELD) and sent to your grocer. The rare cases when it is RINSED you often get the added artificial dyes and waxes added in the next step to make them LOOK better on the shelf. Don't soak and wash away all the wonderful "-cide effects" that may be available when these chemicals are added to Mother Nature. Seriously, though, this package of products is the most comprehensive (and natural) approach to removing what you never intended to buy and eat!

review/summary: Don't get it yet
review/text: I don't get the hype around this product, at least not yet.  I bought it mainly because I wanted my child to eat apples without taking the skin off and I wanted the skin of the apples to be wax free. After following the instructions, I did not find the skin on my apples any less waxy than before washing it with this soap. Maybe it is supposed to look and feel exactly the same even without the wax off, but for some reason I always thought that once you got rid of the wax, you were not supposed to have this shiny and gliding surface where you can see droplets of water stuck to the apple. Anyway, I will keep using it since I have so much of it, but I don't think I will be buying more of it until I see some definitive proof that it works.

Well, I just got home after a few weeks only to find out that he has been enjoying gummy worms, but not the sour ones I thought I ordered for him! The photo is WRONG. These are NOT sour worms. These are just the plain assorted flavor. Kinda bummed as I really wanted the sour ones, but they are tasty still and they are fresh.

review/summary: Versatile and an All-Around Winner
review/text: This is an amazing product. I first bought it as a soup base, but then I discovered that it doubles as a thickener (wheat flour and corn starch). Now when I re-hydrate/cook TVP meat imitations over a saucepan, I add this to the cook water to create a gravy. When my local store stopped carrying this, I ran here and bought a case.

review/summary: Good product, shipping disaster
review/text: I ordered Osem Vegtable Soup Mix as an inexpensive replacement for the pricey vegetable soup mix packets from the grocery store that I normally use for Spinach Dip. As such, being yellow in color rather than brown, it has a different appearance than expected. [The picture on the label shows a brownish, beef-like broth, but that is not how it looks.] It also lacks the amount of dehydrated vegetables visible in the brands of instant vegetable soup I am familiar with. And yet the flavor is similar enough that it did work "okay" in the dips.<br /><br />The unexpected, bigger benefit, has been its use in gravies, cream sauces and homemade cream soups. It's become a very handy item to have around, adding a little "something extra" to the flavor of these other recipes. And if you happen to run out of milk to use in one of these you can still pull off a tasty cream sauce or soup since it is met to be made with just water.<br /><br />I opted for the "subscription" ordering system, scheduling a delivery of six containers every six months. The first time a shipment arrived, all was well. However, the second time, it was awful. Thank God the 6 containers were packed inside of a plastic bag, because the tops had separated in all but two of them. The whole red top part of each container had come off the yellow base. The interior foil seals, that line the containers at the top had also pulled loose. If not for the bag, the soup mix would have been all over the inside of the box.<br /><br />When I signed into my Amazon account to look up the phone number to complain, I was presented with a question regarding customer satisfaction with the shipping on the order. So I filled out the form submit, explaining what a mess that shipment had been. I have never received a reply of any kind. Either no one reads the information they solicit from customers or they don't care.<br /><br />That leaves me with a four star product [because it does not look like the beef broth appearance as shown on the label] and one star shipping experience, so I gave it a three star rating. I am undecided as to whether to cancel the subscription or not. The product is not quite what I expected and wanted for spinach dip use, but it has some other uses I had not anticipated that are worthwhile in their own way.  I had one good shipping experience and one that amounted to a lot of wasted product and no way to know what the norm is. If anyone else reviews this soup mix, I hope you'll comment on the condition it arrived in.

review/summary: Scorpion Sucker---Have people watch you and go "what?"
review/text: I'm arachnophobic... with an exception of scorpions it seems. Just stating.<br /><br />There is a dense layer of flavored candy surrounding the scorpion which helps you build up to the big moment your tongue brushes a pincer or, worse, its body. After this encounter, you'll want to flip it around and start on an area where the scorpion is not. This is how it was for me. It was about 20 minutes later that I was able to hold the whole scorpion in my hand. 20 minutes later inside of a pizza parlor with an audience of 3 curious customers.<br /><br />As I've stated before in another review, the reason we are so appalled by eating insects is not the taste; it's the fact that you're eating an insect--something you've spent the majority of your lifetime chasing and killing--and it's extremely difficult to fathom putting something you have that sort of relationship with in your mouth as food no matter how you dress it up.<br /><br />The flavor of the scorpion is a bit nutty, but the texture kind of reminds me of chewing on a fingernail... not that I ever have. But I like it. This is somewhat of an acquired taste. If you don't like it the first time, there's a large chance you never will. Don't force it or you will vomit. Either way, these are great for pranks, gag gifs, icebreakers, thrill-seekers and drawing that much needed attention to yourself in public.

As far as the mint filling, it adds some more sweetness to the Chocolate, but at the same time the mint is very refreshing. Perfect to have after dinner or as a dessert.<br /><br />If you like Mint Chocolate, you might also want to try the After Eight Mint Chocolate. they are very good too. Also try the Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark Chocolate which is kind of interesting taste (a combination of chocolate/dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust).<br /><br />Sidarta Tanu

review/text: Our family thinks this is a great jerky, and the jar didn't last long at our home at all.  Not sure what a previous reviewer thought when they bought this and commented that it was like 'shoe leather' but have they had jerky before?  Jerky is dried meat, so it isn't going to fall off the bone in your mouth people.  This had a wonderful flavor, and would be great for long trips or hikes.  The kids like taking some for snack time even.  We will definitely be buying more, thank you Amazon!

review/summary: Good part- you get a lot.  Bad part  - you get a lot.
review/text: Yeah, these are definitely not what I was expecting with jerky.  Hard , flat circles of some sort of flavored processed meat.  I read the reviews and thought I really loved peppered jerky so I know I will like them.  Then I got them and they are pretty tough about like putting a piece of thick plastic in your mouth.  You chew on it for a while and it loosens up and the peppered does have some flavor, but they get old pretty fast.  By about the 3rd day I was going to the store to get some real jerky.  I do not like to be wasteful but these are pretty bad.  I give it three stars as you do get a lot for the price and there is some flavor if you are willing to suffer through the hard blandness until you soften it up.  I would never order these again.

review/summary: Jack Links Jerky Medallions
review/text: These are great.  I first discovered the medallion style  jerky while traveling.  I liked the shape and texture (as well as the taste).  On the road they were 25 cents a piece (4/dollar), so getting 80 of them for under 13 bucks is a great deal.  I use the scheduled shipping from Amazon because I never run out of these and it saves me $$.  I like both the Teriyaki and the Spicy versions, but my wife finds the Spicy too hot for her so I mostly get the Teriyaki.  Always fresh I love my medallions.

review/text: Call me a fool, but when I ordered Jack Link's Smokehouse Beef Jerky Medallions, I thought I was getting beef jerky, not frisbees. These seemed more like doggy snacks than real beef jerky.  Having eaten many Jack Link's products before, I expected more of the same good quality snacks but this was not one of them.  These are made from chopped bits of beef which are then formed into discs. Consequently, the resulting product is tough and plastic-like, for want of a better word. I imagine dogs would enjoy them a great deal.<br /><br />Two stars for the pleasing peppery flavor and the value. Zero stars for the consistency.

review/text: I like how the product comes sealed in a separate bag inside the canister.  This ensures freshness until you decide you are ready to open the contents and share/sell.  I buy for personal consumption for the office and home.  The supplied serving tongs are nice especially in these days of added viruses and germs.  Even though the medallions are a bit tough at first, breaking or cutting in smaller pieces (quartered) and sucking on them makes chewing easier.  After a while, your jaw gets acclimated to the hardness of the texture.  This is why I give them 4 stars.  Taste is incredible.  I would buy more for sure.  Eric D., Wanamingo, MN

Got to looking and found mold growing on some of the medallions.  I couldn't find an expiration date on the package, but I'm guessing it was some time during WWII.  I thought the whole point of beef jerky was to preserve the beef.  I'm going to try to post a picture to the item page.  I contacted customer service and they're sending out a replacement... hopefully it'll be less fuzzy.  Tried the teriyaki flavor and they're ok... nothing to write home about though.

review/text: I love beef jerky, especially the chewy type.  I read the reviews that this particular kind tastes like leather and is rubbery.  I tried it anyway, since the price is much lower than the other beef jerky types.  My first impression of the medallions is that it is very thin.  It is somewhat rubbery.  It is also very hot. I didn't like it at first, but the taste grew on me.  I actually loved it now.  I would take a scissor and cut the medallions into strips and then slowly taste and savor each one.  The longer I chew, the more flavor I taste.  There is a good portion in the container too.

I will just make sure to look at the brand at the gas station for my next purchase so I can get the dry type beef jerky.

review/summary: Rancid
review/text: I bought this stuff after reading the reviews.  Normally, I don't waste my money on store bought jerky since the quality is so poor.  But, I decided to give this a try.  Big mistake!  Although it did come in a separate, sealed bag, after opening, it started turning rancid within the first week.  I couldn't find an expiration date on it, so I don't know if it was old when it was purchased, or close to the expiration date.  It tasted fine when we first opened it, but it went bad fast.<br />I wouldn't waste my money on this again.

review/text: I love jack link beef jerky especially the peppered flavor one. here I was hoping I would get  a great tasting beef jerky from Jack link. I'm in for a surprise, I don't know about the people who gave this product a 5 star but to me this deserve a -1. First, there is no taste or flavor to this thing not even with a peppered one. second, it's hard like plastic ( i thought i was chewing on plastic). don't get me wrong I love jack link beef jerky but this thing is meant for animal, to be honest I'm not even sure any dog would want this.

review/summary: Jack Link's Jerky Medallions, Hot
review/text: I like how the product comes sealed in a separate bag inside the canister.  This ensures freshness until you decide you are ready to open the contents and share/sell.  I buy for personal consumption for the office and home.  The supplied serving tongs are nice especially in these days of added viruses and germs.  Even though the medallions are a bit tough at first, breaking or cutting in smaller pieces (quartered) and sucking on them makes chewing easier.  After a while, your jaw gets acclimated to the hardness of the texture.  This is why I give them 4 stars.  Taste is incredible.  I would buy more for sure.  Eric D., Wanamingo, MN

review/text: I had never heard of Yellow Label. I was looking for Lipton Loose Leaf, which is difficult to find in markets. Ordered this from (fulfilled by) Amazon to check it out. It is a 'gunpowder' style and tastes better than regular Lipton Loose. A smaller gunpowder than you find in gourmet tea stores, but an excellent tea at a reasonable price.

review/summary: Very potent
review/text: First time I brewed it, I measure the amount of tea by guessing from the way I measure green tea. The result was way too strong tea that stained the inside of my white cup. After a bit of experiment, I ended up with microscopic amount of tea per cup. If I could measure it on my scale, it'll be like less than 0.1gram. Compare to this, I use 0.5 gram of green tea per 8oz cup. I think this one pound box will last for years to come.<br />The taste is nothing fancy but what a good tea is supposed to taste like, then again I'm not a gourmet drinker, otherwise I'll be reviewing something else with higher price. It's good enough for me for every day use.<br />The tea in the dry state looks like round pellet, which is easier to control the amount when you scoop up.<br />I'd recommend this to anyone specially who hasn't tried loose tea in a while. I also recommend Finum brewing basket to go with this. Little things that make your life a bit more enjoyable.

review/text: Lipton Yellow Label tea is very concentrated -- you don't have to use a large quantity to get excellent flavor. This makes for a good money value, as you extract maximum taste from small proportions of leaves. This version of Lipton tea reminds me of how Lipton's used to taste -- a good , traditional,  Pekoe flavor. In recent years, I feel Lipton has declined in quality in their bagged tea, but this loose Lipton's is much closer to the "good old days." <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTRGAQ">Lipton Yellow Label Loose Tea, 32-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: Thin, delicate strands of the finest Italian pasta!
review/text: RECENTLY (Dec 09) found a superior pasta: La Porta! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GJL7QO">La Porta Spighetti, 1.1 Pound Bags (Pack of 8)</a>. It costs about the same, but is incomparably better than any other Amazon carries. Try it!! You WILL be spoiled!!<br /><br />This is #10 pasta that cooks in 5 or 6 minutes, or 4 minutes if using for a baked recipe. The origins of this type of pasta are to be sought in the Ligurian territories, in the province of Genoa, in Ciociara, and in the Naples area of Italy. Fedelini is a long thin spaghetti-like pasta, similar to Angel Hair. The best condiments for this pasta are BUTTER based sauces, such as butter and cheese, or melted butter with sage and cheese. Excellent also with egg or fresh raw tomato sauces. Another way to eat Fedelini is in a light broth. In the Naples area, Fedelini is used for preparing oven cooked "Pasticci," (or Pastiche, or Pasticcio.) The word literally means "a medley or potpourri or m&eacute;lange" and refers to a lasagne-like casserole composed of various ingredients (depending of the Region) that is baked and served in firm slices. (recipe follows)<br /><br />PASTICCIO<br /><br />The Pasticcio is made in four stages: Sauce (Meat or White), cook pasta (firm!), assemble, and bake. Its time consuming if you try to do it all in one day and it takes lots of pots. I usually make the sauce either a day or two prior to baking the casserole - or even a week a two ahead and freeze it until needed. Then combine all ingredients, add pats of butter to top, and bake at 350 degrees for ABOUT an hour and a half. When the top is puffed and golden it is done (Watch It!) and then must REST for an hour or two prior to cutting in squares and serving. You will need a deep pan like a lasagna pan for baking the pasticcio.<br /><br />Main Ingredients:<br />1 lb. Fedelini<br />1/2 lb. Grated Parmagiano Reggiano Cheese (Imported Italian)<br />1/2 lb. Grated Italian Romano Cheese (or Greek Mizithra Cheese)<br />Grated fresh nutmeg to taste<br />6 eggs<br />salt to taste (start with 1/2 tsp since the cheeses are salty)<br />2 tbsp. unsalted butter for greasing baking pan<br /><br />MEAT SAUCE:<br />One batch Marinara Sauce with Meat<br /><br />WHITE SAUCE:<br />6 heaping tbsp. flour<br />6 tbsp. unsalted butter<br />3 cups 2% milk<br />white pepper to taste<br />grated nutmeg to taste<br />6 slightly beaten eggs (in a bowl)<br />half cube unsalted butter in cubes (for top)<br /><br />If you want a thicker topping, you can increase flour and butter to 8 tablespoons each and add 4 cups of milk for the white sauce. Rest of instructions would be the same.<br /><br />Boil Fedelini in salted water for 4 minutes, drain and return to pot, with heat OFF. Sprinkle in two grated cheeses to taste, about 3/4 of a cup of each cheese. Grate nutmeg to taste into pot and stir all with wooden spoon. Crack eggs into pot quickly one at a time and stir in after each addition. Macaroni will be warm and eggs will seem to cook somewhat but don't worry about it.<br /><br />Assembly of Pasticcio:<br /><br />Heat sauce. Butter baking pan and lay in a couple of large spoonfuls of the sauce. Then take half of the pasta mixture and layer on top of the sauce pressing it down into sauce, and adding sprinklings of both types of grated cheese. REPEAT process, making three or four layers of Fedelini. Finally, layer rest of sauce and sprinkle rest of the cheese on top. Smooth with spoon. Add pats of butter to top.<br /><br />At this point, pan can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for baking the next day. Casserole should be removed from the refrigerator about an hour and a half prior to baking, so it can come to room temperature.<br /><br />White Sauce Preparation and Baking:<br /><br />Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br /><br />Melt butter in 3 quart heavy stainless steel saucepan. Add flour and mix together with butter using a wire whisk in order to make a rue. Cook for a few minutes over medium high heat to make sure flour loses it's raw taste. (Flour will brown slightly.) While stirring, slowly add milk, and keep stirring so no lumps will form. Still stirring, and add spices. Stir until mixture comes to a full rolling boil. (Must stay on top of this, stirring, so sauce will not burn on the bottom.) Remove from heat.<br /><br />In the bowl with the slightly beaten eggs, begin slowly adding a spoonful of the white sauce in order to temper the eggs, mixing well. Keep adding white sauce, a spoon at a time, and stirring until you have added about a cup of white sauce. Then return all of this mixture into the rest of the white sauce, stirring all the while, to make a smooth sauce before turning on the heat. Heat very briefly and stir until thick and smooth. Remove from heat.<br /><br />(Assemble casserole as above.)<br /><br />Place in preheated oven and bake for about an hour and a half, depending on oven. Keep checking! Pasticcio is done when it is puffed and golden. Cool for 1 hour, slice in squares, remove with a spatula and serve. Or cover with foil and cut a little later. Can wait for an hour or two prior to serving.

review/text: I really enjoy this wine!  I was a little skeptical about it at first because it is so inexpensive, but I tried it at a wine tasting and I got hooked!  It has a wonderful favor and it actually has a taste of red velvet.  This is a great wine for any occasion, but especially for the holidays.  And even though it has the taste of red velvet, its not a sweet wine like a port.  I've also seen this wine available at BevMo, Costco, Bed Bath & Beyond and World Market.  Cheers!

review/summary: Our dog loves them, but the aftermath isn't pretty!
review/text: We have a large mixed-breed dog who loves to chew. Her ability to demolish toys is almost comical, so we are always looking for a way to entertain/occupy her that isn't going to drive us into bankruptcy.<br /><br />She loves her Kong, but I hate cleaning it after it has had peanut butter in it. So, when I saw these I thought they would be a perfect solution! Something she would have to put a little work into that wouldn't result in a big mess to clean up afterward.<br /><br />I was right...sort of. She loves them. They only keep her occupied for about 10 minutes but that's more than can be said for most of her toys. However, about an hour after she has one she gets the worst gas she has ever had. I'm not talking the occasional smelly fart. Last night I went upstairs and thought something had died in my bedroom because the smell was so terrible. It took me 15 minutes to realize the smell was coming from the dog and wasn't going away. I can only imagine the discomfort she must be in to be producing that much gas.<br /><br />Unfortunately as much as our dog enjoys them, I'm fairly certain they don't like her and I don't think I can handle the resulting gas storm.

review/text: The concept is a good one. Stuff a treat into a rubber toy, and let the dog figure out how to get to the prize. Should keep Fido busy for hours unless like our dogs he loses patience and gives up. After having to remove the Ziggies ourselves most of the time, we've given up and now give the remaining Ziggies to one of our dogs as a snack.<br /><br />Good: Made in the USA. Piper likes them. Doesn't make our dogs sick. Soft  enough for a dog with four missing teeth like our Piper. NO meat-by-products<br /><br />Not so good: First two ingredients are ground wheat and gelatinized wheat starch. However, there is chicken meal in there too.<br /><br />Finally - As a treat choice this isn't bad because there are far worse choices out there. As entertainment paired with a Kong, it hasn't worked too well for us. It might work for you.

review/summary: Not a good fit for my dog
review/text: To put it simply, my dog gives up too easy. I bought a package of these thinking it would be easier and less messy than filling the Kong with a food/peanut butter mix and freezing it. Little did I know that my options with these Ziggies were either too easy or too difficult for my dog. If I inserted it into the Kong with just a little bit sticking out she would get the whole thing out very easily and it would be gone in 2-3 minutes. This totally negates the concept of it occupying her over time. Whoever said that a dog won't give up on food until it gets it never met my lab. If I wedged the Ziggie all the way inside the Kong she would give up after trying for 5-10 minutes and walk away from it leaving me to pry it out with a knife. After two tried I ended up feeding the rest of them to her as treats. She enjoyed them very much but the price point is too high to use them in that capacity. Not all dogs are the same and others will probably have more favorable results but I did not.

review/summary: Not worth it
review/text: I bought these as an easy solution to filling the kong toy.  I typically fill the kong with chicken & peanut butter but figured I can save some time cooking chicken with this product.<br /><br />It fit really snugly in the kong toy. Maybe I bought the wrong size?  The package says it fits medium and large kong toy (I have a medium). My dog was only able to eat the tip of the treat and could not get the treat inside the kong.  Using a knife, I managed to wedge it out and gave the rest of the treat (not in the kong) to my dog.<br /><br />A few hours later...my dog had smelly gas and eventually, my dog had diarrhea...<br /><br />I decided not to feed the rest of the package to my dog but did not throw out the package.  A few weeks later, my husband, not knowing the product caused stomach upset in our poor dog, decided to feed the Ziggie to our dog.  Our dog is currently being crate-trained (only a 3 hours a day when we are out).  Lets just say, she had diarrhea inside her crate.  After a few hours of cleaning, bathing, and throwing away a new dog bed and blanket, I'm writing this review.<br /><br />Now, granted, there is a chance that it may have been something else that caused her stomach upset (I feed her premium dog food and limit her treats, and never give her table scraps)BUT she only had the issue the two times we gave her this treat. I'm not going to risk a third time.

review/summary: Not totally pleased
review/text: When I bought these treats for my dog I was hoping for, as most people are, an easy and mess free way to give my dog his/her Kong toy. That is exactly what I got.. kind of.<br /><br />Yes, my dog does love the taste of these treats, and they fit well inside my large Kong. The problem is that the treat either ends up stuck inside the Kong, inaccessible to the dog, or the dog pulls the entire treat out at once and eats it.<br /><br />I'm not totally satisfied with this product. It keeps my dog entertained for a little while but this treat doesn't fully work as intended. I will not buy this product again.

review/summary: Sitting here feeling grateful
review/text: I felt compelled to write my very first Amazon review as a result of sitting here, getting my work done, observing my puppy run back and forth across the room with a Ziggie-stuffed Kong in his mouth.  I am currently overseas and do not have access to many dog treats, but I happened to bring a bag of these and am so grateful that I did.  My 11-month old puppy is unbelievably food-motivated and perseverant, and this has kept him busy for 1-2 hours on several occasions.  Because we have a limited supply, I had to figure out ways to ration the Ziggies, so I've actually cut them into four pieces, and give him a fourth every week or so when he's got more energy than a walk and fetch session will take care of.  I put peanut butter on the sides and then stuff the piece as far into the Kong as it will go, to the point where I struggle to get it out even with a tool (chopstick!).  Then I hide the Kong, so he needs to spend time tracking it down, and then he lies there working it for OVER AN HOUR.  He'll sometimes stop to nap while working on it, then wake up to continue, with not a single concern for what I might be doing during that time.  For dogs who will not give up pursuing even the smallest morsel of food, the 1/4th Ziggie + Kong combination is just brilliant.  Don't get overzealous though and break it up any further; I tried to cut it into fifths and wasted one whole Ziggie as a result.  I think that I'll continue to only give him a fourth even when we return to the States because he can pull the full ones out in just a couple minutes, and this method costs a fourth the price.<br /><br />Puppy just stopped for a water break, and now he's back to work!  =)

review/summary: My dogs enjoy these!
review/text: I give these to my dogs about twice a month. They really enjoy them and it entertains them for awhile. For added enjoyment, I also put some peanut butter in the kong. My (smart) dog is done with it in about 10 minutes, but it takes my other dog (not too bright) awhile for her to finish it.<br />I like to use these on rainy days or days when I am super busy and we don't make it to the dog park.

review/summary: Doggie Approved
review/text: My dog seems to really like these. I'm sure they're not the healthiest dog treat out there, but hey we all splurge sometimes. For some reason he won't eat the KONG while we're away from home, at work. But once we're home and he's had his walk he usually goes and finds his KONG and carries it out to the mat at the front door to enjoy his treat! I sometimes add peanut butter to it or plain yogurt. He digs it, the only problem is my dog gives up too easy. If the Ziggie breaks off leaving half of it too far for him to reach it, he's over it. He'll just leave it there, leaving me to have to dig it out for him later.

review/text: Ordered these and expecting the same type of dried strawberries found in grocery stores, but the seller should have labeled the item as candied strawberries instead of calling it dried strawberries. These are VERY sweet and come in bright red nugget-sized pieces - not at all as pictured. Also, no ingredients are listed on the package. Obviously besides being made of strawberries and sugar, there is no way of knowing whether there are other ingredients used (additives and/or preservatives). So disappointed.

review/text: First, let me say that I'm new to drinking tea.  I decided to purchase this tea in order to sample the different types of tea that Ahmad offered.  Having little exposure to tea, they were good with a slight bitter aftertaste.  I thought this was common until my sampler pack from Two Leaves and a Bud came in - Two Leaves and a Bud has no bitter after taste and is very smooth.  Now, I drink the Ahmad teas if I don't have any Two Leaves tea remaining.  This is decent tea but not compared with the higher quality teas out there.

I've been drinking Gloria Jean's Capuccino (middle brew button) and Coffee Barista's Columbian.  They are excellent!  I like a strong cup of Joe but not bitter and these 3 are great!  You pay a little more for the Starbuck-s K-cups however, I feel it's worth it.  I'll pay just about any price for a "GOOD" cup of Joe.  People, stop your whining and enjoy your coffee -

If you are looking for a good K-Cup to start your morning, this coffee will work just fine.  At times, it feels a bit acidic (more so than other brands), so I would recommend some form of creamer here.  For whatever reason, these K-Cups do NOT taste quite as good as the bean version you can buy in stores.<br /><br />It seems that Amazon is now offering a decent price on these K-Cups, but you may be able to find them elsewhere for cheaper.

review/summary: OK, but just a "cup of coffee"
review/text: A cup of store-brewed Starbucks Breakfast Blend has always been my favorite cup of coffee. Even when I brewed (regular brewing) it at home I couldn't get the quite same taste, but I could get close enough. Now that I have a Keurig brewer, I was excited to finally see Starbucks BB k-cups.... but, ouch, the price.<br /><br />For comparison, with my Keurig brewer, right now I like Tully's Extra Bold Breakfast Blend and Tully's Extra Bold Kona Blend, both of which I brew on the 2nd cup size (~7oz).  I've liked some other k-cups in the past, but they haven't been available on Keurig's site for a while.<br /><br />Anyway, I finally gave in and bought the Starbucks Breakfast (and House) Blend k-cups (from Keurig's site). Neither is like getting the same cup at Starbucks. I realize it can't be exactly the same, k-cup vs large brew. The Breakfast Blend k-cup is ok, I guess.  But it just doesn't have any of the complexity you taste in a cup from Starbucks. It's just "a cup of coffee".  I brew it on the 2nd (~7 oz) cup size on my brewer... smaller is too strong/bitter and larger is too watery.  To me, it's definitely not worth spending more on the Starbucks branded k-cups since I don't feel like I am getting anything close to the store brewed cup. Actually, I don't even like it as much as the Tully's BB mentioned above, so wouldn't buy the Starbucks BB even if it was the same price. Bummer.<br /><br />(FYI - For me, the Starbucks House Blend is undrinkable - it's too bitter (and I've tried brewing 3 different sizes, from smallest to travel mug).  It's just bitter regardless, with no underlying complexity of flavor. )<br /><br />Hope this helps someone, since obviously taste is very subjective!<br />c-

review/text: I follow a Paleo lifestyle which means potato chips are not in my diet. I bought these as an alternative and they are sooo yummy. I feel in love with them immediately. They are a little pricey compared to regular chips but so much healthier for you.

review/summary: Very tasty for a jar sauce, not overly sweet
review/text: I can only assume that the previous review of this sauce was composed after adding some high-fructose crack to the mixture. Not overly sweet at all - I'd call it sweet only inasmuch as tomatoes are sweet, and this is a tomato sauce. A very tasty, and quite savory one. In short, if you like mushrooms and tomatoes but can't be bothered to make your own sauce, you could do a lot worse.

review/summary: Way too sweet!!
review/text: Got this @ Walmart for like $5. Saw the list of things in it and was really excited.<br /><br />But way too sweet!! I even tried to tone it down by using another sauce and nope, overpowered it! I used Emeril's roasted red pepper to try to tone it down. I went 25% of the Mezzetta sauce to 75% of the Emeril sauce and still overpowered it.<br /><br />I guess if you like it sweet, then this might be up your alley. But me, i'm actually thowing away the last quarter of the bottle of this that I have.<br /><br />After having Gia Russa, cheap brands like Ragu and Prego don't stand a chance.

review/summary: Quick Recovery!
review/text: I ordered Monin Lemon Grass Syrup for a recipe I was making for a party, and I was in a crunch. I definitely needed the product on a specific date, so I ordered well in advance. Unfortunately, due to some problems with the shipping company, my package (and many others) was damaged and the seller was never notified about my order specifically (though she knew some packages were damaged, she wasn't aware that my syrup was one of those). When I emailed her to find out where in the shipping process my syrup was, she realized immediately that it was one of the damaged packages and sent a new syrup by air overnight. In the end, I received the syrup right on time, and the recipe was delicious.<br /><br />What stood out to me was the level of care and concern the seller had for me. She went out of her way to make sure I got my syrup on time, even though it wasn't her fault I hadn't received it. When I did receive my syrup, it was packaged carefully to prevent breaking. My guess is that the same care was taken the first time, but accidents happen sometimes!<br /><br />I would highly recommend purchasing products from this seller, she cares for her customers and goes above and beyond to make sure they're happy.
