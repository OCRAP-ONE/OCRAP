review/summary: Totally great taste!
review/text: Just bought this first time after tiring a little of Starbucks. I brew at home in my Quisinart Grind 'N Brew. Anyway I read it won some coffee award so i tried it and I'm totally sold on it. Great aroma fills the house- great taste follows. Got the medium roast and really love it. Definately a quality roast. Will buy more when i run out.

review/summary: A wonderful surprise
review/text: When in Hawaii several years ago I tried Kona coffee for the first time and was not at all impressed.  So I never looked for Kona coffee since.  But recently a friend gifted me with Hawaii Roasters Medium Roast and I was wonderfully surprised.  This is the best!  Grinding its rich shiny beans for a french press pot first thing every morning is a perfect start to the day. Its taste is fresh and smooth and a delight all by itself.  I can't help but sit with it for awhile to really enjoy it rather than sip it on the run (though that's ok, too).  I'm converted now and will definitely be ordering more.

review/summary: My dogs love this
review/text: One of my dogs has a sensitive stomach and was constantly eating grass when she was outside, then she'd come back into the house and throw up.  When I read that this dog food was helpful for dogs with sensitive stomachs, I decided I'd give it a try.  My dog has only thrown up a couple of times since I started her on this food months ago.  Even though it's on the expensive side, it's worth it.  Most specialty dog foods like this are on the expensive side, but it's much better for your pet because it doesn't have all the fillers in it.  My dog has had no problems with her bones, which is a problem with her breed, her coat is healthy and shiny, and her eyes are fine.  My breeder once put it this way to me.  "You can either spend a little extra now on the pet food, or you can spend a lot later at the vet."

review/summary: Now Small Breed Formula Dry Food
review/text: I am babysitting my kid's new 8 week old mini Australian Shephard. Most puppies have sensitive tummies and at first the dry food we started feeding her didn't agree with her at all, detected by loose stools usually. When we tried "Now" our puppy immediately ate and loved this dry dog food plus my daughter and I read the label carefully and noted it is grain free, no animal or grain fillers. Recommend reading the ingredients on other dry foods to compare this one. Now Small Breed Forumula has real de-boned poultry, salmon, natural vegetables & fruits --all nutritious food. Stay away from grain & meat fillers -- they are not a good thing.

review/summary: Excellent dog food
review/text: This dog food has healthy ingredients and it agrees with my female Havanese. She is doing well on it and has firm stools - which has not always been the case with some other dry foods I tried, including Wellness small breed. The only drawback I can see is that she doesn't seem to love the taste. She is somewhat finicky and occasionally skips a meal. I would give it 5 stars if the favor could be improved a little.

review/text: I tried this dog food after trying two other brands. My chihuahua mix didn't seem to like the first brand and she had stomach problems with the second. After giving this a try based on the ingredient list and reviews, my dog isn't crazy about it, but she eats it and has well formed stool, so I'm sticking with it for now. I bought the 10 lb bag but it's huge and my dog doesn't eat much so I'll get a smaller bag next time.

review/summary: Good Food for Small Breeds!
review/text: this food was suggested to us by a gal from "All The Best" pet stores. I would say it ranks well among grain free foods. We wanted to try something different, our 2 year old Yorkie had been on small breed Wellness for awhile. We did a taste test of about 4 foods and this one is the one he kept steering to. He's been on it about 6 months now, seems to love it no problems.<br /><br />Shipped out pretty quickly. Good price!

I was so excited to see a U.S. company had them because to purchase them from the UK the shipping is more than the candy. Unfortunately, they aren't the same, they remind me more of Smarties and while I like Smarties I can get them without ordering on-line.  I wish there would have been a cheaper way to find out these weren't what I was looking for.<br />If you need Kosher food item's these may be worth it but if you are looking for Fizzer candies don't bother.

review/summary: Delicious and filling snack
review/text: I find that these Planters Big Nut Bars strike a good balance in terms of crunchiness, chewiness, sweetness and saltiness.<br /><br />I think that most snack foods are far too salty or far too sweet.  While these bars aren't exactly light on sugar and sodium, I thought that the taste wasn't overwhelming.  It felt like a good balance of sweet and salty, but this is definitely up to personal taste.  For example, I find Snickers Bars to be delicious but also painfully sweet.<br /><br />The balance between crunchiness and chewiness is also pretty good.  Despite being mostly nuts, it wasn't all that crunchy, which I actually liked.  Much of the chewiness seems to come from the globs of syrup that holds the entire bar together.<br /><br />Overall, I found these to be a pretty good snack.  I wouldn't eat them all the time though.

review/text: Among the ranks of peanut bars, this is not at the top but not awful either.  It is chewy, not crunchy, and chewy in a strange way, almost half way chewy.  But halfway between chewy and what, I don't know.<br /><br />The peanuts are fine, but the small pieces of nuts sprinkled throughout the bar are annoying. For those who watch their diet, this product is not so bad.  12 grams of fat is about normal for a meal, add a bit of fat from the rest of your food and you are not in such a high range.  The carbs are lower than most candy bars and the protein,@ 7 grams, is a nice bonus.<br /><br />Bottom line, this a good substitute for a candy bar, but the flavor and texture could use some work.

It was a nice blend of different nuts: honey roasted peanuts, almonds & cashews: it was both crunchy & chewy, with a touch of crisp...it was not overly sweet, but was sweet enough for my tastebuds!  With 220 calories, 12g fat, 23g carbs, 13g sugars and only 230mg of sodium, this is a good snack bar, for when you need to delay a meal for awhile~ It made me crave another, and I would definitely buy this product to have it again: it'd be great as a snack in between meals, to carry in your purse, etc.<br /><br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this Planters BIG Nut Bar!

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: Planter's Big Nut bars are just that:  Big and full of nuts (honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews)  I often have issues with this kind of snack, since they so often try to position themselves as a healthy choice and they so often are not one.  Aside from calling itself a granola bar, this snack does not make any particular health claims, yet it actually is a relatively good choice - VERY preferable to a candy bar (which is really where these types of snacks belong).  It contains 12 g of fat, but almost none of it (1.5 g) is saturated.  Each bar contains no cholesterol, a reasonable 230 mg of sodium, and 220 calories, while providing 7 g of protein, 3 g of fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin E, and phosphorous.  Like most of these bars, there's quite a lot of sugar, but again, when compared to other candy bars, it's not a bad choice, and they easily taste as good as most candy bars.  I wouldn't hesitate to have one of these as an occasional treat.

I was sucking little bits of the bar out of my teeth for several minutes, but I kind of expected that.<br /><br />Anyway, these are very good and should be a hit with you as long as you're cool with the sugar in these.  I've been buying more of these for my husband to take to work as mid-morning snacks.  The bit of protein is a bonus, and he felt better eating one of these Planters Roasted Triple Nut bars rather than a chocolate candy bar when he got hungry.

The bar is full of protein and carbs and would make a great snack to take on the trail if you're into hiking and camping.  If you have to watch your sugar intake or have to count calories, you need to be aware that this bar can replace a small meal.  Otherwise, it tastes delicious and is quite filling.

review/text: Planters Big Nut Bars are quite tasty. The mix combo of nuts in a big bar size makes for a delicious treat. It's a nice balance blend of nuts in a tasty triple nut granola bar.<br /><br />My husband, who is a big peanut fan, really enjoyed the Big Nut Bars. In fact, he ate the whole box and left me only one to sample for this review. (How nice of him, huh?) He was the one who told me that as a peanut bar, the Big Nut Bar is terrible(not enough peanuts), but as a granola bar they're awesome! (I laughed when he told me, but when I tasted the bar I discovered he was right.)<br /><br />Me, I'm not so fond of peanuts and generally avoid peanut products. (And I married a peanut nut, go figure.) But I liked the Planter's Big Nut bars. The peanut flavor was not overpowering which allowed me to enjoy the other nuts as well. If my husband left me a couple of more bars, I would've gladly snacked on them.<br /><br />Planters Big Nut Bars are delicious and worth trying. Makes a tasty nutty granola bar treat that can be enjoyed anytime.

review/summary: Just the right balance of all the good stuff
review/text: Before the details:  The Planters big nut bars are a great tasting, quick energy and nutritious snacks.  Lots of peanuts and almonds make it really good on taste and nutrition.<br /><br />Taste:<br />======<br />Does not taste like a Granola bar, tastes more like a peanut bar with some almonds and oats in between.  Infact, you can hardly taste the Oats.  The Peanuts looks like they have been dry roasted in salt, so with every bite - you experience a slightly salted peanut + roasted almonds + caramely sugar taste<br /><br />Nutrition:<br />=========<br />220 calories in one bar.  Whats not good is that 50% of the calories come from sugar.<br />This is not for those who are on a low calorie diet.<br /><br />If there was one thing which Planter could have done, they could have probably decrease the amount of sugars in it and instead added more peanuts/almonds and made it more protein rich

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I really liked these. A little bit similar to Payday but not as sweet, which is fine. It's a substantially-sized bar, chewy, nutty, and just plain good. There's fat in it but it's the good kind - mono - the one that combats the other types.<br /><br />What more could you ask from a 10a.m. and 2p.m. snack?<br /><br />Get this one.

review/summary: Gourmet taste in a nutty Snack Bar
review/text: My husband thought this nutty treat tasted like a showy version of the classic PayDay candy bar.  My daughter thought it tasted like Fiddle-Faddle, only nuttier.  I just thought it was scrumptious.  Usually granola-nut-type snack bars are a little on the bland, dry side for me.  Sort of like peanuts and oatmeal stuck together with salt-water taffy.  But Planters Big Nut Bars are not too sweet, not too nutty and not too dry -- they are just right.<br /><br />With a bottle of juice, this nutty bar makes a wonderful fast breakfast at the office for those days when you just cannot stop even to pour the milk on the cereal. It is also a good energy bar for your backpack or purse. I can definitely taste the cashews and almonds mixed in with the peanuts in this bar, and the sweetness is sort of a rich caramel -- but without the overwhelming stickiness of a caramel-nut candy bar.<br /><br />I loved this bar, and so did my family.  These are going on the shopping list.

review/summary: A good nut bar - not life changing, but good.
review/text: Planters has put together a tasty nut bar that contains peanuts, almonds, and cashews..but mainly it appears and tastes like there were many more peanuts than almonds and cashews together (confirmed by the ingredients list on the wrapper).<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the bar was, as advertised, "BIG" - bigger than other granola type bars I've had.<br /><br />The flavor was good and I was lucky to grab one of these for myself before the rest of my family grabbed them up while we were on a hike.  I guess that's a good bit of advertisement, when people aged 10-50 enjoy them.<br /><br />The consistency of the bar was less nutty and more crunchy (a la "crisped rice crunchy") than other granola bars I've had.<br /><br />I would be happy to have one of these along while hiking, fishing, or camping, but no happier than I'd be with any number of other kinds of granola bars I've had.<br /><br />So, to sum up, the bar is crunchy, nutty, sweet, and tasty, but not what I'd really call a "healthy snack."  After all, each bar has 220 calories, about the same as is in most candy bars.<br /><br />Is this what you are looking for? That's for you to decide.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!  Have a great day!

review/text: Everyone in my family really enjoyed these Planters nut bars. In fact, I just went to look for the box to get some information on nutritional value, and I realized they were all gone! It says a lot when a snack disappears that quickly!!<br /><br />To me, they tasted like a Snickers bar without the chocolate. I'm not even a huge fan of peanuts, but I really enjoyed it--I wish I had more! I guess it's more like a granola bar than a candy bar, but it tasted like a candy bar with the benefits of a granola bar! They're also a really good source of protein, so you can't go wrong!<br /><br />Definitely get these!

review/summary: Unfortunately I'm Allergic
review/text: These are the first distinctly nut-flavored meal or snack bars I've ever tried, and I truly enjoyed them.  However, I won't be ordering anymore because of a somewhat uncommon (and thus not specifically warning labeled about) food allergy.<br /><br />I'm extremely allergic to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YXO0IU">Canola Oil</a>, also known as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7L6C">Rapeseed Oil</a>, which in me produces severe hives and swellings in the throat.  Fortunately, my allergic threshold is relatively high so that small amounts usually produce no reaction.  However, caution induces me to check labels and avoid it whenever I can; labels reading "may contain one or more of the following vegetable oils:" are the bane of my existence, asking me the question, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHQTE">"Do I feel lucky?"</a><br /><br />Unfortunately, near the end of the ingredient list, near the end of the sub-list for granola is my old nemesis <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YXO0IU">Canola Oil</a>.  Consuming no more than a single bar per day and that not on consecutive days spared me any allergic reaction, but I will take no further chances when I am NOT obliged to write a review.<br /><br />Too bad, because I did enjoy them very much, more than I did the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OCBT3U">Planters Big Nut Bars, Double Peanut, 8.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)</a>.

review/summary: Nutty, Crunchy, Satisfying
review/text: Considering that this product is labeled as "granola bars," I was pleasantly surprised by the nutty flavor. Expecting to taste primarily a protein flavor, I was delighted that the nut flavor of the peanuts, cashews and almonds were more predominant. Also the 220 calories were not excessive, therefore I believe the bar could be a substitute for lunch while dieting which I frequently do. I was relieved that there were not transfats and only 1.5 g of the good nut saturated fats. The acceptable monosaturated fats were 6 g which is fine as I am mainly avoiding transfats. Other acceptable monosaturated fats are of course olive oil and avocadoes. One suggestion I would make would be to eliminate the corn syrup as the sweetener. Otherwise I believe this is a winning nut bar that lives up to its Big Nut name!

review/summary: Better alternative than Snickers or Payday, but I prefer the double peanut flavor
review/text: The big nut bars are a pretty tasty alternative from Planters- I counted no less than 5 almonds in my bar.  However, as others have noted, the caloric count is pretty high for such a small bar.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they're also very sweet still, and I was looking for a more nutty bar with fewer sugars.  Additionally, much of the bar is taken up by filler "rice".<br /><br />Actually, I prefer the Planter's Double Nut flavor, because it has a better contrasting flavor of salty/sweet.

review/text: These are very good. Very nutty and sweet. Any nut lover should love these. My husband said they reminded him of peanut brittle. We liked them so much we went out and bought more. This probably won't be the healthiest snack you've ever had, but it would make a nice treat.<br /><br />The only change I would suggest to Planters would be to change the photo on the front of the box. It doesn't do the bar justice and actually is a bit unappealing.

review/summary: Beats Snickers in nutritional value (but not the ideal health snack)
review/text: When you compare this snack to the unofficial "nutritional bar" of the sugary junk-food mass-market (Snickers), the Planters "Big Nut Bar" (what kind of a silly name is that?) beats the classic Snickers handily. The Snickers nutritional data comes from the Snickers website.<br /><br />The Planters has the following advantages:<br />+ NO CHOLESTEROL (Snickers has 5mg)<br />+ 3g protein and 2g fiber more<br />+ 17g Sugars LESS (13g vs 30g)<br />+ 60 calories less<br />+ 3g of saturated fat less<br />+ 110% Vitamin E<br /><br />Snickers advantage<br />+ CHOCOLATE<br />+ 100mg less sodium<br /><br />Obviously, despite the healthy promise and premise of nuts, this bar still has its sugar load (and corn syrup and friends).<br /><br />However, if you compare with Snickers, it is a better nutritional alternative/replacement - if you can live without the chocolate that is :)

review/text: Ok I love nuts and this was a great tasting bar. It was sweet, full of nuts with a carmel chewy flavor. The problem I had with the bar it was very high in calories and very sweet.  It was too sweet for me (but I don't eat very much sugar).  If you are wanting a healthy 'chocolate bar' this would be good alternative.  If you are looking for healthy snack maybe I would just buy the a bag of peanuts.

review/summary: Good flavor but...
review/text: These have that good peanutty flavor, but the texture is a real turn-off: chewy.  I don' know about you, but I want some crunch in life.<br /><br />Also, like some other reviewers, I wasn't happy with all that corn syrup.<br />There was nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it.  I can't think of when it would make a good snack as the texture was such a disappointment, almost as if it was stale.<br /><br />If you want a great crunchy nut snack try this:<br />Heat a frying pan, any size is OK, on medium.<br />Add 1/4 cup of maple syrup (the real kind).<br />Cook until it's frothy and has reduced by half.<br />Add 1-2 cups of nuts: almonds, walnuts, macadamias, etc. (The fewer nuts the sweeter the result.)<br />Add whatever spices you like, cinnamon; salt and pepper; Hungarian smoked paprika; or, cayenne.<br />Stir until all the syrup is absorbed and the nuts look dry. This may take 5-10 minutes.<br />Pour out onto a cookie sheet lined with foil and let them cool.<br />When cool and completely dry store in a tightly covered jar at room temperature.

review/summary: Five stars for consistency, but merely a couple for taste
review/text: In a world of diet and snack bars, this is a good move for Planters. As far as I'm aware, they don't have a snack bar (although I think sometime ago there was once a Planters Peanut Bar, but not sure if it's still around). Anyone in the grocery store looking for a snack bar with peanuts is sure to consider this one. I was in the store recently and the blue box was the first one I saw on the shelf with the other cereal bars and such. Planters is known for being the king of peanuts, and "BIG" grabs your attention on the box.<br /><br />Marketing aside, this is an OK nut bar. There are three nuts - honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews. The taste of almonds and cashews is barely noticeable, but each bar in the box may vary a bit. To my disappointment the peanut flavor seems "off," but likely because of the stickiness and sugar. It's all held together with rice and corn syrup and your other typical granola bar ingredients, unfortunately most of them not very healthy (there are seven grams of protein, however). The consistency is excellent - not too sticky, not too chewy - it's perfect. Five stars for that, but merely a couple for taste.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't go out of my way to buy Big Nut Bars. I'd rather just eat Planters peanuts for the nuts and Quaker granola bars for the chew. Or maybe just go with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMI5KC">PayDay</a>.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I like them, and so has anyone I have offered them to.<br /><br />I like planters, they have a good reputation. I also often eat the "Nature Valley" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6K6GW">Nature Valley Roasted Nut Crunch Granola Bars, Almond Crunch, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> nut bars. The Planter's bars taste very much like them, so I would buy whichever seems to be a better value at the time. I would not consider either to be a `healthy' snack, but somewhat better than most alternatives. I think they would be good to have in vending machines.<br />They are very sweet and nutty. They also somewhat resemble Kashi `go lean' bars (that do have more protein) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P1EGQ8">Kashi-Go Lean Crunchy, 24 ct Variety Pack</a> , but somewhat easier on the teeth. But they are still pretty crunchy because of the excellent Planter's nuts. I would place them more in the realm of energy bars than in healthy snacks (i.e. low carb, low fat, organic ingredients etc.) as they do have a bit more salt, so if you are out on the trail but have plenty of water, they might be a good choice. I think they are nothing like a "Payday" bar. They are filling.<br /><br />I like them!

review/text: I usually don't eat nut bars, but these are really very good, great nut taste, nice and chewy, nice subtle salty taste, not too much like most nut bars.  The bars have three kinds of nuts:  peanuts, almonds and cashews.  Seem to have a little carmel flavor too.  Obviously heavy on the peanuts, but just enough of the others to give it a nice unique taste.<br /><br />I usually have a "breakfast" bar but I think these would be a good substitute, while more calories and more fat, honestly more taste, and not that many more calories.  Maybe I will become a nut bar person.

review/text: Simply put - these bars are good.  If you are a nut fan (and if you're not why are you looking here?), you will be satisfied with a good portion of Honey Roasted Peanuts, Almonds and Cashews.  It's not a "health bar" by any means with the corn syrup (13g sugars), but it has enough good stuff to make this a decent snack choice.  With 220 calories and 12g of fat this is not a light snack, but that's what I like about it.  It's big enough to satisfy my nut cravings and curb my hunger.  If I had a can of nuts in front in me, I might eat 2, 3 or maybe 6 servings before I made myself stop.  This bar is enough to let you stop.

Just salty enough to make them delicious, and sticky enough so it doesn't break apart when biting into one.  Yet not so sticky that you have to wash your hands after eating.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.

review/summary: Love the nuts but not the corn syrup.
review/text: I probably eat more peanuts than Jimmy Carter, and have no idea why, here in the United States, they smother delicious, healthy, energy and endurance boosting peanuts in sweet crud.<br /><br />Of course I like the taste of them--what American doesn't like a mouth full of flavored sugar these days--but corn syrup (i.e. sugar) is the second ingredient listed, "crisped rice" which contains SUGAR the third, followed by peanut butter, SUGAR, then some nuts and oats and other good stuff, and somewhere near the end the key word on the package gets in there--"granola"--which is rolled oats mixed with--guess what--more SUGAR.<br /><br />One bar contains 220 calories mostly consisting of various kinds of sugar and ingredients containing sugar.  Since 100 calories per bar are from fat I have to wonder what tiny fraction of those remaining 120 calories are at all healthy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Stay clear of this one unless you're in the last three miles of running a marathon or horribly underweight.  The amount of fat and sugar (which turns to fat like nothing else can) contained in this bar far outweighs the health benefits of the nuts and oats it contains.<br /><br />On the positive side, I will say, these are delicious and I couldn't resist eating them--which is why I will never, ever have them again.

review/summary: Sometimes you feel like a nut.....
review/text: From A strictly taste standpoint, these bars are absolutely delicious.<br /><br />The packaging advertises them as having lots of protein, and they do.  Peanuts have a lot of protein.  Just keep in mind these are in no way, shape, or form "health bars".  They have lots of corn syrup as one (second) of the main ingredients. Sugar then appears in various forms among at least five of the other ingredients as well.  The bars are 220 calories each, 100 of those coming from fats.  The fat content is about 12 grams, of which 1.5 are saturated fats.<br /><br />What that means is, all in all, while the bars have protein in them, they are not a great source of protein, with about 7 grams of protein, but almost twice as much total fat.<br /><br />As far as a nut bar, this product is very tasty, but people are conditioned to red "granola" and say "Hey!  Healthy!"  At 1.6 ounces per bar, the protein is offset by the fat and sugars.<br /><br />So, very delicious, but buy these knowing they are more "candy bar" than healthy snack.<br /><br />Since Planters makes no real claim that these are health bars, I have to rate them a 5 on pure taste.  You eat one, you want another.

review/text: My youngest son (age 12) gave this treat a rating of 8 (on a scale of 1-10), saying he would buy it again (I didn't ask whether he would consider using his own money).<br /><br />His older brother called the confection "boring" but indicated that he would be glad to pop a boxful into the shopping cart at the grocery store.<br /><br />My husband, giving it a 6 on the scale, described the bar as having little flavor and a weird squishy texture.<br /><br />But what you really want to know is "what does JoAnne think?"<br /><br />I am a peanut fan, and Paydays were my favorite as a kid.  I haven't had one for a few decades so I can't really compare, but I do recall a sublime peanut-rich candy experience.  The peanuts in the Big Nut, in contrast, seemed flavorless and borderline stale.  I didn't realize until I started to write this review that the bar also contains almonds and cashews, so I can't say they made a huge contribution to the taste.<br /><br />Other reviewers complained about the number of sweeteners and other unwholesome ingredients in this bar.  Maybe "granola" implies healthy to some (it doesn't to me) but I don't expect much nutrition from a candy bar.  I do expect a candy bar that calls itself "big" to be somewhat larger than real small, and this bar struck me as below average in size.  But then, candy bars in general are a lot smaller (and cost a lot more!) than when I used to eat them every day.<br /><br />That said, the dominant note in this mix of 30 or so ingredients was the corn syrup.  It overpowered the peanut taste and left the kind of remorseful aftertaste that made me ask myself why I'd just wasted 220 calories.  I realize that corn syrup is ubiquitous; I wonder if the purveyors of cheap candy bars realize how offensive it is to so many of us?<br /><br />Would I buy it again? No. I gave it three stars because the boys liked it, and if you have some of them in your family and you want to get them a treat, this might be your bar.  Me, I'm sticking to chocolate.

review/summary: My, what a big package you have: A Planters Roasted Triple Nut Big Nut Bars review.
review/text: Without much of a selection and knowing how much I enjoy nuts, I choose to review the Planters roasted triple nut big nut bars.  As a chef who cooks from scratch, I can be picky, especially when it comes to prepared foods.  However I enjoy good food when I find it.<br /><br />Planters roasted triple nut big nut bars claim to be a chewy granola bar with 7 grams of protein.  Granola bars tend to consist of rolled oats, sugar, and crisped rice.  To say this is not a granola bar is unrealistic.  However, this bar isn't what I would expect from a chewy granola bar either.<br /><br />My first thought when I opened the package related to the excessive size of the box.  (See posted image.) Some may find this deceiving, especially if bought in a store.  I don't think it's as much of an issue when buying online.  However the package could easily hold four more bars.  This is just wasteful and unnecessary.  Of course I'll recycle the package, but greener packaging would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />When it comes to the bar itself, it tastes pretty darn good.  I don't eat a lot of sugary foods; many chewy granola bars seem to be overwhelmingly sweet to me.  In this case, Planters has created a pleasing balance between sweet and salty.  I can taste the peanut butter, but since its flavor is blended with other ingredients it tastes a little off.  The texture is crunchy without being hard yet chewy simultaneously.  Overall the flavors work well, making this a tasty treat.<br /><br />Planters promotes the 7 grams of protein each bar contains, while not claiming this to be a health bar.  With all the sugar and high fructose corn syrup, few granola bars on the market could reasonably claim to be a health bar.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZ5FKS">Nature Valley sweet and salty nut granola bars</a> when calculated to match the larger size of the roasted triple nut big nut bars are comparable but tend to have a higher fat and calorie count.  Sugars and carbs are also comparable, but the roasted triple nut big nut bars tend to be lower than the Nature Valley version plus contains almost twice as much protein.<br /><br />I don't normally purchase these types of products, but if I were going to I would purchase the planters roasted triple nut big nut bars over Nature Valley's version.  The larger than necessary packaging is wasteful, but not a strong enough reason to avoid this product.  If you enjoy these nutty chewy granola bars, try the roasted triple nut big nut bars.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Balanced sweet salty flavor<br />7 grams protein<br /><br />CONS:<br />Excessively large outer box<br />Peanut butter flavor a bit off

review/summary: Another evil junk food item
review/text: I was so excited to try these out but the obscene amounts of sugar shocked me out of my delight. Does a nut bar really need 5 different sweeteners? There's the bane of my existence - corn syrup, followed by sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, honey and brown sugar on top of that, excuse me Planters but why are you poisoning us with this? These bars are so sweet that my cavity was singing the day I tried them, I mean blaring pain and the bar itself isn't so spectacular, the nuts are mostly chopped up into random pieces with sweet syrup on top and some sort of bread crumb like stuffing in between.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend these to my worst enemy and I would advise to stay far away from these. Corn syrup is packed into 90% of processed foods; even jarred pickles have this stuff in the sauce they swim in, I feel like a science project when I get anything that isn't raw these days, and this is another bad, shameful product that people will eat for sure and pay for it with their poor health twenty years later. Cheap food is expensive, it makes us sick later, and this is yet another product to add to this problem.<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/text: These Planters Peanut Bars taste de-lish!  I could probably snack on them all day.  Unfortunately, they just aren't as healthy as one would expect for a peanut bar alternative.  They are packed full of sugar, corn syrup, and calories.  One might as well have a candy bar.  I thought the peanut count would up the protein but its only 7 grams, I think less than what a handful of peanuts as a snack would have.

review/summary: A very good and fairly healthy snack
review/text: The box showed up yesterday in the mail and when I opened it the cardboard container was a little smashed but the product inside remained undamaged. I'm guessing this is due by the shipping method Amazon used on the Vine items as opposed to customer purchased goods shipped via UPS.<br /><br />The box had the 10 nut bars in it each one with the same expiration date which in this case was approx 4 months from today, plenty of time to eat the items without them going bad. I will say that I love to eat almonds and honey roasted peanuts so I was excited to get this product. Its called the "Triple Nut" and contains honey roasted peanturs, almonds and cashews and they do not skimp on any of them. The bar is totally loaded with nuts, however there is a little filler which I imagine is used to glue it all together and get the bar shape.<br /><br />Overall the bars are really good to me and I will definitly be purchasing these down the road. The only thing I don't like about the bars is the amount of ingredients listed but overall the ingredits are ones I am familiar with, they include:<br /><br />-peanuts<br />-corn syrup<br />-crisped rice<br />-sugar<br />-evaporated cane juice invert syrup<br />-whole grain rolled oats<br />-almonds<br />-cashews<br />-less then 1.5% whey<br />-soy lecithin<br />-salt<br />-honey<br />-vegetable oil<br />-resistant corn dextrin<br />-granola<br />-xanthan gum<br />-mixsed tocopherols (to protect flavors)<br /><br />So the list of ingredients isn't that overally concerning. It's a good product, I definitly recommend giving it a try!

review/summary: Tasty & Nutty Granola Bar!
review/text: This bar is a very nice snack! The bar is not hard or dry like most granola bars, but is not too soft either. This is a very delightful & chewy granola bar that has a nice size to it!<br /><br />The bar itself looks to be composed mostly of nuts. I first expected something closer to a payday candy bar for flavor, but that changed when I ate one of these Planters Big Triple Nut bars. These bars are not simply just a bunch of peanuts, or plain old granola bars. It is a wonderful blend of both with a nice honey flavor.<br /><br />I enjoyed these bars and find them to be a useful snack when I am a little hungry, but don't have time to eat yet. A much better alternative to a sugar filled candy bar. Also, they are excellently priced! Each 8.1 Ounce box has 5 bars, each weighing in at 1.6 oz ... so, you get 50 bars! Not bad!

review/text: The package for this "chewy granola bar" from Planters has stuff about its size and contents written all over it: "Big Nut Bar", "Triple Nut", "30% Bigger", etc., etc. But the "Big Nut Bar" does live up to its name. It's a bit heftier than a standard granola bar and also a bit crunchier - because it's filled with nuts instead of granola, duh. To be specific, it's filled with Honey Roasted Peanuts, Almonds, and Cashews. Something holds it all together - don't ask me, I'm no nutritionist, and it tastes great. It's a granola bar that makes you feel like you actually ate something.

review/summary: Candy bar in a Granola wrapper
review/text: The first bite of this Planters chewy granola bar takes me back to my childhood and Payday candy bars.  Back then, I couldn't eat chocolate, so my treat choices were limited.  I grew to love the sweet saltiness of Payday, and this Planters product delivers an almost perfect rendition of that flavor, down to the chewy caramelized sweet coating.  The only thing missing is the nougat center, and 20 calories.<br /><br />Yes, this "granola" bar has a whopping 220 calories, 100 of them from fat.  A Payday bar has 240 calories, 120 from fat.<br /><br />Although, at 13 grams of sugar, Planters does deliver less sweet stuff than Payday at 21 grams, but the distinction is tiny.<br /><br />This bar tastes great, does hit the spot and keep me from getting hungry in the afternoon, but I think a candy bar with nuts would do the same thing - even better is a handful of almonds or other nuts without the added salt or sugars.<br /><br />Great tasting treat, but "granola" bar it's not!

review/summary: Very tasty snack that satisfied my sweet tooth
review/text: For nut lovers, this is a very tasty chewy granola bar that is chocked full of nuts. The nuts add quite a bit of fat to the bar - 12 g total for a 1.62 oz bar, but are a good source of protein (7 g) and provide fiber (3 g).  The nuts are large and substantial. The honey roasted flavor adds a depth to the overall taste of the bar<br /><br />All is all this was a great tasting, relatively nutritious bar that I'll definitely treat myself to again.  It satisfied my "candy bar" craving with better nutritional qualities, including relative low sodium (230 mg) and a full day's worth of Vitamin E (110% DV).

review/text: Planters is the leading distributor of peanuts and wide assortment of other nut products.<br /><br />So it comes as no surprise that Planters would be the ones to create a healthy snack bar that actually tastes good.<br /><br />Larger (30%) than your typical snack bar, each 46 gram chewy, nut-filled bar offers a whopping 7 grams of protein! And only 23 grams of fat!<br /><br />Each Planters Big Triple Nut Bar offers a snack chocked full of honey roasted peanuts, almonds, and cashews.<br /><br />Being that, prior to trying these tasty treats, I had not found a snack bar that offered nutrition and good taste, I was a little hesitant to even give these a try.<br /><br />I'm glad I did!<br /><br />As a former gestational diabetic at risk for Type 2 diabetes, I'm try to maintain the healthy eating habits I learned during pregnancy. Planters Big Triple Nut Bars is one more thing I can add to my list of allowable snacks.<br /><br />Whether you're trying to maintain a healthy diet or just looking for a tasty snack, I recommend giving Planters Big Triple Nut Bars a try!

review/summary: Great Taste but not exactly a healthy snack
review/text: I really like the taste of these bars and was very excited about the product.  To find a healthy snack that tastes good is a rare find for me.  Then I read the lable and was a bit dissapointed.  Planters uses high fructos corn syrup in it and additional sugars.  I don't understand why the Honey wouldn't be enough to make it sweet.  High fructos corn syrup is something that I need to avoid as it is very bad for my heart health.  In fact I believe it is the worst kind of sugar there is. Although I originally gave this one star by accident and amazon won't let me rase that to a 3 star I do feel dissapointed in the health qualities of the product and probably won't be buying another batch any time soon.

review/summary: Stale Peanuts Surrounded by Sticky Sweet Goo
review/text: I found these bars to be way too sticky and sweet.  This seems to be yet another one of these products that is trying to make you think it is healthy by plugging into the granola bar genre, but they blow it by making it as sweet as a candy bar.  Texture-wise it is like chewing sticky caramel with stuff embedded in it.<br /><br />Additionally, the peanuts tasted a slight bit stale to me (even though the date stamp on the bar wrapper was 4 months away).  To be sure, I compared this product with a freshly opened jar of Planters Dry Roasted Lite Salt Peanuts, and those tasted nice and fresh compared to the stale peanuts in these bars.  Too bad the manufacturer couldn't do a better job with peanut delivery, I wanted to like this product.

review/text: I discovered Planters Big Nut Bars - the Triple Nut variety - about two years ago.  When they became hard to find at my local supermarket, I started ordering them by the case from Amazon.  Now, Amazon only offers them through a third-party seller and the cost to have a case delivered has jumped from around $30.00 (give or take) to more than $80.00.  I sent an email to Planters asking about their distribution problems, but never received a reply.  Has anyone else had trouble finding these bars at a reasonable price?  If you're still finding them - where?  Needless to say, I like these bars very much.

review/summary: Crispy, crunchy, tasty, but....
review/text: Planters Bit Nut Bars are slightly bigger than a typical "granola" bar, although these are not really granola bars, they are designed to fit that niche.  7 grams of protein is nothing to sneeze at, although I can think of plenty of bars and bar-like products that can do better than that.  Most of the protein comes from nuts, which is a definite flavor improvement over soy or whey powder.  The calorie count rivals most candy bars though, and I"m not sure these have anything to offer health wise that make it superior to something like a Snickers bar.  There's plenty of sugar, fat, cholesterol to go along with the protein.<br />The up side?  They are crispy, the nuts actually do taste roasted, and they are eatable.  Meaning, not so hard you chip a tooth but substantial enough to pretend its a meal.<br />The down side?  Nothing really, except they are just good and not fantastic and don't seem to offer much of an advantage over cheaper, more readily available alternatives.<br />I actually hoped these would be better than they are, so perhaps my slight disappointment made me like these less than I might have.<br />Overall?  B-.

review/summary: Wow, these are pretty gross.
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect with these - they aren't granola bars, they aren't candy bars...  Of course, they're "NUT BARS."  Triple Nut, to be exact.  (The package also says "5 Chewy Granola Bars.")  "Honey Roasted Peanuts, Almonds, and Cashews."<br /><br />Well...they sorta taste like a dirty Payday candy bar, except the "peanut" flavor tasted like the bad peanut that you end up getting in every bag - a bit bitter or over roasted but pretty gross either way.  I couldn't taste any almonds or cashews (perhaps because they're the the 13th and 14th ingredients.)  They "honey roasting" is sort of a misnomer, as the sweetness is undoubtedly coming from the Corn Syrup (ingredient #2), Sugar (#4, #10), and Evaporated Cane Juice Inverted Syrup (#11.)  In fact, honey is listed as the 4th ingredient under the "contains less than 1.5% of" list.<br /><br />At any rate, a Payday candy bar tastes better, and just by claiming these are "NUT BARS" doesn't really make them healthy...comparing the nutrition facts between these and a Payday reveal these have a less sugar, more salt, and the same protein.<br /><br />Given they're being marketed as granola bars and healthier than candy bars...these are on the very bottom of my list for flavor and texture of a granola bar.  If you're looking for a good, healthy, chewy granola bar...you'd be much better off with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZIE">Cascadian Farms Organic Chewy Granola Bar, Chocolate Chip, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  If you're looking for a snack with nuts - just buy the nuts.<br /><br />I'm not sure why all the other reviews seem to be raving about these things...I generally eat only natural and/or organic foods, so perhaps my palate just drastically varies.<br /><br />For reference, here's the full ingredient list:<br />Peanuts, Corn syrup, Crisped Rice (rice flour, sugar, malt extract, salt, caramel color, mixed tocopherols), peanut butter, sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, whole grain rolled oats, almonds, cashews, [Contains 1.5% or less than:]  Whey (from milk), soy lecithin, salt, honey, vegetable oil (peanut and/or cottonseed), resistant corn dextrin, Granola (whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, whole grain rolled wheat, coconut, canola oil, wheat bran), xanthan gum, and more mixed tocopherols.

review/text: I really enjoyed the Planters Big Nut Bars.  The flavor has a nice balance between salty and sweet, and the peanuts don't over power the rest of the ingredients.<br /><br />The bars travel well and don't get too sticky or disintegrate if they get warmed up in a hot car.<br /><br />Personally, I think the bars are a bit too big for one serving.  It's a good thing because they also keep okay for a reasonable period if you wrap them up tight, but the packaging doesn't lend itself very much to preserving leftovers.  So make sure you have a zip top baggie on hand.

I was expecting something more peanut brittle-ish and thought I'd be "dentally" regretting my decision or boring like a granola bar that was rock hard.  Luckily this it was something in the middle.  It's not at all like peanut brittle, it's more like peanuts just magically connected with a glue of goodness.  It's not boring or rock hard like a granola bar either.  If you like roasted peanuts, then sign up for a box.  Good protein and a treat, all in one.

After all, theoretically most of us have come to recognize that eating healthy food is important, right?  That said, I could imagine an athlete like, say, Lance Armstrong, needing a high-calorie pick-me-up at one of the mountain stages of the Tour de France and reaching for one of these.  So, okay, not a good choice for me.  But how about the taste?<br /><br />Although supposedly a combination of nuts, including peanuts, cashews, and almonds, the peanut taste completely dominates.  If you like peanuts, can afford the calories and fat, then this is the bar for you. The peanut taste is rich and satisfying and the bar definitely fills you up -- another plus.  But I think this will work best for a very specialized target audience.  Not a purchase I will make in the future.

review/summary: Calories
review/text: These bars weigh in at 220 calories. I was in a situation where that would have been a plus. This is it: two of us had made it to the summit of Redcloud Peak, 14,034 ft, our second 14,000 ft peak of the day after eleven hours of scrambling over rocks and scree. It was 6:00 PM with the sun soon to set at 7:00 PM. It was snowing with the wind blowing the snow horizontally seemingly from all directions. We were 4000 vertical feet and seven miles from the trailhead, and not sure if we would make it back through the snowstorm. That was a perfect situation for one of these 220 calorie peanut bars. Fortunately, we did have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LTM29M">Nature Valley Granola Bars</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UXNYPU">Clif Bars</a>, which got us back to our car in the dark in only another four hours.<br /><br />On the other hand for most of the year, just sitting around the TV, I think 220 calories is a little high. The bars have 230 mg of salt, also a little much. The sugar content is 13 grams out of 46 grams, about average for this kind of product, although some of the sugar comes in the form of corn syrup.<br /><br />As to taste, you have to like peanuts. The bars taste a lot like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, but without the chocolate. The texture is crunchy. The surface is sticky at room temperature, but ok if you keep them in the refrigerator or carry them up mountains in the snow.<br /><br />Altogether, I think that these bars are ok in taste and texture, but high in calories and salt. However, they can be just right in calories if that is what you need at the moment.

review/summary: Tested these on the whole family
review/text: I got a box and gave one to each of my kids, my husband and tried it myself.<br /><br />First I asked my 8 year old son what he thought (very picky eater, thinks all food should be made in the form of a TV dinner). I asked him what he though of it. He said "They are great!". I will add that he is a big fan of peanuts. He's fine with chunky peanut butter and likes just planes roasted peanuts as a snack.<br /><br />Then I asked my 8 year old daughter (they're twins) what she thought. She typically will eat anything. Vegetables, fruits, spicy food dishes, etc., are all just fine with her. She thinks imitation crab meat on crackers is the greatest food on earth next to chocolate, so I was expecting a high review from her. However she did not care for them. She didn't even finish her bar (which is just unheard of for her).<br /><br />Then I asked my husband. He says their ok, but they would be better with chocolate. Like they were missing something.<br /><br />I tried it and I thought the same thing as my husband. They just aren't the kind of thing I would take as a snack.<br /><br />However they were a huge hit with my son who really enjoys peanuts alone as a snack. So if you have a peanut lover in the family (that person who can sit down with a jar and just eat them all afternoon), this may be the snack for them!

review/summary: Nut-tastic
review/text: These are great.  Not dry or hard (like brittle), but rather nuts held together with a softer goo of honey and sugar.  More sweet that salty. Good balance of nut flavors, with (as you'd expect from planters) peanut being the dominant taste. So it's not a pure health bar due to the sugars, but it's better than a pure candy bar thanks to the nut protein and fiber.

review/summary: Pretty good peanut bars
review/text: These are pretty good peanut bars. Planters Big Nut Bars have big chunks of peanuts, gooey sugary goo but they're not too sweet so they don't give you a headache. I like Planters, they make a quality product and I love their famous cocktail peanuts with plenty of sea salt in the tins and their mixed nuts. These peanut bars are another good thing they make and they are individually wrapped so you can keep them in the car or in your pocket for a snack on the go.

review/summary: Great taste, chewy texture, and a wonderful snack
review/text: My wife and I really love these Planters Big Nut Bars. We're generally fans of chewy granola bars and we also love peanuts, cashews, and almonds ... so these granola bars seem like they were made for us. The nuts are fresh and provide a little bit of crunchiness and the granola and caramel give these quite a bit of chewiness as well.<br /><br />My wife thinks they're perfect, but I think the caramel flavor overpowers the nut flavor a bit too much and that the bars are on the edge of being too chewy (if you try to pull a piece of the bar off then the whole bar starts to fall apart because it's so chewy).<br /><br />Still, I really like these granola bars and my wife and I will definitely buy more of these.

review/summary: Big, but not overwhelming (3.5 stars)
review/text: Planter's Big Nut Bars live up to the name in that they are big, but I wasn't overly impressed with the product. The bars I consumed reminded me more of a Pay Day candy bar (which I like), but these don't work for me as a mid-day snack. I prefer something lite (fruit, yogurt, some kinds of granola bars) as a snack before or after lunch, but these just have too much fat (12g per bar, 18% of daily value), sugars (13g) and salt/sodium (230 mg, 10%) for my liking.<br /><br />However, they are very tasty, very big and very chewy, which is all the packaging promises. I'll eat them for those reasons, but probably only as dessert on the weekend.

review/summary: Planters Peanuts are the best
review/text: I like how the Planters Peanuts were turned a snack bar. It was very salty and sweet. The size is perfect for one person. It looked fresh and i would buy it. The color of the nuts were brown and the granola color was light brown or peach. The bar was perfect for Peanuts on the go. It was sticky and crunchy. It is similiar to a Rice Crispy bar because of the stickiness . The smell reminds me of vanilla and granola cereal. The granola bar was so good that I could eat two in a row. There was five granola bar in the box not ten.

review/summary: Excellent snack
review/text: These bars are full of nuts - peanuts, almonds and cashews. The combination is great, and encased in a sweet chewy goo. These are not health bars by any stretch, and they pack a relatively high caloric punch (220). What I like is that these are reasonably low in fat, particularly saturated fat (only 1.5g), which I am concerned about, high in "good" fats (mono and polyunsaturated), and relatively high in protein. So you will get a large nutrition  bang in a small package that will last a long time. heck there is even 3g of fiber per bar. The biggest drawback is that it is relatively high in sugars. Overall I really enjoyed this, but would not make a habit of eating them all the time!

review/text: Nuts by themselves are a very healthy snack, if eaten in moderation. I try to eat a small handful of almonds, pecans, or cashews everyday. Although I don't plan on replacing my nut snacking with these bars, this does make a better choice than a candy bar for someone wanting something sweet and nutty. I thought the bar had excellent flavor, and would choose this over chips, candy bars, and cookies.

review/summary: Could be sweeter, could be nuttier
review/text: This bar product claims to fit in with the 'granola' catagory, and I guess that works, as it's not really a candy bar and it DOES seem to have granola in it. But the nuts overwhelm this, and what you get is a certain weird mishmash of flavors that almost doesn't taste like anything.<br />Now don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, but my first impression was that it wasn't sweetr enough. There's obviously a bit of honey, but it could certainly use more. Failing that, as it probably wants to be on the healithier side (though at 220 calories and 12g fat, it's not) perhaps a bit more of a nuttier taste would be better -- I cannot actually taste any cashews, one of my favorite nuts, and almonds? Forgetaboutit. It's all mishmashed together to give more of a uniform taste, but this gives it no real reason to have the nuts (and thus be more expensive) in the first place, really.<br />So in all, yeah it's ok. But there's a lot better choices out there, both as a yummy-treat snack bar, and as something to give kids to chew on.

review/summary: Not bad, but not worth buying
review/text: I'm always looking for alternate sources of quick protein over meat, so I decided to give a box of these Triple Nut bars a try. While not bad, the bars taste a bit over-roasted and sometimes bitter. I was also put off by how much saturated fat and sodium were in these bars. I never put extra salt on my foodstuff, so I have to admit I was a bit taken aback by how salty these were. Generally you eat granola bar type products on a run or hike. These things will dehyrdrate you pretty quickly, so the target audience is a bit out of luck here. Maybe they would work better as a snack for a work or school lunch.<br /><br />I'm also put off by the sheer amount of corn syrup in here. Corn Syrup is one of the worst things you can put in your body, making this a pretty bad option for those looking for something healthy.<br /><br />The bars taste okay, but they're neither worth the cost nor very good for you. I'd search out a healthier corn syrup free alternative if I were you.

review/summary: Taste pretty good, but more like a candy bar than a granola bar
review/text: These are referred to as "granola bars" on the box, however they don't taste anything like a granola bar.  They are very sweet, likely due to the honey and salt.  "Granola" is one of the very last ingredients listed, which means there is very little of it in each bar, possibly just enough so they can use the term "granola bar" in their labeling.  But if you like "corn syrup," you are in for a treat because it is the second ingredient on the list.<br /><br />Now, I don't want to state these are unhealthy.  They do have 12g of fat (18% of your DRV), but only 1.5g of that is saturated.  The rest are polyunsaturated and monounsaturated, which are healthy fats that comes from the almonds and nuts.  Although at 220 calories apiece, and 13g of sugar, I would not advise anyone to eat several of these a day, thinking they are getting a healthy snack.<br /><br />The box refers to these as "big" nut bars. They try to back up this claim by stating they are "30% bigger than the leading nut & granola bar." I do not know what the leading bar is that they're referring to, so this claim has no merit to me.  Also, the words "30% bigger" is in a huge font, while the rest is in tiny type that is almost invisible. I think this is fairly deceptive, considering that this bar is filled with a lot of air and water vapor, and is designed to be very easy to chew and swallow.  Sure the bar might be 30% bigger in size, but the nuts aren't packed as closely together and air takes up a lot of space. Not to mention that a large portion of the bar is syrup, compared to the leading bar, which is likely more nuts.  And the bar is probably 30% smaller than the leading candy bar, which is what it should be measured up against.<br /><br />This isn't a bad product as long as you know what you're eating and realize that it's not really a granola bar.  It does taste pretty good in my opinion, and if I had to compare it to anything, I would say it tastes a lot like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z1R1W">Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.  When I'm eating a "peanut" or "granola" bar, I don't want to sea corn syrup, salt, and sugar at the top of the ingredients list. I want to see nuts, nuts, and more nuts.<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 bar<br />Servings per container: 5<br />Calories 220<br />Calories from fat - 100<br />Total fat -12g<br />  Saturated fat - 1.5g<br />  Trans fat - 0g<br />  Polyunsaturated fat - 3.5g<br />  Monounsaturated fat - 6g<br />Cholesterol - 0mg<br />Sodium - 230mg<br />Total Carbs - 23g<br />  Dietary fiber - 3g<br />  Sugars 13g<br />Protein 7g

review/summary: A pleasant alternative to plain granola
review/text: They're 30% larger than leading nut and granola bars with an advertised 7 grams of protein, but I'm not sure how to describe them.  They don't seem like a granola bar; in fact oats is well down the rather long list of ingredients and granola is in the "less than 1.5%" category.  That said, they also don't resemble a candy bar except in the loosest sense.  Having never eaten a Payday bar, I cannot attest to what others have said about this comparison.  Here's what's important: 5 -  46 gram bars are in each box, each containing 220 calories, 12 grams of total fat, 23 grams of carbohydrate and 230 milligrams of sodium.  The main ingredients in order are: peanuts, corn syrup, crisped rice, peanut butter and sugar with lesser amounts of rolled oats, almonds and cashews.<br /><br />I found the flavor quite good, peanuts being the overall flavor.  However, I feel there are better tasting granola bars, and I am not a huge peanut fan.  Still, this bar is pleasant-tasting and a satisfying snack, if sugar (13 grams) and carbs are not a  problem.  So, with those caveats noted,  I can recommend the Planter's Big Triple Nut Bar.

review/text: Normal granola bar-type snacks quash my hunger for half an hour or so, but then it gradually comes crawling back.  However, I found Planters Big Nut Bars to be far more filling (they're bigger, so they're more filling). Also, they have large chunks of almonds, peanuts, and cashews, which provide a nice crunch amid the chewy bar.  They're a bit sticky, but if you hold the wrapper while you eat them, you're set.  Recommended.

review/summary: Nutty, chewy, sweet - what more do you want?
review/text: Our first impression of these was: Chewy! You see, they were delivered on a 90+ degree day, so they were really warm and chewy...which led to our second impression: Yum!<br /><br />You could actually see the nuts in the bars (see my photos), although it was mostly peanuts and some almonds--no cashews in sight. They tasted mostly of peanuts, though. The bars were sweet, but not overly sweet. It was a bit more satisfying than your typical run-of-the-mill granola bar because it was bigger (see my photo, compared to a dollar bill) and just felt heftier.<br /><br />Is this a truly healthy snack? Of course not. Is it better than a candy bar? Well, that depends what you mean by better, LOL.<br /><br />This is a tasty little morsel that is easy to throw in a bag for eating on-the-run (although I agree with another reviewer that they tend to be on the sticky side, so beware).

review/summary: Yummy but....
review/text: The packaging on the box compares this to a traditional granola bar, boasting that these are '30% bigger' than your average granola bar.  Yes, that's true. But I took the liberty of comparing the bars with an actual trail mix bar (the kind with nuts so it's a fair comparison), and here's what you get in that '30% more': 220 calories (as opposed to 140 in the comparison bar), more than TWICE as many fat calories, three times the saturated fat, almost three times the sodium.<br /><br />They're about equal in sugars and total carbs.<br /><br />On the winner side, this bar has more protein (7g as opposed to 3g) and three times the dietary fiber.<br /><br />It's also undeniably delicious.  Seriously, this is a yummmmmmmmmy bar.<br /><br />However, if you think that it's really a good replacement for a granola or health bar, think again. It's a candybar minus the chocolate.  It's salty and sweet in just the right proportions to be delectable, yes.  But it's not a 'granola bar'.<br /><br />Another irk: again, with the five bars per box. This is a rip-off, and a waste of packaging.  There is no way to pack five bars in your standard bar-box and not have some rattling around. It's obviously a scam, and it really irritates me. Charge me for the extra bar, for heaven's sake! I'd rather pay and eat than feel gypped.<br /><br />I could definitely see myself buying these bars again, but cutting them in half, and using them as a lunchtime treat.  Super yummy, but don't be fooled by the 'granola' hype.

review/summary: Very enjoyable, but a wee bit too sticky
review/text: I really enjoyed these bars - lots of nuts, held together in a soft, chewy formulation -- a nice change from the customary granola bar. Big pieces of nuts, which also is a nice change from the "nut dust" that you sometimes find in snack bars.<br /><br />The only negative, and the reason for the one star drop, is that it is really sticky. I tend to eat these types of bars on the run, and often don't have easy access to a wet nap to clean up. You have to be really careful to not get your hands on the bar, or you'll have very sticky fingers!<br /><br />Otherwise, great product. Hope they come out with one that has chunks of chocolate in it as well!

review/text: When I saw 'BIG' on the box, my first thought was the the nuts in the bar would be big and the product definitely delivers on that end.  It was almost more like a trail mix held together with peatnut butter, and not so much granola-y, with surprisingly large pieces of nuts.  As far as the bar being so much bigger than other granola bars, I wouldn't say that I particularly noticed it being huge, only that that it wasn't super tiny like bars seem to be getting these days, which I think is a good thing.  I hate opening up a little package to find it half filled with air and a tiny snack inside!  I liked the flavor, not too sweet, and would purchase them again if I saw them at the store.

The bar was very chewy and there is some crisp rice in it to add to the crunch.  It says the bar is 30% bigger than the leading nut and granola bar, but since I don't know which one that would be, I have to say I don't think these are particularly large.  I'm glad they aren't any bigger because each one is 220 calories.<br /><br />I like nuts and do like the taste of these, but I think I will probably stick to my plain almonds.

review/summary: Mr. Peanut, shame on you!
review/text: I was all excited to get these Planters Big Triple Nut Bars because the photo on the box looks like crispy peanut brittle studded with giant almonds and cashews. Even better, there's my good friend Mr. Peanut tipping his top hat with one white-gloved hand, holding his cane at a jaunty angle in the other. He's got such a big grin on his face, I know he's winking at me from behind that monocle! Yes, the box says "chewy granola bars", but I thought that would mean that they are both delicious AND healthy.<br /><br />Wrong! Mr. Peanut, how could you do this to me?<br /><br />First of all, the packaging is very deceptive. The box could hold 10 or 11 bars instead of 5. Yes, it's more than twice the volume of the product it holds and that is deceptive. The photo of the bar itself is enlarged approximately 100% so maybe that was the excuse. In reality, the bars are very small, weighing a tad over 1 1/2 ounces each and measuring about 1 1/4 inches wide by 4 3/4 inches long by 5/8 of an inch thick.<br /><br />The smell is okay, like roasted peanuts, pretty much what you would expect.<br /><br />But what about the taste?<br /><br />The flavor is pretty much one note, peanuts. That's the only thing I could taste. Normally, that would be a good thing because I love peanuts! Unfortunately, the peanuts taste stale and have an unpleasant aftertaste. The bars are also way too sweet and much too salty. (I had to brush my teeth and use mouthwash both to get rid of the taste.)<br /><br />I couldn't see any cashews or almonds in the bar at all. I did finally find one and a half very small almonds buried inside as I broke off each bite looking for the nuts. I couldn't identify any cashews by sight or by taste and I could identify the almonds only by sight and by the slight crunch, no almond flavor either.<br /><br />The texture (other than the tiny crunch from the almonds) is like soft peanuts mixed with cornmeal and coated in sticky soft goo. I really didn't enjoy the texture at all, it just didn't feel good on my teeth when biting down.<br /><br />I'm not surprised I couldn't tell the cashews from the peanuts but I couldn't even tell the oats from the peanuts by texture or taste and barely by sight because of the sticky goo.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know what was worse, the soft sticky texture or the cheap bitter peanut taste or the overwhelming sweetness or the heavy saltiness.<br /><br />Actually, I do know what is worse than all of that: the ingredient list and nutrition information. The box touts the 7 grams of protein but neglects to highlight the 12 grams of fat and 23 grams of carbohydrates. (An ounce is a little over 28 grams so that's quite a bit of fat and sugar.)<br /><br />The one good thing I see is a lot of vitamin E because of the tocopherols added as a flavor preservative.<br /><br />Other things that bother me are that the crisped rice is rice flour, sweeteners are listed eight times, and almonds and cashews are listed just before the under-1.5% ingredients. Since peanuts aren't really nuts (they're legumes), I think putting "Big Nut Bars" and "Triple Nut" on the package is very deceptive given the scarcity of the cashews and almonds and calling them granola bars is a bit of a stretch as well.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Peanuts<br />Corn syrup<br />Crisped rice (rice flour, sugar, malt extract, salt, caramel color, mixed tocopherols)<br />Peanut butter (roasted ground peanuts)<br />Sugar<br />Evaporated cane juice invert syrup<br />Whole grain rolled oats<br />Almonds<br />Cashews<br /><br />Contains less than 1.5% of:<br /><br />Whey (from milk)<br />Soy lecithin<br />Salt<br />Honey<br />Vegetable oil (peanut and/or cottonseed oil)<br />Resistant corn dextrin<br />Granola (whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, whole grain wheat, coconut, canola oil, wheat bran)<br />Xanthan gum<br />Mixed tocopherols<br /><br />Nutrition Information:<br /><br />Serving size one bar (46g or 1.62 oz)<br />Calories 220<br />Calories from Fat 100<br />Total fat 12g (18% of daily value)<br />Saturated fat 1.5g (8% of daily value)<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Polyunsaturated fat 3.5g<br />Monounsaturated fat 6g<br />Cholesterol 0%<br />Sodium 230mg 10%<br />Total carbohydrates 23g 8%<br />Dietary fiber 3g 12%<br />Sugars 13g<br />Protein 7g 7%<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 6%<br />Vitamin E 110%<br />Phosphorus 10%<br /><br />It may seem silly to give such a long review of these candy bars but I really felt let down by Planters, Kraft, and especially Mr. Peanut. I know these aren't gourmet brands but my experience is that they have consistently decent quality. It really seems like this product was just an excuse to use up low-quality and leftover ingredients by creating a sweet, salty snack food to make people fat and give them diabetes and cavities. Offhand, I can't think of a less enjoyable way to eat 220 calories especially when almost half of them are from fat.<br /><br />I'm sorry, Mr. Peanut, but I think it is kinder to be honest with you because we've been friends for such a long time. I would want you to tell me if I didn't taste good to you, either!

review/summary: Good but not a health bar
review/text: This is a nice size bar at a nice size calorie count too - 220 calories.<br /><br />It is tasty, sweet and savory at the same time.  It is larger than a comparable bar like Fiber One.<br /><br />Here is my comparison between Fiber One and Planters.  Obviously there is a little difference since the Planters Bar is larger:<br /><br />Planters-Honey Roasted Peanuts, almonds and cashews:<br /><br />46 grams in weight-1 bar<br />220 calories<br />Fat Calories 100<br />Total Fat 12 grams<br />Sat. Fat 1.5 grams<br />Total Carbs 23 grams<br />Sodium 230 mg<br />Fiber 3 grams<br /><br />Fiber One-Oats & Caramel:<br />40 grams in weight-1 bar<br />140 calories<br />Fat Calories 30<br />Total Fat 3.5 grams<br />Sat. Fat 1.5 grams<br />Total Carbs 30<br />Sodium 105 mg<br />Fiber 9 grams<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I liked the Planters Bar, but if you are trying to cut down on calories and fat and get some daily fiber, I would go with the Fiber One.<br /><br />I gave this product a 4 star rating in that it is not in my opinion a true Granola Bar.  I like it.  I think it tastes good, but probably it is not the healthiest choice.

review/summary: Could be nuttier
review/text: Our old friend Mr. Peanut is now in the granola bar business.<br />These bars contain peanuts, almonds and cashews, but since they're "honey roasted" and contain corn syrup, sugar, evaporated cane juice, and sugar, they are sweeter than this consumer would want, and the flavor of the nuts doesn't come through.  That said, they are only 220 calories, so could be a good quick snack with seven grams of protein (albeit 12 grams of fat, which one would expect from nuts).  If I were a suspicious sort, I'd wonder if the various sugars added so that the manufacturer can say that less than half the calories come from fat.

review/summary: Nice snack bar
review/text: Planters big nut bar has just the right mixture of sweet and salty flavoring.  Neither overpowers the other and makes for a pleasant tasting treat.  Each bar has seven grams of protein with 230mg of sodium and 13g of sugar.  These chewy granola style bars would make an excellent addition to any outdoor adventure or after school snack.  If you like nuts, this peanut almond cashew bar is well worth having on hand.

review/summary: DELICIOUS and well-sized.
review/text: These nut bars truly taste great, and the "30% bigger" size is just the right size for me for a snack.  They also strike the perfect balance between chewy and crunchy -- there's no gooey-ness, and they aren't too sticky.  A well conceived bar.<br /><br />I'd be happy with their taste even if they had a slightly lower salt content, but the sodium levels don't really raise any eyebrows.<br /><br />What I found interesting is that they use "mixed tocopherols" as flavor preservatives, which makes good chemical sense, as tocopherols are natural antioxidants, and this preservative (essentially Vitamin E) makes for a good nutritional supplement as well.  All I'd warn against is that since you can ingest too much Vit E, and these bars contain 110% of the USRDA (roughly 33IU) of Vit E, and many multivitamins have as much as 500% of the USRDA, it might not be wise to sit around and eat several boxes of these per day....<br /><br />....Even though they taste good enough to!  I'll be watching for these to come onto the snack market.  Great product!

review/summary: Great tasting candy bar
review/text: If you love candy bars like Payday or Pearson's Salted Nut Roll, then you'll want to try this one, too. It's more like a granola bar than a nut roll. Instead of nuts rolled around a nougat or caramel center, this bar has peanuts (and far fewer almonds and cashews) mixed in with rice and oats. Don't buy it if you're looking for a healthy snack; just try hard not to think about all the sugar (in 6 forms), salt, and fat (including cottonseed and coconut oils) the bar is loaded with as you enjoy this tasty treat.
