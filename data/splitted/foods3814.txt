review/text: I received the item today. The package and the outer box is completely fine. But the titles are in horrible shape. They are all broken, and the colors are mixed. Some titles are just half full. It looked like it was broken before, been returned and repacked.<br /><br />Totally upset. I should have gone with the powder version on ebay.

review/text: These macademia caramel clusters are irresistible!  I first tried them when a guest brought them with her from out west (her local Costco, I'm assuming, because Kirkland is a Costco brand), but I haven't been able to find them in the mid-Atlantic, only the mixed-nut caramel clusters, which are good but not the same without the luscious macademias.  The chocolate is pretty good in quality (as far as American chocolate goes anyway), and the salted caramel makes all the difference.  I guess it's a blessing they aren't available at any Costcos here, because I'd gain 10 pounds for sure!

review/summary: Stubborn cat loves it!
review/text: My cat loves the salmon flavor and pate texture of this food. She weighs 8 pounds and can eat about a third or fourth of a can at a time. I recommend stirring the food before giving it to the cat to release some of the aroma and make it easier for the cat to lick up.<br /><br />I've given her roasted chicken flavor, which she likes, but not as well. I've also tried beef flavor, which she absolutely won't touch. The salmon is always a hit!

review/summary: Great-looking on cupcakes
review/text: These are just slightly smaller than a dime, and look great on top of cupcakes.  I often tint my frostings and these are a fun accent.  There will be a few chipped ones in the bunch, but I like to stick them in almost vertically anyway for the most dramatic effect, w/ the chipped part down in the frosting.  They taste allright - it's about the look anyway.

review/text: I purchased these sprinkles to decorate a giant cupcake.  They were just as advertised and I received them promptly.  The colors are soft but vibrant and the size is as one reviewer said, "a little smaller than a dime." They just weren't as cute on the cupcake as I had hoped.  I found them to be too large to use as "sprinkles" but could definitely see using them in other ways.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when these arrived, as the sizes of the multi-color circles were very nice (not too small nor too large).  To date- I've found that they make great cupcake toppers,, they also make cute little rainbow circles on  one of the cake layers to give it some fun and dimension.  They're thin, but not too thin, they're not fragile but they certainly don't take over the tast of the icing on the cake, but they certainly do some pizzaz to the cake when finished.  I hope that each of you enjoy using these as much as me!

review/summary: Best grape juice out there.  No water or juice concentrates.
review/text: This is the best there is. From the color to the texture to the taste, Kedem concord grape is perfect. As a matter of fact, this grape juice is so real, that the taste and aroma are reminiscent of wine.  Of course, there is no alcohol in it.  The ingredients include grape juice, but no juice concentrates or water!  I don't think any other major brand can say that.  Other brands are also so syrupy sweet.  This one is not too sweet.  I like this glass bottle better than the 64 oz plastic bottle.  I drink it straight from the bottle.  It's definitely worth the higher price than other brands.

review/summary: Excellent Taste, High in Calories.
review/text: I picked up a bottle of Kedem Grape Juice (concord) at my local Fresh and Easy Market. I thought it was one of their concentrates, but when I got it home I found out it was just grape juice. That's okay, it was quite excellent concord grape juice, one of the best I've tried. Fine flavor. Delicious. It''s quite sweet, but it has no added sugar or any artificial sweeteners. My problem with it, which may not apply to other people, is that it's too high in calories (150 per 7-oz. serving). I can partly get around this by diluting it with a slightly carbonated water, but this dilutes the delicious flavor also. In any case, it's an excellent product and I highly endorse it if you can stand the high caloric content.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: GREAT ALL PURPOSE WINE MAKING YEAST, LOVE IT!
review/text: I have made about 12 batches of red wine with 8 grape varitals with Lalvin EC-1118 over the last year. Every batch has started quickley and fermented to completion with no problems. I do not sterilyze my equipment or use any chemicals. I start the must at about 75 degrees and let it find it's own temperature balance after that. This yeast is so vigorus that nothing strange seems to ever be able to get started. I scatter the yeast on the must as soon as I have in in the stainless soup kettle, let it float on top for 15 minutes and then stir it in. I always adjust my sugar for 15% alcohol. About brix 26. This will take awhile to complete fermentation. About 2-3 months due to the high sugar content, but the wine has all been great. So much better then any commercial wine I have tried that I no longer want to buy wine. I went to a wine tasting recently. These were $30-$40 dollar a bottle wines. They were so far inferior to what I make that they gaged me.<br />Larry Dennis

review/text: EC-1118<br />Saccharomyces bayanus<br /><br />Origin<br />The EC-1118 strain was isolated, studied and selected from Champagne fermentations. Due to its competitive factor and ability to ferment equally well over a wide temperature range, the EC-1118 is one of the most widely used yeasts in the world.<br /><br />Oenological properties and applications<br />The fermentation characteristics of the EC-1118 -- extremely low production of foam, volatile acid and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) -- make this strain an excellent choice. This strain ferments well over a very wide temperature range, from 10� to 30�C (50� to 86�F) and demonstrates high osmotic and alcohol tolerance. Good flocculation with compact lees and a relatively neutral flavor and aroma contribution are also properties of the EC-1118.<br /><br />The EC-1118 strain is recommended for all types of wines, including sparkling, and late harvest wines and cider. It may also be used to restart stuck fermentations.<br /><br />An excellent choice for champagnes and late harvest wines. Also a very good choice for dry whites.

review/text: These are good quality Wasabi Peanuts. I've been a fan of wasabi covered products for sometime. Even if the toppings might not be exactly wasabi (more likely some sort of mustard powder), this product is hot and tasty. There is something good about the spice and bite of the wasabi and the creamy nutty flavor of the peanut together. Good bargain at around $25.00 for about five pounds. Sure, you'll have these around for sometime, but seeing as it's difficult finding a consistent local source for this product, it's a smart buy if you're passionate about these little green nuggets. Enjoy!

The strawberry jam is excellent, too.<br /><br />Real fruit taste and no food coloring or preservatives (no syrups, no processed sugar), just strawberries, concentrated grape juice and fruit pectin.<br /><br />The texture of this delightful conserve is different from jam or marmalade, not as thick, more like between jelly and jam, and the flavor is fruitier. You can definitely taste the strawberries.<br /><br />A very good choice for those with a sweet tooth who don't want or can't eat highly processed sugars.<br /><br />Great product from France.<br /><br />The lil' jars are very useful for storing spices, individual salad dressing for the lunch box, etc., and also for non food things like beads, powders, and many other craft items.<br /><br />TIP: A few of these little jars in a cellophane bag with a nice ribbon make a lovely present.

However... the 48 pack for THIS specific flavor (Strawberry) does not give you a full jar. I've ordered the pomegranate/red raspberry flavor and those jars are full to the brim. When you turn the strawberry jars upside down, you see that they are only half full. Be aware of this before you order! I only ordered them in these packs because I was planning to give them away as favors. Now I can't return them and I have to order more of the pom/rasp. If you are just buying for the house, you are better off buying larger jars.

review/text: I first tasted these when I got some free samples in a DAS order for salt (also very good).  The caramels are amazing.  I bought this box as a gift for a friend.  She shared a few and then quickly tucked away the rest for herself.  She loved them!  They are rich and fresh and have a wonderful hint of orange and a little crunch and spice of salt.  Just one thing to note -- the 4 oz. box is very small -- there are a good number of small pieces inside, but the box is just a few inches tall by 2 or 3 inches wide.  I would order them again.

review/summary: An Unfortunate Misleading...
review/text: I purchased two varieties, including this one. I've heard much praise for Das Foods' goods, but the caramels did not stand out in any way. The taste of fleur de sel was unnoticeable and the product indeed looks like the first and second photos given- there is no coarse salt on top of any of the caramels like the third pic. The second flavor I purchased showed me that they are not generous with their ingredients. It's a shame when disappointment in an item leads you to patronize someone else's business online... :(

review/summary: Works for me - at half dose.
review/text: I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up.

review/summary: Not bad but not as shown or named
review/text: Pros:  (1) It arrived in very good condition; (2) It will take some work but could become a decent bonsai. I like this because I want to create my own bonsai from a pre-bonsai. (3) I would buy another from Brussels if the price is right but I want a picture of exactly what I am buying.<br /><br />Cons: (1) Mine was NOT as shown. The one shown had nice nebari & branching, mine turned out to be an exposed root style and overgrown. (2) It is as stated in the description as a Buxus Microphylla 'Dwarf Saunders' which I actually like because it is small but faster growing than a true Kingsville - a Buxus Microphylla `Compacta`.  So this is as much pro as con. But should be made clear by the seller just what it is and also if a 'Dwarf Saunders' is a varietal, a cross breed or what.<br /><br />Summary: Put in the correct photo, provide the correct detailed botanical name, do not imply that it is a true Kingsville.  It is fairly priced, not a super deal.

review/summary: A Great Specimen in Need of Carefull Pruning
review/text: The Kingsville Boxwood is considered by many to be the granddaddy of deciduous bonsai. This one arrived securely without one single peanut, a welcome first for Brussel's. The tree sent has a trunk at least as thick as the one pictured on Amazon, but it is in desperate need of pruning. I would call this closer to a pre-bonsai than a finished one which isn't a problem for true bonsai people, but the price is fitting to a well trimmed tree. As an outdoor bonsai it important to know that boxwoods need a dormant period burried outside or in an unheated garage, and not everyone has that.

review/summary: Wild Turkey 101 is a sophisticated and lovely bourbon at a good price.
review/text: I love Wild Turkey.  The Russel father-son team are talented distillers.  Turkey 101 is fairly inexpensive mass market hooch and I've been tasting top drawer stuff lately.  How would it hold up?  Quite well, as you will see:<br /><br />Color in the glass:  medium bronze-amber.<br /><br />Toffee fruity sherry nose w/ salted roasted peanut note.  With more time the fruit takes on a meaty quality - bacon.  There's more grape sherry or Madeira notes too.  There's also a solvent note that carries burnt rubber. With even more time I get a bit more burnt rubber to go with the roast peanut, bacon, and Madeira cocktail.  I like that it's distinctive and unique.  I could learn to love it, but it's not the aroma profile I would have said I wanted in advance.<br /><br />Entry is toffee sweet and richly honeyed with an immediate drying midpalate. Peppery with a beer-like tang of herbs with a bitter edge like hops and a whiff of smoke (that is oddly absent in the finish).  Theres a kiss of vanilla after extra airing and some of that nice sherry flavor too. Sweet then off dry with herbal notes.  I've been seeing that lately with fancier offerings like Woodford and 4 Roses single barrel.  I suspect its a higher rye balance in the mashbill.<br /><br />Finish is long and spare with spirit heat beer malt and hops echo.  Elegant, lean, surprisingly drinkable with an interesting and varied flavor profile.  Gives up a little to the best in the areas of flavor intensity, and wood notes but holds it's own as an interesting robust and varied bourbon.  Excellent value.

I appreciate having single-serve salmon packets because I don't want to eat tuna every day.  This provides some variety.  I have eaten several of these packets and don't recall a specific flavor from the seasoning.  I typically mix this salmon in with other foods, such as macaroni and cheese, or mix in crushed kale chips.  Packets are lighter than cans and fit in my limited luggage space better.

review/summary: It's Really a Cookie!
review/text: These are tasty and I am enjoying one with my morning coffee break while I write this, but reading the nutrition facts and the ingredients list on the package, I have to think that this is more of a tasty and somewhat healthy cookie than a substitute for breakfast. According to the package, a serving is four biscuits which adds up to 230 calories. Though that includes 3 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, it also includes 13 grams of sugar and 8 grams of fat.<br /><br />They are good, tasting like a nice butter cookie with just a hint of cinnamon and apple. Still, I think I'll be more likely to have one from time to time as a little treat with my morning coffee or after dinner than to substitute a package for breakfast. There I'd more likely chose a low-fat fruit yogurt which would have more than twice the protein, less sugar and fat, and less calories.

Though I wouldn't have these for breakfast on a regular basis, the 230 calories for four "biscuits" is reasonable, and the taste is certainly satisfying. Mostly I like the convenience of this product; they're a good option when one is in a hurry or on the run. They're also good for a mid morning pick me up.<br /><br />The apple cinnamon Belvitas could have  a bit more cinnamon in the recipe; I could barely detect any hint of cinnamon in there. If one is trying these for the first time, I'd recommend the blueberry Belvitas for better taste.

review/text: Although this is a negative review, you will not find a bigger fan of Celestial Seasonings tea than me, which is why this variety of tea disappointed me so. The original blend without white tea was so much better. It was a perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. This new blend, on the other hand, tastes like lawn mower clippings. I would expect that from Bigelow or Yogi tea, but not my beloved Celestial Seasonings. Although I can understand the desire for innovation, sometimes the adage holds true: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." CS had the perfect forumula before, and they ruined it. Sadly, I will have to break my monogamous relationship with CS and try other brands of green tea. Good thing that I received a free sample of this tea to try and didn't waste my hard-earned money on a whole package of it.

Now, they've gone and messed with it, adding white tea for "smoothness."  Well, if I wanted white tea, I'd BUY white tea (and it would be silver needle organic).<br />Was so disappointed to get the box, and discover that the pure, lightly vegetal green tea taste was gone. Am bummed that they changed the blend, to say the least. Worst part is, the new blend doesn't taste as good as Stash's "Fusion," which is also a green/white mix...<br />Please bring back our green tea, Celestial Seasonings!

review/summary: Avoid, a horrible green tea
review/text: I have been drinking tea for years. This particular blend of green and white tea by the folks at Celestial Seasonings is quite possibly the worst cup of tea I have ever had. Green tea naturally has a grassy kind of taste to it, but it is very light and hidden behind the smooth, sweet, and slightly bitter taste the rest of the flavor produces. I love the taste of a solid green tea, however this is anything but. I don't know what exactly went wrong with this blend of green and white, but the final product remains consistant no matter how many times I try to give CS a chance to prove it was just a bad batch I have recieved. The smoothness and slightly sweet flavor is totally gone and you are left with nothing, NOTHING but bitter grass. I am not a particularly picky tea drinker folks, I can tell you of the kind I have had which is better than the others, but I still can find enjoyment in most teas I consume. This particular brand is just totally unpleasing to the pallet in every way and there is no way I can possibly recommend you avoid it enough.

review/summary: I Love The Smooth Well Rounded Taste...Great Value Too
review/text: Amazon was out of my regular green tea so I picked up a box of this Celestial Green Tea with White Tea at the store to hold me over.  I LOVE IT!!! It's very smooth without that very slight "tang" (or bitter) note at the end.  I'm very careful about making my tea.  I use very hot water but NOT boiling.  It's important to NOT "burn" the tender tea which can effect taste and destroy some of the antioxidents.  I have a whistle tea pot so put water on the stove and do my thing until I hear the whistle blow, take the tea pot off the burner, set my oven timer for 10 mins and let the water cool down before pouring it over the tea pouch.  Many brands just say pour boiling water over tea bag...uggg.  You have to remember that green tea is just black tea in the very early stages of leafing out....just as the name implies....green leaf stage.  In any event, for my taste, Clestial Green Tea with White Tea is excellent. This is an amazing value compared to buying tea in a supermarket AND free shipping and an ADDITIONAL SAVINGS over the listed price if you buy through Subscribe And Save.  For those who might be a little hesitant to try letting Amazon automatically deduct money from your debit or credit card on a regular basis, it's a great option.  I've used Subscribe And Save for a few years now and love it.  They send you an e-mail well before each transaction to let you know a debit to your account is coming. You can decide how often you want a delivery..once a month or every 2,3 or 4 months.  You can change delivery dates anytime you want to which also changes when your payment option is charged, you can order extra shipments whenever you want to with no shipping charge even though the order is under $25, and you can cancel any time you choose so try it for your first shipment and if you don't like the tea cancel.  It's a great savings and you never run out because you forgot to order.  In my opinion it's great tea at a fantastic price.

review/summary: Why the white tea blend?
review/text: I really cannot emphasize how disappointed I am with Celestial Seasoning's having ruined its perfectly good green tea. The company has apparently totally eliminated production of plain green tea in favor of blends with white tea. On the box it says "with White Tea for Smooth Taste."<br /><br />Smooth taste my foot -- the white tea bitters it.<br /><br />Can you imagine if you're a Folgers drinker 3 times a day for 10 years and then all of the sudden Folgers adds Essence of Municipal Garbage to its coffee? Yeah -- that's what celestial seasonings did to me. Thanks, guys!<br /><br />You forced me to go Bigelow!

review/summary: I Really Enjoy This Tea
review/text: I've been drinking Celestial Seasonings for some time now. I enjoy mixing the Green Tea with one of the others that has a bit more flavor. I usually mix it with Apple Cranberry (Celestial Seasonings always) or one of the others that is close to Apple Cranberry. I'm not a coffee drinker, so the Green Tea gives me a little added boost for this Grandmax7 :-)...and the Cranberry Flavors give it the extra taste, my daily ritual!

review/text: This is my favorite variety of green tea.  Some brands of green tea seemed to give me an upset stomach for some reason.  I'm not sure if the white tea addition to this green tea makes it less harsh for my system or what, but I can drink it with no problems.  I also really like the flavor. It still tastes like green tea to me.  I've never had the "original" blend before the addition of the white tea, but I really enjoy the green and white tea mixture.<br /><br />I also just read an article stating the great health benefits of white tea.

There are no green peppercorns in them, which of course is good for your peppermill (green peppercorns will corrode the gears).<br /><br />The only quibble I have is there were a disappointing number of already-broken peppercorns among them, as opposed to other brands I have purchased. That said, the flavor and aroma is quite good.

With Subscribe & Save the price is significantly better and I received all the grocery items in two days from the Nevada distribution center.<br /><br />The Roland Five Peppercorn Blend has a pungent, exotic flavor that's different from my regular retail store purchase. It takes some getting used to and now we like it. The Jamaican all spice is much larger than the other peppers. Overtime I'd learned to give the grinder a good shake when the all spice corns get stuck and it works okay. These peppers are fresh and of good quality.

review/summary: Sesame Snaps From Heaven
review/text: When I first tried these confections many years ago (in the early 90's) I instantly loved them. They are toasted sesame seeds bound together with a honey glazing. That is all - honey and sesame seeds. But boy are they good and addictive. The only negative side to this treat is that the four individual wafers contained in each package tend to stick together and sometimes they do not break away cleanly from each other. This is to be expected though given the nature of the ingredients and is a small inconvenience. The product is made in, of all places, Poland and I find it gratifying to be able to purchase a product from a country that has come so far, economically and socially, in the last 20 years. If you want a simple, delicious, and nutritious confection, look no further - this is it.

review/text: I bought these originally thinking they were honey and sesame.  As it turns out, they are sugar and sesame.  They do taste great but traditionally this type of snack should have honey instead of sugar.  If you are looking for a honey and sesame snack, there are others available through Amazon that contain honey instead of sugar, among those are [Joyva Sesame Crunch Candy].  If you are looking for a sugar alternative snack that is all natural, that is your best bet.
