review/summary: Yummy Gluten Free Cereal
review/text: This is one of the only Gluten Free cereals that my children and I can eat and not feel like we are "missing out" on flavor.  I love this cereal because it is not only Gluten Free, for my son, but it isn't sweetened with sugar (sugar beets or cane sugar, both of which cause my daughter and me to have headaches.)  So for people with food allergies this is a great cereal!  My only complaint is that this cereal doesn't last long at our house! :)

review/text: These taste just like Kellogg's� Rice Krispies� cereal. The obvious difference is that these are marketed gluten free! There are no gluten containing ingredients; let's hope there's also no cross contamination with US Mills' other products.<br /><br />These 10 ounce boxes don't last long, at least for me. Their small size does make this a convenient choice for traveling -- just add milk from the continental breakfast buffet at your hotel and you have a gluten free comfort food wherever you happen to be. :)

review/summary: We love this cereal!
review/text: We started eating this cereal when one of my children had multiple allergies, including wheat and corn. It was one of the few processed foods he could eat. Now he's outgrown almost all of his allergies, and most breakfast cereals are fine, but we keep ordering this because we all love it. The brown rice makes it so much more flavorful than other rice cereals, and I love that the ingredient list is short and free of questionable ingredients. And while they aren't exactly healthy, this is the best cereal for marshmallow crispy rice treats!

review/summary: Reasonable flavor, not much nutrition
review/text: I have been purchasing these for my wife.  She was recently diagnosed with Celiac and already had child onset diabetes.  She was eating Kellogs cornflakes for about 20 years, once or twice a day, but quit because Kellogs could not confirm gluten free corn flakes (because they use the same equipment in processing whole grain products).<br />After a few months of these her hair started falling out, probably because of a lack of folic acid and possibly some other essential vitamins or minerals.  Upon further review, we realized that, for a cereal, this product is severely lacking in nutrition.  It cannot compare to most main stream cereals out there, but probably does as well as other gluten free cereals.  We chose to take our chances with Kelloggs Corn flakes, but she is still eating these occasionally.<br />What else are we going to do with 16 boxes!  ;-)  Since switching back to Corn flakes , her hair has stopped falling out and some new hair growth is being observed.

review/summary: A GOOD PURE BREAKFAST and or SNACK with NO SIDE EFFECTS
review/text: AS OF Sept. 20th, 2011, I REVISED MY STATEMENT ABOUT THE GREED OF AMAZON AND EREWHON!!<br /><br />We are Happy to have, FINALLY, a GOOD HEALTHY CEREAL that is GREAT for Breakfast, and a SUPER ANYTIME SNACK, with NO SIDE EFFECTS! {remember folks, Do NOT LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR. They know NOTHING about Gluten and Dairy} If you eat this product, and have effects, it's the MILK your using. If they say your alergic to Gluten, you are alergic TO MILK and Dairy. I know.<br /><br />Seems EVERY CEREAL these days contain Crap. Either dairy or a derivative of, gluten, which is NO GOOD for the body, even if your healthy, or Tons of Sugar, which NONE OF US NEED!<br />So, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Product!<br />Over 20 years of NO Breakfast Cereal, until this came along. BUT, PLEASE BEWARE of the OTHER CEREALS from this company. Especially if you have reactions to wheat or gluten.<br /><br />For breakfast, use RICE MILK and a Fruit. Either banana or blueberries. Fresh Blueberries are the BEST when in season. Whatever you do, DON'T BUY BLUEBERRIES from the store right now. They are OLD and STALE and TASTELESS!<br />Besides, they are RIPPING OFF THE PUBLIC. These stores DOUBLED THE PRICE and are giving LESS THAN HALF of what you normally get during season. Best is if you have a PICK YOUR OWN FARM in your area.<br />Anyhow, I give this product 110% VOTE for GOODNESS!<br />Thanks so MUCH for this product.<br />(And a THANK YOU to Amazon for NOT BEING GREEDY about price and shipping. It's my HOPE that you keep it the way it is.) &lt;----my statement in the beginning &lt;-------------------------<br />****MY REVISION, Dated Sept. 20, 2011**********  Amazon and Erewhon GOT GREEDY! There prices ARE MUCH HIGHER than when we signed up. Seems each month now, the price GOES UP! And now, it's NOT WORTH Buying BULK, because we DON'T GET BULK PRICE anymore. So it's just as easy to go to the grocery store, and pay the 4.00/box, as opposed to buying 12 boxes, and still paying almost 4.00/box, here on Amazon. The box got pretty, BUT WE DON'T EAT THE DANG BOX!<br />Matter of fact, we DON'T EVEN READ THE BOX. Sheeeez PEOPLE, GET REAL ALREADY! You can buy a box of rice crispies for HALF in the grocery store. And that cereal has all kinds of sugars and junk, which COSTS MORE $$. So tell me, how much does PLAIN BROWN RICE COST???????????????????  "NOT HAPPY A CUSTOMER ANYMORE"!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3AI">Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice Cereal, Gluten Free, Organic, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Vinegar base
review/text: Cooks should be aware that these are ripe olives pickled in a vinegar-based brine, not the plain California-style black olives. The vinegar style is often hard to find in a sliced form, so these are great for highly flavored Mediterranean dishes (these make a good pasta sauce with the addition of only some snipped chives and a little cream, for example). For dishes where bland black olives canned without vinegar are needed, however, these are too biting in flavor to be useful. For example, they are unsuitable for many Mexican dishes. The olives aren't entirely sliced, either. The rings haven't been sorted after processing, making only about half the can's contents presentable as garnish; the other half of the can is filled with small chopped pieces, so these would be better described as salad olives than as rings. Sorting out the whole rings takes longer than it would require to slice whole olives into rings oneself.

review/summary: Worth the Price but hard to find!
review/text: My cat gets a combination of wet food in the morning and dry in the evening (sometimes dry in with the wet in the morning if we don't have his normal wet food). I don't know that I would call him a picky eater but I do know that since I put him on this dry food minimal hairballs, his weight has come down (he was at 15lb now down to 11), his coat is beautiful, and the vet says he is super healthy. I did go with a cheaper, easier to find dry food when we ran out of this once before and never again! His coat got duller and hairballs galore! Now the biggest problem is actually finding this brand and specific type for him. Because he doesn't get tons of this, a 7lb bag will last at least 2 months so I don't get the bigger bag, but if you try it and only feed dry food, I would go with a larger size bag. All in all, we love it!

review/text: My cats are picky eaters, but I've never seen them completely snub a brand of food!  I mixed it with their old food so they could get used to eat, and they would literally eat everything in the bowl except for this food.  If I put a bowl of just AvoDerm out, they would not eat anything.  I thought they would eventually get desperate and try it, but they refused to even do that.<br /><br />Maybe some cats like avocado, but mine certainly don't! It was so bad, I actually had to return it (never had to do that before).

review/summary: Warms you up on cold winter night!
review/text: I bought this because it was a bit cheaper than Gran Marnier and I like trying different orange liqueurs. Not quite as good, but still a suitable choice.<br /><br />Unlike Grand Marnier it does not possess a beautiful amber color, but rather is clear. I do like to serve it neat in a brandy snifter, so Patr&oacute;n Citronge is definitely a bit dull in comparison. It does have a nice light syrupy consistency that I like, but it's not so sweet that it's overwhelming. A few years back I tried Cointreau and I found it so disappointing as it was a bit too syrupy, almost medicinal.<br /><br />I enjoy the mild orange essence of Patr&oacute;n Citronge. It's sweet but lacks the strong citrus bite of some triple secs. I definitely feel a slight burn on my initial sip. When it hits my palette the orange flavor comes through, before it finishes with a final burst of heat.<br /><br />Compared to Grand Marnier, it's much more subtle. That liqueur, since it's cognac based, literally clears up my entire sinus cavity. Not so with Patr&oacute;n Citronge. It definitely is warming and a wonderful liqueur to sip on a cold day, but it's a bit more generic experience.

It has just the right amount of salt and is the perfect thinness, size and shape, and has the exact amount of oiliness that a chip should have. Magnificent! Most of the time I eat them plain because they are so good, but sometimes I dip them in salsa (oh so good) or guacamole (ok, they are a bit thin and break off in the guac, but I can live with that because I LOVE that they are thin - remember, they are the PERFECT thinness - I wouldn't change a thing).

review/text: My aunt used to bring or send me an advent calendar with Kinder chocolates from Germany for Christmas every year when I was a kid.  Now I share Kinder chocolates with my kids while we mark the days on our advent calendar.  It's a tradition I'm passing on and it would not be the same without these incredible chocolates!!  My kids fell in love at first bite just like I did years ago.  Kinder is awesome.  Order early though, since they took a while to arrive (at least around the Christmas holiday).  But they were perfectly packaged and preserved when I received them.

review/summary: Poor packaging
review/text: The product is normally great, but the way it was packaged was a poor display and made the product melt and unetable.  Very disapointed and will not purchase from this company again.<br /><br />Was told it was coming UPS but instead it was put in the UPS bag then boxed and sent in the normal post office mail.

review/summary: Great chocolates, great price
review/text: I was searching online for foreign sweets, and came upon these assorted chocolates. They were the best deal I could find on something that contained Kinder Bueno, so I placed my order. Not only did I get to my Kinder Bueno, I got several other varieties. They shipped impressively fast, and arrived in perfect condition. The box it comes in is pretty cool too: you can easily reach in and grab one or two and slide it back closed.

review/text: I can't say this enough. I LOVE KINDER. I grew up with them and being able to buy them while in the U.S. without having to drive 50 miles to a little European store that sells them was very nice. They are pretty expensive, but they shipped pretty fast and surprisingly enough they lasted me quite a bit and I'm a piggy when it comes to chocolate. Would get it again, and again and again.

review/text: If you like Chocolate, You love Kinder Chocolate. Its not so easy to find here in the states, so having it shipped is a little costly, but its great to treat yourself on occasion. I used to get Kinder from the Candy trucks that used to drive though our neighborhood in Germany just like the the Ice Cream trucks do, and I always choose the Kinder Eggs rather than the Ice Cream trucks. If you havent had Kinder Chocolate, you have to try it !! Really ... you'll love it!!

I ended up calling my daughters into the room and we sat and enjoyed the candy together.  I guess I'll have to buy these again to put in stockings for Christmas. Oh darn! :)

review/text: This is a pretty small box with little pieces of candy. I expected that because I read the reviews, but I just want to make sure that other people realize that. I still feel that the price is pretty good because Kinder is generally pricey in the US.<br /><br />The reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5, is because the chocolates were melted when they arrived. They are still edible, but squishy, and I think it ruins the texture of the product. The box was labeled as fragile and had "chocolate" written in marker on the side, but I wish they could figure out a different way to ship the product so that that it doesn't end up melting.

review/text: Although I love kinder, I ordered this to accompany a birthday gift for someone and it came later than expected. The main issue I have however is that the picture is deceptive because it gives no sense of the scale of the product- it was far too small for the price it was sold at. The chocolate was nice, but this was an extortion and You could easily buy triple the weight in chocolate for the same price at the store.<br />Slightly disappointing

review/text: I wouldn't buy this product again, it isn't bad chocolate, but it isn't great chocolate either.  Truthfully, Hershey's tastes much better.  The box is neat, so, if you're looking for a new type of gift for someone, then it is worth a try because it is German chocolate, especially for a child.  A child would enjoy this.  A chocolate lover would rather have Wockenfuss chocolates.

review/summary: Handy to have in the Pantry.
review/text: My wife and I have been trying to eliminate snacks of the junk variety from the house. It's impossible, of course. One thing we try to do is limit our snacks and have snacks around that carry some nutritional value. One such item are these little packets of Sun-Maid Natural California Raisins. An individual pack is low in calories, tasty and high in nutrition. We use them for all sorts of things and I carry them to work in my noontime lunch. In addition, they're excellent to take along on camping trips. Now and then a recipe turns up that requires a small amount of raisins and one or two of these little boxes often fill the bill. These are handy things to have in the pantry.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I love these puffs. They're crunchy and delicious and sooo flavorful. My local health food store is always out of these, so I'm delighted to find them here.<br /><br />I was just reading that Barbara's Bakery participates in the non-GMO project, so that's a huge plus. I hope that means that this product is non-GMO.<br /><br />They also don't have any MSG (under that name or any other name that I can spot). That stuff is a cheap flavor enhancer, but this brand uses real food to enhance the flavor. What a novel idea!  They don't have any artificial food coloring, either.<br /><br />I guess there is a difference between snack food and junk food, and this actually tastes better than the stuff I grew up eating!

review/text: I am not a fan of cheese puffs.  The popular brand one can purchase in supermarkets is way too cheesy for me.  And too puffy as well.<br /><br />When I recently ordered Barbara's shredded wheat (a treat for my pet chinchilla, I don't eat it myself), I thought I'd throw in this selection as a treat for myself as well.  I'm glad I did!<br /><br />These puffs are not oversized.  But especially nice is that they are a combination of blue and aged cheddar cheeses which produces a very pleasant taste.  The flavor of the jalapeno peppers is very mild, just a hint of it.  I also like the fact that sea salt is used, and some paprika extract.<br /><br />These puffs meet my standards of excellence.  Next time I order more shredded wheat, I will be adding them to the order as well.

I gave a bag to some friends and they liked it.<br /><br />If you are looking for Flamin' Hot kick, these don't have it. More peppery if anything. Okay cheese flavor.

review/text: I'm a little surprised there are no other user reviews.  "Deep" curry powder, which I've purchased at Indian markets, is wonderful.  Note how its list of ingredients isn't dominated by salt, as most others are.  The spices it is composed of are varied and of good quality, and they lend a lot of depth.  There's heat, but even the most sensitive American palates can accommodate it in doses sufficient to bring out the spices.  Good stuff, and cheap when purchased in these bulk bags.  I recommend it highly.

I don't buy anything with artificial ingredients and have resigned to only buying American-made products.  We use Crunchy Puffs for a light and crunchy snack, or as a treat for a job well done. My dog LOVES them and I like the fact that they are healthy, with limited ingredients and *MADE IN USA*.<br /><br />As with previous review, I stumbled on them at Costco, but you can't always count on Costco carrying what you want all the time, so I'm so happy to find them on Amazon!<br /><br />Great product!

These are a bit pricey but well worth it.<br /><br />If you buy several items at one time you can get free shipping and you then wind up saving money in the long run.  I have to travel a fair distance to buy gluten free items.  If I can get the same items for less money and  free shipping then to save on gas and time it is wonderful and to have it delivered to my door in just a few days is a bonus.

review/summary: Good Bagged Pu-erh
review/text: Is this cheap, "Heck, no."<br /><br />Is this good, "Yes!"<br /><br />Pu-erhs (ooo-air)are made into little (or big) cakes of tea, and then allowed to ferment (rot).  Bad Pu-erh tastes like tea left to rot.  This definitely does not.  It has a warm oak flavor.<br /><br />Pu-erhs are "double-fermented".  Tea makers let the tea oxidize like black tea, and then form the leaves into cakes.  Pu-erhs take awhile to ferment; they actually have vintages like wine and can be as old as 40 or 50 years.  Because of the longer processing time, pu-erhs are generally more expensive, so this isn't a bad price for pu-erh, although it is a little pricey for tea.<br /><br />This is good pu-erh for other reasons:  unless you have a tea diffuser, you can't make pu-erh teas--they're not generally sold in bags.  If you're not really into buying a lot of tea accoutrement, e.g., an American, these bags are a real find.<br /><br />Each one will more than handily make 3 or 4 cups of tea when steeped in a several cup teapot--or you can steep repeatedly for a different taste with each cup.

review/text: This tea taste is good.Sometimes I add agave to it however not a neccessity.I drink it cold and hot.I find that I really don't want my coffee if I drink it in the morning.I am not sure if it is doing what Dr.Oz said it was good for which was to eat fat cells, I do know that I feel pretty good after drinking it. Good tea, especially if you are wanting off the fifty cup coffee thing a day. Also the seller sent a box of white tea with it, I guess some type of sell, I did not pay extra for it,but they sure have gain themselves a customer with their white tea also, which i believe is suppose to block fat cell(can't remember for sure).It taste good though.

review/text: i was honestly a little afraid to try this tea because it gets so many mixed reviews in general and especially after reading about pu-erh's fermentation process.  But I am so glad that i didn't let all of that discourage me.  This is a very smooth, rich, full-bodied tea that satisfies someone like me who drinks lots of bold dark coffee.  It definitely has a very earthy taste that is very invigorating any time of the day.  I used to think that black tea was my favorite but that has definitely changed!!  What makes this specific brand better as well is the fact that the seller is extremely fast at shipping the item!!

I can tell you that this tea has made me feel sooooo much better! I mean I used to feel sluggish and constipated (sorry) not any more. It turns out this specific tea was reviewed on Dr. Oz (youtube it) as the best tea to drink first thing in the morning to loose weight. So far this is true. Add a very very small amount of honey and you are all set. Doesnt taste like anything and doesnt make your stomach run. Do it!

review/text: This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again. It is a 2 pound bag of white salt that has a fake hickory smell. It is small crystals, about the size of table salt crystals. My guess is that they tried to infuse flavor into the salt rather than smoking it. The hickory flavor is very faint, and very fake tasting. You are much better off buying real smoked salt, such as Gourmet Hickory Smoked Sea Salt by The Spice Lab Inc. I am not in any way affiliated with The Spice Lab - I bought their salt simultaneously with Faerie's Finest in order to compare the two. Not only is it inferior to The Spice Lab, but Faerie's Finest is the worst smoked salt I have tasted.

review/summary: Tasty and convenient
review/text: First - Amazon's price seems excessive - I just returned from my local grocery which had these on sale for $0.75 a box.<br /><br />The product itself is wonderful. It tastes similar to the packets of instant ramen you'd cook on a stove top - much better than those styrofoam "Instant Lunch" or "Cup Noodles". And there is no need to boil water here - in fact cold water is probably desirable. Simply add cold tap water and microwave for 4 minutes (no stirring or whatever) and it's ready to eat. It's just like making Easy Mac.<br /><br />Sodium content is a bit high (as is the case with all instant/quick noodles) but I imagine the seasoning packet is the largest culprit. You can use less without sacrificing much taste at all.

review/summary: The Best Instant Ramen I have had
review/text: This brand is so much better even though it cost a dollar instead of twenty five cents. You just pop it in the microwave and don't have to put it in a pan on the stove. Takes only four minutes and I don't know why everyone is having trouble with the water going over, I like extra broth so I put my water way over the line that your suppose to do and I have no problem. Love this flavor. I can't eat anything spicy or it messes with my stomach and the plain chicken flavor there is no spicy to it. I live off this stuff and its not because it is cheap which it is but because I just love the broth and noodles. I never buy them from here though but had to put in a review for it because it is so yummy.

I have tried and liked other flavors--Teriyaki Beef and Savory Soy Sauce, for example--but this one is my favorite because I can apply various hot sauces to the noodles in addition to the flavor packet and dehydrated vegetables packet, and this does not overpower the flavors of the specific hot sauces that I am using.  I do not like to eat too much at breakfast, and this product provides me with just enough food whenever starting my day.  It does not take too much time to prepare it, and I find it to be a satisfying, recommendable product.

review/summary: Better than cup noodles at least
review/text: Since it's practically impossible to find good yakisoba short of flying to an area with an actual Japantown, I bought these to see if it would be a suitable alternative however I am somewhat disappointed. The texture is indeed better than the cheap 25cent Maruchan cup ramen noodles at your local supermarket and the fact that it comes with some cabbage and toppings is a plus. However, the taste has been "Americanized" to the point where you really can't tell that these noodles are supposed to be yakisoba. The chicken flavoring packet is similar to the one that you would find in most other chicken cup ramen so I wasn't overly thrilled with it.<br /><br />If you don't absolutely need "instant" noodles, you can save money by just going to Costco and purchasing the Top Ramen (the ones that you need to boil) and minimize the amount of water used to boil the noodles (so as to get a "drier" noodle). The taste and texture is comparable to these Maruchan yakisoba bowls.<br /><br />If you want a more accurate yakisoba taste, I would instead try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028PDFQG">Myojo Ippeichan Yakisoba Japanese Style Instant Noodles, 4.77-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 6)</a>. They tend to cost a little more per bowl but the taste and texture is more authentic and you do get some vegetable toppings as well.

review/text: Recently on a trip to England, my wife and I took the train from London to Hampton Court.  When you hop off at the station in Hampton Court (Surrey), there is a food stand where the proprietor sells tea, coffee, bacon and sausage baps, etc.  Anyhow, he makes his cafe mocha with Cadbury's Drinking Chocolate, which I had never seen or thought of before.  Well let me tell you, it was the best mocha I have ever tasted in my life.  Like many have said, it doesn't provide as sweet a taste as American cocoa.  So, instead of a sickeningly sweet cafe mocha, you get a nice rich mocha hint to your espresso drink.  (The way it should be)  Once again, thank you food vendor at the Hampton Court train station.  You are the best!
