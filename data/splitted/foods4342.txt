review/summary: Similac Advance Ready to Feed
review/text: My first baby refused to take the bottle, so I breastfed exclusively. Although I wanted to breasfeed my second child exclusively, my milk did not come in as it did with my first born. So I had to try bottle feeding to supplement my milk supply. Since I was given a case of Similac Advance Newborn Ready to Feed at the hospital, that is what I ended up feeding her. She seems to like the product, except that she was always very gassy. I did some research and then eventually switched to Similac for fussiness and gas. That did the trick and she is gas free. I would recommend this product for busy moms, as it is already mix (does not need to be warmed, or mixed). I use the ready mix while at church and other places away from home.

review/text: My daughter is almost 10 months old. She gets hungry at night and this helps a lot.<br /><br />By the way,  a pack of 8 comes with only 1 nipple. My daughter, for some reason, refuses to use the Similac nipple. However, I use the evenflo glass bottles which come with nipples and rings and they fit perfectly on these ready to feed bottles. The evenflo nipple and ring also fits on the Enfamil 6oz or 2oz ready to feed bottles. As a result, I didn't have to buy the disposable nipples/rings.

My baby is 5 months now and he's just starting to outgrow these bottles... he needs 3-4oz a feeding.

review/summary: BEWARE NO NIPPLES
review/text: Similac is terrific (I was a Similac baby myself), and I bought this pack as an emergency supply to have handy after learning about the option through my hodpital (which used these pre-filled bottles in the nursery).  But -- lo and behold -- it doesn't come with nipples!  And Similac doesn't even appear to market them.  So if you buy this, you should also get ENFAMIL npples, which I found on Amazon (a ten-pack, I believe).  So this is why I give it four instead of five stars.  Anyway, the more economic option for using Similac is of course the powdered version.

review/summary: Didn't work for my baby...
review/text: For some reason, the formula in the 2 ounce, as well as the 8 ounce bottles of Similac Advance Ready to Feed, is not the same as the 32 ounce.  Both the 2 ounce and the 8 ounce made my baby projectile vomit almost every time.  Only the formula in the 32 ounce bottles, which is visibly lighter in color and smells much better than the formula in the other bottles, works for her.  Perhaps the processing is different or the 32-ounce bottle in which it is stored keeps the formula fresher during shipping and prior to sale, but all I know is that after several purchases of the 2 and 8 ounce bottles from different sources with same bad results, I know now that I can only use the 32 ounce bottles of formula.  Otherwise, Similac Advance Ready to Feed has been wonderful.  My baby loves it and she has been healthy and staying at the top of her growth curve.  Also, we tried the Early Shield but it gives her painful gas cramps.  Regular Similac Advance has worked best for her.

review/summary: just a bit thin and overly sour for my taste
review/text: I've been really craving kadhi pakora for some time now. Had it many times while living in Vancouver B.C., both in restaurants and in the homes of Punjabi friends. Even made it myself in a vegetarian restaurant with the supervision of a Punjabi co-worker. It's a real favorite of mine which I don't make myself only because I almost never deep fry at home. So when I saw this in a supermarket I grabbed it.<br /><br />Slightly disappointing, not quite like I remember it. Decent number of pakoras (more than the amount of panir in some packaged palak panirs that I've tried). But I found the sauce a bit thin and overly sour. Obviously this is all a matter of taste. This product contains mango powder (which is sour) which many recipes do not. But one recipe I read actually suggests adding a bit of citric acid, and water if it's too thick. Personally I like mine thicker and not so sour.

review/summary: Good Food
review/text: I decided to try this brand of wet dog food as I have been purchasing the dry food from amazon for over a year now.  My dog has been scratching a lot and I saw a direct correlation between his scratching and turning up the thermostat when it is cold outside.  He also has his dog bed right by the fireplace.  i bought him some fish oil capsules for his dry skin but he hasn't taken to that really well.  So I saw this salmon food and thought this might work.  My dog likes it.  I wouldn't say it is his favorite food - his favorite food has meat by products in it and who knows what else - but she does like it and it seems to have helped with her itchy skin as she isn't sratching anywhere near as often as in the past.  The ingredients are good.  BTW it doesn't smell bad, either, if that is a concern.  There is no fish smell int he house.  This food is a GO!

As is true of all healthy grains that aren't refined, the bugs love it and will invade if given a chance.  The refrigerator or freezer is the best place for whole grain foods to keep them fresh and the bugs out.

That meant my lukshen kugel could no longer be made with egg noodles (and the eggs switched for egg-whites). The problem is, most pasta is too thick for it. So, i wanted Angel Hair and whole wheat. Couldn't find that in local stores except one, and that place had it for something like three dollars a box.<br /><br />I came to Amazon and found this and one other brand. I tried this one because it had good reviews, perhaps slightly better than the other, i have used Hodgeson Mills in the past, and i was mildly amused about the flax seed. (There is no good reason as to why i was amused. :)<br /><br />I am quite happy with the outcome. These are easy to break into small pieces, and the kugel is delicious.

review/text: to make them really good.. add some extras.. cherry tomatos...mushrooms...  start another skewer and you will really get something special out of the starter ka bob.  you can add just about anything. slices of apples and pears.  they thaw out on the counter in about 2 or 3 hours. great over uncle bens 90 second rice packets.

review/summary: Best tasting Sauerkraut Ever.
review/text: Unlike German Sauerkraut this has a sweeter less sharp taste than German kraut. Like the description says the bacon pieces and champagne and other spices remove a lot of the bitterness. This is really the best sauerkraut I have ever eatern.<br /><br />My one complaint is it is hard to open. The pull latch broke off and I had to use a can-opener on the bottom of the can.

review/summary: Not as strong as original!
review/text: I thought these were gross. Not only do they have extra ingredients compared to the original hard candies (hydrogenated oil, salt...), they are not nearly as strongly gingery as the originals. Also, they have a weird texture - more like gritty chewy than the kind of cough drop lozenge texture of the originals.<br /><br />I have no idea why they are called "Boost" because despite the extra ginger they claim to add, they are definitely not as strong as the original hard candies. No heat, no spice, just a lot of flavorless ginger pulp. Ew.

I know there is an attempt to reduce sugar in products but this one one of my few indulgences.Lots of fiber and it does beat prunes for taste. Would like them to can some sweetened rhubarb if they would also.Thanks Oregon canned produce.

review/summary: Partial to lentils
review/text: In a family partial to lentils, an excellent source of protein (particularly when several of our many vegetarian relations visit), Rice Pilaf Lentil mix was always a spicy mealtime add-on. This lentil and rice combination will not please anyone who prefers their spices on the heavy side. It contains just the right amount of flavoring (as in not too much). It's far less heavily spiced than various Latin rice combinations that also include lentils.<br /><br />For years, we've always kept some of this product handy. (It does sell in our supermarkets; we don't have to order by mail.)<br /><br />At this juncture, though, we're down to our last box of this particular Near East flavor and we are less and less inclined to buy more. Even at local prices, which run considerably less than the per-box total one would pay from Amazon (including shipping), Near East has just grown too costly for our weekly grocery budget.<br /><br />But if you don't mind the extra expense, this stuff is truly delicious.

review/summary: No MSG - for real
review/text: Since Hubby is very sensitive to any glutamates, this was a real find. Called the manufacturer to make certain there were no glutamates of any kind. FDA has about 30-40 legal names for MSG and even products labeled "No MSG" may have 1-5 sources of MSG in them. Let the buyer beware! (If you don't know what they are check the Truth in Labeling website for a list.) Better yet, Hubby doesn't react to it. It does contain celery to wich he is sensitive, but it must not be very much since he has no reaction. Still expensive, but with no other options, finding this cheaper than our local health food store was good. Tastes fine.

I (like the other reviewer) add a small handful of gluten-free/dairy-free chocolate chips to my mix since I am a chocolate lover.  Just perfect!  HIGHLY recommend.  Only one problem--expensive (as with most gluten free products, unfortunately.)

review/summary: The best chocolate chip cookie I've ever eaten!
review/text: My favorite treat of all times has always been a chocolate chip cookie. When I decided to go gluten free I was nervous about giving up my favorite snack. I saw this mix in Whole Foods a few days ago and decided to give them a try. Hands down the best cookie I've ever eaten, with or without gluten. Simply perfect!! The only problem with them is that I could honestly eat the entire batch in one day! I added 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chips per the idea on the bag. Absolutely amazing!!! My pantry will never be without these :)

review/summary: so-so soup
review/text: The description of this soup makes it sound interesting -- sadly more interesting than its taste. By itself this soup had a slightly off-putting flavor of too much tomato. I added a dash of hot sauce and a sprinkle of garam masala; I probably could have also added an additional pinch of ginger. With my additions, the soup tasted more like an Indian curry.

review/summary: FANTASTIC... Closest to Peanut Butter Taste
review/text: I have tried many brands of almond butter because I can not eat peanuts. I ordered<br />some of this from amazon(great service btw) and i was a little concerned when i opened it because it looked almost like peanut butter. I called the company directly in California. They put the plant manager on the phone to answer my questions. I asked him why it was a different color than i was used to.(most almond butters are sort of grayish). He told me that they don't grind the skins with the almonds. Also the top grade of palm fruit oil that they use is high in cartenoids and helps to keep this product stable (not rancid) and adds to the color. Also they process this product to keep it as natural and roasted flavor filled as possible. I was impressed with the manager, the product and the company. Google the company history and learn about Jennifer Barney. [...]<br />What can I say this is the BEST TASTING almond butter out there In my opinion.

review/text: I just bought a jar of this stuff on a whim last night, despite its $8 price tag and boy am I glad I did.  I've never truly liked Peanut Butter, in fact I loathed it for many years...but as my tastebuds matured I learned to tolerate it once in a while with chocolate or apple slices.  I've been searching for a common ground because my BF LOVES peanut butter, but only the "kid" kinds...loaded with sugar and hydrogenated oils.  I like the fact that nut butters can be healthy and satisfy the appetite but I just couldn't deal with the Jif any longer. :)  Well, I've found our compromise... Barney Butter is ever so slightly sweet (just enough, I think) and close enough in taste to PB that my BF likes it, yet it's missing that indefinable something that makes me dislike peanut butter so much.  Plus, the Barney Butter is WAY healthier... compare the nutritional info  on the jar of Barney Butter to your standard jar of Jif or Skippy.  I know it isn't quite as pure as some nut butters since this still contains palm oil, BUT all of the No-Stir nut butters contain palm oil...it's a compromise I can live with if it means not having to stir anything with the consistency of cement... that just too much work for a sandwich.  Anyhoo..this stuff is fabulous and I can't keep my spoon out of the jar!!!  I was very glad to see the 3-pack on Amazon.  I'm ordering it right now!!<br /><br />UPDATE:  My initial enthusiasm for Barney Butter has not waned.  Peanut Butter has never made it back into our house since.  I use the Barney Butter in baked goodies, candies, smoothies, on toast, and on plain old spoons :).  I actually buy 6 jars at a time from Amazon.  LOVE IT!

review/text: For years now we've eaten MaraNatha organic almond butter because I have a terrible peanut allergy.  I came on to amazon to see if I could order it cheap and found Barney Butter.  It's made in a peanut free facility (which is really hard to find these day)!!  And, it tastes just as good.  I will admit it is runner than MaraNatha but due to it's consistency it's easier to spread on bread.  I did have to stir it a little but not like normal almond butter.  I gave it five stars because it takes great and is much cheaper than MaraNatha.  Not to mention the almond only facility.  I will definitely be buying Barney Butter from now on.  I might try the crunchy next time too!!

review/text: I have kids with peanut allergies and I found the perfect substitute for peanut butter.  It is easy to spread and tastes great.  The only thing you need to watch out is that there is some separation of the paste and the oil.  To avoid this problem just stir the almond butter before you spread it.  This product is really the best out there.  I'm very happy that Amazon is selling it online too.

review/summary: Barney Butter is the best way outside of making your own.
review/text: I am trying to get more natural and healthy foods and that started me on a journey to finding Barney Butter. First I started with natural peanut butters but found that peanuts are a natural inflammatory product. I don't want to promote inflammation or add to pains I already have so someone suggested almond butter.<br /><br />I tried a variety of almond butters but I have my own taste expectations. I started looking for something that was made in an almond only facility, did not have to be stirred, had a little bit of sweetness, was NOT gritty, and had the "right" kind of palm oil. The palm "fruit" oil is the good healthy kind of oil and the palm "kernel" oil is the bad. Most of the non stir butters have the palm kernel oil.<br /><br />In my Googling I eventually found barney butter and it had all my requirements. It already has a touch of sweetness added to it and all I had left to taste it and see if it lived up to what I was expecting. I found it at my local Publix grocery store and tried it. I give it a big thumbs up! Right out of the jar, with no "doctoring up" it tastes ready to eat. No stirring and slightly sweet. A real winner.<br /><br />The grocery does not seen to stock it very well and is often out of stock, so now I am buying it on Amazon and that makes it even easier. The purists who want nothing but almonds can find that in another brand, but I always had to FIX those brands in my Vitamix and doctor them up to be blended well and taste right. Now I just buy the Barney Butter and I'm done. They deserve the business. They use the almonds ONLY with no husk, the right and healthy kind of palm oil that is actually good for us to eat, and add a twinge of sweetness to it. It's a terrific product - well done.

Barney Butter delivers the same smooth, creamy texture of peanut butter with all the delicious flavor and nutritional benefits we expect from almond butter. It's a staple in our house for packing school lunches. It's also one of very, very few nut butters produced in an almond-only facility.

review/text: I have food allergies and have really missed being able to eat peanut butter due to my peanut allergy.

Barney butter smooth almond butter has the same texture as peanut butter, if not even a little bit smoother. It looks like peanut butter and tastes even better than peanut butter. It is made in a plant that does not process peanuts, so it's safe for those who are allergic to peanuts. I really love this product!

And the whole family loves it - soon after I ordered our first 3 pack I was back to Amazon for more and have even ordered some for extended family.  The best part is that it never separates.  Our 2 year old son loves "Bowny Butter."  He asks for it several times a week, which makes us very happy :)  We purchased Barney Butter based on the great reviews and we're glad we did!

After hearing rave reviews for Barney Butter, I decided to try out their version. I don't know how they do it, but somehow Barney Butter tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter! I know that this is a plus for some, but if you like peanut butter, why wouldn't you just buy peanut butter? Why make perfectly good almonds taste like peanuts? If I buy almond butter, I want it to taste like almonds.

review/text: Love, Love, Love this almond butter!  Way smoother than both Justin's and Maranatha brands, which I've also tried.  I think this is better due to it being made from blanched almonds, which makes it stick to the roof of your mouth smooth like PB.  It's so good it has spoiled peanut butter for me as I like this even better and I used to love PB, but now, I choose this every time.  In fact, I ate a whole 16 oz jar by myself just last week after being without it for a week due to lack of a local supply!  I eat it almost every day on apple slices, pear slices and bananas, Yum Yum!  Now if they could just bring down the price just a little...or if I could just keep my spoon out of the jar, seriously!

review/summary: Like peanut butter?  Give this a try!
review/text: I first tried Barney Butter by buying a few squeeze packets at my local Whole Foods and fell in love, but I found the price hard to swallow.  So I headed on over to Amazon and picked up this three pack which, per jar, is a few dollars cheaper than my local WFM.  The label doesn't lie, it certainly is no stir!  It's very smooth and creamy, perhaps a little too creamy.  My jars are so creamy that I can remove the top, turn them over, and the delicious almond butter will pour out on its own.  I suspect that this extra creaminess is from the cane evaporated cane juice, but I don't care either way, it's so very tasty.  If you like almonds, you'll love this.  Unless of course, you like your almond butter crunchy.<br /><br />Tonight, my girlfriend tried this for the first time and summed up exactly how I feel about Barney Butter, to quote: It tastes just like peanut butter.  That's the same thing I said the first time I ever had this and it's kept me coming back time and time again.  Since buying this, I've stopped purchasing peanut butter altogether, something I'd never though would happen.<br /><br />If you're unsure if you'll like this, grab some of the squeeze packs and give it a try!

They removed the other skins of the almond, so there is no grit like in other brands. I'm sure this is taking away some of the nutritional content and fiber, but hey it taste damn good.  I would classify this as true peanut butter replacement! And becasue this is made in an "Almond ONLY Facility", this removes any concerns with folks that have peanut allergies.

It would be awesome to have a similar product without the palm oil and cane juice.
