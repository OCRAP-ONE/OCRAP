review/summary: Beagle loves it but it stinks!
review/text: Got this for my 9 year old beagle.  She "expects" treats anytime she comes back in from outside and has pretty much figured out how to work that system with my 4 year old so she gets treats every 5 minutes (really need to figure out a better lock for the back door!).  I saw this Lickety Stik and the concept seems good.  I had read some reviews about certain dogs not liking this product at all but that is not the case with my beagle.  In fact, she LOVES this stuff and will sit near the counter staring up at it.  My only issue with this product is that it really stinks....and I mean really stinks!!  I try to quickly open it, let my beagle take a few licks and then close it as quickly as possible.<br /><br />It works very similar to how a roll on deoderant would work so if you haven;t used it for a few days, it may take some manual intervention to get the top of the ball wet enough to turn on its own.  I don't have any issues as my dog can easily get it started using her tounge.<br /><br />I will most likely try the other flavors of this since my dog likes it so much.  Plus, assuming this product is accurate in its description, cutting back on the fatty treats she normally gets will be a benefit to her health.

review/summary: She just doesn't want it
review/text: I was given a bottle of the savory bacon flavor for the purpose of trying it out and reviewing it. I've tried on several occasions both with the bottle and with putting some on my fingers in case it was how it is dispensed that was bugging her and my dog just wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because the concept is interesting and also because my dog is very picky. It's not the first time she's refused a treat, so I didn't think it merited a star rating quite so bad as "I hate it."<br /><br />I won't be buying any, though, unless she has a radical change of heart very soon.

review/summary: Great Idea for smaller dogs. MJ loves this Bacon flavor, but she wants to bite the bottle.
review/text: Our dog is a hugh White English Bulldog about 3 ft tall and 6 feet long. She loves bacon and loves the flavor of this, but she tries to bite and take the bottle away.<br />The bottle is a roller ball like roll on deodorant, and being a big dog she could choke on this if she did get it in her mouth, which is why we give 4 stars. she loves water out of squeeze bottle and would think this would do better in that type of bottle.<br /><br />I would reccommend this for small to medium dogs, but not for the Mastif breeds.

review/summary: I think they're out of ideas for dog treats...
review/text: I received my Lickety Stik bacon flavored dog treat from the Amazon Vine Program, free in exchange for writing a review.<br /><br />I thought this product was a kind of stick, based on the name of it. Instead it's a flavored liquid in a bottle with a roller ball something like a deodorant applicator.<br /><br />We have a beagle who loves treats and loves to chew.  I thought he would like this treat simply because I was giving it to him.  He did understand that he had to lick the ball to get the flavor, but he wasn't impressed.  Two sniffs, three licks and he was done.<br /><br />I don't think this treat is safe for dogs unless you stand there and hold it for them.  Any chewing on their part will either separate the roller ball from the end and choke them, or their teeth will puncture the container and the liquid will go everywhere.  It's certainly not a treat you can give them and turn your back.<br /><br />I much prefer treats that they can totally eat, and I can't see this "rollerball" treat being very popular with pet owners.

review/summary: I'm not sure what to think . . . and neither does my dog
review/text: I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this "Lickety Stik" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again.

review/text: So, my dog likes it. I'll just get that out there right away.<br />But, it's awkward to carry and can be messy (which I didn't think it would be) but since you have to sometimes give it a little encouragement to get anything to come out, sometimes it just decides "Oh you want ALL of it!" and I have a sticky snouted puppy.<br />And, she has since lost interest in it and prefers treats she can smell better.

review/summary: She loves it
review/text: I can understand this might not be for every dog;  my mother's dog just tried to eat the whole roll-on.  But my dog has no issue with it at all and loves it.  I taught her to recycle using this, and she goes out of her way to find stuff to recycle so she can get some.  It's like feeding a baby lamb out of a bottle.  If you have trouble getting the stuff to come out, squeeze it a little because that gets a little more on the roller ball, maybe that will encourage them to just lick and not chew.  My dog even has fun selecting which flavor we're going to open next.

review/summary: Really depends on the dog
review/text: I decided to try this out after seeing an ad in a Bass Pro Shops catalog. I have two chihuahuas. One of them loved it and could probably lick it all day. The other dog wouldn't go near it. All in all, I think it really just depends on the dog itself; hence the mixed reviews here. It's not a bad product by any means, but probably not something I'll be buying often - just more of a fun treat every so often.

review/summary: great for grooming
review/text: I was resorting to the old trainer's trick of smearing peanut butter on the fridge or a plastic stool, so my new rescue dog could happily lick it off while I brushed him. It worked but it was very messy. Lickety Stik works much better, although I do generally need a helper to hold it while I groom. The big test will come when I next take him to the vet and bring LS along--will it work the same while he's getting his temperature taken? Or will the experience of the thermometer ruin the treat for him? If the former, I'm sure all the vets and techs at our clinic will be ordering this stuff! I was a little concerned with the stuff upsetting my dogs' digestive systems: the new guy has an  iron gut it seems but my other dog has a sensitive tummy. She, however, had some (inserted herself while I was grooming the newbie) and was o.k. We were using liver flavor. Overall, I'm very impressed so far and ordering some more.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE
review/text: This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix. He loved the flavor and it served as a great distraction if we wanted to clean his ears or trim his dew claws. Unfortunately, with one swift bite he popped the roller ball into his mouth and down his throat. We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.  Additionally, customer service for this company was a HUGE disappointment.  They were unshmpathetic and kept on about how it was not meant for chewing.

review/text: I guess the idea here is that you can reward your dog with quick and tasty lick of a thin liquid on a roller ball. Seems like a decent idea, especially if you're trying to train your dog.<br /><br />The problem, in our case anyway, is that our dog is sort of lukewarm on this treat. He'll lick it sometimes, but other times, he just isn't interested. I asked him why, but he declined to comment.

review/summary: A Nice Alternative to Dog Treats
review/text: My dogs can pack on the pounds quickly especially during the winter month so I am always on the look for low calorie alternatives to dog treats that they can enjoy without gaining unwanted weight.  These Lickety Stiks are interesting to say the least.  Much like an ink pen, the dogs roll the ball with their tongues to get the flavored water out.  The package claims only one calorie per ten licks (and over 500 licks per bottle) so that is really nice.  The first couple times I tried on both my dogs, they would give I a sniff, then a couple licks because trying to grab it out of my hand with their mouths.  But after a couple uses they no like try to take it and lick.<br /><br />One major problem with the Lickety Stik, or at the very least the liver flavor is that the smell is extremely strong, which is a big problem because liver does not smell very well,  and gets stronger with every lick to the point it starts to make my eyes water and stinks up the entire room.  Also, after prolonged inactivity, the liquid solidifies on the ball making it harder if not impossible for the dogs to use, but that is easy to remedy with a little warm water.  Once, or if, you get past the smell, this is a good alternative to fatty dog treats.

review/summary: Simple and effective.
review/text: I have a three month old pug puppy who is incredibly food motivated.  Carrying around treats on a walk while I'm leash training him can be a hassle to fish out without spilling the rest or getting crumbs in my pockets.  We received a free sample of Lickety Stik at our puppy training class because of a pug's tendency to pack on the pounds and I was really surprised at how quickly the puppy took to it.  He will do tricks and readily follow on the leash to get a lick of this treat and becomes excited when he sees the bottle.<br /><br />The main drawback to this thing is that it stinks to high heaven and if I get a strong whiff of it the thing makes me gag.  The dog loves it, however so I am really considering buying more of this product in the future.

review/text: I got the Lickety Stik through the Vine Program.  I was a little skeptical upon ordering.  I have two dogs that both need daily medications and they also get vitamins.  It was always a battle to get them to take either and had to revert to the shove down the throat and blow on the nose tactic.  That is until now.  Put a little of this stuff on whatever they need to take and wham gone down the throat.  It took about a week and then I stopped using it and the dogs now take their pills without any treatment.  Highly recommend and made my life a little easier.

review/summary: Still not sure....
review/text: I have been giving my dog this for several weeks as a treat and am not sure if she is really getting any juice or she just loves the smell. It is hard to tell if the ball is turning when she licks it or if it remains stationary. She always comes running when she sees me pull it out the pantry so I assume that she is still getting her 'treat'. I do like the size of the container, but wish that I could tell how much is remaining.

review/text: I tried several times to get my jack russell terrier to use this treat, but he prefers chewing on something rather than licking his treats.  The only treat he has patience with licking is a little cup of  doggie ice cream.  Even ice cubes he will crunch instead of lick.  I was also a little bit bothered by the smell of the product; there was an oily odor to it.  This treat may work for little dogs or dogs who have more patience but sadly not my dog.  It is a good effor though.

review/text: This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in dark flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains.

review/text: Many of these reviews seemed to be confused. This Stik if really created and used for training dogs/puppies. It is much easy to give them a quick lick when they walk next to you instead of giving them lots of treats or clicks. This product is a god-send. My puppy loves it and walks much better on the leash as a result. Also, just because you dog doesn't like the taste doesn't mean this deserves a poor review. Dogs have different tastes! For what this does, it deserves a better rating.

review/summary: Good but Not Good Enough for My Picky Dog
review/text: Likety Stik is a great product for some dogs obviously, but Foxy, my ten-year-old standard poodle, is not interested. She first thought she was to take the entire container into her mouth. When I didn't give her the opportunity to try to swallow the whole thing, she tasted the juice on the ball. Deciding it was pretty good, she looked around to see if any other dogs might just have happened to come by for a visit. She is a picky eater. When she reacts by looking to see if any other dogs are around, it is evident that something is extra tasty. If she really, really likes something super tasty, she doesn't take the time to look around for other dogs. She has licked it a few times, but she seems somewhat reluctant. The low-calorie idea is neat, but my picky eater needs all the calories she can get.<br /><br />From a people's perspective it seems a good product, but no matter how much I shake it, I find it necessary to turn the ball manually to make the juice available. It would be fun to try this stick on a dog with more enthusiasm about food.<br /><br />Four stars.

review/summary: He likes it (and licks it) but sticky ball
review/text: Our dog really likes this thing.  It smells like it is full of flavor, and he seems to really enjoy licking the thing for as long as I'll hold it for him.  If you are unfamiliar, the flavored juice in the container is released each time the dog licks a small ball at the tops of the container; as the ball spins, it gets covered in the juice, which the dog licks off, etc.  So, well done!  My one beef with the product, though, is that the ball is a little tough to get spinning until it is fully lubricated, which means that I often have to use my fingers to get it started, which isn't ideal because I don't want to get any of the flavored juice on me.  That said, my dog is a big fan of this product.  So, while I think this is a good product, I'm giving it four stars because I think the delivery mechanism (ie the ball) isn't the best, and could be improved upon.

review/text: My dog is a bit shy about eating in front of people, so I should have known that he would not like these.  He didn't.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  I tried to make him try it, but he resisted and then I felt bad about doing it.<br /><br />One time during a bad storm he was hiding under my desk and he licked it and seemed to like it, but I haven't got him to do it since.<br /><br />I think the product is probably good - and there's a lot in it and it looks safe enough - it's like a deodorant roller ball - but my dog is just too shy.<br /><br />My cat liked it.  I wasn't sure how good it was for cats though so I didn't let her try it again.  They should make these for cats though - I had a cat that would lick her fur off, this would have been great to help divert her.<br /><br />It's a lot neater to keep in your pocket than regular treats.  It would be great for training a dog if you had a dog that would lick it.

review/summary: Lickin it all night long
review/text: My dogs seem to find Likety Stik extremely tasty as demonstrated by their desire to keep licking it. On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count.

review/summary: Lickety Stik
review/text: At first the dogs were confused and the golden terrified. But once they sniffed it and figured out how to lick it, they loved it. I think it smells awful, nothing like bacon. But the dogs appreciated it. It is a great way to give the dogs a treat without all the calories. One calorie to every ten licks. Just be sure to store it out of reach. I can see my basset counter surfing, grabbing it, and chewing it all up.

review/summary: Product is awesome, watch the price here!!!!
review/text: I tried this product on a new dog I had in training, because I liked the idea of a liquid for increased reward value.  It has turned out to be a great reward for many dogs I work with as well as a great reward in numerous situations.  In many performance sports you need to be very careful when rewarding your dog on a practice field that there are no crumbs left behind.  This product is PERFECT!!  I also don't need to worry about my pockets getting eaten out of my pants after training.<br /><br />My advice is to watch the price you pay here!!!!  I buy mine locally at less than 1/2 the price you see advertised here.  Even Petsafe will sell it to you for $8.99 not $13!!!<br /><br />Otherwise certainly a 5 star product!!!!!

review/summary: Dogs Give it 5 Stars Each
review/text: We have two little dogs and they have shared the licks.  I can't speak to the taste, but I feel like I'm giving them puppy crack because they became very upset when I put the stick up.<br /><br />As a human, I'm a little less enthused about the whole thing.  First, it's more like a bottle of shoe shine than a bottle of deodorant.  So, as you turn it upside down, you have to squeeze the bottle a smidge to bring the liquid to the ball.  Squeeze too hard, and your dog will get a face full of Lickety Stik juice.  The dog doesn't mind, though.<br /><br />Both dogs started to try to chew the bottle.  They sort of got the hang of it, but I'm not sure that I'm giving them a life lesson here or anything.  It's certainly not worth the patience, for instance, used in showing a toddler how to drink from a straw.<br /><br />Still, as a novelty, I'm cool with this.  I really do think the dogs will get militant when the bottle runs out, though.  For all I know, it's just sugar water, but whatever it is, they really like it.

review/summary: Great idea, flawed execution
review/text: I love the idea of the Lickety Stik:  a dog treat without all the extra calories.  Unfortunately, the design of this product makes it difficult to use.  The roller ball is very firmly fitted into the top so that it doesn't really roll.  It's mostly stuck in one position unless I manipulate it with my fingers (which are then covered in a strongly-smelling liquid that is difficult to wash off).  My two dogs quickly figured out what to do with this "treat", and they will lick and lick, but nothing comes out unless I either (1) squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out (which then usually drips onto the floor) or (2) move the roller ball with my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great concept that needs a little tweaking in the execution.

review/text: I have my Min-Pin boarded at the home of a friend who has what looks like a Westie. I took the bottle of "Lickety Stik" over when I went to pick up my dog. Offered it to both dogs. The westie loved it, however my Min-Pin would have nothing to do with it. Maybe that's because another dog licked it, however that's doubtful as most dog I've met aren't that fussy. Its kind of a cool idea but I think a dog biscuit works just as well. One other caveat, it looks like the same bottle that roll-on deodorant comes in so make sure you know for sure what you're smearing on your arm-pits or you could attract some unwanted attention

Panda loves treats, like most puppies, but this treat in particular gets his attention. It is working as a great training aid too.  He sits, he licks.  It is a treat that he is motivated to work for, and it makes training easier. We do have other treats that work, but this one has the benefit of a fast grab. I don't have to dig in a bag or really search for it.

review/text: This is like a deodorant bottle with gravy in it.  My dogs took to it right away and did every trick as if I had a chunk of steak in my hands.  I figure it's a lot cheaper than conventional treats and not as messy as wet ones.  You do have to squeeze the fluid out sometimes so if they aren't ready for it, it drips.  If you aren't over a rug or other cloth surface it's not a problem, because they'll lick it off the floor.  I do have to keep it out of reach when I'm not using it because I'm afraid they'd jump up when I'm not looking and run off with it for me to discover it all chewed up with a stained carpet under it!

I usually only give her high quality treats and chews but I figure a few licks of this roll on won't her her.  I don't think I will buy it because it really is not a healthy treat for her but since she likes it and it does not make a mess I gave it 4 stars.  If it was better nutritionally I would have given it 5 stars.  This is definitely a great concept!  I just wish is contained better ingredients.  : )

review/summary: Unique treat for dogs
review/text: This is the most unique dog treat I've seen. The liquid treat is dispensed from a container that reminds me of a large lip gloss tube with a roller. I've given this unique dog treat "4 stars" instead of five as an average based on the varied reactions from my two small dogs. The smaller Malti-poo loved the treat and from his reaction would give it "5 stars". He immediately licked the roller, received the treat, and wanted more. Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a pickier eater in general and wouldn't even try it at first. He finally did, but didn't seem to like it. We have the chicken flavor and it may be he just didn't like the flavor.<br /><br />Since our Malti-poo likes it so much, I have just ordered the three-pack that has chicken, liver, and bacon flavors. The three-pack is a better value than the individual packs and I'm hoping our Cavalier will like one of the other flavors better than the chicken. This is a unique idea to reward dogs with a treat without filling them up like traditional dog treats.<br /><br />** Update:  I ordered the three-pack and my Cavalier definitely likes the bacon flavor much better than chicken!

review/summary: Fantastic Product
review/text: I came across this PetSafe Lickety Stik and decided to give it a try.  We just got an 8 week old Bassett Hound puppy and decided to try out this Lickety Stik as a training reward due to its low calorie content.  Bassets are know to get fat quick so a low calorie reward is needed as Bassetts basically only respond to food.<br /><br />Basically, this thing has the same construction as a stick of roll-on deodorant.  You turn it upside down, the liquid inside saturates the ball in a second or so and your dog takes a lick or two of the ball.  It works fantastically for training a puppy or dog.  We got the bacon flavor and she absolutely loves it.<br /><br />The puppy loves it and will do anything to get a lick of this thing.  It smells terrible to us(a really disguisting rancid bacon odor)but she absolutely adores it.  The price of $8 may seem a little high, but we've have been using the same Stik for over a month now, numerous times each day and we still have a third of it left.  We will definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a fantastic product that is great for training or just a treat.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Good idea for certain dogs/needs, but...
review/text: As other reviewers have mentioned, this looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant. It's not quite what I was expecting. You have to squeeze it a little to get the liquid to flow, and then the dog can lick at the roller ball, similarly to how a hamster would drink from its water bottle. It works well enough, and my dog likes the taste okay. It seems to bother her that she can't chew on it, and it bothers me that I can't just hand it to her and let her go to town on it. Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog. If your dog has a weight problem and you like to give it treats, this is probably a good alternative for you. This isn't something that I'll purchase again myself.

review/summary: Just don't set it next to your roll-on deodorant... :)
review/text: Imagine doggie treat flavored underarm deodorant.... have to squeeze just a bit to get the roller wet, then turn upside down and let the dog lick it. Unique idea.  Would probably be useful as a training tool. Our dog definitely likes it.  I imagine this works best as a daily treat. I shudder to think what would happen if you let the roller dry out, dog ends up with a tounge rash trying to push the roller past the dried out spot... or worse, squeeze to hard and drip doggie treat juice all over!! I'm just saying...  :)<br /><br />All in all, worth a try for the dog that has everything or just needs a change of taste...<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay

She will lick on it all day if I let her. The Chihuahua sniffs it and snubs it. She couldn't be less interested. So, one out of two dogs loves this stinky treat.  Humans, on the otherhand, hate the strong smell.  I think it's fun and can imagine it is a great treat substitute for obese dogs who need to watch their calorie intake. If you aren't adverse to strong odors you'll love the handiness of this Lickety Stik!

review/text: Like other reviewers have said, this may take a short time for your dog to get used to. The dog learns to lick the roller ball and get to the juices. This may not be as satisfying a treat as doggy biscuits, but I can see this product being useful for training. For instance, if your dog pulls on the leash when you go for walks, stop and call the dog to you. If he listens, let him have a few licks before continuing. I can also see it being useful for dogs who are overweight and whose owners want to cut back on calories yet can still give the dog a little treat for good behavior.

review/text: Both of my finicky yorkies love this treat, but I don't!  It smells awful and I have to hold it for them to enjoy it, unlike other treats that I toss to them and let them enjoy while I enjoy a little peace and quiet.  Also, the liquid gets in their "beard" so the odor of the treat lingers even after I tuck the bottle back in the treat cupboard.  It is rare for both of my dogs to agree on a treat and it is fun to watch them enjoy it, but it is inconvenient.  I will not likely repurchase this.

review/summary: Interesting idea... so-so execution
review/text: I am of the curious sort when it comes to dog treats and new ways to reward dogs so I jumped at getting this product.<br /><br />Lickety Stick arrived and three dogs were eagerly sitting in front of me; a cocker spaniel, a norwegian elkhound, and an australian shepherd.<br /><br />I unwrapped the stick and squeezed a little juice out of the tube onto the roller. I presented it to all three dogs. The cocker spaniel and the aussie eagerly licked away. The aussie licked away so much the cocker needed a wet cloth over the top of her head due to dropping juice on her head. The elkhound however, wanted no part in it.<br /><br />After a couple days of using it and trying it out I am left with the premise that it's an interesting take on a a dog reward - but in the end, the execution and possibility of making a mess leave this treat stuck in the treat drawer. I don't see myself buying these in the future.

review/summary: Not sure it's worth the trouble
review/text: My little dog (a Shih Tzu) seemed to have trouble licking the rollerball consistently enough to fully enjoy the treat.  Her inclination was to try to bite the top - and I'm wondering if that's what most dogs would try to do.  Of course, a dog can't tell you in words if they like something - you have to go by behavior.  And when we took this away from our dog, she really didn't protest like she does when it is a favorite treat.<br /><br />The premise behind this product is interesting - and I can understand why the idea of a rollerball made sense.  I'm just not sure it all works together well enough.  I can't envision seeking this out and purchasing it for my pet.

review/text: What a great idea for a treat.  Lickety Stik is constructed like a roll-on deodorant with a flavored dog treat inside.  Hold the Stik upside down and my dog licked away at it.  It is low calorie (great for my dog who is on a diet). It is also very easy to carry.  I keep it in my pocket.Since it has a cap and has plastic construction, it doesnt get crushed in my pocket. It makes a great little reward during training sessions.<br /><br />I find it especially helpful to reward my dog when Im teaching him a new trick. With the lickey stik he was very eager to see the stik come out.<br /><br />A few notes on the Lickety Stik's use.  The first time you use the Lickety stik, you may have to move the roller-ball with your fingers to get the treat to flow a little.  Once the dog understands that licking the ball makes the treat flow, it is not an issue. Also when he is done licking, there is no dripping.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik also has a clear window at the base of of the bottle so you know when it is time to reorder.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik is not large which makes it easy to trasport. However it does mean that if it is your primary treat for you dog, you may run out quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I can say that the dog was enthusiastic about the stick. It was easy to use. It was fun to give. I am happy with this product.

review/summary: Dogs KNOW it's bacon
review/text: When I picked up the padded envelope from our mail basket, my cocker spaniel snapped to attention.  By the time I had the bottle out of the envelope, the Rottweiler had joined us.  Their anxiety grew as I struggled to break the plastic wrap around the top.  Finally I had the bottle ready for action, after a very long 30 seconds.<br />I had to rub the roller ball to get the liquid inside to lubricate the ball.  Squeezing the bottle forces the liquid to ooze around the ball.  Both dogs wanted to eat the bottle rather than lick the ball.  They give it a five-star review and suggest that the Vine program send more to our house.<br /><br />The rottie still wants to eat the bottle. The cocker has learned the licking technique.  The cocker is quite responsive to the sound of the bottle being shaken. (Cockers are the original foodies.)<br /><br />The major problem I have is that the ball does not move freely.  I get some liquid on the ball and hold it out for the cocker.  She licks it very clean.  Then I have to squeeze more liquid out and roll the ball around with my thumb.<br /><br />The ingredients seem to be healthy, or as healthy as something with bacon fat in it can be.<br /><br />This product can be a great training reward, but you will have a sticky thumb. The first time I offered my thumb to be licked clean, the cocker started to eat it. If you are training your dog, you probably will want a rag to keep your thumb clean.<br /><br />My vine review philosophy is to first test the product without regard to price.  Now that I have checked the price, currently around $8, it seems a good value for a training tool.  $8 does not buy a decent size bag of training treats.  And the dogs are much more responsive to the bacon than to freeze-dried lumps.  However as just a treat for being a good dog in general, it is not as satisfying as a regular-sized biscuit.  Pity my poor dogs who are only getting this one bottle of bacon treat.

I didn't actually lick it.<br /><br />But my dog did, and she loves it.<br /><br />The basics:<br />The container is like a roll-on antiperspirant.  If you use roll-on deodorant, and buy this product, you may accidentally sport a new aroma if you are particularly groggy in the morning.<br />Its a no-calorie treat if your dog is ... uh... "easy to see" as they say.  My dog is a bit thick (like a barrel on stilts), so I had some high hopes for this product.<br /><br />The pros:<br />My dog loves it.<br />Its low calorie.<br />No crumbs!<br /><br />The cons:<br />You can't throw it in the laundry room as an easy way to get them to be put up.<br />I had to hold it upside down, and it would drip.<br />When my dog is aggressive she threatens to take it away from me.<br /><br />Overall, I would say that this is one of the few products that delivers exactly what it promises.  I recommend it.

review/text: For those that follow my reviews you know I have many dogs so I just had to try out this product.  It was so funny the day I received it. I was surrounded with furry friends. Incase you don't know dogs can smell just about anything and they knew something was in my hands that they were going to like.  The container reminds me of roll-on deodorant.  I know that sounds gross but nevertheless it did. It is made where the dogs lick the top of it to receive their treat.  Okay, now all I had to do was let the dogs lick it and believe me they were ready.  They piled around me and all took their turns, it was so cute.  Now, did they come back for more?  You bet they did, each seeing who could get their tongue on it first.  I could tell to them it was a tasty treat and for me it was a time to interact with my animals and show them love. You can't just let them play piggly wiggly and lick it all in one day, because they would, believe me. You have to allow only so many licks.  I liked this product and so did my dogs and plan to purchase it for them. Dog biscuits are of course a lot easier, you just throw them and they catch, but this is a special treat that allows you time with your animal. Nice product.

review/summary: Perfect for use while training your dog
review/text: The Lickety Stik is fabulous!  My dog immediately took to it and gets so excited when he sees the bottle.  I have been trying to train him to fetch a ball and then give it back to me, but I have had to wrestle the ball away from him.  I was worried about giving him too many treats because of calories, not to mention the expense.  I started letting him lick the Stik once or twice each time I got the ball away from him.  It didn't take long before he would drop the ball when he saw the Stik, and now he puts it directly into my hand, just so he can lick the Stik. I plan on using it to train him to do other things, as well.<br /><br />Considering how many times I have used it, it is a good value for the money.  It's kind of awkward to give him as a regular dog treat, so I save it for training and give him dog biscuits or other treat.

review/summary: Weirdest thing ever
review/text: First of all, let me say that my dog likes the taste of this treat - a lot. However, I have a large dog...and evidently an impatient dog. Rather than lick this "roll-on" treat, she would rather just bite it and chew it. That's really the only down side. Found out my daughters kitten liked it too. It's weird, like a 1980's deodorant company trying to do something profitable with their out of date product line. I wouldn't buy it, but my pets liked it.

review/summary: For Little Dogs ONLY!
review/text: It's a good idea, but my dog did not get it at all.  It's design is like a roll on deoderant - the ball inside moves while licked putting more of the liquid flavor onto the ball and into the dogs mouth.  You can ration how much the dog licks and put the lid back on.<br /><br />The smell wasn't strong unless you put your nose on it for a big whiff.  It must have smelled good to my dog because she went nuts over it.  The problem was it was too small and she kept bitting it and trying to yank it from my hand.  Then later when I was gone - she got it off the counter and chewed through it.  Yes, I know - she wasn't well behaved with it.  BUT she couldn't resist the temptation and after I had let her lick it I guess she figured it was fair game.<br /><br />Overall - I believe it's made for a little dogs but I didn't know that when I got it.

review/summary: The Dog loved it, I didn't
review/text: Well, when I ordered this I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it sure wasn't a roll on deodorant container filled with stinky liver flavored liquid.  For me personally, I've always stood by the belief that while the dogs are the one enjoying the dog toys and treats, the are more made for the humans than anything else and there is something totally repugnant about a dog eating from a deodorant container.<br /><br />Jilly, my puppy, loved it.  She kept on trying to take it out of my hand and bite at the container until she realized she had to lick but she did love the flavor.  The only real negative is that Jilly got "liver breath."  Also the ball in the container didn't spin and I had to squeeze and I got a drip or two on the floor.  I have wood floors so no harm no foul, but if you have carpeting you might get a stain, but Jilly helped with the clean up.<br /><br />But I couldn't quite get over the container and even though Jilly loved it the doggy breath and the fact I didn't like her licking a deodorant container was a big turn off.  Plus, if I used roll on deodorant I won't want my dog to associate it with treats, in case she got in the bathroom and ate the real deodorant which I'm sure could make her very sick.<br /><br />3 Stars.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The cat found this on the table and started pawing at it, so I opened it for her so she could have a lick and she loves it more than the dog!

review/text: I was excited to get the Lickety Stik for my dogs. It sounds like a good idea BUT the roller part DOES NOT roll and in order for the dog to get something to taste you must squeeze the container which can be a mess. I have four dogs, as I dog train in obedience and in tracking. In the beginning all four were interested, but then they all became frustrated with it. I ended up with $25.00 of this garbage. SAVE YOR MONEY.it's not worth it!

review/summary: Crack for dogs!
review/text: I have three beagles and a lab.  To be honest, when I read about this product, I was dubious as to its ability to make them happy.  A lick?  That's it?<br />Well--I was right, and wrong.<br />When I first broke it out, the lab tried to eat it--he wasn't happy with the one lick.  The beagles saw him try to eat it, and then they were all about eating it, too.  But once they realized what it was all about, they LOVED it.  They were like crack addicts.  I put it on the dining room table, out of reach, and we kept catching them walking on their hind legs, noses over the table ledge, trying to get it.  They got so sneaky!  Climbing onto the chair?  Really?  When it was time for bed, when they usually get a cookie, they all ran to the table and gave me the distinct message--"WE want THAT!"<br />Last night I put the Lickety Stik on a tall shelf in the hallway of the house--and this morning, they "knew" exactly where it was, and wouldn't leave the hallway until I grabbed the thing and walked them outside.<br />So, we're calling it either crack for dogs or catnip for dogs haha..<br /><br />It's sort of like a roll-on deodorant style container.  The beef-gravy-like substance covers the ball and they simply lick it off.  Of course, as I said above, they will try to eat it at first, until they get the idea.  Although I'm convinced that should it get left within reach, they will eat the entire container.)<br /><br />It's a small container--about 5 inches long.  The picture made me think it would be much larger.

review/summary: Engineering flaw
review/text: My two dogs apparently loved the scent and taste based on the way they were all over the Stik as soon as I uncapped it. The problem was the roller ball. It didn't roll very well. This became the pattern -- place thumb on ball, roll, let dogs lick off residue, place thumb on ball, roll again ... It became tedious very quickly. My main dog grew impatient and latched onto the bottle with his back teeth, easily piercing the neck allowing the flavored goo to ooze out. I tossed the Lickety Stik lickety split.

review/summary: These things stink!!
review/text: I bought this product because we originally thought our new puppy had a condition called megaesophagus which requires them to eat and stay in a vertical position for 30-45 minutes after eating and other people had recommended this product to keep the dog occupied during that time.<br />We later found that our dog doesn't have this condition (thank goodness) so I was going to return it but I decided to try it out when my puppy got a tick on her head, thinking it would keep her focused while I got the tick off (which it very much did)<br /><br />The only one I have used is the chicken flavor and when I took off the lid, I gagged and threw up in my mouth. It stinks that bad. But my puppy did seem to like the taste of it.

review/summary: Somewhat undecided
review/text: This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought "Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"

review/summary: Interesting, but what's the practical use?
review/text: Lickety Stik is an interesting idea. It's a small bottle filled with a thick brown liquid - a liquified dog treat, essentially - which you can squeeze out and smear over the top (sort of like gel deodorant). Your dog, I guess, is then supposed to lick this as a treat, but unfortunately my dog was just confused. I was still able to dab the liquid on his paw, and he seemed to like that quite a bit. So it still works for me to some extent.<br /><br />The big issue, I think, is that I'm not sure what the practical use of this product is. Maybe it's convenient for training; instead of carrying a bag of treats, you can just pop this thing in your pocket. Or I suppose if you have an elderly dog who has trouble with solids, it might come in handy. Otherwise it seems more convenient for me (and probably for many others) to stick with the dry treats.

review/text: I am not exactly a tea connoisseur, but I always buy my tea loose leaf and brew it in a French press because I still have one from the days I WAS a bit of a coffee connoisseur.  This tea tasted better than the Twinings brand equivalent I tried, and was much more resistant to bitterness when I lost track of the steeping time.  I mostly attribute this property to the tea leaves being whole rather than ground up like the Twinings, but I have no real evidence that that's the case.

As far as black tea goes I liked it.<br /><br />The tins are really nice with two lids (as tins should be).  One lid pops in and the other fits on top and semi-locks with a twist.  Definitely worth saving to use with tea that comes without tins (in bags).

review/summary: Cranberries are a problem
review/text: When they indicate dry cranberries they mean very dry. Even after soaking in milk they remain hard as little stones. I removed them before eating the granola which was OK.

review/text: This is a tasty, crunchy granola which is well made. The 12 ounce packages are too small for someone who eats granola regularly. The company should offer bigger bags at discounts.

review/summary: Love the variety
review/text: I bought these because I'm lazy. I want good espresso as I'm trying to hurry out the door to work and get the kid to school on time. These deliver. Lots of different styles to keep things fresh and different. I don't think I've had one I didn't like.<br /><br />They're a little pricy, but that's likely because they all look like they're imported. If they were a little cheaper, I'd probably buy more and end up buzzing around the office... so maybe it's good they're not cheaper.<br /><br />I use them in a real pressurized espresso maker. I'm not sure they'd work well in a steam-powered one like some of the home coffee/espresso combo units I've seen/used. They're pretty dense pucks.

review/summary: Disappointed with packaging
review/text: I bought this as a gift for a friend. The espresso pods smell wonderful but I was disappointed with the way they were packaged. All the pods came in a ziploc bag. It is fine and I don't like giving only 3 stars but I can't give it 4 stars. It would have been really nice if they were packaged in a box for gift giving. But if you are looking to try different types of espresso this is definitely the way to go.

review/text: I love smoked turkey wings and it is hard to find good ones.  These are not too salty, nice and richly smoked and not at all dried out.  Over all the best smoked turkey wings I have tried.  It is even worth the extra shipping, with the dry ice and all.

review/text: I like sugar free Red Bull. It's the best tasting "energy drink" I know of. I like it better than the regular Red Bull. However, if you have access to a Costco, you can get a case for ~$10 less.

review/summary: Red Bull Energy Drink
review/text: It consistently delivers. This is a product I simply cannot live without. I work full-time and go to school-full time. Also? I have cats, so every little bit of energy helps.<br /><br />Some people say this energy drink has a slight aftertaste, but I think it tastes light and citrusy, not harsh.<br /><br />This product has 10 calories, versus the "sugar-full" version, which, I believe has 150.

review/summary: Total Zero Tastes Different Than Sugar Free - Don't Like
review/text: I highly recommend you buy a single can of the new "Total Zero" version of Red Bull before you buy a case of Total Zero.  That way, if you don't like it, you've only bought one can, not 24.<br /><br />I'm a long time user of both the regular ("Original") version and the sugar free version.<br /><br />For my tastes, there isn't a huge difference between the Original version and the sugar free version, but there is a noticeable difference between the sugar free and "Total Zero" versions.<br /><br />Everything tastes different to different people, but I don't like the new Total Zero version.  It leaves, for me, a mediciney after-taste.  If you are drinking this late at the bar with your favorite adult beverage, you might not care, but I drink my Red Bulls by themselves as a pick me up during the day.<br /><br />Now, what do I do with the 23 other cans....?

review/summary: Only 10 Calories!
review/text: I really LIKE RED BULL, but at 150 calories a can - there was no way that I could have it very often.  I had looked at Costco and other places for the Sugarfree RED BULL to buy in bulk and they didn't carry it.  I was really pleased to discover it at AMAZON at a great price with free shipping.<br /><br />I love this stuff. At only 10 calories it is a great energy boost and definitely keeps you from eating because it really provides a tangy, sweet alternative.  Highly recommended for dieters!

review/summary: Prefer over regular Red Bull
review/text: I had not tried Red Bull Total Zero prior to purchasing the case on sale at Amazon.  I've had the regular and the sugar-free flavors and to me, I prefer the taste of Total Zero.  In some ways the flavor doesn't seem to be as strong and overbearing as the normal Sugar-Free can.  I don't really notice any strange after-taste in comparison to the other Red Bull flavors, they all have a similar "mediciney" taste.  I would definitely recommend trying a single can before the purchase of a case, unless you can get it on sale and want to take a chance.

review/text: I am not a big fan of sugared drinks and I always try to consume sugar free liquids. Red bull regular is a taste I do not like so I take the sugar free kind. This is better to mix with vodka too since you don't need more sugar with alcohol.

review/summary: This product is the BALLS!!!!!
review/text: I haven't received it. I don't give a crap if it tastes like donkey piss. I bought this to support a private company that was willing to take a tremendous personal risk to support private, non-.gov near-space endeavors. There's no other way to do it. The Soviets and NASA got the whole kit and kaboodle going 50+ years ago. Our 1/2 century's long exodus from dependency on a single cradle planet started from a .gov seed, and HAS just begun. But, our success depends on private enterprise, and that is the era we have been segueing into over the last 40 or so years. SpaceEx, Baumbgartner/Red Bull, and MANY others -- they are the NEXT gigantic LEAP for mankind! I do my miniscule part here, buying a case of Red Bull post Red Bull Stratos.
