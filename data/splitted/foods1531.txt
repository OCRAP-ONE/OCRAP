review/summary: Lovely smell, tastes pretty good overall, REAL sugar
review/text: I love peppermint and chocolate as a rule. I was a little wary of this canned coffee mix at first. Opening it the first time and the dry mix smells like chocolate cake mix with a faint hint of peppermint. Adding the hot water to the mug with the dry mix in the bottom was wonderful. The bright smell of peppermint wafted up followed by a weaker scent of chocolate. I did the four teaspoons to 7 ounces of hot water per the instructions and the flavor was weak. Adding a bit more mix fixed the problem. The flavor overall is mild and smooth - no funky after taste of any kind. There is a tingle of peppermint on the tongue after you swallow and I really like that. One thing I really like is no artificial sweeteners - just sugar. I truly detest the flavor & aftertaste of the artificial sweeteners, so a product like this with just regular, natural sugar is always welcome.<br /><br />The only reason for removing a single star is due to the need to add more mix - otherwise it's sort of watery. This is a product I will keep on hand - we have a Dolce Gusto machine for traditional coffee & lattes with the real deal foam etc. However, they don't make a peppermint flavor, so this Maxwell House International mix is a decent option.

review/summary: Holiday Classic
review/text: For me nothing says the holidays like peppermint lattes @ Starbucks. But who can pay $4+ for their smallest size? And if you are like me, you want to enjoy your coffee while sitting at your desk 1st thing in the morning when you get to work. Who has the time to wait in 15min morning rush lines at your local coffee house? I don't have $4 a day or an extra 15min even to rush over for some coffee so that is where Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha Latte comes in hand. Make your own holiday classic out of the convenience of your own home, at work, or even in your car on the way to work as long as your aren't driving. It's that simple, and you can adjust the flavor to meet your needs instead of having to wait an extra 10min to send your drink back for them to fix it for you. All you need to do is boil water, or heat milk, and then add 4-5 teaspoons of latte, stir and you are done! That's it who knew a latte would be so simple to make. I prefer to make mine with milk with about 6 teaspoons (I prefer a stronger peppermint taste, but overall I would rate the peppermint flavor mild with only 4 teaspoons and the mocha very slight.) and add a little bit of caramel drizzle to go along with it. Takes me only 1 min to get my latte ready in the morning and I am out of the door, and the best part about the whole thing is that it didn't cost me $4 for a single cup.<br /><br />Other than convenience, I love the fact that you get foam on the top of your latte. I know lattes are supposed to have foam, but I can't tell you how many times I have bought make-it-yourself-lattes and their excuse for foam has been this pasty layer at the top. Maxwell House lattes have had a generous amount of foam on the top, much more than you would expect from something that you are just stirring into a cup.<br /><br />If your just like me and love your holiday coffee but don't have time and don't want to pay your coffee house prices I highly suggest you try Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha Latte. And if you want an extra treat add a little bit of caramel to your drink, you can thank me later.

review/text: I enjoyed the Pumpkin Spice version of this same product, but I was far less impressed with this Peppermint Mocha.  My wife, who loves all things minty and chocolate flavored, didn't even like it.<br /><br />Simply put, its too bland.  Its sweet, sure, but there's not much peppermint and not much mocha.  It goes okay (but not great) in coffee, but in water I just felt like I was drinking hot sugar water.<br /><br />The Pumpkin Spice stuff is great, but don't bother with this.

review/summary: YUMMY
review/text: I am sitting here sipping this delicious drink as I write, and this is NOT my first cup.  It has been a while since I have had an International Latte and I'm wondering why. Talk about a drink that just makes your insides happy, this is it. At first I thought  perphaps the peppermint flavor would be over-powering but it is not.  Just the right amount, the flavor of the entire drink is rich and very satisfying, although I had to add some sugar, but I want everything sweet. I made my granddaughter one, she wanted it cold, and she loves it.  I myself think it tastes better hot and is perfect for the upcoming nights of sitting around the Christmas tree with friends and family and sharing this drink.  Very good, a tasty treat  and I would recommend it.

review/summary: A Taste of the Holidays
review/text: Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha is a wonderful cold season treat.  From the initial opening of the can with its burst of scent to your first taste, this is what starts the holiday season for me.<br /><br />For an extra indulgence, I love to add it to Maxwell House's Orange Caf&eacute; and the combined flavors remind me of a special treat from an old coffee house that is no longer in business.  So for something special, combine these two great tastes for an amazing holiday delight.

review/summary: Pretty good!
review/text: Delicious taste. I love peppermint, so I was incredibly excited to try this product. Unfortunately, the ingredients are not so delicious. Hydrogenated oil, corn syrup... two big no-no's for me. While this was great to try (and this was definitely a treat drink for me), I try to keep the not-so-good for you ingredients out of my diet, which means the remains of this went into the trash.<br /><br />When it comes to taste, this is amazing. If you don't take issue with the ingredients, then by all means, buy it. If, however, you are like me--and are mindful of what you consume--then I would say to avoid the temptation with this and make your own peppermint latte.

review/summary: Minty Mix
review/text: After mixing and remixing this, I finally found the correct ratio of product to liquid.  The peppermint flavor is bold while the chocolate is not quite rich enough, being masked by the initial mint burst.  However, when mixed with milk, the flavors come out a bit more evenly than with water, which tends to make this seem really watered down if there isn't enough flavor mix added.  I like it as a change from just chocolate or vanilla coffee flavor since the peppermint is refreshing without being overly powerful.  Just takes some fiddling to get the mixture right.  Overall, a good instant product.

review/summary: Taste of the Holidays
review/text: Being the oral type, I associate food with holidays and chocolate and peppermint are definitely Christmas flavors.  Add coffee to that and you've got a satisfying jolt of caffeine with some holiday flavor.  The flavor is light and not overwhelming and mixes well with hot water.  Be sure to use hot water and stir generously as these coffees sometimes leave a dredge at the bottom of the cup if not mixed thoroughly.  Overall this is a nice pick me up anytime of day and excellent to sip while reading or watching tv.  And it's a lot cheaper to make a cup of it at home than go to you-know-where and try to remember that tall means small and grande means medium and have to choose between numerous milk options.

review/summary: Delicious, Holiday Treat
review/text: Many folks are scaling back on the cost of gift-giving this year, and I highly recommend a gift basket or gift bag including an inexpensive Christmas mug plus a can of this Maxwell House International Coffee in the Peppermint Mocha Latte flavor. Remember that Amazon sells a pack of 4 for the price! It makes a smooth, creamy instant cup of coffee with rich chocolate and cool peppermint notes... sinfully delicious!<br /><br />You can bake with this, too. I stirred two rounded tablespoons into dry packaged brownie mix (9 X 11 inch pan size) before adding wet ingredients, then folded in chocolate chips and broken peppermint candy pieces. You could skip the fold in part, frost your brownies with chocolate frosting and top with broken pieces of peppermint candy as a special dessert or treat for holiday potlucks. Consider stirring a tablespoon or two of the dry mix into your chocolate sugar cookie recipe for a hint of coffee and peppermint flavors.<br /><br />In summary, this instant coffee is a yummy, affordable splurge for the upcoming holidays. Enjoy!

review/summary: Glorified hot cocoa?
review/text: Everyone is offering a peppermint mocha today.  Just take a drive down the road at all the major chain coffee shops and even the local ones.  You can't miss it this time of year.  Well now Maxwell House wants to bring that popular holiday flavor to your home.  First off, the recommended serving size is too small of a serving.  Your going to have to double it.  Mixing is easy, add powder to water.  The end result is a very weak latte or a strong hot cocoa.  The peppermint flavor over powers any chocolate or coffee taste.  It's nice to have the ability to make something like this at home, but I think it's a concoction best left for the experts.

review/text: I adore the Christmastime Peppermint Mocha drinks from Starbucks. While I never assumed this would be anywhere near AS good, I figured it would at least be GOOD. Mixed with hot water, all this tastes like is peppermint. There is a faint mocha taste, and no discernable coffee taste at all. This is better used as a flavoring for real coffee or mixed in milk to make a peppermint hot chocolate drink.

review/summary: Too weak to work- disappointing
review/text: I'm a tea drinker, not a coffee drinker but I find these little tins make a nice change and a peppermint  coffee sounds good for the holidays. Unfortunately the delivery didn't live up to the promise.<br /><br />It smells wonderful. A Christmassy peppermint smell with a thick froth of foam on top. Sitting on a table top perfuming the air it's like a commercial for Christmas. The problem is that the flavor is too weak. After all the promise it just sort of falls flat. I tried to make it with more powder, same effect. It looks and smells wonderful but in the end it just disappoints. Not really worth the money.

Fairly easy, and it dissolved with no problems but very heavy on the peppermint and not much else there. The ingredient list isn't terribly encouraging either with sugar right at the top, followed by the *cream* with a list of things you'd rather not know, with the "instant coffee" well towards the bottom of the list. From looking at the Nutrition facts its seems rather high on the carb content.<br /><br />I really didn't find much in this product that I could recommend it at all, and not one I'd try again.

review/summary: Too much mint, not enough mocha.
review/text: To this day my mom still loves her International Coffee, which is why I decided to give this new flavor a shot. Peppermint Mocha sounded good for cold, holiday-type weather. Sadly, I still don't see what my mom loves about it. First, the packaging is "new." No longer does it come in a cute, sturdy tin can; but rather a flexible plastic packaging. Second, I used approximately 7 ounces of hot water (calls for 6-8) and added 4 heaping teaspoons of powder. A pleasant fizzing ensued, creating what I assume is supposed to be the "foam" of the latte. After I let it cool a bit, and stirred it plenty to dissolve those annoying chunks of powder, I took a sip and was hit in the face with peppermint. Way, way to much peppermint. After letting it cool some more I took another sip and it was actually worse than the first. Perhaps I used too much water and not enough coffee, but I tasted no mocha flavoring in this beverage. I can't imagine using less water though, as the peppermint was insanely strong with the amount I had.<br /><br />Overall, the convenience is not worth it, unless watery-peppermint-with coffee undertones is your thing.

review/summary: Minty and Sweet
review/text: Having been a fan of the Maxwell House International "coffee" mixes for years, I looked forward to trying the peppermint mocha flavor and anticipated a chocolate peppermint blend. One of my favorites in the series is the International Orange mix.<br /><br />It appears that Maxwell House has changed the design of the packaging, the names, and the size, for I remember buying these in a larger, metal container.<br /><br />A look at the ingredients shows that the first ones listed are: sugar, non dairy creamer, multiple multi-syllabled concoctions, and far down the list cocoa and instant coffee. Mixing the powdered blend with water produces a somewhat tasty drink with a litle bit of a foam on top. There's a hint of chocolate in there, but the only way to know coffee is in the blend is to read the ingredient list. For me, the peppermint taste is too pronounced, but that's my personal preference.<br /><br />I like making my drink with at least half milk to produce a tastier, richer experience. Using the International Latte as a creamer/flavorer in my morning coffee is also a preference of mine. That way I get the coffee and the subdued peppermint kick.<br /><br />Though I'm enjoying this sampling of International Latte, were I to purchase another it would be a different flavor, the International Orange or something more chocolatey.

You can get the full taste of the Peppermint Mocha with the mixed in sugar free versions. The 100% Peppermint Mocha with no sugar-free is super rich and tastes like a desert. To knock yourself out, get some peppermint ice cream (the kind with the little chunks of candy cane) mix 2-3 tablespoons of Peppermint Mocha into just a little water--until it's dissolved and pour it on the ice cream.

review/text: Normally I don't go for instant coffees, but this was delicious.  The instructions suggest 4 teaspoons in 6-8oz of hot water.  I used 5 teaspoons in 12oz of water with a dollop of Silk soy creamer.  It made for a delicious peppermint mocha low in fat and high in taste.  Starbucks' peppermint mochas are too sweet and sharp for me.  Too much peppermint, too much chocolate.  This powder is the perfect mix - you get a much lighter drink.  My only complaint is that it doesn't pack much of a caffeine wallop.  Starbucks has Maxwell House beat there.

review/text: Anyone who has enjoyed dipping a candy cane into a mug of cocoa and savoring that hint of minty goodness that blends so perfectly with chocolate is going to be really, really disappointed by this brew. The harsh artificial peppermint flavor tastes exactly like mouthwash.  The coffee flavor is very faint, there isn't much sweetness either.  This is a perfectly horrible beverage.  I tried adding a little sugar, hoping more sweetness would cut the medicinal peppermint assault. It didn't.<br /><br />Forget TV commercials that depict women sighing with delight over their steaming mugs of International Coffee.  If those women can drink this stuff without shuddering, it can only mean one thing: they had the foresight to lace it with a double shot of bourbon.<br /><br />If coffee/chocolate/mint appeals to you, there's a really easy way satisfy the craving:  Make a cup of real coffee and toss in a Peppermint Patty.  No kidding. It's easy and yummy. You get a lovely, rich, chocolaty, minty blend (and you can still add that shot of bourbon if no one is looking). And when you finish the cup, there's this delicious chocolate-mint sludge at the bottom of the cup waiting to be spooned up.

review/summary: Needed to tweak recipe to taste good
review/text: I've tried many flavors of Maxwell House's instant coffee drinks. They all do better with four "well-rounded" teaspoons instead of the flat four teaspoons the instructions suggest is all you should need for 6-8 oz water. i.e. Use 5-6 teaspoons per 6-8 oz water if you want a drink at all worth the time/money. It's a shame the packaging is not more honest with how much mix is really needed for a decent drink in order to fool customers into thinking they're getting more for their money than they really are. I tried one drink following the packaging directions just to make sure since it's a different flavor than what I've had before (6 oz water + 4 tsp mix). The result was a muddy looking pool of peppermint water.. no good mocha taste except what you might expect when you put some water in a dirty coffee cup and pick up the remnants of coffee - that's the only trace of "taste" other than peppermint I picked up.<br /><br />After adding an extra teaspoon (6 oz water + 5 tsp mix), I had a drink that was acceptable, but still not something I would favor enough to buy this mix over other flavors. The mocha taste is lighter than what you get from other flavored coffee mixes. I prefer stronger. At least I didn't find the mint or sweetness overpowering even with the extra teaspoon of mix.<br /><br />The best way I found to take this mix is adding in some extra instant coffee granules (6 oz water + 4 tsp this mix + 1 tsp other instant coffee mix + 1/4-1/2 tsp sugar). I added the sugar to counter the extra bitterness added by the regular coffee granules. This combination gave me a much more satisfying, flavorful drink, and I will continue drinking it this way until the powder is gone.<br /><br />I'm not happy with the fact I have to do so much tweaking on my end to get a good drink out of this. The whole point of these mixes is everything should already be in good proportion with proper instructions given on how much is needed to make it. If you don't mind the extra hassle, get this, otherwise, you might try other flavors that come with a better balance of tastes.

review/summary: Weak To The Last Drop
review/text: I am sorry to say that I was disappointed in Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte. If Teddy Roosevelt had been served this coffee at the Maxwell House hotel, Maxwell House may never have earned their colophon ("Good to the last drop.") This beverage boasts of two flavors; peppermint and mocha. Peppermint flavor has a strong beginning and a weak ending. Also the peppermint flavor does not linger. The mocha flavor is weak to non-existent throughout. I tried following the package directions; four teaspoons per six to eight ounces of water. I then kept adding more and more mix. Unfortunately, I could not find an acceptable ratio. This has to be the worst Maxwell House product I have tried. I do not think it is worth the money. It is very expensive. For the same cost, you could buy coffee beans, peppermint candy, cocoa and milk and create a much better home-made concoction. For the price of one canister, you could probably buy two cups of latte at Starbucks and enjoy it much more.

review/summary: Didn't Really Taste Like a Latte
review/text: I tried this product and it really didn't taste much like latte or even any kind of coffee.  I had to look up latte on the Internet to make sure I wasn't missing something.  The generally accepted definition of latte seems to be strong coffee with steamed milk.  When I checked the ingredients on this package the first ingredient was sugar, followed by nondairy creamer.  The first ingredient in the non dairy creamer was corn syrup solids.  The third ingredient was partially hydrogenated coconut oil. Coffee was actually the ninth ingredient, listed behind dipotassium phosphate, artificial flavor, and maloxdextrin, which explains why it didn't taste much like coffee.  I do think it is a misnomer to have latte on the front of this package.  I guess in smaller print they have the words "naturally and artificially flavored cafe-style beverage" so technically that is how they are defining their product. But in larger letters are the words Maxwell House and International Latte so I was really expecting something coffee tasting. Anyway the product doesn't really taste like latte or coffee at all.  It really just mainly tasted like hot sugar water with a few other kind of odd flavors thrown in.<br /><br />I think for the money I would stick with something more healthy and natural like black or green tea or even just real coffee with real milk added in.

review/summary: Good, mild flavor
review/text: I'm not much of a coffee drinker so if I drink a cup I prefer to have a mocha.  The chocolate flavor is good, the coffee flavor isn't overwhelming and the mint adds nicely to the overall taste.  Not a substitute for those who like a strong cup of black coffee but a good pick for someone looking for a good-tasting, milder, flavored coffee drink.

review/summary: Quality as always...
review/text: I grew up with these coffees as a little kid, not sure if I just remembered those old commercials or if my parents really liked them.  The Maxwell House International Coffee extends from the original General Foods International line, that is why the tin may be familiar to some and yet slightly different at the same time.<br /><br />I received this just as I experienced my first winter in the new town I would live in and it was such a welcome arrival.  Peppermint and mocha, together served hot in -10 F or more temperatures in a gloomy town with no ambition or progress is such a savior.  I loved and savored it, enjoying it with my lovely wife as she too endured this backwoods town (town name is witheld for now of course).<br /><br />I noticed some of the reviews about a lack of flavor or a serving size too small and just shake my head.  To each our own, but I am one of those that eats healthy and exercises regularly and can't help but feel somewhat saddened at so many of us who indulge in and grow blind to oversized proportions and our foods and drinks have to be bursting with insane amounts of sugars and fats.  But at around $8-9 a tin, those of us that need excess can use the entire tin for our single serving and sated...or perhaps even make it 2 servings to be a little bit more healthy (sarcasm hinted just in case).

review/summary: Coffee, chocolate, and peppermint flavors in one handy little can... what's not to like?
review/text: I'm more of a basic coffee person, but my wife enjoys flavored coffees so I ordered this for her.  She really liked it, pointing out how the rich chocolate flavor and underlying peppermint zing really complemented each other.  The sample can was gone in about a week and a half.<br /><br />And, hey, I even made a cup for myself, and quite enjoyed it.  It would likely be a big hit with me on a cold winter day... it's like a cup of hot chocolate with a little sophistication stirred in.<br /><br />I'm still more of a "normal cup of coffee" type of person, but one would be a cad to totally turn away from an occasional sweet indulgence like the one Maxwell House offers here.

review/summary: Nice and minty!
review/text: The first coffee I ever remember drinking (more than a sip, anyway) was Maxwell House International Coffee. I have enjoyed watching the new flavors come out and trying the various dietary options, and I'm also a big fan of peppermint, so this one was a natural for me. Even though it is not sugar-free or fat-free, one serving (4 teaspoons of the powder) is 50 calories, which is really not bad compared to having a pastry or something else when the sweet tooth hits. The peppermint flavor is strong, and then you taste the same old mocha that was probably your first favorite flavor of this stuff - a bit thinner than the coffee my mom makes, but pleasant. Like all of the International Coffee flavors (and all instant hot cocoa powders, for that matter), it mixes much better if you add hot (not cold) water to the powder instead of adding powder to water. If you like to use the microwave, you can heat the water in a measuring cup, use a single-cup coffee pot, or even use hot tap water. It's nice to have on hand for quick and easy enjoyment.

review/summary: Lots a mint, a little cocoa, but where's the Coffee?
review/text: Well folks, I'm not sure what this is supposed to taste like but all I get out of it is watery cocoa with lots of peppermint in it. Or is it lots of Peppermint with watered down cocoa? Its got so much peppermint its to the point of overdoing it. WAY overdoing it!<br />  My first try of it I used my big 12 oz. glass mug that I use for Latte's. Mixed it with approximately 3 parts milk to one part water & 7 heaping spoons of the mix. It was kinda watery so I added another three more heaping spoons of the mix. Even with 10 heaping spoons of the mix & that much milk, its still kinda thin. If you like a hot drink with a lot of Peppermint to it, and I mean a LOT, then you will probably like this one. I didn't realize it until I drank about half a mug full but my sinuses had been about half closed up and this stuff with all that Peppermint in it opened them right up! There is some chocolate flavor to it too but its mostly overpowered with the Peppermint and I cant tell if there's any coffee in it at all.<br />  I'm still not sure if I really like this very much. Maybe if I cut it with regular cocoa mix and make it half and half, or 2 parts cocoa to one part of this, it will be better. Or mix it with the cocoa @ 2 to 1 and use more milk than I did or add some half & half to the milk. It makes a richer latte if I use 3 parts milk to 1 part Half & Half in my Mr Coffee Cafe Latte machine so maybe it would improve the results with this mix.<br />But right now I'll have to wait to experiment with it 'till after I make a trip to the store since I used the last of my milk on it. But, to be honest I don't think I'd like it any which way that I could think of to mix it because it just has way too much Peppermint in it. It's been half an hour since I finished the mug full that I made and I still have a very strong aftertaste of Peppermint in my mouth.

review/text: Let's be honest, peppermint mocha is a great winter treat. The warmth of the liquid with the refreshing peppermint is delicious. Being a fan of peppermint mocha, I was excited to try this. Overall, I thought it was a good drink mix. It was a nice change from my usual coffee or hot chocolate. Also, I am a huge fan of anything peppermint.<br /><br />Having said that, there are some things to know when purchasing this product. First of all, this is sweet, so if you are not a fan of overly sweet drinks, you may not want this. Also, the coffee and mocha flavor was subtle. I didn't find it an issue, but do not buy this if you are looking for a rich decadent treat; you will be disappointed.

review/text: I fell in love! Rarely do I come across a flavored coffee that I like but with one sip of the Peppermint Mocha Latte, I knew I had found a coffee that was destined to become my favorite. The peppermint taste is perfect and does not leave an overwhelming flavor. It mingles nicely with the mocha that provides a satisfying taste. I had researched the Maxwell House website to find out where the product was sold. After running from store to store without any luck, my husband discovered the coffee here on Amazon (of course!) He promptly ordered eight cans of the coffee so that I could have enough to get through winter.

review/text: This coffee is flavorful, creamy and it tasted a lot like a latte that you would purchase at a coffee house.  I was pleasantly surprised by this coffee and didn't think I would like it as much as I did.  There is a good amount of sugar in it which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I loved how frothy the coffee was, I anticipated it to be flat and not creamy which is just the opposite of what I experienced.  I wish it had less sugar in it but that is just me.  It is definitely tasty!

As you add water, it starts to foam and the coffee dissolves.  You do have to stir quite a it to get all the lumps dissolved but not as much as you do most hot chocolate mixes.  It has just the right amount of sweetness for my taste and makes a nice afternoon treat.  I wish they made a sugar free decaf version.

review/text: Comparing to Starbucks Peppermint Mocha, this one tastes like mud. If you never tried Starbucks one: this one is too watery when prepared as directed, if you up the dosage of mix per ounce there is still not enough richness or decadence in it. It is simply not good enough. I did find a use for it though: if you add a teaspoonful to Swiss Miss Dark Chocolate sensation mix, which is perfectly divine by itself, it brings a bit of minty coffee flavor to dark chocolate and tastes great, but only mixed into Swiss Miss.

review/summary: It's okay
review/text: I doubt it's much different than it was prior, if any.  They said it's only a changed label.  For what it's worth, I liked the old label better, but that's of no real substance here.<br />I didn't think the coffee flavor was strong enough, even with double the dose.  The peppermint was a nice addition to the coffee, but neither was strong enough.  I wouldn't get it again for only that reason: strength.<br /><br />The idea is good, and the flavor is good...just not enough of it.  I guess there's no reason to up the peppermint, since it's only supposed to be a hint of flavor, but the coffee needs some work.  If the old Cafe au Lait appeals to you, i.e. weaker coffee flavor, but still not tasting like 'instant', then this might be just your thing.  It certainly has that holiday aroma, and I'm just sorry it didn't offer enough "coffee" for me.

review/text: I always need my coffee in the morning, and this made for a nice change of pace. It has a smooth, rich chocolate flavor with hints of fresh peppermint. It would make for a great treat during the holidays.<br /><br />However, it does have its flaws. Depending on how you mix it, it can have almost no flavor or be too sweet. It also uses corn syrup, non-dairy creamer, and artificial flavors that aren't particularly good for your diet. In addition, the package is rather small, so the coffee goes quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that this is more for fans of hot chocolate than coffee drinkers, but makes for a sweet winter treat for anyone.

review/text: A nice change from regular coffee, it has a nice rich taste depending how you prepare it, I made it with water and also tried it with milk, I found I preferred it with water. Asides from the taste, I got quite a pick-up from it and  found it a very enjoyable drink. It is quite sweet, something you cannot compromise on or else it will be on the thin side.<br />The package itself is a little on the small side, It did not last long in our house, and was empty by the next day....though this does mean that everyone liked it!<br />I would compare it to a high end hot chocolate drink with a nice peppermint taste. If you enjoy flavored coffee's or hot chocolate hot drinks, this will please your taste buds. However, if you don't like sweet drinks...it may not suit you.

review/text: The Maxwell House International Latte is easy to make, and does taste good. You must use a lot of the mix to get a full-bodied cup of the peppermint mocha. In my opinion, the peppermint flavor overpowers the mocha... And it really seems more like a cup of peppermint hot chocolate than a coffee drink. Keep in mind, it's made mostly of sugar, nondairy creamer, corn syrup, and a host of artificial favors. That said, if you like peppermint hot chocolate that's easy to make with hot water, this is for you.

review/text: This tastes like a weak hot chocolate with peppermint in it. It does get a little foamy on top which makes you think it is like a capachino but the flavor isn't strong enough and I really couldn't taste any coffee flavor in it. You need to put more than it calls for to get a strong enough flavor but it still doesn't have a coffee flavor to it. The mint makes it a nice change of pace and really does add to the flavor but this is not something I would buy often, for the price and the extra you need to use, plus the fact that the flavor isn't as good as the real thing it really isn't worth the price and is not what I would consider gourmet or special.

review/text: I love Peppermint Mocha and eagerly await it's arrival at Starbucks every winter, as well as the Coffeemate Creamer in the grocery store.  So I was excited to see this product.  The first cup I made tasted weak, so I decided I hadn't used enough.  Next cup, two heaping teaspoons.  Still a tad weak in the flavor department.  So, although you taste the mint and the mocha, you just don't taste it enough in my estimation.  Also, they've now changed the containers from tin (recyclable) to #5 plastic, so into the landfill it goes.

review/summary: Very tasty!
review/text: I am a huge peppermint lover!  I am also a bit of a picky person when it comes to drink mixes.  For me, many end up being powdery and not as creamy and tasty as I would like.  That was not the case with Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte mix.  Once you find just the right mixture of powder and hot water, you are good to go.  The container states 4 tsp to 6 - 8 oz of boiling water.  Well, I always have a big mug when I drink, which is about double this.  Not a problem - I usually use 8 tsp for my 16 oz. mug and it turns out great.  The peppermint flavor is amazingly refreshing and so delicious.  It is not overpowering, yet is strong enough that the drinker knows it is peppermint flavored.  For me, this is one of the perfect ways to treat myself after a crazy or hectic day.  Curling up with a mug of this peppermint mocha latte and a great book makes a blissful evening!  I highly recommend this mix to anyone who enjoys peppermint and chocolate.

review/summary: Festive flavor for the holidays, but I think I'll stick with "real" coffee
review/text: To save calories and all the artificial ingredients, I really wish I could drink plain black coffee, but I just don't like it.  I usually have brewed coffee with flavored non-dairy creamer.  When I saw this product (and the Pumpkin Spice variety) available through the Vine program, I thought I would give it a try.  It's okay, but nothing great.  It's sweet and has a slight peppermint flavor (fun for the holidays), but really no coffee flavor to speak of.  It's certainly not the quality of a latte drink you would get at a coffee shop.  On the plus side, it is super easy to make plus costs much less than a latte drink from a coffee shop.  The product does not contain much actual coffee, so it certainly won't give the morning pick-me-up that I have come to expect from my morning coffee.  So I think I will stick with my usual brewed coffee with flavored non-dairy creamer in the mornings and the occasional latte or similar drink at the local coffee shop.

review/summary: Good at home peppermint mocha mix
review/text: I like mocha, and I like peppermint.  I think I especially like these drinks around the holiday season.  A little sweet, a little decadent, but why not?  The Peppermint Mocha flavored International Latte by Maxwell House is a convenient and cheaper way to have a peppermint mocha at home.  Is it the same as those made by your favorite coffee shop?  No.  But it is a nice instant drink when you are in the mood for something hot and flavorful at the house.<br /><br />It mixes well, but I use a larger than 8 oz mug, so I have to put more than the recommended serving to get the taste I want.  That's another nice thing about doing it at home, you can make it as strong or weak as you like.  If you want more coffee, try mixing this peppermint mocha powder with coffee rather than water.  I like it that way too, just as I like the liquid peppermint mocha creamers being sold this time of year.  However, most of the time I just mix this powder with water.<br /><br />There is more sugar and other ingredients than coffee by reading the list on the package.  That means it is not a strong cup of coffee, which may suit some people better.  Because it is high in sugar, with a touch of fat, it is high in calories for what it is.  But it is not nearly as calorie laden as those from a coffee shop.<br /><br />So, for a nice, flavorful, quick, mix-it-at-home, powdered beverage that mixes with water, Maxwell House's Peppermint Mocha is nice to have in the cupboard for when you want a cup of peppermint mocha at home.

review/summary: It's the moooost won-der-ful tiiiime of the year!
review/text: ...and Maxwell House's Peppermint Mocha mix will help set the tone at your house.  I'm not sure what sort of magic Maxwell House has captured here, but this product completely surpassed my and my wife's expectations.  (It probably helps to have somewhat low expectations!)  We weren't hoping for anything close to coffee house quality, but I dare say that when mixed correctly, this mocha surpasses the beverages one gets out of the machine at the local gas station.  That's pretty darn good, considering this comes out of a can.  That considered, I'm very happy with this sweet concoction.  It's got a lovely peppermint flavor that balances the coffee nicely.  Not too sweet, certainly not bitter.  It's a nice cold-weather combo.  The peppermint aroma will have the family wandering by to see what you're brewing.<br /><br />If you're looking for a remarkably easy coffee treat at home, this is a nearly fool proof way to go.  I recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: Satisfying for the Holidays
review/text: Maxwell House's International Coffee Peppermint Mocha is something that I'd only think of picking up around the holidays. As it is a simple, home mixed Latte, you have to keep that in mind when you compare it to Latte's you get in coffee houses and restaurants. Each can is just 7.1 ounces and the amount that it takes to make a good cup of Peppermint Mocha is about 1 1/2 times what the directions call for.  The peppermint flavor is stronger but you do get the taste of the mocha (particularly if you increase the amount used). It is good with both water and when you use milk and it is delightful as a "holiday extra" or on a cold night. We did mix some in with a pre-packaged cake mix and the peppermint flavor is primarily what came through, so I'm not sure that using it to bake with is more cost effective than just using some peppermint extract. I'd classify this more as a "treat" or impulse purchase but one you'll be satisfied with if you keep in mind that it isn't replacing a trip to the coffee house.

review/text: As with many cocoa mixes, the quantity of powder needed to make a satisfying cup of hot chocolate is surprising. I followed the instructions on the box and felt that the taste was a little thin. I will add more powder next time. The peppermint flavor is tasty. Not much mocha taste, though.

The taste is wonderful and it mixes well whether I used a lot of the mix or just a bit in a brewed cup of coffee!! The aroma of this beverage is wonderful.  The peppermint enhances the taste rather than overwhelming it.  Try this coffee and you will be hooked!! I only hope it is not just available for the holidays!

review/text: Well, I have to say that I never would have bought this product on my own.  I got this on Vine to test, and I am sold.  I would actually buy it again.  I'm a coffee snob, so I would have walked past it in the supermarket.  But seriously, it's delicious!  It's not for the hard core coffee drinker - it almost tastes like a peppermint hot chocolate, maybe a mocha.  But it is easy and tasty, and I totally recommend it if you want something yummy once in awhile.

review/text: One thing for certain, you really can not go wrong when choosing Maxwell House. For years their products have been top quality in taste and always at a reasonable price. But the Peppermint Mocha Latte is by far their best creation, especially during the Holidays. It has such a rich flavor! Our main concern was that the peppermint would overpower the taste but I have to say it was perfectly blended. To us it's the best way to wind down a day; sit by the fireplace sipping a peppermint mocha latte and just relaxing. Very highly recommended!

review/text: Ummm...I'll admit that I'm in love with a lot of Starbuck's drinks, so I compare all coffee to theirs. However, as I sit here sipping on a cup of Maxwell House International "Peppermint Mocha Latte" Coffee, I must admit that I am pleased. This chocolaty with a hint of peppermint drink is slightly reminiscent of a certain Peppermint Mocha. All that's missing is the whipped cream and chocolate shavings. I must admit that this is my first time trying a Maxwell House International Coffee and I think that I'm a fan. Very satisfying except that I had to add a little sugar. Other than that, I would recommend this drink.

review/summary: Not bad if you keep in mind it's instant coffee
review/text: A "latte in a box" is really instant coffee, and in setting expectations for this product, you've got to keep that in mind. There's no fancy milk steamer, no fresh coffee grounds, no barista to pull a shot and stir in the milk.<br /><br />You just boil water, put a tablespoon or so of the coffee mix in a cup, pour on the water and stir. There's nothing at all to add, not even milk. Easy? You bet. That's the good part.<br /><br />The bad part is that something has to be compromised in the process, and like all instant coffees, this one can't, and doesn't, measure up to the real thing.<br /><br />So then we have to ask, how close does it come? Is enough flavor and quality delivered to make it at least a decent drink, if not a great drink?<br /><br />I thought so when I tried this product, and I got one unexpectedly pleasant surprise: a nice frothy layer of foam appeared at the top of my cup, nicely mimicking a "real" latte. I haven't seen that before in an instant coffee.<br /><br />The flavor wasn't fantastic, but neither was it unacceptable. The mocha and peppermint, especially the latter, were somewhat overdone and detracted from the coffee taste, which came across as a little weak and thin (despite following the package directions as to quantity of powder to use). You might want to mix yours a little stronger, although that might make the peppermint even more dominant.<br /><br />I would call this something of a "mood" drink; something you'd need to be in the mood for, as opposed to a regular, everyday sort of thing.<br /><br />Nutritionally, you might think this would be a brewing disaster, but the stats per serving are really quite good: 50 calories, 9 grams of carbs (7g of that is sugar), and 40mg of sodium. That's a lot better than a can of sugary soda even if it isn't quite the same as plain black coffee.<br /><br />I give this four stars out of five because I think it does quite well for an instant coffee product. It isn't something I'll drink very often, but I was quite surprised at how far the instant coffee "art" has come.

review/summary: Delicious Taste
review/text: I was utterly excited when I saw this item and it certainly did not disappoint. It's not too sweet and the the mint undertones were perfect. The chocolate taste was also not overpowering, but you could certainly taste it.<br /><br />I added around 4 teaspoons to a cup of heated soymilk that I had heated in the microwave. It was delicious and I personally think that the soymilk helps compliments the flavors. I haven't tried regular milk since we don't usually have that in our fridge.<br /><br />I also attempted to mix this with milo, with soymilk of course. Two teaspoons of milo and two of this product had a richer chocolate taste, but the peppermint taste was still there. I prefer this one versus just the 4 teaspoons of peppermint mocha latte.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention the wonderful foam? It's absolutely splendid and it doesn't disappear after a few minutes.<br /><br />I have yet to add this to coffee, but I definitely plan to once I start drinking coffee again. I'm sure that a teaspoon or two will help brighten my day up in the morning.<br /><br />As for the cost, it's on the pricier side for me, especially since one 7.1 oz can doesn't seem to last a long time if you only use this mixed with water/milk. With 4 teaspoons per cup, I can maybe manage about 10 cups. It has a much higher value if you simply mix a teaspoon or two to hot chocolate or coffee since I can still get the same flavor, but enhanced with the taste of coffee or more chocolate. I might pick this up at my local store, but I can't see myself buying 4 cans of this at this price. While it can go a long way, I'd rather buy one can to last me during the holidays.

review/summary: Holiday Treat
review/text: I am a bit of a coffee snob, so to call this "coffee" is a little hard for me to swallow.  However, it is a great holiday beverage -- more along the line of a gourmet hot chocolate.  The mint is good and strong- the choclate flavor is creamy - but the coffee flavor is non existent.  I thought it took more than package recommendation of the product (powder) to make my beverage falvorful enough. The mix had a tendency to sink to the bottom, so be sure to over-stir.  My favorite way to use it to add the mix to warm milk -- very rich and flavorful.

review/summary: Much Better Than Expected
review/text: I was expecting this Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha Latte mix to be a thin, watery-tasting mess but I was happy to find that the flavor was decent.  The flavor really increased when I decided to use milk in place of water.  Wow.....it made a big difference in the flavor and the richness!  I highly recommend skipping the water and going with warm milk.  Here is what I did...I heated some whole milk in a saucepan over low heat until the milk was lukewarm. I then added the Peppermint Mocha Latte mix. (Waiting until the milk is WARM helps the powder to dissolve and creates a smoother drink.) I then continued to heat this mixture until it was hot - about the temperature of hot coffee or cocoa.  Yum!<br /><br />If you are expecting a coffee tasting drink (as the Latte in the name implies) then you will be disappointed.  I would describe this more as a hot chocolate or cocoa type beverage.  The taste was really nice and the minty flavor was refreshing. There was a good balance of mocha and peppermint which resulted in a smooth, rich flavor.

review/text: I love anything Peppermint Mocha, so I was excited when I came across this.  I typically add Peppermint Mocha creamer to my hot chocolate and my coffee.  This is gives you the same feel when you don't have time to brew a pot of coffee.  I like it at work since all you really need is hot water.  I would recommend it.  The only sad part is that it probably won't be around once the holidays pass.  Peppermint Mocha seems to be a holiday trend and gone.  Get it while you can find it...for you, for the coffee lover in your life, to pair with a cute mug in a gift basket...<br /><br />Five stars from me for Peppermint Mocha International Latte by Maxwell House.

review/text: If you like hot chocolate with mint, you will likely enjoy this new holiday flavor by Maxwell House.  There isn't much coffee flavor, so this is literally like drinking hot chocolate with mint.  My mug holds about 2 cups of hot water and it takes 2 heaping tablespoons to get full flavor from this mix.  The mix is also a bit powdery and needs to be stirred very well before it blends into the hot water.  The container is made of some sort of reinforced cardboard. I preferred the tins.  But I suppose this is one way for the company to save money.  All in all, though, this is a nice treat for the holidays.

review/summary: Short on coffee, long on tastiness . . . and sunnies up a winter day.
review/text: Don't count on this to keep you awake because of its caffeine content.  If anything, you might get a sugar high.  "Instant coffee" is the fifth ingredient after "sugar," "non-dairy creamer," "maltodextrin" and "cocoa."  In fact, it tastes much more like a specialty cocoa than it does a coffee.  Nice blend of peppermint and mocha flavors.  Certainly won't win any "healthy food" awards, but you probably know that already.  Fifty calories per serving, fifteen of which come from fat.  Nine grams of sugar.<br /><br />As with many hot-mix-type beverages, recommends 6 oz of milk or water per 4 tsp of product.  I used 4 tbsp (that's tablespoons) instead and was impressed with the intensity of taste.  Glad I tried it.

review/text: I have to echo the sentiments of others on here, the recommended amount is not nearly enough.  You have to add 3-4 tablespoons to really get any flavor.  The first ingredient is sugar, this is a lot of calories for little taste of peppermint and none of mocha.  Also, there's very little coffee umpf if that's what you're looking for.  It would make a nice office party gift tie with some cellophane and ribbon, the price is right.  However, if you really want a good cup of joe, you're going to have to stick with Starbucks Peppermint or get the International Delights creamer.

Viscosity just sounds like a icky term with which to describe coffee. If you use four, it's more of a nicely frothed latte.  If you use 2, and then add some marshmellows, it does a mighty fine impersonation of a mint hot chocolate, so nice for a winter's day.  This is going to be routinely stocked in my pantry.

I tend to use the MHI Coffee powders as flavor enhancers in my daily brew, but for once I wasn't crazy about the flavor. Actually, the first thing I really didn't care for was the "self-foaming" aspect to this one, almost as if it has some tiny peppermint-flavored pop rocks in it or something. Not needed and kind of weird to me. Overall the taste is alright, though I feel it needs to be paired with a regular cup of coffee for optimal taste. Just by itself with hot water it's kind of flat.

review/summary: Simply Perfect!
review/text: When McDonald's launched their new Peppermint Hot Chocolate and Peppermint Mocha, I knew that I was doomed! I am addicted to peppermint in any and all forms, so a daily drive-through before work, netted me a comforting and tasty hot drink on the way to work. However, at $3.07 per day, with a weekly total of $15.35 going out of my wallet, it soon became apparent that this "treat" was more of a "trick", with a monthly total of $61.40!!!! That's a lot of groceries or gas money for one small mocha!<br /><br />So, when Vine offered a trial of the Maxwell House International Peppermint Mocha Latte, I jumped at the chance to save a hefty portion of that $61.40 and put it to better use!<br /><br />Now, I don't know how other peppermint-lovers feel about mint-flavoured products but there are times that the mint extract is SO pronounced, you don't know if you're eating/drinking toothpaste or a mint-flavoured item!!!! So, my expectations were not high. Surprise! Surprise! Surprise! The mint ratio on this product is bang-on: not too minty, not artificial tasting in the least...a perfect balance of mint and mocha! This is a 10 star product, in my opinion. I pour myself a small amount of coffee into my travel mug, add a regular plastic spoon's worth of sugar and an equal amount of the Maxwell House International Peppermint Mocha Latte to the coffee, give it a quick stir, top it off with coffee and then my normal amount of Half & Half. I would NEVER be able to tell the difference between my homemade brew and McDonald's beverage in a side-by-side taste test.<br /><br />Now, instead of raising McDonald's Profit Margin, I'm raising my OWN by making an equally tasty coffee drink and banking the rest of the money saved. I highly, highly recommend this product for excellent taste, quick ability to dissolve and saving me a substantial amount of money in the deal!<br /><br />Thanks, Maxwell House, and Thanks, amazon, for making this and selling this great new flavour addition to my morning coffee routine. :)

review/text: I've tried other Maxwell House International Coffee flavors before so I had a pretty good idea that this would be good.  When you open it up the powder looks pretty much just like hot chocolate and I couldn't even smell the peppermint.  So the first thing I tried it in was coffee.  I added two teaspoons to my regular cup of coffee and it was delicious.  The peppermint flavor came through well and the latte part was maybe too much but I'd already added creamer to my coffee so it's probably a suit to taste issue.  I also tried adding it to my regular hot chocolate and that was really good too.  Drinking it with hot chocolate allowed me to taste the mocha flavor along with the peppermint.  I have not tried it as a standalone product.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone that likes peppermint.

review/summary: Nice peppermint mocha flavor
review/text: I've found that most pre-sweetened coffee drinks taste almost the same: too sweet and have an artificial flavor. This one is actually quite good. It's sweet, but not too sweet. The peppermint and mocha combinations tastes delicious. If you stir it well, there's a little foam on top that makes it pretty close to a coffee house style latte. You can also make it with milk for a richer taste. With about 17 servings per can, if you don't want to spend $4 or more for one little latte at a coffee shop, this is a great tasting alternative.

review/summary: Delicious coffee for the holidays!
review/text: Maxwell House International Coffee Peppermint Mocha Latte is a perfect drink for the holidays! It has just the right amount of peppermint flavor, and is smooth and creamy. And it's so quick and easy to make! Just scoop some into a cup, add hot water, stir and enjoy. This is great to keep on hand for unexpected guests or just for a special treat for yourself. This is one of my favorite flavors from the Maxwell House International Coffee product line. It would make a wonderful gift for friends and family, too!

review/summary: Taste HORRIBLE!
review/text: Things have certainly changed for this brand.  First you will notice that this will not be shipped in the old school metal container; you now will get it in a plastic container much like their coffee.  The taste has also changed.  Being a person who enjoys the Peppermint Mocha Creamer I was excited to try this only to be disappointed!  I followed Maxwell Houses directions and got some clumping to go with the fizzing that creates the foam to make it a latte.  After stirring again, and again to break up the chunks, I finally go to take a sip and what do I taste is WATER!  I ended up adding two more tablespoons just to get any taste out of it, by this point almost half of the container is gone.  This is not worth the money you spend for it.

review/summary: Christmas in a cup!
review/text: This International Coffee was a balanced blend of the taste of coffee,chocolate and peppermint.  It was smooth (no tart overpowering coffee taste) and did not leave an aftertaste as some powdered hot drinks do.  I did find that as a dedicated chocoholic that I had to put in more than the recommended amount in order to get the flavor that was satisfying to me.  When it is made with milk it becomes a rich drinking experience.  When it is made with water the flavor is much more light.  Overall I would purchase this and would recommend it to others who need their peppermint fix!

review/summary: Not exactly coffee but still tastes good
review/text: There is almost a misnomer in the title of this product. It is not a Latte; rather, it is more of a peppermint cocoa flavored beverage. Still very good and has the hints of Christmas you would expect from something like this product. A nice clean aftertaste and refreshing for a hot beverage. Give it a try.

review/summary: It really does "foam up"!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Peppermint- anything! This Maxwell House Peppermint Mocha Latte is extremely tasty. I make it with warmed low fat milk instead of water and I think it is really delicious that way. After you stir in the powder and let it sit, you can actually see the foam start to rise on the top of the latte! It's really neat! This drink is extremely creamy and the flavor is not too 'pepperminty'. You can add more or less powder depending on your taste or add half milk, half water for a lower calorie latte. My only comment is sometimes I wish it had a little more of a 'mocha' flavor- or even a chocolate flavor. However, this mix is perfect for latte lovers and for the upcoming Holiday Season.

review/summary: Flavor is excellent but you only get about 6 per canister
review/text: I do love peppermint mocha.  And this definitely delivers the flavor.  Now the one thing is that each canister makes 6 8oz servings.  So for the price I find it a little expensive (cheaper than Starbucks but then the quality is also less.)<br /><br />Now that said here is a very important warning!!  This product foams like a latte, so you for an 8 oz drink you should use a 12 oz mug. Yes, there is that much foam.  The foam reduces drastically but you need to have a mug that will hold the initial foam.  Also, like most other similar products, the mix does not fully disolve without a lot of stirring.  But once stirred, you should only get a few nuggets of undisolved mix.<br /><br />For what it is, Maxwell House has made a very good product but I would not buy it at the suggested retail price.

review/summary: Expected a lot more from a popular coffee mfg
review/text: I've had other International flavored coffee's before and have been pleased, but this one is not up to par to be included in this category. Following the directions the flavor was really weak and tasted watered down, so I added an extra scoop to the cup to get more flavor and it tasted more like hot chocolate than flavored coffee. This was a dissapointment to me and I was so looking forward to a nice holiday flavor.

review/summary: With a touch of my Aerolatte, this becomes cafe quality goodness
review/text: I used to drink International Coffees a long time ago or should I say, my family brought them, probably to relive their memories of Jean-Luc!  I am sure I am not the first to make that joke, but hey, that commercial was a classic.  So now, I am trying International Coffees again, but this one is more seasonal and American then a trip to Paris.  It's more of a home for the holidays blend.<br /><br />I tried this coffee with water.  If I added what they told me to add, it seemed to weak, so I added another teaspoon or so.  I didn't find it too much to my liking.  Even when I added hot water to a cup with the powder sitting in the bottom, it wouldn't mix completely. But I then used milk and my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001RT2C4">Aerolatte To Go, Milk Frother, Black</a> to mix up the powder.  What a difference.  Now it tastes like high quality hot chocolate you'd get at a decant cafe.  The mint taste is really nice and works well with milk.<br /><br />I would drink it this way all the time, as opposed to making it with water.  But I may froth the water and coffee to see if I like it better. I wish I could mix the powder up with a spoon and have it completely dissolve because part of the fun of the coffee is to see it create it's own foam on top, which is probably not in the natural order of things.  The Aerolatte blends the foam right into the cup, on that effect is gone.<br /><br />I give it five stars, because foamed up and completely mixed in warm milk (about 1 minute and 1/2 in the microwave, not boiling) it is fantastic.  Reminds me of my trip to the Alps and Fritz, my skiing instructor, but that is a whole other story! :)

I'm more of a "little coffee with my cream and sugar" kind of person so this is the perfect type of product for me as I really didn't get much of a flavor of actual coffee.<br />I give this item four stars as it has quite a nice flavor and makes a nice, hot, relaxing drink.

review/text: During the holiday season I drink peppermint mocha coffee from a well know coffee shop so I was thrilled to find this product available on the Vine list for review.  A lot of product is needed to create a cup of coffee (4 teaspoons) and the flavor was weak on both the mocha and the peppermint sides. No full bodied flavor here. I knew this would not taste exactly like a brew from the coffee shop but I could not have known the flavors just from taste. There was no pleasant aroma along with no full burst of peppermint mocha!

Order it!<br /><br />You can thaw out the slices the way I did if you like.  At 30% power, heat 4 slices in a regular microwave for about 55 seconds.  Don't cover them while you are doing this.  Plus, there are slips of paper between each slice, so you need not cut anything or worry about adhesions.

review/text: Cheesecake arrived within a week of ordering.  Packing was amazing, ice in the pack was still frozen, and so was the cheesecake. We let it thaw to room temperature.  It is delicious, creamy, crust is perfect...but for me personally, it is super-sweet.  Typical of my taste, I just don't like super sweet anything. So, if you have a love of cheesecake that really is 'New YorK' style and really love super-sweet, then this is perfect for you.  For those of us who love creamy cheesecake with a nice crust but are more reserved on the super-sweet, think twice.

review/summary: Update of previous review
review/text: This is a resubmittal of a previous review.  Originally, when I received my cheesecake I was very disappointed with the careless way it had been packaged and delivered - and I said so in my review.  I NOW say that if anybody ever says that Omaha Steakes doesn't care about their product feedback, do NOT believe it.  After submitting my original review, I was contacted by Mr. Sendgraff of Omaha Steaks who apologized for their poor packaging and inormed me that Omaha Steaks has a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all their products and, that he was refunding my entire purchase price, including shipping.  Even after I told him we had eaten the cheesecake, and it was really quite good, he insisted that my experience had not met their 100% satisfaction guarantee standards and my refund would stand.  I say, THANK YOU, Mr. Sendgraff, you are a credit to Omaha Steaks Customer Service and have restored my confidence completely.  I'm looking forward to my next purchase of an Omaha Steaks product.

review/summary: Something unusual
review/text: I first bought this in a local Hispanic market (at $2.99) where it seemed it was the only place I could find it. I needed these 'shells' for a dessert recipe in Daisy Martinez' newest cookbook. The shells are fairly large and can be "stuffed" with any filling you find pleasing, I used a whipped cream mixture.  I made that dessert and had some shells leftover, so I pureed them and froze them to use as a 'dessert' sauce for later on.  The texture when pureed is like a thick nectar, so it makes a great alternative to using peach nectar when making the famous drink, a Bellini. With a few tbs. of guava puree at the bottom of a glass and some sparkling wine or champagne in the glass you have a simple drink.  The guava when used as a sauce, puree, or whole, has a beautiful salmon blush color, so it's a delight to the eye as well as the stomach. I mention these suggestions for use b/c it is a new food item I am just figuring out myself!
