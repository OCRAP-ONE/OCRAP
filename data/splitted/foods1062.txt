review/text: Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.  I realize that taste is a personal thing.

review/summary: A Lime flavored spicey Nut
review/text: Lime and Chili seemed a strange combination but the Lime Flavor is natural, not sweet, just tart enough to bring out the chili spice to create a great tasting nut treat to snack on.  Almonds are a great, fun snack and having one that has a Lime Tart Flavor is absolutely Fabulous.  Even better is that Amazon delivers three full one pound packages for less than the price this item normally retails for in Stores, IF you can even get it in your favorite store.

review/text: Blue Diamond almonds are by far my favorite for flavor and texture. My only minimal complaint about these is that they are very minimally spicy. I was afraid to go for Habenero in case they were TOO spicy, but given that these are much more mild than Jalepenos I will go for Habanero next order.

review/summary: only for lime lovers
review/text: I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.

review/text: I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel "mouth-satisfied" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value.

review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

At first I thought "When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too.

They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/text: The taste of these almonds are addictive.  They are spicy, but not too hot like you'd think a habanero would be.  It's been hard to stay out of them and I eat too many in a day.  The price from this seller is stellar and about the same price (per lb) that I find at walmart for a small can.<br />We will re-order soon as the almonds are almost gone  :-)

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

review/summary: First tried this tea in Hawaii
review/text: I first tasted this tea at a very expensive buffet in Hawaii.  I enjoyed it so much I asked the waiter about it and he gave me several bags to take with me.  I'm not too picky about my tea, as I feel even the cheap lipton stuff is fine for day to day hot or cold tea drinking, if used properly.  I've tried dozens of different types of tea as I've been drinking both hot and cold tea all my life.  This tea gives off a sweet smell and has a taste similar to some chinese "flower" teas.  The nearest I can come to describing the flavor is if you've had a Kerns Guava, imagine a much more mild (not as sweet) version of that flavor in a tea.  This is by far the best tea I've ever had.  If you enjoy flavored tea, if you appreciate the difference between Earl Grey and cheap Lipton tea then you'll enjoy this tea also.

review/summary: Like sweet tea? Try this out for something different.
review/text: This tea is very, very good. This specific brand and flavor is currently brewed in McDonald's on the island of Kauai, Hawaii as an iced tea (I would imagine other the islands as well but I cannot say that for sure).<br /><br />I was able to find this locally on the island during our last visit and brought a couple of boxes home. I use one bag at a time in a Keurig machine to make a great cup of iced tea. Add some sugar for additional sweetness; according to the box, sweetener brings out the passion fruit to new levels.<br /><br />I was already fan of the passion fruit tea found at our local Panda Express restaurants but this is a few notches better. If you like passion fruit flavored tea, definitely give this a try.

review/summary: Too many oranges!
review/text: I had been buying this candy from a machine (for a quarter at a time) and filling a ziplock bag to take home.  I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a "candy dish" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.  There does not seem to be any broken pieces.

review/text: I bought this thinking to give it a try, and maybe cut down on the diet snapple that I've been buying at costco.  I just made it today, and I really can't tell a difference!  There's no aftertaste that I can pick up, and it really does have the peach flavor, and no bitterness that tea sometimes has.  I used 4 teaspoons in a 16 oz snapple glass bottle (for that authentic feel, and also because it was handy), and it really tastes the same.  It looks a little darker, but that's fine.  I'm very happy with my purchase, given the money I'll be saving!

review/text: Lipton Instant Diet Peach Tea (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM8UGU">Lipton Instant Tea Mix, Diet Peach, 2.9-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>) is a taste treat.  Living in a place where peaches are grown and where there is an annual peach festival in our town, we have become discerning about the taste of peaches.  This peach tea has an authentic peach taste.<br /><br />Not only does it satisfy our desire for a peach taste when peaches are unavailable; it gives us a little kick.  We like the sweet taste without all the calories too.  We consider this tea a winner.<br /><br />Ingredients are maltodextrin, citric acid, instant tea, natural and artificial peach flavor, aspartame (sweetener). It disolves easily.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.

review/text: I regularly use instant tea.  I had never seen Lipton Tea as a Diet Instant Tea. I<br />trust the Lipton brand so, I bought this as a case.<br /><br />Lipton Instant Tea is more like tea than some of the other Peach Diet Instant teas<br />I have tried.  The flavor is more subtle, and it is not overly sweet. Of course you<br />can add more mix to enhance the flavor experience. All the others I have tried have<br />tiny pre-measured tubs, that make two-quarts each.<br /><br />This has become my brand of choice for instant diet tea.<br /><br />If you follow the suggested measure, each jar of instant tea is good for 40 servings.

review/text: I seriously hate how my local stores stop carrying one of my favorite items. This was one of them. Lipton's Diet Peach Tea is one of the best tastes I have ever had. I love ice tea, and sometimes the already mixed ones like Snapple can be a little bit more pricier. I mean it's not just a budget deal here, but the overall taste of it is just pure awesomeness. Their other flavors are just as well. However, this peach ice tea is just one of the best ever. Plus it's DIET! I'm so happy to have found this on Amazon. I was worried about the expiration date, however It's good until another year. I'll definitely purchase this again and highly recommend it.

This went above and beyond my expectations! I've tried other diet teas and they seem to all have a distinct "diet" taste. These teas are great, very good flavor, no diet aftertaste! I can't decide if I like the raspberry or peach flavor better, both are very good.

One thing I noticed though with the Diet Lipton, is when stirring / adding water, it froths up alot.  Not sure which ingredient in the drink mix makes it do this, but kinda makes me wonder what is really in there.  I haven't seen any of the other Lipton drink mixes do this, but this is still an excellent product.

review/text: First had Lipton peach tea out of a vending machine in Paris, France. Got home & they didnt sell it here. So I got the instant and it's great stuff; forget the raspberry since it tastes like medicine. However you can get it cheaper at the local grocery than through Amazon, and now they finally sell it already reconstituted in bottles here (USA) but the instant is a far better deal since you get 10 quarts out of a jar. I've paid from $3.59 to $2.99 for a jar.

Upon opening the box, we first noticed a large tag around the product that stated "Keep Refrigerated". The item was shipped unrefrigerated in a simple cardboard box. Upon opening the product package, it was covered in a yellowish slime with white mold spots on it.<br /><br />We contacted the merchant who refused a replacement or a refund stating simply "We do not offer refunds on grocery items" - and they closed our request. Fortunately Amazon's "A to Z" guarantee saved the day for us and Amazon is refunding. We will not do business with this vendor again. We will instead pay the slightly higher price at La Tienda as we had previously. So much for trying to save a few dollars using another vendor.

review/summary: Good Serrano Ham but no ham-stand included
review/text: The ham is good and it tastes not as salty as other serrano hams but if you don't want to spend much more money in a bellota ham it'll be fine, you'll like it.<br />The only issue or misunderstanding was because the other reviews, because according to them, it was supposed to come with a ham-stand and a knife and it didn't.

review/summary: good ham
review/text: I bought this for Christmas. It is a Spanish ham and more or less as advertised. It does not come with the hoof on as pictured but comes with a ham-stand and knife (jamonero)which was a very nice addition. Now this is a bit pricey if compared to what it would sell for in Spain (around 70$)--shipping and import etc. would obviously add quite a bit to the cost but this much... I don't think so.

review/summary: very yummy and very easy to make
review/text: I bought this at my local BJs with one of the weekly coupons. I am not an awesome baker on any level, but this was so easy to make and smelled amazing! The only downfall to me  was way too much cinnamon crumble. It was a little hard doing the 2nd layer but I'm sure that is a learned skill.<br /><br />The cake stayed soft the while week we had it for breakfast gently wrapped in plastic wrap. I don't think I would pay $20 for it, but it is certainly a good product :-)

review/summary: Love the Company!!  But not as good as the ones in Starbucks
review/text: I originally found these in starbucks,and they are sooo delicious! At $4 a pop, I decided to buy the bag to save a little cash.. however, it didnt really pan out as the bag for three was about $12, and they didnt taste as good as when I bought single.  I am still a lover of Two Moms, but will most likely go back to buying as a treat when I am in Starbucks.  oh well..

review/summary: These crawlers will put you at ease
review/text: When I first received this 5lb bag of candy from my friend for Christmas, I thought to myself how times have changed.  In the past I had always received a giant box of cherry sour ball candies.  When this bag showed up, I knew I had graduated to the next level.<br />Upon inspecting the bag I realized it did not contain a zipping closure, so this would become my responsibility.  Luckily for me an old bag of "Bare Fruit 100% Organic Bake-Dried Granny Smith Apple Chips" was safely in my file drawer.  I knew that it would come in handy one day.  After transferring the contents of this bag of "Large Bite Crawlers" from Trolli my first instinct was to share this with my co-workers.  This day in particular we had been pushing our manliness by eating raw habanero peppers to see which guy would cry first.  While these crawlers did not ease the pain in which we had inflicted upon ourselves, they did however bring a smile to our face.  In the end I realized these candies are what it's all about, colorful worms wrapped in sugar... little bit sweet, little bit sour.<br />TLDR<br />These crawlers are great, especially when you've had habanero pepper man contest prior.

review/summary: Love Them!
review/text: I didn't realize that "mini" crawlers meant the very small ones (maybe an inch or so big?), but I'm actually happier that they are! I thought these were the ones just a little bigger (about twice as big, in the regular packages in the stores)... but these are absolutely perfect. I love them, and they make a perfect reward treat for my potty training little boy, and for a fun reward for helping for my twin 4 year olds. The package is big, so make sure you have a ziploc bag (or two) handy to put them into to maintain freshness. As long as you re-seal the bag, these yummy tiny worms are delicious! We all love them in this house, adults included. I have now ordered my 4th bag from this same company.

The cookies are delicious and look great, and  Beautiful Sweets has a whole variety of themes for year-round occasions.<br />One very minor issue, I wish the product page had specific information about shipping times. It took Beautiful Sweets about a week to ship my order; there's nothing wrong with that, but it would just be nice to know, especially when you're used to Amazon shipping everything so quickly.<br />On the positive side, they emailed with tracking number as soon as the package shipped.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering more from Beautiful Sweets in the future. Sister In Law doesn't know it yet, but she's getting the Halloween special!

review/text: I love them! They're crunchy on the inside and smooth and creamy on the outside. They're basically biscuit (malt) balls covered in chocolate. We have a weak imitation over here (Whoppers), but Maltesers are much better, I think the chocolate is a better quality, or just smoother and creamier. Actually, I don't know if Whoppers or Maltesers came first, but I definitely prefer Maltersers.<br /><br />Get the 5 pack, in fact I once bought a 25 pack box and hid it from my wife. It lasted me one week and I had to see Dr. Johns, DDS soon after that.

review/summary: Not as good as I expected
review/text: This buckwheat is very flavorful while uncooked. However, it is dried/roasted in such way that if you cook it the standard way you will end up with mush. You have to follow the recipe on the bag (or some variation of it) in order to get the grainy consistency. To me, this method of cooking is more complicated than what I am used to and to a certain degree compromises the flavor. I am used to the kind of buckwheat that you can cook in a rice steamer and it does not turn to mush.<br />I know in non-organic world there are better products. Not sure if there is any organic buckwheat that is better than this.<br />I absolutely love the cracked buckwheat variety by this company -- that kind is usually cooked to be mushy and there the drying/roasting method used by this company puts it well above anything else I tried.
