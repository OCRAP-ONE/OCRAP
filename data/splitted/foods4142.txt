review/summary: Chinese Roasted Chestnuts
review/text: These Chinese chestnuts are perfectly cooked and very moist in one's mouth.  They make a perfect chestnut dressing for the Thanksgiving or Christmas turkey.  Having ordered them twice now, we can honestly say they are a very good and wholesome product. I look forward to purchasing more of these delectible chestnuts.  They make the cooking process less bothersome around the busy holidays.

review/text: Being French I grew up knowing how important it was to use a good unrefined salt. The one from Brittany being the very best. No! It's not foolish to spent money on a  basic spice. It has a very delicate flavor (almost floral) and you don't need a lot. Will taste great on salads. A clear healthy winner.

review/text: Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes, it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly, though, I think it seems "creamy". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.

review/text: I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.

I would get the fine salt next time. I wanted that but must have hit the course by accident. We still like it! You will too. Worth every dollar. And now im spoiled.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, "French gray" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.

review/text: In eating low-carb, one of the real challenges is texture. Meatballs without any breadcrumbs, crabcakes without any breadcrumbs...they're just too dense. LC Foods to the rescue! I had some leftover cooked salmon that was crying out to be made into fishcakes; I flaked it up, mixed it with an egg, some sauteed onion, and some of these breadcrumbs, and it was just SO good! Making the breadcrumbs is rather a pain: You have to make up the mix, bake it as a loaf, cut the loaf into slices, bake those, and then whiz them up in a processor. But to be honest, it took very little time, and the only real trick was to stop eating the baked slices -- which I was tasting, you know, for quality control -- before they got turned into crumbs. They are delish. All in all, this is a terrific product, and NO ONE will know it's low-carb.

These grits cook up quickly so I don't have to wait a half hour to have breakfast. By the time the bacon and eggs are cooked (about 5-7 minutes to get both done) I can also do a small bowl of grits. These grits cook up equally well when done on the stove or in the microwave. Make sure to stir occasionally to avoid lumps; add the water, a little butter and some salt and pepper and it comes out creamy and delicious. A really good texture and light flavor that works really well as a culinary foil to bacon and eggs.

review/summary: The Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/summary: The "green pearl" of tea.
review/text: Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the "green pearl" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself "home of silk and tea" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name "gunpowder" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.

review/summary: A delicious and beautifully presented tea
review/text: You've really got to hand it to the English when it comes to teas. They really know their stuff. They are great lovers of the drink and by some measures, consume more tea per capita than even the Japanese and Chinese. I received a box of Taylors of Harrogate Gunpowder from a friend at work and was very really impressed by just the box. Everything about the presentation of this product is top-notch-- from the tin design to the quality of the tea pellets. The outside is beautifully adorned with illustrations from the 19th Century.<br /><br />It is one of the best green teas I've ever had. Brewed, it is darker than other green teas, producing a golden/amber color. It has a very robust flavor and aroma. Tea should be drunk within 2-3 minutes of steeping (instructions are on the back), so don't make too much of it at once and leave it sitting in the pot. It will become bitter from the tannins. Hot or cold, this makes a wonderful beverage. No sugar and milk should be added though.<br /><br />I'm very glad to have discovered a new favorite. It makes a wonderful gift that reflects favorably on your good taste.

review/summary: Best Nuts on the market!
review/text: I love Brazil nuts. I think I am a connoisseur of a Brazil nuts. I like them fresh and crunch. Unfortunately, these nuts tend to be expensive so I shop around for the best price. I bought 3 packages of nuts from this company and 2 packages from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7LVM">Bergin Nut Company Brazil Nuts Whole Raw, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> to compare them. I tried NOW Foods Nuts first. They were delightful! They were fresh, crunchy and absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Then I opened Bergin nuts. There was no flavor to them. What a waste that was! I spent $21.98 for the nuts that are ROTTEN and SPOILED. There is NOTHING worse in the culinary world than chewing on a nut and realizing that it's spoiled. It takes 3 teeth brushing to get rid of that awful taste! Avoid even trying Bergin nuts!<br /><br />So, if you want good Brazil nuts, buy the product you are currently looking at:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CD2T4U">NOW Foods Brazil Nuts, Raw, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a><br />I've bought from them 5 times and each time nuts are fresh and tasty, just like they are supposed to be.<br /><br />Now, if only they didn't have so many calories... :)

review/summary: very fresh
review/text: I've been eating brazil nuts for 40 years, mostly for the healthy amount of selenium, but I never realized that all the shelled brazil nuts I'd been eating were old and that's why they were soft and didn't have any flavor.  Eating two a day for the selenium was a burden.  I should have noticed that the in-shell brazil nuts I usually eat around Thanksgiving were hard and crunchy and very good.  They are also a real hassle to crack open, messy, and dangerous to dig out of the shell.<br /><br />About a month ago I decided to try them again and bought a pound at Trader Joe's.  They were small, crisp, and delicious.  I was totally amazed.  I've eaten raw shelled brazil nuts from Trader Joe's and other nut stores but I had never eaten fresh ones.  I was just satisfied that they weren't obviously rancid.  I gobbled them up and went back to TJ's a week later but this time I got the regular big old tasteless ones, of course.  At least now I knew it was possible to find fresh brazils so I checked Amazon and sure enough these were well reviewed.<br /><br />These nuts are big and crunchy and hard.  Some are actually a little hard to bite, which amazes me in a good way.  You need two for your daily selenium.  Selenium can be toxic in supplement form but food minerals are safe in any amount, which is good because I probably eat 20 at a time.  Raw brazils have replaced raw cashews (supposedly not really raw unless hand-cracked and very expensive) and raw pistachios as my favorite nut.  I'm glad I know where to get my brazil nuts now and this story has a happy ending.

review/text: Brazil Nuts is the only way for me to get Selinium which is a rare essential mineral. The next close thing is kidney and liver  and that offers only 1/6 of Brazil Nuts with high cholesterol which needs to be prepared before consumption. Brazil Nut is very high in fat, 29% with 190 calories for only seven pieces. That is the same as one whole avocado. I consume these as super food, no more than four a day. Now Foods Brazil Nut is priced very reasonably but quality varies with packaging.

review/summary: Tasty, filling, healthy!
review/text: I don't like starchy, salty, and thick soups (too much starch actually makes me hungry). This particular variety (roasted chicken and vegetable) fits the bill. It is sparse on the noodle, with only 4 g of sugar per can (I have never eaten half a can of soup, so, all values are for the entire can). While still high, the sodium for the can is 920 mg: much less then in a "regular" soup.  The satisfying taste belies the 140 calories and only 2 g of fat! The liquid is light, but there is lots to chew on in the bowl: many chunks of meat and firm veggies make this a meal, rather then a snack. The ring on top of the can makes it easy to open. You can tuck a can in your purse and take it along to the office for a quick lunch. So far, so good.<br /><br />The only downside is the price. Even though I ordered the soup thru the Subscribe and Save programme, I paid for the dozen more then $6 over the price in the local mass retailer. It is not worth it, even with the covenience of free shipping. I will continue to buy the soup, just not on-line. Make sure to do your price research, but eaither way do give this variety a try. I'm sure you will not be dissapointed!

review/summary: Great natural product for indigestion & gastro problems
review/text: My wife has suffered with gastro-intestinal pain ever since we first met 16 yrs ago. Nnothing seemed to help except when she would drink some half and half to coat her stomach...that would seem to keep it at bay for a little while...I remembered a # of years ago I had a miniture schnauser whom had eated some chicken bones...he had blood in his stool and was acting sick...I couldn't get to a vet..it was a Sunday so I cut up some alo plants and scraped the juice into a saucer...I held the dog's head and poured the juice down his throat...In the morning, his symptoms were gone and ther was no longer any blood in his stool.....Since my wife had tried all kinds of over the counter remedies for her intestsinal ailment and none of them gave her relief, I told her that story..I have an alo plant...I did the same thing for her as I did for my pup..(except for holding her head and pouring it down her throat)....she did that on her own...beside the fact that it was dreadfully bitter, it gave her much needed releif...One day while shppping in a Big Lots I spotted some small 6-8oz bottles of a alo-pomagranite drink and thought I't get her some to try...They had about 15 bottles in stock @ $.75 per bottle so I bought all of them...The next episode of gastro-pain she had she took a few swallows and a short time later her pain subsided... and it didn't taste bad..in fact, it tasted good too!...Over a period of a few weeks she used it all up and Big Lots never had any more of the stuff...so I got on the internet and went to Amazon.com... There I found a number of companies that sold alo juice products...I now make sure my fridge is stocked...

This brand (which also comes in a tasty non-pomegranate aloe flavor) is so pleasant to drink that my daughter enjoys it!  I drink it whenever either my throat is raw or my stomach needs soothing.  On the downside, it's as sweet as a soft drink--but if one imbibes only as needed, it's worth the calories!

Well, were we surprised: THIS IS THE BEST PASTA I EVER ATE  AT HOME - chewy,  yet soft, thick but not too thick to clump up in your mouth in a ball of dough,  with just amount of give to make you want  more. It actually reminded me of the pasta my mother used to make, when she would lay the dough to dry on clean cloths  all over the house, and I couldn't sit anywhere.  I was sorry I had bought  so little, so when i found it again  -it seems that it's not always available - I purchased it at full price - expensive - because I truly think it's worth it.

review/text: As a kid I can remember my dad and grandfather grinding real 'home made'... 'fresh ground' horseradish and letting me smell it.  It would bring tears to my eyes.  Over the years I searched for such a product to use in coctail sauce, with prime rib, in a bloody mary and perhaps ... MAYBE JUST TO CLEAR MY SINUSES!  They all were weak sisters or creamy junk!  BUT.... Now after what could be a 30 year search I have found it. THIS IS THE REAL STUFF! I now order it and send it out as presents to all my Texas "we like it hot" friends.  Also, the flavor is great and uncompromised.  As a side note, most horseradish is weak as the root is picked/pulled to young, it takes 5 years or so to generate some heat as well as cure flavor.

review/summary: Hot and good
review/text: If you like really hot horseradish as I do this is the place to buy it.  I searched long and hard to find a really good horseradish and this is the only one I buy now.  It's inexpensive and definitely hot.  In fact when you take off the lid it makes your eyes water.  It's as good as any restaurant horseradish.  If you can't take the heat you can always tone it down with a little sour cream.  So your search is over if you want the best horseradish you can buy anywhere.  In fact I think I need to order some more today.  Don't order any more than the 2 pack at one time unless your going to be serving a big group of people.  Horseradish loses it's heat after you open it.  It's still good just not as hot as time goes by.  You can't do anything about that though even with fresh horseradish it loses it's heat after a while.<br /><br />I don't even remember paying shipping charges which is always a plus.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon.com your definitely  my favorite shopping place.

review/summary: Bring on the bite!
review/text: If you like your horseradish to have a powerful kick then this is the brand for you. Unbelievable punch with a great flavor. Lasts a couple months in the fridge after opening and although, like all horseradish, it loses some of it's kick after time, you won't mind. This brand is not for the weak. A little goes a long way.

review/summary: It's not atomic
review/text: I was disappointed. The product in my opinion and numerous friends and family that tasted it, found it far from atomic. Perhaps if it had been rated on a scale of 1-10 (1 being mild and 10 being hottest)it would help the consumer determine if they want to purchase this horseradish. My opinion and that of my tasters have given this horseradish a 4 in degree of heat.(not a 10 which would make it atomic) So as not to make it a total waste of money,I spent $1.88 and purchased horseradish root from the grocery store. I grated and added it to the product.It is now suitable for our taste. Unfortunately, the people that we bought our horseradish from in the past have retired. My quest for hot horseradish continues..................or maybe I should start my own brand???!!!

review/summary: What would compete with a 5 POUND BAG OF TASTY JOLLY RANCHERS?
review/text: Being a teenager stuck in middle school, candy is rare treat. Sometimes we sell chocolate bars to eachother in a fundraiser, sometimes we have to guess the amount of sour patch kids in a jar in math class. Most of the candy given out at my school are little hard chunks called Jolly Ranchers, and they are the best thing I've ever eaten. They are juicy and pretty much last the entire class period. They come in all sorts of delicious flavors (my favorite is cherry), and although a five pound bag is bit of an overkill, they aren't going to expire fast. Buy some for your class, coworkers, halloween party, etc.

The only problem I find is that you can buy these at Walmart for under $2 a bag....so they need to sell these for less. Also keep extras in the fridge cause they do get sticky when they melt in the summer heat.

review/summary: Pinnacle - Limited Ingredient
review/text: I received the recommendation as a more natural healthy alternative to the more commercialized brands of avoderm, royal canine , and others.That have either reduced the quality of there food over time or bought out by larger pet food companies and drastically change the formuls. I was very pleased to have changed considering my english bulldog started to get allegies from those other foods. Her allergies eased dramatically once i started her on the Pinnacle. I find the food to be substantially better in quality and ingredient structure and heriarchy of the elements contained within. i find it equally comparable to Halo and Lonovo. The only negative is that if your dog has yeast problems inside and out then this product delivers its fair share of sugars(Carbs) from the potatoes which help fuel the yeast. i used for several months and would recommend to other dogs without yeast problems. good luck but, trying many types and finding the one that works is the best strategy.

The leaf pieces are relatively small, but they make such a sweet, irresistably grassy tea with the Matcha mixed in, I would rank this alongside whole-leaf teas in taste. Definitely give it a try if you like Japanese green tea. It also requires very little leaf at a time, so it will last.

review/summary: TRICLOPYR is what you need for POISON IVY...
review/text: This contains Triclopyr, which is more aggressive than Glyphosate.  It is also more persistent which means that you don't want to spray it close to plants you value.<br /><br />Triclopyr is what you need to knock out Poison Ivy. Poison Ivy and a lot of other shrubs or trees can take a swig of Glyphosate (Round Up), gargle twice with it and spit it back into your face just for giggles.  I've used this and the Ortho Brush-B-Gon.  They contain the same active ingredient and I haven't observed any significant difference.<br /><br />This stuff is the real deal - I found it when I was trying to locate a product called Vine-X (discontinued?) and found out that it was 13.6% Triclopyr in a penetrating oil.  You simply brush it onto cuts or active vines and it would kill the entire plant.<br /><br />This is where it is really nice to buy the concentrate instead of the pre-mix.  I spray the diluted version but also use the concentrate in a small bottle.  If I cut a thicker vine or trunk, I simply drip the concentrate on it and it will kill the roots and vine.  Besides PI we also have wild grapevine, Buckthorn, Box Elder, and many other invasive and nuisance plans in the woods.<br /><br />Because Poison Ivy is a creeping vine with multiple roots along it's length, eradication is helped with a higher concentration than the label instructs. (My observation) I use it between 50% to 100% (double) strength.<br /><br />It appears that if you spray it in one spot you will kill that part of the vine, but if you hit it (in enough places) with something strong enough you can kill the whole plant down to the roots.<br /><br />Make sure you spray it when you think it won't rain for at least a couple of days or else you will probably need to spray it again. Make sure you get all "sprouts." From extensive hand pulling, My observation is that for every "sprout" there is another ~3 feet of vine lurking around and another sprout hiding somewhere nearby.<br /><br />If you've found this review helpful please let me know!

review/summary: Great for vines and small trees
review/text: Had vines that were taking over. They were creeping / had buried roots growing horizontally, which can complicate killing them. To get rid of them, I cut the upward=growing vines about half a foot above the ground. I did this so that if I had to apply the product again, I would have enough vine remaining to cut again. Sometimes if the vine (or root or base of tree or shrub) is really thick, it can take more than one application. (It's best to apply the product to a fresh cut.) In order to apply it twice or three times, you want to leave enough length so that you can make the cut again. This stuff is strong, so don't get me wrong. But, for really large diameters, leave yourself some extra in case you have to come back.<br /><br />I've used this on oak trees too. Just cut the sapling down to size and spritz the stub. If anything grows back, you can spray the leaves or make a fresh cut. Eventually when enough of the root is destroyed, it will not grow back.<br /><br />Great product. Would buy again.

review/text: Purchased the Bayer Brush Killer to get rid of several Bradford Pear trees that a previous owner has planted. I had cut the plants down to stumps but from the stumps and along the root lines of the tree kept coming back. It got to where I would cut back only to have more growth. I did some research and came across the Bayer Brush Killer, unable to find it at a local store I turned to Amazon. After cutting back the trees again so there was fresh cuts, I applied the product. I actually applied twice last year, this year the trees are dead and the stumps had even dried and rotted out to where I could pull them out of the ground with no problem. Again, great product!

review/summary: Too weak to be called a concentrate
review/text: The reviews for this product are confusing and not accurate.  Mr. Wu, says this is 13.6% Triclopyr which is incorrect since the manufacturer clearly says "Active Ingredients: Triclopyr, triethylamine salt: 0.8%".  Also the description calls this a  "concentrate" yet there is no information about how much working solution this so-called concentrate makes.  The description also says "convenient no mix formula" which implies it is used right out of the bottle so it can't be a concentrate.  Again Mr. Wu says he uses 50 to 100% stronger mix, but this can't be a description of this product since it is a no mix formula and any mixing would reduce the concentration, i.e., there is no way to make it stronger.  It appears that Mr. Wu has pasted his description of another product into the space for this one and that is not helpful.  So it appears that this is NOT a concentrate, but a ready to use solution that is less than 1%.  Very misleading.
