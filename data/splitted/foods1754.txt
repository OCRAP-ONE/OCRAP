review/summary: Best Tasting Coconut Water
review/text: I have tasted several coconut waters and like O.N.E. best because it does not taste like plastic or very salty like the others.  It's the closest in taste to a fresh young coconut just opened which I have had many times.  I drink it every day.  Nothing quenches my thirst as well during and after a workout!

review/summary: I'll Pass
review/text: I love coconut water.  Hands down my favorite drink.  I thought this would be a great idea because it's less expensive and more convenient than buying a young coconut and draining the water out.  It is both of these, but it does not have the same flavor as fresh coconut water.  I guess that's a no brainer.  I can't even bring myself to finish the drink.  It's gross.

review/summary: Closest tasting to fresh coconut water
review/text: Traveled extensively throughout south east asia and south america and had coconut water all the time. Back in the states, I used to buy coconuts from asian food stores and hack them open, but ONE is the closest I've found to the natural fresh coconut water taste (I've tried over 10 other brands) w/out the inconvenience of breaking out the cleaver. It is absolutely refreshing without the excessive sweetness of some brands like Amy and Brian or Taste Nirvana. There's also no sour aftertaste like w/ vitacoco (which adds ascorbic acid as a preservative). It's a bit odd that A&B and TN source their coconuts from Thailand and ONE from Brazil. ONE tastes much closer to the fresh stuff that I had in SE asia than any other brand I've tried. Superb overall.

review/text: So we purchased this because when we buy liters of coconut water in local grocery stores, O.N.E. has always had the best, most refreshing taste to us.<br />We figured we'd be getting the same product, just in a smaller quantity. Not the case. These smaller sized containers really just do not taste as good. We drank them, but didn't enjoy them. We will not buy this product again in this serving size. The liter size just tastes way fresher and sweeter. These, not so much.

review/summary: O.N.E. Coconut Water: The most natural, best tasting coconut water
review/text: O.N.E. is the best tasting, most natural coconut water product on the market, period.  I have tried all the competitors and they simply do not stack up.<br /><br />Zico, while the most price efficient, is garbage as they sacrifice quality of their formula by mass producing it from concentrate in an attempt to cut costs.<br /><br />Vita Coco, while better than Zico, seems to focus more on mass marketing and endorsing their product than on producing the most natural and delicious formula.  Vita Coco is much like the Patron of coconut water.  Similar to Patron, Vita Coco is a solid product marketed and endorsed heavily to the masses, but true connoisseurs of the drink know that it is not the best.<br /><br />O.N.E. coconut water is the best.  The company's focus is on their product, improving their product, and making sure that their drink is the most natural, most organic product on the market; not on cost efficiency or creating a false image through mass marketing.

review/text: We bought O.N.E., after getting a box of Vita-Coco.  They both taste about the same.  We like the taste and feel refreshed drinking it. We know what real coconut water tastes like, and this tastes close enough, since we can't get young coconuts easily (or cheaply) as we don't live in the tropics.  So, good purchase and will buy again.

I don't know why this is the case, but the packaging makes a big difference in the flavor of their water.  I suggest if you already like this water, do a taste test side by side.

Wife still thinks it not ideal compared to what we have had in Hawaii and in the Carribean, but I think its fairly decent. It comes with straws too which the Costco's ones dont.  However, price point vs flavor, I think its a wash.  ONE was more expensive and not sure if I would buy it at the normal retail price on Amazon versus the VitaCoco at Costco.

review/text: ONE Coconut Water in the 12 pack is a great value, especially if you are doing the subscription plan at $17.59.  Each 11.2 oz container is sells for around $2 in stores, so this is definitely a good value. The taste is neutral, there is no "natural flavor" added like Zico.  There is also a straw included in the container, so it's easy to drink like a Boxed drink.  Most of the Other Coconut Water packaging does not include this straw.<br /><br />Please note that ONE Coconut Water is Product of the Philippines, as clearly labeled on the 12pak box when you order it.  However, nowhere in ONE Coconut's marketing is the Philippines mentioned.  They appear to imply that product is from Brazil, when it is in fact from the Philippines.  Overall, a good product.

Potassium is also another huge factor, don't get me wrong I love eating banana's but after eating 2-3 a week it gets a bit bland.<br /><br />The best way I've found to drink O.N.E. Coconut Water is to drink it ice cold. You will not get the maximum enjoyment or flavor out of your drink if you decide to drink it at room temperature.<br /><br />I subscribed and continue to get a shipment once every month, and will continue to do so until I can find a better substitute.

review/summary: try this drink!
review/text: I recently tore up my knee, they suspect ligament damage and possible cartilage injury but wont know till after the MRI in a few days.  Being in a thigh to foot brace, and walking on crutches (especially now that we're getting into the summer months) has me totally dehydrated.  I dont drink sodas for hydration, sports drinks are OK-but get boring, and water is great but not 100% of the time.  So recently I decided to give ONE coconut water a try and I thank God that I did.  It is totally refreshing, completely rehydrating, and the subtle coconut flavor is delicious.  Please believe, this is not coconut milk.  It is not thick or heavy.  It is light and refreshing.  I buy it at a local grocery only store and it is $2.50 per 11 oz box.  A little on the pricey side but well worth it.  Ive been drinking 2-4 per day and lovin it like Mcdonalds.  Its healthy, it tastes great, and does everything that it says and more.  I definitely give this drink my seal of approval.  There are a lot of other brands out there, but Ill never try them because this is just too good to go elsewhere.  If you get bored by gatorade and sometimes need something a couple steps away from water, then its a must that you try this drink!!!

review/text: I used to buy this product from a health food store and it was good. The store is a long drive away so I ordered it from amazon. The first package was good and once I finished it I ordered another. The second batch was awful. Tasted very off and I couldn't drink more than a few sips. I sent a complaint and they sent me another package free of charge. However, this package was just as bad and I had to dispose of it too. What a waste of money! I know it was before the expiration date so I'm not sure why the taste was so off. I'll make the long drive to the health food store from now on.

I would refrigerate the product upon purchase.  Buy this product with as far an expiration date as possible.  This is what I use to hydrate myself at the gym, instead of water or gatorade.  Overall, I mon rate it.  Yard mon out.

review/summary: The Closest Thing to Fresh Young Coconut Juice But In A Box!
review/text: My family has been adopting a raw foods diet for the last year, and one of the things we have been able to enjoy is eating young green coconuts.<br /><br />A young green coconut looks like a woody white cylinder with a point on the top of it.  In order to open it, you take a heavy cleaver type knife and you strike it in four sides around the point of the coconut.<br /><br />You then take off the top and inside you get anywhere from 1/4 to a full cup of coconut water- a clear sweet nectar with subtle coconut flavor.<br /><br />Drinking this type of juice is a delightful experience, however, it does take some work to get at and is not always convenient- until now.<br /><br />When I first saw the 11 oz aseptic container of O.N.E coconut water, I was not sure what to expect.  I know that I expected it to be flat tasting and probably nothing like I was used to from having fresh green coconut water.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />This coconut water might not be fresh and raw, but it is the closest thing to it that I have come across so far.<br /><br />The foil wrapped box has about a 5/8" opening (slanted square) that is covered with foil.  You peel that off and it forms a slight spout for easy pouring.<br /><br />It is best served cold, so I kept in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The water/juice inside is a slightly cloudy clear liquid which has the delightful taste of young green coconuts.  There is a refreshing coconut flavor that is not at all overwhelming, but just right.<br /><br />It has no added flavors or sugars to it, which is delightful.  It has only 60 calories which is also a nice feature.<br /><br />I have compared it to fresh coconut water, and although I do prefer raw fresh water, I am very happy with this as a substitute.<br /><br />I can say this, my family all fought to taste this stuff- so it made a big hit here.<br /><br />If you are into raw foods and need to have a beverage which is close to what you are used to and is not cooked to death and sweetened in a package to take on a picnic, trip, or even to work, this is definitely a great item to have handy.<br /><br />You might like it even if you are not into raw foods, but like the fragile coconut flavor in coconut water- you should give this a try.<br /><br />I do want to mention that this is NOT the kind of water that comes out of very dark brown dried coconuts- that tastes very different than young green coconuts.

review/summary: The best coconut package out there
review/text: I have tried just about every coconut water company out there (Zico, Harvest Bay, Vita Coco, etc.) and this by far is the best and the closest to the coconut water out of fresh young coconut. Nothing will be beat drinking it right out of fresh coconut but O.N.E comes the closes.<br /><br />The coconut water is supposed to taste like fresh refreshing, slight sweet water with just a hint of coconut flavor. If you taste strong flavor of coconut, it is probably over ripe or aged. This container also doesn't have any package smell as some of the other coconut water packages have.<br /><br />Just remember to buy them fresh and chill them before you drink. The flavor is much better when chilled. Highly recommend buying this over the other brands.

review/summary: not bad stuff, but I have serious questions
review/text: Coconut water is the liquid inside an unopened coconut. It is not "coconut milk," although there is often confusion about that. Coconut milk is made from the meat of the coconut after it is opened and the water poured out. Inside the coconut, the water is sterile and very benign to the human body - it has been safely used in emergencies as IV fluid! (Straight out of the coconut, that is, NOT from a Tetrapak.)<br /><br />Coconuts in general are very healthy items. In the South Pacific the coconut palm is called "the tree of Life," because it provides so many things for a healthy life: food, water, shelter, medicine, etc. Coconut oil is one of the healthiest oils on the planet, but has been the victim of intense propaganda campaigns by corporate vegetable oil cartels and other evil critters.<br /><br />Coconut water tastes (to me) a bit like very watery, unsweetened tapioca, with just a hint of sourness. It is quite bland by itself, but mixes easily with fruit juices, etc. It has great health properties and is rapidly becoming popular with athletes as a superb isotonic drink, because it has great electrolyte and mineral properties, and is a natural food with no harmful side effects or hideous chemical garbage masquerading as food.<br /><br />Good organic coconut water is very hard to find, but there are many brands of non-organic like this one on the market. I checked out the package info and vendor's web site, but could find only general information on coconut water and its benefits, nothing specific about this exact product - where and how it is grown and harvested, the quality of the land and processing, etc. That is not a good sign.<br /><br />For an item that is very health oriented, the only reasons I can see for hiding that information are pure marketing ignorance, or knowing that the truth would not paint a good picture. Rain forests are reportedly being cut down for coconut palm plantations, especially those dedicated to unhealthy corporate factory farming practices. It would be vital for a company to distance themselves from that kind of activity by using only properly grown plants on healthy, environmentally sound plantations, and making that a very prominent part of their marketing.<br /><br />It would also be vital to play up everything possible that points to a healthy product by specifically mentioning those things about this specific product, not just general properties. This company doesn't do any of that, so I can only assume that this product is not produced in a way they want me to know about. That is the kiss of death for a product in my eyes. Granted, I am fussier than most in this regard.<br /><br />Don't be misled by the "100% Natural" marketing hype. That means virtually nothing. It is not a strict, legally defined standard, as is "USDA Organic," for example. Virtually anything found in "nature," i.e. toxic heavy metals, MSG (yes, it occurs in nature), animal manure, etc., can be considered "natural" and can legally be included in a product labeled "100% Natural." Granted, USDA organic standards are very weak as organic standards go (compared to say, Oregon Tilth), but they are still better than nothing.<br /><br />While I love coconut and want to give this product 4 or 5 stars, the complete lack of honest information about its origins and processing make me VERY, VERY suspicious. Without more information about how safe/healthy the product actually is, I can only give it 3 stars and a serious "caveat emptor." It is probably much better than any ordinary "sports drinks," but there are too many unanswered questions to be sure. One's health is not something to be treated lightly.<br /><br />UPDATE July 2009:<br /><br />After continued searching, I still have not been able to locate a consistent source of organic or Fair Trade coconut water. While the manufacturer of this coconut water still does not give out any real information about the growing, harvesting, or other relevant details of production, neither do any of their competitors.<br /><br />So far, this is still the best coconut water I have been able to find, and I continue to drink it, even with the questions I have.

review/summary: O.N.E vs. Vita vs. Zico coconut water
review/text: Each of these three products has a number of reviews.  I don't have much to add to any of the individual reviews.  Coconut water is great, if you are in the market for a case of it you already know this.  But which of these three is the best?<br /><br />I went around town and found 5 boxes of each of the three brands (15 total) each, with no two boxes of a the same brand coming from the same supplier.  The goal was to get a wide range of product batches.  This I am happy to report was pointless.  All three brands produce an internally consistent product.<br /><br />I then ordered a 12 pack of all three brands from Amazon.  The only significant difference in packaging is that O.N.E. glues a little telescoping straw to each individual box, the other two brands do not.  If you are a straw person this is a feature if not this is just more trash, you decide.  The amount per container varies slightly by brand but given the price fluctuation on Amazon I don't consider the 0.1 Oz  differences an important factor.<br /><br />All three are made in Brazil, O.N.E. mentions that it is pasteurized the other two do not (nevertheless, I suspect all three are).<br /><br />On pure taste, at refrigerator temperature, I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CN7BMA">Zico</a> to be the best (say 5/5), but only nominally better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC">O.N.E.</a> (4.5/5), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I">Vita</a> was a distant third (3/5).  Both Zico and O.N.E. taste almost exactly like drinking right from a fresh green coconut.  Vita, on the other hand, has a grape aftertaste which I did not like.  At room temperature the order remained the same; however, the differences in taste became more obvious: Zico (5/5), O.N.E. (4/5), Vita (2/5).  Obviously all of this is subjective.<br /><br />I observed the price of three on Amazon over the course of a month.  Zico (~$24) was consistently more expensive than the other two (~$18-21) which traded places as the least expensive.<br /><br />Considering the price and quality, O.N.E. is my choice and the brand to which I now subscribe.  I consider Zico an excellent, but over priced, product and Vita an inferior product.  If, however, I preferred my coconut water at room temperature I would give strong consideration to paying the extra money for Zico.  If I used my coconut water as a mixer I would buy which ever one is cheapest at the time.<br /><br />All three products are better than nothing (the previous option) and I am happy to see them on the market.

review/summary: Best out of 4 Coconut waters I've tried
review/text: My mom recommended to me ONE coconut water, and it's great.  Great tasting, full of electrolytes, and relatively healthy.<br /><br />When my Whole Foods ran out of stock, I thought I'd try the alternatives, including Zico and Vita something.  Surprisingly, both weren't that great although I think in one case it may have to do with them trying to mix other juices in (i.e. not pure coconut water).  Another brand I tried was worse.  That's pretty sad because other than good OJ or apple juice, nothing beats coconut water and more people ought to know about it.  No matter what brand you try, I wouldn't recommend non-pure coconut water like mango or other juices mixed in because it takes away from it.<br /><br />I've had coconut water straight from coconuts, and this is as good as I've had.  So it was a pleasant surprise when years back they started selling this stuff.  In many cultures, Coconuts are a daily staple and the source of a wide range of critical nutrients.  It's something people can eat and drink literally every day.<br /><br />The drink is good like Gatorade after a long excercize.  I hate Vitamin water and all the other sports drinks, and somewhat tolerate Gatorade.  I'm surprised they don't just imitate coconut water.<br /><br />Anyways, highly recommended.

review/summary: The real stuff.
review/text: Like a few of the people who wrote a review I was born and raised on a carribbean island... Barbabdos to be exact. When I came here I tried to find coconut water that actually,.. was coconut water and guess what , One coconut water is exactly that.<br />It taste like the young fresh coconut water that it clams to be from ... loook at the ingrediants no additives just coconut water. There is a difference between young coconuts and more aged coconuts. The older ones are much sweeter :) but the young ones are more refreshing and much healthier.<br />So if you dont know what you talking about..its not right to leave a negative review, because to really know the difference between coconuts you actually would have to taste the orginal product cut fresh and drink it out the nut.<br />One... Thanks.. I always crave coconut water during pregancy because there is nothing better than young cocnut water to keep a mother and her baby healthy and you have given me something wonderfull.

review/summary: Coconut Water from Brazil is Great but from the Phillipines  Horrible
review/text: Let me say I have been drinking ONE coconut water since it first came to market and I loved it. I noticed my last shipment had a funny taste.  I checked the shipping carton and found that ONE has started getting its coconut water from the Phillipines.  Big mistake.  It's awful. The only way you'd know this is if you buy it by the case.  ONE doesn't identify the source country on individual Tetra Paks. Anyone who started with ONE in the beginning knows they used only Brazilian coconuts as their source.  The original stuff was crisp, clean and totally refreshing.  This new source is murky and not satisfying at all.  Time to look into other brands.  I'm so disappointed.

review/summary: Beware of Rancid boxes; Foul, Sour Taste- Smells like vomit sometimes, tastes funky
review/text: I did love the ONE coconut water but my last two shipments (case each)had numerous ones that smelled funky and were very foul tasting. As soon as you tear off the tab, you can smell it has gone rancid. Not sure if it is how long Amazon holds it in their stockhouse, if they even do that, or if it spoiled due to extreme temperatures but I have had to throw out an average of 3 containers from each case. Not sure the word Aseptic is factual when it is so rancid at times. But when they are fresh, it is good with a light taste. Not overpowering.

review/summary: Delicious and Refreshing.  Product was recalled for mold, but my 12pack was great.
review/text: great product, kind of expensive, especially when not on sale for 10$ or under for a twelvepack, which it does drop to on amazon quite often with Subscribe and Save.  I read lots of reviews of O.N.E. and VitaCoco, the two major brands I focused on because they seemed to have the most sales/least negative reviews out of the three best selling brands.  Frankly, Vita and ONE are really fairly close in taste, with O.N.E. tasting more natural, less of an aftertaste, and I think that's probably because Vita jams 240% of Vitamin C into each tetrapack.  That does alter the taste, making it slightly more acidic and to my tongue at least, not as fresh/tasty as O.N.E.  I haven't tried Zico yet, and based on some all over the place reviews, I'm probably not going to.  VitaCoco seems to have the same comments here and at a lot of other websites too, as in same wording, so I sort of doubt the veracity of half of Vita's reviews tbh, but regardless it's a great product too and I'd have no problem buying it again for the right price if this wasn't available or was at full price.  This was the first time I'd tried coconut water, and I was really surprised to find I liked it.  I was half expecting it to taste coconut-like, which it does not, which is good for me.  Closest thing I could think of to describe it would be if you can imagine drinking flavorless Gatorade, that's close.  Very refreshing/revitalizing, some slight natural sugar in it of course (none added), and really kinda tasteless.  The metallic taste people talk of I wonder if that might be because its just got so many electrolytes in it it sorta gives that tingle, not sure.  I did sorta notice it too, but it's hardly noticeable and not offensive.<br /><br />There was a product recall on this.  Amazon sent me an email saying it may have been mold contaminated and had been recalled.  I'd already guzzled the 12 pack a month before, and had drank down a case of Vita Coco too, so wasn't much for me to do.  I did find the box and checked UPC/exp date and it was not in fact affected by the recall, so in my single recall experience, Amazon erred on the side of caution, sending notices to people who weren't affected, as well as those who were, presumably.  That's good.  That's pretty encouraging.  If you check the recall notice it says that it was several reports of moldy product/damaged packaging that occurred in one region of the US and that a report of the factory found nothing, so probably occurred in shipping/distribution, not when packaged, but whatever.<br /><br />Amazon, drop this crap down to $8.97 a twelve pack or slt so I can stock up.  I am glad for the free shipping.  Without that, buying online for this wouldn't be practical.

review/summary: O.N.E. Coconut Water 11.2 oz 100% coconut water.
review/text: The product was packed well by Amazon.com, and I received it fast. My order of this product arrived in excellent condition - no issues.<br /><br />I tried this product - O.N.E. Coconut Water 11.2 oz - before, and never had a problem with it.  The first time buying this was at a store called, "Always 99."  At the "Always 99," I purchased 198 of the 11.2 oz containers of this product at a price of 3 for 99 cents.  What a deal!!! Worth trying out at that price.  Before that time, I never tried coconut water before because too expensive for me.  Although the products I purchased at "Always 99" were 6 months past expired, the taste was always very good with no variation in taste.<br /><br />The O.N.E. 100% Coconut Water I purchased through Amazon.com was just as good - very pleasing.  Of course no one anywhere on the internet sells this product at 3 for 99 cents - even at past expiration dates.  And the "Always 99" store received thousands of containers of this product as a one time thing; so, I will likely never see that super deal again.<br /><br />I guess each of us has to decide for ourselves whether this, or any, coconut water is worth buying at present prices.  But O.N.E 100% Coconut Water 11.2 oz is a reliable high quality product in my experienced opinion. I mean, if this product is still just as good even 6 months after expiration date, then it has to be good bought before expiration.<br /><br />I add a sprinkle of Stevia Extract to each cup of coconut water for sweetness.

I did like Zico best until they were bought out and changed their formula, now, this one is my go-to.  I'm a soda person and I really dislike water, so finding something that not only can quench my thirst in a healthy, natural way has been a real plus for me.  I have also been able to use it to stave off those mid-morning hunger pangs instead of turning to chips or other less-than-healthy alternatives.  It did take me a few containers to get used to the taste since it was so different than what I was used to, and ice-cold makes it taste much better, but I now find myself craving it when I'm thirsty.  Low calorie, hydrating, loads of potassium--it's a winner all the way around for me!

review/summary: O.N.E coconut water
review/text: I have been drinking coconut water from fresh coconuts since I was little (lived in Malaysia) really like the taste of this over vita coco.  It doesn't have the sour after taste like it's been sitting around too long.  Overall excellent if you live in a  place with no convinient access to fresh coconut water.

review/summary: Great Coconut Water
review/text: I purchase coconut water from Amazon for several reasons.  I really like this brand and it is not available in the small town I live.  And the price is much better than Whole Foods.  Love this product and would recommend it to anyone.  And the great thing about Amazon is you can  purchase two cases and get free shipping.  It tastes even better than from a fresh coconut.

review/text: Got my hubby started drinking ONE as an alternate to Gatorade since he has to watch salt intake.  He loves the coconut water and swears it keeps him feeling more alert, especially in our 114 degree heat.  Got my 89 yr old Mom to try it for her nightly leg cramps - after drinking one a night for three nights her cramps have stopped and her constipation eased up.  Great product for the elderly who don't drink enough water.  Thanks to Amazon's subscription plan - don't even have to go to the store and it's cheaper.  Tried several brands and ONE is the best!

review/text: At first the taste surprised me, but comparing it with the Vita coconut water, there was no comparison. That looked clearer, and has no immediate taste, but the aftertaste turned me way off. The O.N.E. coconut water is a little cloudy, and has a taste right up front, but it's consistent and after just a few glasses I came to love it. Now I totally crave this stuff and feel really refreshed after drinking it. Our 14-month-old loves it too, straight up in a sippy cup.

review/text: It does bring up fond memories of my life in the bahamas. Nutritionally speaking, it is high in potassium, so it could be used as a sport drink. Also it only has 60 calories, no fat, and is 11 ounces. This beverage is best enjoyed very cold, or over ice. Yes, it does taste like coconut water. If you like coconut water, you would enjoy it. I like coconut, but not particularly fond of the clear "water". But it does taste quite refreshing on a hot day.

review/summary: Hangover Helper
review/text: I hate to admit it, but one day I drank too many cocktails.  A margarita, followed in quick succession by two cucumber-basil martinis (delicious, by the way) at my fave local Mexican restaurant.  It was a celebration, and I was celebrating.  I was messed up, and I do not say that lightly.  I managed to get home, embarrassed and feeling godawful.  I remembered having read somewhere that coconut water is good for a hangover, so I had two O.N.E. coconut waters.  Within a couple of hours I felt perfectly fine.  I sure hadn't expected that!  Next day I felt as though nothing had happened.  That's my coconut water "miracle."<br /><br />You don't have to be drunk for it to make you feel better, though.  If you're feeling a little dehydrated, this will help.<br /><br />I love the taste, too, although it took two or three times of drinking it before I could say that.  The first couple of bottles, I didn't care much for it.  Not that I actively disliked it; it just wasn't anything like what I would have expected, having only ever had sweetened coconut products previously.  And I liked how drinking it made me feel so... healthy.  Now I can't stand the thought of not having it around.  Once you start drinking it and liking it, sometimes you just feel like your body NEEDS it.<br /><br />Be sure to chill it before consuming.

review/summary: Not bad and very very good for you
review/text: The first brand of coconut water that I tried was Vitacoco. You can see my review on that page, as the Vitacoco tasted like toilet water. This brand O.N.E. is much much better. Like the difference between night and day. O.N.E. is a little more expensive than the other brand noted here, but it is worth it if you plan on drinking straight from the container. The taste is a little bit bitter, after all, it is the juice from an unripe coconut. But it is tolerable, tho it may take many awhile to get accustomed to. When I bought the Vitacoco brand, I learned to mix it with Gatorade to make it tolerable. If you are new to this product, you may want to do the same with O.N.E. at first, until you acquire a taste for it.<br /><br />I, in fact, changed my review from four stars to five stars, as I have tried a few other brands, and this one is still the best. I have gotten more acquired to the taste and drink it straight half of the time.

review/summary: Great Product for Sensitive Stomachs of the Elderly
review/text: I became interested in a soothing drink for my elderly mother, who has a sensitive stomach with recurring nausea. Many times she's unable to drink anything other than a weak tea or water. The coconut water has made it possibly for her to keep things down and relieve the nauseous feeling. I now make sure that she has coconut water available to her any day of the week or month. This is certainly a drink that restores her energy when she has experienced a few days of not wanting to eat. I highly recommend this product if you, friends, or family experience symptoms as my Mother does.

I rated it a 4, instead of a 5, because it is a little weak on the coconut taste.  On the other hand, I can drink it without adding a lot of calories and its natural taste makes it ideal for me. It definitely reminds me of the islands.

While I fell far short of the 3500 needed to reach the plateau of temples, I also barely managed to return to the base.<br /><br />Blame it on my Anglo-European genes, sheesh.<br /><br />Back at our vehicle, a vendor hacked off the top of the green globe before offering it too me.  Though the water within was warm, it was more refreshing and cooling than anything else I could have imagined at that moment.<br /><br />The inherent cooling properties of coconut water make it an ideal way to stave off the heat from both the inside out.<br /><br />O.N.E.'s coconut water, though not as 'mentally' satisfying to drink (everyone loves the green globe) certainly is as tasty and refreshing.

One caveat: If you drink too much coconut water, you may experience the opposite effect ... ridiculous diarrhea. It takes a lot, but I like the taste and, well, overdid it (about 1/2 gallon in a day).  Watch out!

review/summary: One of the best-tasting coconut water drinks on the market
review/text: I buy coconut water quite often, particularly in summer. It's a great isotonic drink for hot days, hiking trips and while doing cardio. I have probably every brand available on the market, icnluding several ones only sold in Europe, and I can honestly say that I think O.N.E. is the one that tastes the best among the brands sold in the US. It doesn't contain additives, sugar or anything else, just coconut water. Now, if you want something that tastes a bit fruitier there are other brands that add fruit juice to theirs and it does make it taste better but also adds carbs, which means the drink doesn't work as well to use during cardio, particularly if you are trying to lose weight.<br /><br />I also appreciate that they chose to sell their product in cartons instead of cans, especially in light of the new research about metals leaching in our food and drink.

review/summary: Delicious -- but definitely unexpected!
review/text: If you're expecting something sweet, and almost syrupy like a slightly watered down version of coconut milk -- you're in for a shock.  This has a much lighter taste, just a hint of coconut rather than an overwhelming flavor, but I really enjoyed it.  It's satisfying but not really all that sweet.  It's especially good when it's icy, icy cold -- a real unexpected taste on a summer day.

review/summary: Refreshing coconut water
review/text: This coconut drink is not bad compared to other drinks. This drink tastes best when really cold. No straw. It is not like juice boxes where you puncture the straw through the foil. Although I would have preferred that it came that way. It would prevent spills for the kids. But then again this is not marketed for kids. It is really easy to open. Pull a foil and you are ready to sip. The mouth is not that big nor to small. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys coconuts.

review/summary: A Little Expensive, But a Good Alternative to Soda
review/text: This is a good tasting, relatively low calorie alternative to soda that is good for you.  It's not overly sweet.  The flavor is a light coconut.  At 60 calories for an 11 ounce serving, it seems like a good way to hydrate and get a little energy as well.  My only complaint is that $2 per serving seems a little high.

review/summary: A convenient source of Potassium
review/text: I'd recommend this product for someone who needs potassium but can't or won't eat bananas. Potassium is important for your heart and if you are nauseous. It would be very effective for athletes or people in danger of dehydration. It's a natural, raw food containing 5 electrolyes, which are important for your heart to function properly. Your electrolyte balance can be upset by dehydration, over-exertion or illness, and any athlete can tell you that that's dangerous. This would be a great drink to have on hand if you could only have fluids or couldn't keep solid food down. I think of it more as a supplement than a beverage because there isn't much taste to it, but it would be handy to keep in your locker at the gym or in your bag. It's much healthier than a sport drink containing artificial colors and flavors.<br /><br />You'd expect it to taste like coconuts, but it really doesn't. There might be a faint suggestion of coconut flavor, but I'm not sure you'd notice it if you didn't know what you were drinking. Otherwise, it's like drinking water. Not bad, not really good, just there. I can see myself picking up one of these to eat with a meal just for the potassium boost, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I had the flu, was playing sports, working out or was working hard - like mowing lawns, gardening, doing construction - in hot weather . Then I'd want to have these in the fridge (they taste best ice cold,) because they would definitely be better than just drinking water.  I'd use it as a sort of adult Pedialyte or a natural Gatorade. I'll probably keep some around this summer for that very reason.

review/summary: Almost
review/text: Having drank from a coconut just off a tree, I can tell you that this product is pretty close.  Lightly sweet with the taste of coconut, this is a refreshing drink.  This is a good substitute for any of the sports aid.  Having electrolytes and tons of potassium, it is the perfect natural way for a nice boost.  The manufacturer also does a good job by not adding any preservatives or artificial flavoring.  Coconut water is terrific all by itself, it doesn't need any help.  Great product.

review/summary: O.N.E. is the ONE
review/text: A friend of mine recently turned me onto O.N.E. Coconut Water as a refreshing post-exercise drink. The taste is sweet but subtle, but what really wowed me was reading the ingredient label. Coconut water naturally has 650 mg of potassium (15x more than a banana), 25mg of magnesium, and 35 mg of sodium! All of this in a 10 oz, 60 calorie package. It's like nature's gatorade!<br /><br />I LOVE ONE COCONUT WATER!!!

review/summary: Acquired taste?
review/text: I'm sorry but my wife and I found this product to be completely unpalatable.  I have tasted fresh coconut meat and canned coconut milk, but this is something totally different.  I suspect that it is an acquired taste. Before you buy a large quantity, be sure and know what it tastes like.

review/summary: ***Warning Mold infection ****
review/text: I brought this from Amazon.com last month. I got an email from Amazon about possible infection detected inside the package. DO put the drink in glass instead of drinking from package to be sure.
