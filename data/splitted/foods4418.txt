review/summary: Classic sweetener & excellent value
review/text: Whether you use Sweet n Low at home and just want to buy in bulk to save money, or you're buying for the break room at your office, this is a great value on a classic sweetener. If you're not going to go through it quickly, store it in a dry place, and/or seal it in plastic canisters. Even if it turns solid in the packet, it's still just as usable-- just break it apart and dissolve it in your coffee or tea. Aspartame (Nutra Sweet) gives me headaches, and I love being able to keep this product and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ">Splenda</a> on hand as affordable alternatives.

review/summary: Sweet N Low
review/text: I have used this sweetener for many years. I even carry it with me as you cannot find it in all restaurants and I do not like the others and have to revert to sugar if they don't have it and I forget mine. It has become increasingly harder and harder to find in the 1500 value pack. It is still available at my local warehouse/club for the cost of $11.48 (as of  1/16/2011) . I have never tried to use it in baking (I am not real handy in the kitchen), But I do use it in my coffee and tea. Since I drink a pot of coffee a day, I really need to buy the value pack and at a decent price.

I've been using these lasagna noodles for over 10 years and everyone loves them.  Most of the people I cook for are not on a gluten-free diet, but they eat these as enthusiastically as I do.  These noodles work well whether I boil them the day I'm making the lasagna (when I have failed to plan ahead), or put the lasagna together the day before, wrap it tightly, and put it in the refrigerator to let the noodles soften overnight (my preferred method).  Great stuff.

review/text: I was pleased with the quality and freshness of these currants.  They were moist and well packaged.  I found the plastic container easy to deal with and great for storing any leftovers.  My only problem is that I wish I ordered 2 lots before they sold out.  These are perfect for my Traditional English Fruitcake, Dundee Cake and Christmas Puddings.<br />I was extremely pleased with the price.  They are an excellent value for money compared to the price I pay for 1 box at the grocery store.  I plan to keep these as a staple.  I hope to purchase them on subscribe and save in future.<br />Finally, I noticed that another reviewer called these Zante raisins.  I have never seen a recipe call for Zante raisins.  They are always called currants.  Rather, they are dried Zante grapes.  If you are looking for Blackcurrants, these are usually canned or frozen to preserve freshness.  Try a British foods store to find a can/jar of Blackcurrants.

review/text: It seemed like a good idea. Buy in bulk and save some cash, but as it were being shipped it must have warmed up and cooled down. Many of them were stuck together, and colors rubbed off on each other. There was a 2lb mass of beans in the box! Also, beware and don't freak out because the package consists of a cardboard box and jelly beans. No plastic inside the box, no paper lining, nothing. Kind of creepy, but I'm not dead yet, so it must be okay.

Was concerned following the other review about beans sticking together, but decided it'd be worth it to have 10 flavors.  Box arrived and they were stuck together, but only 5 flavors.  A waste of my time.  Never would have ordered if product had been described correctly by the seller.  Just drive to the store and get the 5 flavor mix that's not already stuck together.

review/summary: Buy this if you have NO taste buds!
review/text: "Blends smooth and creamy for a sweet tasting protein"  is in the item description. I don't know who wrote this but they must not have ever smelled or tasted this stuff! Based on the description, I purchased a few of these bags. They come vacuum sealed. The color of the powder is a light olive green. The taste is a combination of powdered sawdust, wheatgrass and every dark green health food store drink you've ever had. The only reason it gave it a star at all is well, there's no choice for zero, and it probably does have decent nutritional properties. But while forcing myself to drink this stuff, I got flashbacks from 3 years old when I was forced to eat spinach. The good news is Amazon refunded the cost of the purchase even though it's a "non-refundable" product. You have to call them to do it. They didn't even want me to send back the unopened bags! But I really want to return them. It seems a shame to have to throw them away.

As a regular at the gym I have a curiosity about any food that promises lots of protein. This wasn't for me - or my wife - but, hey, it's food, and that's very subjective. Someone else (or his goat) might love this stuff. It smells like rope (it is a hemp product, after all) and doesn't dissolve well in milk, leaving a nasty, gritty mud at the bottom of the glass that sticks to the teeth.

review/summary: Tastes Pretty Good!
review/text: Didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, but I mixed my first glass with a little unsweetened Almond Milk and surprisingly LIKED it.<br /><br />Has a nutty flavor, isn't sweet at all, but definitely isn't bad and is a bit palatable.  Tastes like a whole food without any vegetable type flavor.  Given that I really don't like the taste of vegetables this is great for me.<br /><br />And given that it's a healthy, animal free protein source, I'd definitely recommend trying it as a healthy alternative.  I'll probably stick to whey 3 times a week post workout since it has a higher BV, but the rest of the week I'll be switching to hemp protein I think.  No cholesterol like there is in whey either and I definitely notice less bloat from hemp as I've read.<br /><br />Give it a try it even if you aren't vegan, which I am not.

review/summary: Upsets my stomach badly
review/text: I've used a lot of different protein powders and decided to try this one for a change.  I was not put off by the slightly odd color or the slight grit of this powder as neither were too bad in my opinion.  The taste is not too bad either - not great but okay.  What I was put off by, unfortunately, is the fact that it seems to make me feel nauseated even in small quantities.  Very disappointing, and I can't return the large amount that is left.

review/summary: Edible...I think not!
review/text: I bought this in attempt to change up my protein routine and I read the reviews and most were pretty positive so I decided to buy. Big Mistake, I'm not sure who the people are that drink this willingly. The serious green colored turned me off but I bought and had to try. I could only manage 5 drinks before throwing it down the drain never to open again. The taste, I'm not sure just gross and it doesn't mix well at all so it was gritty and just plain nasty.<br />You can imagine my horror when a canister of two showed up on my door step because I forgot to cancel my subscribe and save and BTW, this is non-returnable item. If you want to try at a really discounted price email me and I will sell you (2) unopened canisters and yes, discounted price. Email me at lowecj@hotmail.com and use the product name in your subject.<br /><br />Good Luck!!

review/summary: Great protein/ fiber supplement
review/text: Overall, I was pretty happy with the Nutiva Hemp Protein Powder. It mixes and dissolves pretty well. I love the fact that is is organic! The added fiber is also a great benefit. The only downside is that you must mix it in with something for flavor, because the flavor of the powder alone is not good (in my opinion. I do think it blends well with fruit juice or in a smoothie. I think I might try the Nutiva hemp protein powder in chocolate if you are looking for more flavor. This protein powder is good to add to things. It tastes really good with some chocolate almond milk,the chocolate really balances the earthy taste of the hemp.

review/summary: Good Protein Source...But
review/text: I like this product. Great taste and a healthier alternative to whey or soy (I did the research). I add peanut butter and cacao powder to increase flavor and protein.  I initially bought it through Amazon because of the competitive pricing. I was buying high quality Hemp Protein locally by the pound container at $10.99. As this price had escalated from $8.99 to $9.99 and so on I found Amazon and Nutiva. Originally the 50% Protein/3lb bag was competitively priced and came in at around $9.00 a pound. Then it jumped up to $10.00 per pound and now its less expensive to just buy it locally again. Hemp is catching on and perhaps and this is driving the price up. Until Amazon/Nutiva drops the price again I'll keep buying locally.

review/summary: I wanted to like it
review/text: I really wanted to like this product. I like that it is made of hemp and has lots of protein. I have tried several different ways to make smoothies with this stuff, but it doesn't dissolve! You get an unappetizing brown sludge at the bottom of your glass at best. At worst, it was chunky and clogged up my straw. It is really not yummy looking either no matter what you add so I put it in an opaque covered cup to drink it. Probably not going to order again.

review/summary: Nice addition to smoothies and nutrition bars
review/text: I have been using this on a daily basis for well over a year. Each three pound bag lasts about a month for me, supplying the protein component for me and my wife's smoothies. On its own, the hemp protein is pretty harsh. I used to fill up a shaker with 16 ounces of water and � cup of this stuff and gag/gulp it down. Besides the fact that it does not mix at all with water, it is somewhat vile in its purest form. It is actually a bit more pleasant than a few other brands when consumed alone. When a serving is added to some hemp oil, almond milk and fruits, it falls into balance and the nuttiness of the hemp stands out nicely. The grittiness also becomes unnoticeable in my smoothies - and I'm using an inexpensive blender. I've also started making nutrition bars with this stuff and so far so good. I've seen a huge debate here and elsewhere about the quality of hemp protein. I am privileged enough to choose a diet that makes me feel good and remain healthy. Since this is not my sole source of protein, I'm not concerned that I will get Kwashiorkor, in case anyone still feels like maintaining the potential negative of switching to a hemp protein only diet. In fact, I feel that I have come upon a period of peak health and I will say that this purchase plays a significant role. The price has fluctuated by quite a bit as of late, but I use subscribe and save to get the most bang for my buck. In short, I highly recommended this product if you are using it in a smoothie or nutrition bar.

review/summary: Probably great for you, but tastes terrible
review/text: I bought this because lots of people said it had a natural nutty flavor, but my wife and I find it pretty much unusable. I still try to mix it in water and chug it as quickly as possible. It's not easy to hide in foods or sauces either (this is unlike nutritional yeast, which also tastes good on its own). I would give this one star, but I know a lot of people get this for its health benefits and not its flavor, but the flavor is so bad I rarely use it so I'm not getting the health benefits anyway. Of course, taste is a personal thing, but we were hoping this would be a good source of protein and nutrients for our vegetarian diets and we were quite disappointed.

review/text: my friend recommended the Hemp Protein as a really great protein source.  It is suppose to be one of the cleanest proteins available however the taste is really not that great, probably because it doesn't contain a lot of fillers and unnecessary junk.  I can tolerate it in my protein drink but refuse to mix it with my food, the taste is not horrible it's just very green tasting like you added grass to your food. I guess if you're used to green tea, or wheat grass it wouldn't bother you as much...

review/summary: Hemp it Up!!!
review/text: I love this stuff ... I have tried a bunch of Hemp products - this IS a bit more "grainy" than most - but I think I actually prefer that than the super fine powder - so it is personal preference. I recently ordered the 70% Protein version as well to give it a run - even though it is NOT organic ... so we will see. I usually mix this with some Rice Protein (unflavored), Pea Protein (unflavored) and of course Hemp protein ... add some fresh fruit (banana) - almond milk, natural sweetener and ice ... and BAM!  Protein madness for my Vegan adventures ...<br /><br />Give it a try - and see if the texture is right ... the flavor in my opinion is MUCH better than the other options ... but it is a bit more "grainy" ...

review/text: I have tried whey protein and found that it make me feel sick; however, hemp protein I can mix with my green drink in the morning and it doesn't make me feel sick.  I don't eat allot of meat and this is an easy low calorie way to get the protein I need every day.  I mix it with frozen berries and Almond milk or coconut milk to make shakes.  I was concerned that it would cause me to fail a drug test because I assumed that well you know what plant this is related to but after emailing Nutiva they told me that is not not cause you to fail a drug test.

review/summary: Great for smoothies
review/text: I ordered this when I began feeling fatigued during my morning workouts, and realised that I might be lacking in protein. I don't eat cereal and/or egg everyday, because I prefer raw food and also they tend to be heavy before a workout and I detest highly processed bars and powders. When I read up about hemp powder, I was skeptical, but decided that it was the only way out to have a sure fire morning protein dose before my yoga workouts.This product has now become a favorite of mine and I use it in the following recipe (almost every day)<br />- blend a cup of unflavored, organic soymilk, a ripe banana, handful of berries (fresh or frozen), some flaxseeds, hemp powder (2-3 spoons) and some honey (optional) to a rich delicious smoothie. The flax seeds add a nice crunch and the hemp gives it a nutty flavor that goes great with the bananas.<br />I'm glad I found this product. Natural, raw, organic and extremely healthy. Perfect!

The seller recommends you reserve 1 lb for immediate use in the fridge and to store the remaining 2 lbs in the freezer for rapidly approaching anticipated use. I'm still shopping for a vegan-friendly protein powder product that doesn't require me to dump half the whole bag into my shaker before coming through on it's promise of delivering 50 percent of my daily protein needs.

review/summary: very good stuff
review/text: The source of protein in Hemp seeds is much easier to ingest than  whey.  The flavor is very good, rather nut like and is very good on whole grain cereals.  I've cut down on red meat and use the hemp seed product to keep a handle on the protein that my body is asking for.  I'm 61 years old and am an active outdoors person.  I do not take junky supplements of any kind in tablet or capsule form.  This source of protein is natural and delicious.

review/summary: An acquired taste to put it nicely...
review/text: I just received this product on Wed Jun 1, 2011 and was extremely disappointed and disgusted. My brother and I tried the powder in milk, then added cinnamon and vanilla to attempt to hide the flavor, but it was extremely grainy, did not mix well at all, irritated my throat, and tasted absolutely horrific. I tried once more to drink it mixed with water, which I did successfully while holding my nose until 5 minutes later when I almost threw it up. I ended up throwing it out in my backyard. This was $28 wasted as fertilizer.

review/text: I purchased this product solely off the description from its website.  It stated that, "It's so delicious many of our customers report they love to eat it off the spoon!" When I read that, I thought," great! Im sold." I recieved this product and mixed 4 teaspoons with some skim milk and drank it.  I damn near threw up, it took me 30 min. to choke it down.  I then even tried mixing 4 teaspoons with 2 bananas, 10 strawberries, and a quart of strawberry yogurt and it was still undrinkable. I threw it away cause I did not want to spend $20 dollars on other stuff just to make 4 teaspoons taste better. Dont buy this stuff.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Nutrition considerations if depend on large amounts of hemp
review/text: Despite claims to the contrary, hemp protein is not a complete protein.  It is very weak in lysine, and doesn't have enough leucine and tryptophan.  Because of this, if you eat it in large quantities, especially in a vegetarian diet, it cannot count gram for gram. That is not to say it is not a very positive element of a well balanced diet in reasonable diet proportions or when complementary proteins balance the weaknesses.  One tip: Protein from almonds and almond milk are also just as incomplete in lysine.<br /><br />Hemp seed protein has all essential amino acids - just not in the optimal proportions.  You'd be hard pressed to find any protein that was nearly devoid of even one of them (ok, gelatin is a rare contender). ... it is good to separate the hype in the marketing of nutritional supplements and then to enjoy it for what it offers ;-)<br /><br />According to the amino acid data Nutiva, this manufacturer of this natural hemp 50% protein powder, provides on THEIR website - put in terms of proportions of each of the essential amino acids per actual gram of the hemp protein, this is NOT complete protein by definition.<br /><br />The standard "complete protein" definition you can find on Wikipedia defined, or on the Self (Nutrition) site is, in mg per gram overall protein:<br /><br />Tryptophan................7<br />Threonine................27<br />Isoleucine...............25<br />Leucine..................55<br />Lysine...................51<br />Methionine+Cystine.......25<br />Phenylalanine+Tyrosine...47<br />Valine...................32<br />Histidine................18<br /><br />Hemp: Lysine is only 27/51: incomplete.<br /><br />If you look at the essential aa's stated on the Nutiva website and compared them to the definition of a complete protein above you will notably find less than 55% of the complete proportion of lysine.  Tryptophan and BCAA leucine are also coming up short: three of the nine essential amino acids are thus lacking vs. a "complete protein". That gives hemp seed protein quality score of under 55 when a complete protein needs to be 100 or more. Normally protein quality is nothing to worry about since randomly several sources are combined and usually work out well. But some people seem to really push their protein intake very high for bulking up, etc., and others, usually not healthy are trying to supplement their needs to meet their numbers. In both of those cases protein quality will make or break their strategy. That is not to say they need to have complete proteins each time they eat: Only; they need to approximate optimal human essential amino acid proportions basically over a day or so.<br /><br />The bioavailability of hemp protein is decent - somewhere around 80% bioavailability - typical for veggies which presents a challenge. Compared to milk, egg or chicken, for example, these score in the high 90's for bioavailability in digestion (flavor and whether it agrees with you are different concepts). In perspective, and unfortunately, that makes hemp's protein quality worse than the approximate 55 ...<br /><br />All the above said hemp can be GREAT if balanced properly in the diet! You just need to quantify what you are getting and tailor it to your needs, when you use the supplements as a major portion of your diet.<br /><br />SUGGESTION: The bottom line is if you are in need of protein supplementation, be careful with counting on large amounts of hemp if you haven't complemented the relatively "low protein quality" with other "low quality" or otherwise complementary proteins (don't get misled by the use of the word quality ... all protein is good ... we are just looking to meet optimal human requirements and that is where the misnomer 'quality' is being applied).<br /><br />To get the correct mix for optimal diet needs... it would be critical to add at some point in the day, (this works) 100g of frozen spinach and a cob of corn or its equivalent in kernels to get the additional lysine and tryptophan per serving of hemp - it would be a reasonable vegetable source if you go the vegetarian route. Alternately, adding a reasonable amount of yogurt for its protein content works fine, and if you eat fish, cod is one of the best complements to hemp as it has a lysine score of about 180 vs. hemp's 55.<br /><br />"Eat a well balanced diet". Yogurt or whey protein in your diet will take care of that - combining it with hemp protein content 1:1; soy somewhat if you are vegan - but be careful of not overdoing it for your thyroid hormone with soy since that is controversial and certainly for people who have low thyroid hormone levels... find soy extracted with alcohol if this is the case since the hormones in soy (which many tout as 'good') are diminished during the alcohol extraction.<br /><br />Soy is great in moderation and offers better "quality" than hemp if you look at it alone, but properly part of a balanced diet, neither is better than the other.<br /><br />Believe it or not, eating too much protein can be a problem, too if you get supplemented out. This applies especially if the amino acid profile is not a good match for optimal nutrition conveniently found in meat, dairy and soy proteins (which are close to optimal individually eaten). Excess amino acids in a diet are disposed of by putting the liver to work. In extreme cases (somewhere over 1.2 grams protein per pound of body weight depending on the strength of your liver), you will get a yellower urine even when you drink lots. That is basically the nitrogen byproduct after the body burns and stores the protein it cannot use. So, if you eat an average protein quality of 55 and get your daily grams, you will actually only get let's estimate something of the order of 55% of that protein incorporated into you (ok, there is a bit more to it depending on the non-essentials, but this is the general idea) and the rest will be dumped into your liver, excreted nitrogen and the rest converted into energy or stored as glycogen or fat - there is no memory or "protein reserve" in the body. The excretion part will be in the form of urea. Too much urea in the urine puts you at risk for gout a disease you don't want to know about. All these consideration are for extreme cases. In healthy cases where hemp is part of a balanced diet it is a non-issue.<br /><br />So, best to eat a serving of spinach and cob of corn with a 30 gram serving of this hemp, beans and Swiss chard would be helpful, but really a well balanced diet including dairy is the healthy low risk situation keeping a general eye on fats but no dwelling on it to the point of worrying about gaining an ounce of weight every now and then ... that's why we need to exercise. Alternately you can spend a mint on amino acid supplement pills to raise the hemp to a "higher" quality protein than soy or whey for that matter ...<br /><br />People who are immobile have other issues and the bioavailability, supplementation and protein quality can become major issues for them. Like to preventing skin breakdown and bed sores to start with. Depends on your situation.

review/summary: does hemp protein ever go bad? maybe...
review/text: First off, i definitely like hemp protein. This is the third bag i've ordered through Amazon but the first from Amazon.com. Having said this I'm not as happy with this purchase as I have been in the past. I know it's supposed to have a shelf life of a year but I'm fairly convinced I must have gotten a stale batch. The smell put me off initially, and when I went to make a smoothie out of it I couldn't finish it at all. The first bag I ordered (through Amazon from a company called Raw Foods) came in vacuum sealed and that one was perfectly fine. The second and third one was loose. So based on my experiences I would say that freshness matters somewhat. I tried searching for other folks experience with hemp protein but it's basically impossible to find any more critical reviews of it - all I ever seem to get is how much better the stuff is than Whey protein for bodybuilding.<br /><br />Anyway I much prefer the taste of Nutiva Hemp Protein moreso than the Living Harvest brand, and I did try to contact Nutiva via email about the possibility of a stale batch, but never heard a reply. From now on I will only order bags that have been vacuum packed.

review/text: After reading the other reviews, I was sure that I was going to love this protein powder but, initially, that was not the case. The flavor is very earthy and tastes "healthy", if healthy has a taste. I eased my way into using it by first sprinkling it onto my yogurt...it lends itself very well to cinnamon, so pile it on. I quickly went from, "yuck" to "ick" to "ok" to "not bad" to "pretty good" to "I LOVE IT!". So, yes, it is an acquired taste but the more you use it the more you will find that you love it too.<br /><br />My favorite snack:<br />1/2c Almond Milk<br />1/2c Frozen Blueberries (still frozen)<br />3 Drops of Liquid Stevia<br />1-2TB Hemp Protein Powder<br />Tons of cinnamon.<br /><br />Stir & Enjoy!

review/summary: Super food - ultimate protein - body building - for food sensitivities
review/text: I am lactose intolerant. Eggs give me crazy gas. I don't eat meat. Nuts give me gas. Beans give me gas.<br /><br />I also body build. That leaves me with little options for protein. Luckily there is hemp, and this is the part of the plant my body needs most. As stated in the product description hemp is the plant kingdoms gold standard, much like eggs are the gold standard in the animal kingdom. And really the two are very comparable. Hemp is much cheaper though.<br /><br />It dissolves very easy in water, unlike egg protein. It is easy to digest, unlike egg protein. It tastes great, and is quite mild, almost nutty flavor -egg protein always tastes like crap because they always put artificial flavors in, which make no doubt about it, are chemicals that are bad for your body. The hemp + fiber variety Nutiva makes is too gritty for me. This 50% protein is more expensive because more of the fiber is sifted out. Being a vegetarian I get plenty of fiber as it is anyway.<br /><br />I eat probably 6 heaping scoops (like a standard protein extract measuring cup) of this stuff a day, and never get sick of it. It's great between meals, or with meals, or mixed into meals, and you can mix it into almost anything because of the quite neutral flavor. I recover from workouts faster.<br /><br />It never gives me gas or makes me feel bloated. It has little fat, and the small amount of beneficial healthy fats it does have are needed to build muscle. Since this is plant sourced protein it also has anti-oxidants I am sure, it's green color is a testament to that.<br /><br />I could not be without this product.

review/summary: Highly Nutritious
review/text: Nutiva Organic Hemp 50% Protein Powder is consistently excellent. I have been using it daily for about nine months now in a morning breakfast smoothie with other organic nutritional products recommended by my doctor, one of which is The Ultimate Meal. The results are highly satisfying. Hemp powder is an excellent source of protein from one of the most nutritious sources known. It blends well with fresh or frozen berries and fruits, but usually I prefer a whole fresh organic avocado in the smoothie for added protein and energy that satisfies and keeps me going for hours, and on occasion instead use organic fresh or frozen berries or fruit for variety.. I recommend Nutiva hemp powder for anyone interested in achieving and maintaining superior health. It always arrives very well packaged, in superb condition. My best suggestion is that anyone interested try it and see for yourself. Personally, I wouldn't want to be without it. One of the services amazon.com provides that I use for this product is Subscribe and Save because shipments can be scheduled and changed or suspended easily as one chooses.

review/summary: Best vegan protein I've had so far
review/text: I use a lot of protein powder, mostly in breakfast smoothies, or mixed with almond milk after a tough work out.  Since going vegan (dairy and I were not seeing eye to eye...), I had to move away from the whey protein I was used to and find a vegan substitute.  Nutiva has been a source of some great supplements in my household for awhile, so I tried it out.  Let's just say that now I am a 'subscribe and save' customer with amazon.<br /><br />The price through amazon is much less than Whole Foods (much much less!).  There are 15g of protein per serving, not as much compared to whey, but hemp protein is nice because it is not produced from an animal product.  The flavor is quite nice.  It has a mild chocolate kick that is nice with greens and fruit in a smoothie, or at home in almond or soy milk.  I give it two thumbs up.  And so far I haven't found a better price than the Nutiva on ORGANIC hemp protein!<br /><br />Of note though: make sure you order from amazon and not a third party (though the third party offered this item with free Prime shipping, it took over a week to arrive instead of the two days that Amazon Prime items take - they fooled me by pricing it a penny less and offering the prime option).

review/text: I bought Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein Powder and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E23VXW">Living Harvest Organic Hemp Protein Powder, Original Flavor, 16-Ounce Plastic Container</a> to compare the two. The latter is slightly more expensive, but doesn't seem to be worth the price.<br /><br />As others have said, the Nutiva powder mixes very easily and compared to Living Harvest's, it's far less grainy and bitter. I mix it with warmed soy milk and sugar and find it very delicious w/out added fruits or juices, despite other comments that say the taste isn't all that great. I've noticed, though, that if I mix it and drink it hours later, or make a batch for the following day, it tastes slightly bitter, so it's better when it's made fresh.<br /><br />I finished my 16 oz. container in a week because I couldn't stop drinking it. I'm working on the Living Harvest powder just for comparison, but I'm pretty sure I'll be sticking with Nutiva. It's cheaper, more finely ground, and less bitter. Once I'm done with Living Harvest, I'll be buying the 3 lbs bag.

review/text: I bought this because I am a vegan and I was feeling like I could use some extra protein in my diet. I already eat a lot of soy-based products, so I wanted something different to get my protein.<br /><br />The hemp smells and tastes a bit grassy, which isn't a problem for me, but some people might not like it. It is really easy to add to any drinks or food, but it doesn't dissolve like other protein powders do. In drinks, the granules tend to fall back down to the bottom after stirring. Also, they recommend keeping it in the fridge, which is a bit less convenient than something you keep in the cupboard.<br /><br />I like it, but because it doesn't dissolve, I probably won't rebuy once I've finished.

You must keep the protein you are using in the fridge, and the rest must be kept in the freezer in order to preserve it. I also use whey, but have found better results on the hemp. You need to know up front that it tastes the way alfalfa smells, so it will take some getting used to it. Now that I've used it for a while I kinda like the nutty flavor.

review/summary: Healthy but not that tasty
review/text: If you're looking for the single most healthy protein supplement, hemp protein is what you want. It's amazingly good for you, and includes an incredible amount of protein for a plant based product. Better yet, its free from sweeteners, toxic substances, and other junk that designer protein mixes contain. If you care about what you put in your body and want to make sure its only 'the best' this is the mix for you.<br /><br />However (and this is a bid however), this stuff tastes terrible in my opinion. To put that in context, I've not just transitioned from sugary whey compound proteins and moved to this one and am complaining out of ignorance. I eat only whole grains, lots of veggies and fruit, and while I do use other protein supplements, I don't use them aggressively. I enjoy things like Genmaicha tea that also have 'earthy' flavors. I'll happily scarf down Brussel Sprouts, raw broccoli, and spinach. I can honestly say that Nutivia Organic Hemp protein is just about the worst tasting plant based food I've ever encountered.<br /><br />I made a fairly normal smoothie with this powder: 6 oz vanilla yogurt, 4-5 strawberries, a handful of blueberries, some ice and water. It was thick and chunky and literally made me feel ill drinking it. I had to choke it down. I've tried making smoothies with juice as well. Orange juice worked the best at cutting down the flavor (but not the consistency) of the powder and made it more palatable. Still not great though.<br /><br />I've been trying new things to try and get a smoothie that I actually like, but to no avail. If you have a recipe that you think tastes good, by all means share it in the comments! You see, I really WANT to like this stuff since its so good for me, but haven't found a way to prepare or use it that I enjoy.<br /><br />Nutritional value: 5 Stars<br />Taste: 1 Star<br />Consistency: 3 Stars<br />Value: 5 Stars<br />Average: 4 Stars<br /><br />Wonderful, complete protein that has a terrible taste (in my opinion). I will be sticking with it though, because the healthiness of the supplement is my number one priority.

review/summary: Great for new Celiacs!
review/text: I love this protein powder. I am intolerant to gluten, dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, and soy. Intolerance to dairy is very common with newly diagnosed Celiacs or gluten intolerance. My intolerance really restricts my options for added protein other than meat. It is gentle on the digestive system and is great in smoothies! I put it in a smoothie with two cups of frozen fruit, a cup of coconut milk (or more depending on how liquid you want...) and a tablespoon of local honey to help with my allergies so I don't have to take allergy medications (plus tastes yummy). Hemp is truly a super food. Aloe juice in the smoothie instead of milk and a tablespoon of coconut oil gives great health benefits. I don't know how great this would be just mixed with milk like you do muscle milk and other whey proteins; it is definitely brownish green and a little gritty being it is plant material ground fine. Amazon is the cheapest place for it by far and shipping was right on schedule, a day early even. I am satisfied and will be using this product for years (Fun Fact: it take an average of 1 1/2 to 2 years for the small intestine to heal enough from severe gluten damage to properly absorb dairy).

review/summary: vegetarian weight loss physician is enjoying this stuff
review/text: I enjoy this stuff.  I am drinking a shake of this hemp protein + soy milk + organic cacao 1-2 times per day.  It is quite satisfying and low sugar, high fiber.  Good amino acid content.  I bought hemp protein because I am vegetarian and avoid dairy for health reasons + environmental concerns.  And I already get a lot of soy, so was looking for alternative.  Plus I read in the medical literature that there is a lot of good reasons to eat about 30-40gm protein per meal at least breakfast + lunch.<br /><br />The taste is lousy alone.  Add it to soy milk and it's drinkable.  Mix in some chocolate or strawberry preserves and you are have a protein shake with pretty mainstream appeal.  Key to get a good protein shake mixer, so you can really shake it up well.  You don't generally want to be eating chunks of the hemp powder.

review/summary: Easy to digest, but hard to swallow
review/text: I switched to this hemp protein from whey variants because I had been finding the whey hard to digest (cramping/gas).  I found that the hemp protein is much more agreeable from a digestive standpoint. After switching to hemp, those issues went away completely.<br /><br />At the same time, I have the same issue with the flavor that a lot of commenters have mentioned.  There is *no* question that this is a plant product.  That's not necessarily a bad thing - the flavor reminds me a lot of soy milk so, if you enjoy the "plantiness" of soy milk, you'll likely enjoy this.  And I will say that, over the course of the 3 lbs, the flavor has grown on me.  Much like switching to whole wheat pasta from white pasta - it just takes some getting used to.  However, many people (maybe even the majority) will not be able to get past the initial shock of the taste to acclimate.<br /><br />For those brave enough to try it, this is the recipe I've been using and really enjoy:<br /><br />1c Water<br />1c Unsweetened Plain Yogurt<br />4T Hemp Protein<br />1T Honey<br /><br />I just throw it all in the blender for a minute or so and drink.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: I've tried both the regular hemp powder and this 50% protein version, and this is the better of the two.  Not as gritty.<br /><br />Can't beat this stuff for healthy eating and unlike other protein powders, it isn't loaded with fructose or other chemicals or genetically modified soybean products.  Granted, it doesn't have that vanilla milkshake flavor, and it does look a bit weird (greenish), but it is HEALTHY!  I think it tastes a bit like raw sunflower seeds.<br /><br />I make a fruit smoothie: lots of fresh/frozen whole fruits, 1/2 c. yoghurt, sometimes a little water depending upon the fruit.  Mix in a blender.<br /><br />Since I've been having this for breakfast every day, I've lost about 5 pounds (not even trying) and my energy levels have increased.  I'm attributing the changes to the hemp since all I did was switch from a "standard" protein drink mix to hemp.

review/summary: Terrific protein supplement
review/text: As someone cutting back on animal proteins, I began searching for healthy alternatives.  I came across the advantages of hemp.  I was impressed, especially with the amount of protein and nutrients it contained.  Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein had the highest of all.  So I ordered me a 3lb. bag.  After taking me a spoonful right out of the bag, I was sold.  This is the best.  It has a nutty, almost like peanut butter taste to it.  I mix a tablespoon in my morning "greens drink" and it fills me up.  I am putting it on my subscribe shopping list so I won't ever run out.  Amazon, as always, give you the best price.  If you have never tried hemp in any form, seed or powder, you must give it a try.  I like it much better than flaxseed, salba seed or any of the others I've tried. And I have tried them all just about.  I highly recommend this product of hemp overall for those who are looking at hemp protein as an alternative or addition to their diet and health.<br />  L.

review/summary: SO happy I liked it!
review/text: I am fighting cancer, and I decided to do a vegan diet. With no animal protein, and mostly vegetables it was super hard to get enough protein. My nutritionist suggested whey, but after learning it had soy in it, I searched for alternatives. Since soy is so controversial, I figured i would just stay away from it. He said pea protein, and I am ok with that, but I decided on the 50% Hemp protein. He said go ahead and I just received it today. I have to say I really like it. I made mine with 8 oz. almond milk, 1 tablespoon of raw organic cocoa powder, and 2 packets of stevia (probably could use less stevia). I used my hand help immersion blender and tada..... it was tasty. I look forward to having this every day.<br /><br />I already feel great on my new protocol, can't wait to see if this addition makes even more of a difference.

review/summary: Bearable taste/decent taste, good for active people
review/text: When I first bought this product,  I figured it wouldn't taste anywhere near most Whey Proteins, for this is half true.  This hemp powder sure has an earthy taste with a dirt like texture.  Being the non-wasteful person I am, I kept using it and I found mixing it with a milk(cow, almond, oat..) and a fruit such as a Banana does wonders for the flavor and a hint of Vanilla extract makes it taste good too!  I workout hard every day and I must say it's been helping me to achieve better results and and bigger muscles!  Your body can actually use every gram to it's advantage unlike whey where you have to drink tens and tens of grams to recover from a tough workout.  Do the math=Processed whey powder=50% usable by the body(75g) or hemp powder=100% usable(only 15-30g!).  I go natural with weight lifting because cutting corners will show on your body when you get older.  In all honesty, if you are a person that is picky with taste or flavors, you might only be able to hack this by masking the flavor with a bunch of other products.  It ain't the most exciting flavor, but after a while, you get used to it and it's very easy on my stomach.  From seeing some results using this, I'm definitely gonna continue using this product!

review/summary: Great for gluten-free vegans
review/text: I use this in combination with pea protein powder.  I am not a body builder, just trying to get a little extra protein in my morning smoothies.  I have a pretty sensitive intolerance to gluten, and this does not bother me or cause gas as soy does for some of us.  This powder also has healthy fats, which most other protein powders cannot offer.  With a subscription to this product, I could not find a better deal on such a good-quality, organic protein powder.
