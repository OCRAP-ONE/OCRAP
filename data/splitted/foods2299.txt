review/summary: Love the product
review/text: Not sure if it's working on my stomach pains, but I feel pretty good since taking it daily.<br />Look forward to eating spicy foods again (infrequently of course), and hopefully it'll kill some H Pyori that antibiotics couldn't.<br /><br />The taste is very sweet, but on a cracker or in water, it's ok.<br />It's expensive though! But, I suppose it's worth the price.

review/summary: Healing Manuka Honey
review/text: Was looking for a reasonably priced Manuka honey, also called healing honey, since I read a lot about the amazing properties. I wanted to try it for my acid reflux and to heal my foot ulcers. My foot ulcers were really severe and after 2 1/2 years of treatments, none of them worked, I was almost ready to give up, but decided to try Manuka honey as a last resort.<br />My acid reflux responded to the honey after only a few days and I no longer need medication!<br />My foot ulcers are also GONE! After only 4 weeks my ulcers were about 30% smaller, after 8 weeks they were closed and about 75% smaller and at the end of 3 month, they are GONE. I applied a thin layer of honey to gauze, placed it on the ulcer and bandaged it with rolled gauze. Change the honey gauze pad every 12 to 16 hours and rinse foot before applying the next treatment.<br />Would recommend the Wedderspoon Honey to everyone, the price is unbeatable and the taste of the honey one of the best ones.

review/summary: You change Your Honey, You Don't Get My Money
review/text: I have been consuming and sharing with others Wedderspoon Active 16+ for almost two years. Then Wedderspoon made changes that I find unacceptable. The first had to do with their label, which most people don't bother to read since the label color didn't change. Gone was organic certification by Ecosert SA. Gone was "Support the OMA mark which guarantees honey that is free from chemicals and pesticides." Missing are the following: Never feeding the bees sugar, area of forage is 5 km. from intensive farming, Ecosert approval. Added was the word "harmful" before chemicals and pesticides. Obviously, chemicals and pesticides are added and we are supposed to hope they are not harmful.<br /><br />Then I noticed that batch 110576 was definitely "watery" compared to earlier batches. It had nothing to do with the weather because last summer was just as hot and the manuka was just fine. Batch 110583 was almost as runny as 110576. Then came another shipment from Amazon.com that was packed very securely, but there was leaked honey all over the box. Amazon.com reimbursed me, but it wasn't their fault. The outer seal was intact but there was no inner seal. This runny honey had no difficulty passing between the jar and the cover.<br /><br />Additionally, although it no longer affects me, it appears that Wedderspoon followed through and no longer sells direct to Amazon.com, which raises the price a little more.<br /><br />I rated this product one star so I could submit my review. One star is very generous.

review/summary: great taste
review/text: After reading a large number of orders, I decided to try this.  The taste and scent was extremely pleasant.  No after taste, just delicious.  I took a teaspoon before breakfast and before dinner.  On first day, I got diarrhea immediately after dinner. I tried it again same routine.  Stomach begin to grumble after dinner again and I got diarrhea.  Tried it the third day but with a piece of toast.  Third day, after dinner stomach ache and to bathroom again.  I decided not to try it the following day.  Had no stomach problems.  Tried it again the following day before dinner only and had to  'visit' bathroom again immediately after dinner.  I continued for about 2 weeks and bathroom routine occurred almost nightly (even though I had used bathroom several times already earlier in the day).  So for me, this product seems to act as an agent to clean my system (seems like an expensive laxative ;o).  NOTE:  My objective USE of this product was to alleviate mild arthritic pain that occurs in my knee during extremely cold days.  I noticed no change in the pain when using this product.

review/text: I just bought this product for acne. It's too early to say much, but I wanted to share how I use it. I put a tiny bit in a cup, and drizzle a tiny bit of water over it. Then I use my finger to put it on my face, and it's a lot less sticky than putting straight honey on my face. I can regulate the stickiness by adding more drops of water. I can leave it on my face for a long time. Hope this helps.

Honey tastes very good. I'm a honey person and have tried many out there, especially high-end ones. Some of them give me diarrhea, which is on top of my regular stomach problems. My digestive and colon systems are very sensitive. After a couple days taking this...I feel great (and normal again)! No worries of looking for a bathroom when going out.

review/text: Just had my 6 month repeat endoscopy. While I probably still have Barrett's (awaiting biopsy results)it appears to be unchanged. My esophagitis is completely gone! I credit this to following all the typical advice for GERD ie, watch diet, don't eat anything for 3 hours before bedtime, sleep elevated and I take Tagamet just as needed. I refused PPIs twice a day as is the usual protocol. A few months ago I began having 1 of this honey, on a small piece of banana 20 minutes before meals, once or twice a day. I had a hard time remembering except for breakfast. Yes, it's expensive but I'm sure it helped with healing. It tastes good, too.

review/text: I wish this wasn't so expensive.  I would buy it much more!  At least on Amazon you get a better price than in the store.  At Whole Foods this same honey is over $40.00!!!  Yikes!<br />I love that it is raw & organic.  It is a thick cloudy honey that has a wonderful taste with a little bite at the end.  My mouth waters just thinking about it!  I also love how it's a bit thick because it makes it much less messy.  Talk about wanting to take your medicine!  It recommends you take a teaspoon a half hour before eating.  No problem!  I do it gladly!<br />I haven't noticed any health changes, but I'm sure it must be doing good things.  Honey is known for it's health benefits & this stuff is supposed to be amazing!  Maybe it takes a while for the health benifits to be noticeable.<br />If you can afford it & like honey, I would buy it in place of other honey just for it's yummy taste & if it makes you healthier than bonus points!

review/summary: Diminished my bruise!
review/text: I bought this for mainly external skin treatments.  I mix this with a little bit of turmuric for acne cleansing and toning mask and it works extremely well. It reduces the size of the inflammation/pimple and leaves skin soft and smooth.  Last week I went on a 30 mile bike trail and fell off my bike.  A few days later I noticed a nice blueish half dollar size bruise on my thigh.  On a whim, I decided to use the manuka honey on it overnight to see if it would help since I was already using it for skin.  Well to my amazement, the bruise was almost gone the very next day!  After 3 days of use, I could not see the bruise at all!  For me this is THE BEST natural product for my skin.  I have darker skin that actually doesn't even bruise easily but when it does, it takes months to fully heal.  Discoloration takes even longer to disappear so I am truly truly happy with the brand and product.

review/summary: From Proton Pump Inhibitor to Wdderspoon's Manuka Honey
review/text: I discovered that long-term use of a Proton Pump Inhibitor was killing me. So I stopped. The resuting reflux was horrendous.<br /><br />I started using 2 teaspoons of Wdderspoon's Manuka Honey 30 minutes before meals. I have not needed any type of antacid. I am careful though. I don't eat known irritants like coffee, tomatoes, and chile (green or red). I stay away from all gluten containing foods - or those that might have been cross-contaminated.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with Wdderspoon's Manuka Honey, I have broadened the types of food I eat again. The taste is good and I have learned to like the 30 minutes I wait from "taking" the honey until I eat. I don't use antacid. This Manuka honey is much better than proton pump inhibitors.

review/text: I had purchased a bottle of this Manuka Honey earlier from Amazon and it had done wonders for my dog's intestinal problems.  This is my second bottle but the consistency of the honey is far different from the first one I ordered.  This bottle of honey is thin and runny - much more like a sauce than a real honey consistency, and lighter in color.  I have never seen honey this texture in my life.  A new Whole Foods just opened up nearby and I purchased a bottle of Wedderspoon 16+ there.  When this bottle runs out, I will be very interested to see what texture the one purchased at Whole Foods looks like.

review/summary: Healthy Honey
review/text: I have Crohn's disease and am trying manuka honey for this.  I take handfulls of antibiotics daily and heard others are having good results with this honey, which would be a welcome replacement to the pills.  It arrived undamaged, perfectly packaged, so I didn't have the issue some others had with shipping.  The honey itself is very thick and has sort of an astringent taste, but it's good and will taste good incorporated into teas, food, etc.

Here is what happened:<br /><br />I had acid reflux for two weeks straight, and it was progressively getting worse.<br /><br />After taking this for one weekend my heartburn has completely vanished.  I'm also not forced to take the honey every day, but if I ever have a flare up I just take some and 20 minutes later it is gone.

review/summary: Not Necessarily Good for Stomachs
review/text: Active manuka honey is often recommended as an aid for healing stomach ulcers and related problems.  I have had a couple of two-month bouts of excessive acid combined with gastritis (stomach lining inflammation) and tried it both times.  Both times I had to give up on it because all it seemed to do was increase the burning sensation in my esophagus and stomach, so I really can't recommend it for people with digestive problems.  Plus I personally find it far too sweet, although my husband doesn't.  On the other hand, I do keep a jar of this particular brand around because we have both found it soothing when we have sore throats due to colds.

review/summary: Tastes great, real thick
review/text: It's so hard to know if a product has all of the nutritional value that its purveyors purport.  Price-wise, this was a much better deal than buying it at Whole Foods.  It came wrapped well, and delivery was good.  It has a thick, paste-like consistency and a very strong, sweet taste.  There is something about it that suggests it is "honey with a whollop."  The seller also suggests that Manuka honey is good for easing acid reflux, which I have. That's another good reason to buy it.  But again, I don't know of any empirical studies to support the claim that it eases acid reflux.  All in all, this honey simply tastes very good.  If you just want honey that is natural and tastes good and medicinal qualities are not important to you, there are no doubt less-expensive choices around. But....you can't go wrong with this stuff.

On doing a little research, I found that the bees feed on flowers of the tree that's also called teatree, and if you have ever smelled teetree oil that's what the honey tastes like..almost a menthol taste. But since it is supposed to have such benefits health-wise, and since it was so expensive, I guess I'll go ahead and try using it..maybe to sweeten drinks or something..but for breakfast toast I'll stick to our good local honey.

review/summary: Manuka magick!
review/text: This is an excellent quality Manuka Honey product.  There is a bit of confusion over the UMF, MGO and OMA rating thing.  UMF is the original and trademarked.  MGO is a newer rating system that does not directly correlate to UMF but is accurate nonetheless.  OMA is Wedderspoon's own rating system for determining activity within the raw honey. From my reading it appears to be pretty equitable to UMF.  This honey is also USDA Organic certified (although that doesn't mean as much these days) to ensure that there are no additive ingredients to the product.<br /><br />As for usage, I have two jars of this honey.  I used the first on my wife's wounds following MOHS surgery for removal of skin cancer.  The results were amazing and the surgeon and plastic surgeon both asked what we were using to allow the wounds to heal up so quickly with minimal scarring.  There was also a staph infection as a result of the surgery that the honey took care of as well.  It takes a bit of diligence to ensure daily dressing changes with fresh honey, but the results pay off.  I ended up pre-soaking gauze with the honey and sandwiching between two layers of plastic wrap to create more manageable "bandages".  These were used by my wife when she traveled in addition to direct application to the cleaned wound bed.<br />Basic process: Clean wound with Hydrogen Peroxide, follow with colloidal silver in nebulizer, then drizzle honey into wound and cover wound with pre-soaked gauze pad.  The last bit is to cover the pre-soaked pad with a waterproof dressing like a Telfa-style pad to reduce oozing onto clothing/bedding.  Care must be taken in finding adhesives that do not irritate the skin too much with the frequent dressing changes.  There are also larger waterproof wound dressings with silver-impregnated that might be a good combination.  Main idea is to minimize air-space and keep honey in constant contact with wound bed.<br /><br />If this all sounds new, do some research on honey for wound care at the University of Waikato in New Zealand courtesy of Dr. Peter Molan.<br /><br />Note, this honey is not "sterilized" via gamma radiation (which is not supposed to reduce activity in the honey like pasteurization) but is still highly effective.  Honey is resistant to most any spoilage due to its activity and the sterilization process is just an extra step some honey manufacturer's take (Comvita or Summerglow) to be able to sell their products as medical devices in the US.  It will allow the honey to be FDA-approved.  Again, as I understand this is not a requirement but is done largely to gain approval for medical usage in hospitals and clinics.  Check out Medihoney dressings. BTW, I have also used this topically on oral canker sores with great effect! Sores dissappeared in days and not weeks! Applied directly 3 x day.<br /><br />Lastly, the other jar I use for tea and even coffee and it is delicious.  It has a strong floral taste and finish (as would be expected) and is alittle more viscous than other Manuka honeys I have tried.<br /><br />I have tried nearly all Manuka honey brands from NZ as I visit often and find this to be a great option for those of us who need a high-quality active raw Manuka honey without paying a load for shipping up the stuff from down under.  Or you can just ask a friend heading that way to bring you back some :P

I've been on every Rx antacid known, the last being Aciphex which is very strong and costs me $167 for 30 pills with insurance. I tried this honey after reading of its capabilities but believing that it was just a high priced scam, but I'm desperate for releif so I spent the $28. 3 days after eating 1 tsp on bread per day my stomach pain was gone. I couldn't beleive it. I'm still waiting for it to return but it's been a couple of weeks now and I feel great.

review/summary: Manuka honey, nature's perfect food!
review/text: I've been eating domestic raw honey for a while now to soothe my stomach, but turned to the "stronger" (and obviously more expensive) manuka honey after hearing about its healing capabilities.<br /><br />When I received the Wedderspoon organic manuka honey, I opened it up, and smelled its interesting aroma. It almost has a hint of antiseptic smell to it, along with the sweet honey scent. And it tastes like it smells, but you do get used to it, and it is absolutely delicious. It is thinner and runnier than "Really Raw" brand american honey, so I find myself eating it faster, which is fine except I am about to run out shortly after buying it. But for me, an admittedly starving artist who is notoriously thrifty, it is still definitely worth the money.<br /><br />So what has it done for me?<br />It calms my heartburn, helps my digestion, reduces nausea associated with IBS, and I've used it on a skin infection with great success. All while being completely natural and delicious.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this honey - if you've read about the benefits of manuka honey you will be pleased to find that it does everything they says it does [and more].<br /><br />I will be ordering one more jar from Amazon, before moving to New Zealand at the end of the summer, where I will be quite excited to buy it locally!

review/text: Please note:  The following review is based on experiences which may not in any way be construed as medical recommendation.  The decisions made in this situation were made in agreement with my physician and after careful research.  Always consult with your own doctors before embarking on any medical treatment.  In addition, the seller of this product is in no way responsible for any treatment decisions made regarding the use of the honey.  I am simply relaying my own experiences.<br /><br />Manuka Honey is not only great on toast, it has many medical uses.  In September of 2008, I contracted what turned out to be an autoimmune disorder called pyoderma gangrenosum, which acts as a "flesh eating disease" and it destroyed all the flesh on the front and sides of my right leg below the knee.  Recovery has been long and hard, and as of August of 2009, nearly a year later, is not complete.  In February, after months of wound healing, I had reached a plateau where there were a number of open areas and the scar tissue was still very raw and oozing.  It had been that way for a long time.<br /><br />A friend suggested I try manuka honey.  My doctor and I began researching the product, and after finding many medical journal articles on the subject, and becoming acquainted with Dr Peter Molan of New Zealand's Waikato University, the primary researcher into manuka honey's medicinal uses, we decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Within weeks the stubborn open areas had closed up and the scar was looking much better.  Not only that, but the "pipe veins" which had formed, large varicose veins which protruded and were very fragile, had begun to recede.  It was amazing.<br /><br />I am now using less honey, because of the progression of healing, and though I have a ways to go before I can walk normally again, there is no doubt that the manuka honey has played a large part in my healing.<br /><br />Please note that this honey is being sold as a dietary supplement and food product, and any medicinal uses should be discussed at length with your doctors.<br /><br />A photographic journal of my experience with pyoderma gangrenosum can be found as a right menu link off of [...] -- please note that the photos are somewhat graphic in nature.

Her skin was rough, red, scaly, itchy and she has had it for about a year.  Sound like ECZEMA????  She has tried prescriptions and over the counter stuff with little success.  I bought this and brought it to her and I said "You are going to think I am crazy, but this honey is going to heal your hand."  She told me that within 18 hours, the swelling had gone down significantly.  Within 5 days, it was much, much better.  And, in about 2 weeks, it was practically healed, except for her skin looking a little different color due to the trauma to it over the year.  This stuff is amazing!!  She just put honey on it and covered it with a big bandage.<br /><br />Oh, and btw, who cares if it is a plastic container.  You can't have it all.

Also contracted horrible yeast infection from way too many antibiotics from narrowly-focused Western medicine doctors.<br /><br />This Wedderspoon honey solved both of these persistent, painful problems.  It cleared up my eczema-like patches (I believe these were from yeast infection) with no scarring.  I tried EVERYthing else, nothing helped and I suffered from terrible itching until I found Manuka Honey. Whenever I eat something that I think may cause a GERD flareup, I take a couple teaspoons of Manuka Honey before bed or after a big meal, and no problems occur.<br /><br />Tastes wonderful.  BTW, I also give my Border Collie a 1/2 tsp. every morning.  He loves it and it seems to have solved his sensitive stomach problem.

review/text: My dad had a very large pressure sore (bed sore) on his buttocks after spending over 2  months in the hospital. His home-nurse suggested using honey. After researching, I came across Manuka Honey and decided the $28 price tag would be worth it IF it helped.<br /><br />My dad's sore was HUGE and DEEP. Unfortunately, I never photographed it or measured it but it was BIG and infected and very serious.<br /><br />It has been 3 weeks (THREE WEEKS) that my dad has been applying the Manuka Honey on his sore. Every time the sore gets dirty from a bowel movement, the Aide reapplys the honey and dressing. I'm guessing his dressing gets changed 2 to 3 times per day.<br /><br />I see my Dad weekly and at the 3rd week, I was SHOCKED to see the dramatic improvement. The sore is only about an inch in length and not very deep at all when it was about 6 inches long and very deep (I'm guessing at the size since I never measured it.But it was Huge!!).<br /><br />I am a believer. They say, seeing is believing. Well, I have seen, I continue to see, and I truly believe in Manuka Honey. I can't say enough about this product.<br /><br />It is a shame that doctors and pharmacies make consumers pay for medicines when there are alternatives.<br /><br />I hope this review helps some of you who are doubtful. It has and continues to help but dad. Try it!!!! It's a miracle indeed!!

review/summary: Wedderspoon Raw Manuka Honey
review/text: My husband was told that he had h-pylori last year. I have to mention he also suffers from acid reflux and ibs. After a antibiotic treatment that consisted of 4500 mgs a day for 2 weeks the stubborn h-pylori was not affected and the burning from his throat to his bowels was still very present. I researched herbal remedies and found that this honey was a cure for most of what he suffered from. I said what do we have to lose. The antibiotics made him so sick he was not willing to go another round to hope they would get rid of it. So we ordered this honey and started the slow process of healing. I also have to mention that he did have a severe case of infection that had been prolonged over several years. The honey started to work after the first couple jars or about 2 tbls a day. Needless to say today after 3 months he is h-pylori free and he continues to take it for his acid reflux. It does everything it says. He takes it regularly and I would not be without it ever. It has made the difference in his and my life to be able to be pain free for the first time in years. Make sure you get 16 plus to get the full benefits. You wont be sorry.<br />Carol from Kentucky

review/summary: High Quality Product - but a bit pricey
review/text: The quality of this product is excellent or at least very good. I learned about the health benefits of genuine Manuka honey while visiting New Zealand and have been a fan ever since.  There are peer-reviewed publications in credible scientific journals on the antibacterial properties of Manuka honey - I tried it recently on some road rash from a bike crash and it does work (albeit messy - so you will need good bandages also).  It also goes great in tea for a strong floral flavor.  The only cons might be the expense, but if you use it sparingly it will last quite a while.  I also noticed that some batches are more "watery" than others but didn't associate that with any differences in taste or quality.

review/summary: So far So good!
review/text: I ordered the Manuka Honey after a lot of research to find if it actually can help with stomach problems.  After reading a few news articles etc... it seems this stuff can really work, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I've tried all the doctor's ideas, and it was time for my own.<br />I'm a tad disappointed that it is a plastic container, as we try to avoid plastic packaging.  Unlike others stated, our top was closed and everything was all sealed up tight!<br />As stated by a few others, this honey is not for the light hearted! it won't be like the honey you get in the squeezy bottle with the cute picture of a bee on it.  I'd assume if you are purchasing this, you are for the same reasons as most (medical reasons).  So, no, it is not the best tasting honey I've ever had.  In fact, it is hard for me to get down. It is VERY strong, sweet and THICK!  I've bought regular organic, raw honey before and this is WAY stronger! I don't think taste should be a deciding factor if you are buying it for medical reasons.<br />So far, I am noticing a few changes in my stomach problems for the better!  I am very hopeful these will continue to get better as I increase the intake.  This is how I am taking it. I did not find any directions ON the bottle. I hope this is helpful:<br />How is Active Manuka Honey taken for acid reflux, heart burn, up-set stomach stomach ulcer, gastritis, duodenal ulcer, IBS (irritable bowel syndrome)? Active Manuka Honey is especially useful for an upset GI Tract, because a 5% concentration of this honey has shown to destroy helicobacter pylori, the bacteria that causes most stomach ulcers. Active Manuka Honey also seems to destroy a range of bacteria associated with gastroenteritis and diarrhea. Take one teaspoon of Active Manuka Honey and put it on a square inch size bread, or toast, bagel, cracker or a slice of banana, and take it 20 min. before meals to coat out the gastro intestinal tract. Do not drink anything right after Manuka Honey intake, in order to keep the honey as concentrated as possible. You can take a 4th teaspoon before retiring for the day and still brush your teeth after that.

review/summary: Using for acne, so far so good!
review/text: I am a 27 year old who has dealt with acne since I was 12. I went through my teen years thinking, this will end soon! Well, it never went away... As you can imagine, I've tried everything (except Accutane-didn't want to put that in my body!), from  prescription pills to creams. The thing that has worked the best for me is the Clinique Acne Solutions line. I still break out, but my skin is much better. Then my sister told me about Manuka Honey, she said it's been helping her Rosacea. So I gave it a go. Been using it twice a week for three weeks (I do a scrub then put this on for 1/2hr). My skin is definitely better. The acne is not as inflamed-this seems to calm it down. Also, my skin in general looks better. I will definitely keep using this, way cheaper than a lot of treatments, and I'd rather use honey than chemicals.

review/summary: Tastes like other unpasteurized honey, but far more expensive
review/text: The honey tastes great, but I don't notice any of the "medicine-y" smells or tastes that others on here claim to experience. It tastes like regular high-grade honey. I will be switching to another brand since this manufacturer uses their own independent anti-bacterial rating system. Unfortunately, corporations cannot be trusted to monitor themselves, as anyone who has spent money on worthless products can testify.<br /><br />I have not noticed any miraculous health benefits from this honey either. It is just very expensive high-quality honey. I will be checking my local coop for an alternate brand now that I am at least aware of Manuka honey. I plan on trying one that is using the standard UMF rating. Even the MGO rating is not trustworthy, since it is done by an industry trade group, which is funded by the corporations who use its services.<br /><br />Don't just read labels - research labels!<br /><br />I downgraded the star rating due to the high cost and the company using their own non-standard rating system.  The taste is 5 star, just don't expect to be cured of any ailments because you are paying more for this brand compared to another.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff!
review/text: I received this honey recently, and love it so much that I am back to see if I can get it in a larger amount!  So I thought I'd also leave a review.  I have already used this manuka honey as a facial treatment with great success - smoother, brighter looking skin with rapidly healing/shrinking blemishes, wrinkle reduction, and - I'm thrilled to say - smaller pores.  I have been adding it to tea because I had a nasty cold or sinus infection this week, and I feel much better now.  The honey seemed very soothing to my throat and tasted great!  I just finished a bit of plain greek yogurt with a small scoop of this honey on top, and it was delicious!  I'm also hoping it will help with some chronic stomach problems, but I think it's too soon to say.  I wish I could get manuka honey at my local farmer's market (yes, I realize this is from New Zealand), but since I can't I will be ordering this exact kind again on Amazon!

review/summary: Beware allergic reactions
review/text: I would advise anyone interested in using this for wound healing to do a test patch on a healthy piece of skin first. I didn't think to do so. Who would imagine one would have an allergic reaction to something that, in general, should help fight against allergies and many people report using as a face wash? Unfortunately I broke out in a terrible rash around the wound area and needed Diphenhydramine cream to make it go away. Luckily before the rash incident I did try having some of the honey in tea. Although it has a band-aid smell it tasted fine and didn't do anything strange to me. I regret buying it at the high price but hopefully I'll be able to put it to good use as a tea sweetner if nothing else.

I had been eating the Y.S. raw honey, and loving it, but after reading about the health benefits of Manuka honey, thought I should try it. Wish I would have saved my money. It just doesn't taste right to me--almost has a funny aftertaste to it--like plastic or something, which in my book, shouldn't be there. In fairness, I had my cousin taste it and she thought it was delicious...maybe I just don't have discerning taste buds. I will gladly pass this expensive jar of honey on to her...

review/summary: ACNE Cure? Sadly not
review/text: I stumbled upon the benefits of Mauka Honey while researching methods of treating the acne I have suffered from for 20 years. Testimonial after Testimonial claimed an almost miraculous reaction to this honey. I tried using it as both a wash and mask. Within 24 hours, I had numerous white heads all over my face. 24 hours after that, I had giant red, painful cysts forming under my skin. I thought perhaps this was just some initial purging so kept at it for two week, but it only got worse and worse. After stopping it, my skin started to clear up.<br /><br />The honey itself is sweet and tastes great. Although I broke out significantly, the parts of my face that remained clear do feel smoother, so I suppose for anyone who does not suffer from acne, it might be a nice skin care product. For anyone else, use great caution.

review/summary: Not UMF/MGO - Ok tasting Manuka Honey
review/text: I decided to give Wedderspoon a try because of its price - much cheaper per ounce compare to East Cape, Manuka Health and Comvita, and the large volume of reviews, which all seem to indicate that the honey is good.<br /><br />Well, in my personal opinion, it is an above average Manuka Honey. Bio Active isn't the same as UMF/MGO, so minus a star there. Medical effects are not apparent for me, I guess that's expected given it is not UMF/MGO, taste is just ok, not impressed compare to the others I've tried, so minus 2 more stars.<br /><br />I always buy UMF/MGO Manuka honey, if you are looking for premium medical grade honey, I recommend East Cape, Manuka Health or Comvita. IMO, East Cape is the best tasting, Comvita is a big Manuka Honey producer and their products can be found in supermarkets in Australia and New Zealand. Comvita was also the first UMF honey my friend brought to me from Australia.<br /><br />Depending on what do you need the honey for, if you need it as day to day healthier alternative over mediocre organic honey , then this might be good for you. I will not recommend Wedderspoon for those who need it for medical reasons.

review/summary: LOL - at myself
review/text: I knew nothing about Manuka honey but wanted to see what it would do about a burn on my hand so I bought a jar from Whole Foods that had no name on the label but on the side it said "packed by Arataki for Pacific Resources International." It did improve my burn very much and I was sold! So I read up about Manuka honey and went and bought Wedderspoon 16+. It was LESS effective than the non-name 5+ jar. However, then I tried some local raw wildflower honey and it was just as effective as the 5+, and tasted better, and was a lot cheaper...<br /><br />The NIH tested four types of raw honey. They found that Manuka did have a higher level of antibacterial properties, but it was not as high as something called mountain honey. They didn't specify which mountain and also didn't indicate the level of Manuka. Also, ALL honey clears skin blemishes. Manuka may be better for internal problems as stated - I don't know about that - but I'm sticking with the local raw stuff for $10 a jar. I think wildflower honey is the best because who knows where the manuka bees go anyway? They probably go all over the place unless they are confined.<br /><br />Also, the UMF stands for "Unique Manuka Factor" ??? Seriously?? Why is it that they have a scientific explanation for the benefits of other honeys but not for the "special" benefits of manuka? Maybe the anti bacterial effects don't break down but then why not just go with local honey? What's so difficult about doing a chemical analysis of manuka against other honeys and finding the difference?<br /><br />So I say that if you have money to burn, definitely support your favorite New Zealand honey farmer! Why not? Otherwise you can find a better deal LOL!

review/summary: Excellent for H. Pylori infections!
review/text: This product was first mentioned to me by a relative earlier this year as I was having stomach aches, nausea, constant burping, etc. However, I figured what could honey really do? I went to the gastroenterologist and was diagnosed with H. Pylori and was subsequently given the 7 day course of strong antibiotics which cost a bomb! However, it seemed to do the trick and I was "healed." Or so I thought.<br /><br />A few months later, I started getting the same symptoms of a light stomach ache, nausea, constant burping, etc. again. But I am now traveling so I can't see my specialist back home. I then remembered my relative's mention of Manuka honey for stomach problems, and so did some research on it on the internet. I was so surprised to see that Manuka honey is claimed to kill the H. Pylori bacteria in the stomach, so ok, I gave it a try. Whole Foods had run out of the 16+ Manuka factor which was highly recommended for H. Pylori infections, so I bought a bottle of the 12+ instead. After a couple of days, I started to feel much better, but it had not gone away even after a week. I then went back to Whole Foods and finally they had re-stocked the 16+ Manuka honey. I started taking a teaspoon 20 minutes before meals and before bed, and within 2-3 days I felt so much better. After 1-2 weeks of taking it, I don't feel the stomach aches anymore.....perhaps just the feeling of the infected lining of my stomach healing. I'm now feeling much better day by day, and can actually work out normally at the gym again. No more frequent burping, no more nausea.<br /><br />I'm amazed, but it actually works, and I'll be taking this manuka honey for general maintenance once I am fully back to normal health....and with no antibiotics! Will have to cut down the amount though as the sugar is a bit of a concern. What's more, it tastes yummy.

review/summary: This is the most amazing honey I've ever had the pleasure of eating!
review/text: I just recently (this year) started getting serious with honey. I knew there was better honey out there than the store bought stuff, and even the stuff you get on the side of the road (which is still good, mind you), but after a little research, I came across Wedderspoon....and wow.<br /><br />What's really amazing about this stuff (I've purchased a few jars now), is that each batch does taste slightly different. It just goes to show the true natural and raw quality that is involved here. The taste is heavenly, to say the least.<br /><br />After my research, and personal experience, I'm convinced that good honey can cure just about anything that gets thrown your way. Make it a part of your daily routine (I sweeten green tea with it, and take a teaspoon before each meal), and you'll realize a plethora of benefits. It's hard to explain until you do it yourself.<br /><br />Buy this stuff, and don't look back - you'll never buy "regular" honey again. It's that damn good!

review/summary: Poor Packaging
review/text: Like several other reviews, the honey was received with its cap off and hanging by the paper seal, and the jar empty.  It is not the fault of Amazon who has indicated they will give me a refund but Wedderspoon itself.  There is no inner seal on the jar, and the outer closure is not firm, and easy to pull off.  This is not adequate packaging for a food product either as it is easy to pull off the cap, tamper with the contents and replace the cap.

review/summary: Very Impressed!
review/text: I was at wits end with my chronic gastritis.  I had been to several doctor's and had an endoscopy to find I had h. pylori and gastritis.  The specialist put me on PPI's (proton pump inhibitors) which made me feel worse.  They also put me on several antibiotics which made me sick and caused my candida to get out of control.  After second dose of antibiotics I felt a little better but then back again.  Doctor suggested another endoscopy which I refused and decided to go online and see what I could do naturally.  I found Manuka honey which was over $100 a bottle and decided to look it up on Amazon as I have bought several items  here that retailed well over $100 and found them here for a fraction of the price.  I came across Wedderspoon Manuka honey and read alot of the reviews.  While waiting for my honey to arrive I got 2nd degree burns on my arm and chest from boiling soup.  I thought, gee, let's try the honey on the burns too since many of the reviews said it was great for burns.  I must say my burns are healing beautifully from this honey and much better than any of the other ointments I was using.  My stomach is gradually getting better and I dont have that sick gnawing feeling in the pit of my stomach.  I contacted the Wedderspoon company and was told that it can take a few months to rid myself of the h. pylori but even the antibiotics can take that long yet cause other problems.  I just ordered my second jar and love the taste.  I actually cannot wait to eat it.  My mom also was suffering from allergies and took a teaspoonful a day and saw quick results.<br /><br />I am hoping this is the answer to my digestive problems.  It has been a long hard road to find something that will actually cure this.  I am optimistic that Manuka honey is my answer.  I have to say alot of the reviews I read helped me make the decision to buy this great product and I hope to leave another review when I am totally healed.<br /><br />One last note..........I was very impressed with the fast delivery and packaging was great.  I know some left bad reviews due to poor packaging but I am sure the company saw this and made some changes as both my jars were in perfect condition and arrived quickly and safely.

review/summary: Package problem has been solved!
review/text: I got this honey for the health benefits.  I was worried about the packaging issue discussed in several reviews.  This problem has been solved!  The plastic lid was attached to a base piece of plastic, and the whole jar was tightly wrapped in bubble wrap.

review/summary: Really Quite Something!!
review/text: I stumbled onto Manuka Honey last year and I was really blown away by all of the claims that were being made about this honey. My family eats a lot of honey and we have really made serious changes to our diets in recent years. We no longer eat processed food, get all of our meats & produce from organic CSA farms and we are constantly on the look out for ways to further improve our diets. After reading about Manuka Honey, I simply had to give it a try. The brand I ordered was Wedderspoon Active 16+.<br /><br />To say that I was impressed is an understatement as the flavor is absolutely to die for. It has a very unique taste. To be honest, its the best honey I have ever had. I am a yogurt junkie and started making homemade yogurt a couple years back. Sprinkling some Manuka Honey over homemade yogurt is simple amazing. Its hands down the best yogurt topping I have ever tried and I have tried almost everything. The unique taste of Manuka honey blends perfectly with yogurt. Throw some granola in there and again its absolutely to die for. One of the other things I use it for regularly is on toast. We buy fresh bread every other day from our local bakery and Manuka Honey on fresh toasted bread is just as amazing as the yogurt.<br /><br />As for its antibacterial claims, its absolutely 100% true. My wife has a very mild case of eczema but a couple times a year it acts up and can get pretty bad. The episodes usually last a week or two. She literally has like 10+ different kinds of hand lotion specifically aimed at treating Eczema. When I first told her about Manuka Honey she was extremely skeptical, in regards to what it could do for her skin, but since we already had some she said she would give it a try. Sure enough like 6 weeks later her Eczema stated acting up, mostly on her hands. Before she went to bed She applied a very light coating over the affected areas and then put on a pair of my Light Impressions cotton gloves. I use the gloves when matting or handling my photography prints. They are extremely light and are made of 100% cotton. It only took 2 nights of this and her hands were back to normal. She was absolutely BLOWN AWAY. To give you an idea of just how impressed she was, she wound up ordered 6 more bottles that same week. Since then she has had multiple outbreaks and each and every time she uses the Manuka Honey. Her collection of hand lotions are doing nothing but collecting dust.<br /><br />Bottom line - Manuka Honey is good for you, tastes great and it has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral properties. Its like liquid gold. It now has a permanent spot on our shelves. Yes, it is more expensive than regular honey but this is one of the cases where you get what you pay for. Its absolutely worth every last penny. This is one train you want to get on.<br /><br />5 Stars and then some!!

review/summary: unusual taste but I loved it
review/text: I expected a very strong taste from this honey, and it didn't disappoint.  I actually love the taste and the texture a lot.  Plus, I had a chance to test the healing properties, when a particularly nasty papercut had continued to bother me for a couple of weeks.  A couple of applications of this honey took care of it in two days.  The cut healed beautifully.<br />The reason I am giving it four stars and not five is because of the way it is packed.  The jar could actually be seen between the folds of the cardboard it was delivered in.

review/summary: Great Honey, Great Deal from Amazon
review/text: I tried this honey after having stomach problems for several years. It happened every "change of season". I researched it, and Manuka Honey seemed to be benificial for treating pylori bacillus, which can cause stomach ulcers.<br />After taking a few tablespoons a day for about a week,--- no more discomfort which continues to this day. Manuka honey is also a natural antibiotic. Skin sores heal quickly. The Active 16+ seems to be the right strength for it's antibiotic properties. I feel a higher activity level would be a waste of money.<br />Both my husband and I, take a teaspoon before bedtime. He claims it makes for a more restful sleep.<br />Amazon's subscription feature is awesome. The rebate and free shipping for using this option, can't be beat. You can adjust your order as needed from month to month.<br />I would highly recommend this product and the subscription feature as well.<br />Terry Mare

review/summary: Acid Reflux under control
review/text: I started using Manuka Honey to see if I could finally get off Prilosec that I have been taking everyday for 8-9 months now for acid reflux.  Everytime I would stop taking it the heartburn would come back within 24 hours.  It didn't matter what I ate it would just come back, so I tried Manuka Honey (1 teaspoon in the morning) .  I have been Prilosec free for 2 weeks now and the only other thing I do is take a table spoon of a fiber supplement (Citrucel) also in the morning. I have been taking Manuka honey for about 1 1/2 months.  No heartburn, no pills for 2 weeks now and I eat whatever the hell I want.  Coincidence? Hum.......

review/summary: Believe it or Not
review/text: Our son had a cough for over a month and he tried antibiotics and other cough medicine but nothing worked. When he was visiting us recently I asked him to try Wederspoon 16+ which I had just received from Amazon. After he took 1 teaspoon of this honey, 90% of the cough was gone within 2 hours and the remaining 10% the next day.  He was so impressed with this honey that he took the 17.6 Oz jar with him.  BTW, exactly the same situation occurred with our younger son who lives in a different city. I strongly recommend that you always keep a jar handy at home.

review/summary: No need medicine anymore for my stomachache just use the Manuka Honey
review/text: I had the stomachache many times in my life and notice when I get older it last longer, I am 34 yrs.  Recently I had the stomachache again I took Nexium 40 mg 2 times a day then switch to 1 time a day and 1 Miracid which is also same benefit like Nexium but I just don't want to take high dose of Nexium. I took medicine for about 2 months but I still have the pain which most of time is at night. One day while I was searching about natural acne cure and someone recommended using honey and they said manuka honey is even better. I've never heard about this manuka honey before and started to do some research over the internet and found many interesting information especially helping about stomachache.  So I decided to try, first time I bought it at Whole Foods Markets and chose this Wedderspoon brand after doing some researched. It took me about 5 days then I saw some improvement I didn't have much pain at night time. Then I started to stop the medicine and taking only manukar honey the tip is, I took 1 teasppon x 4 times a day because in that time I still have lots of pain and with some small piece of bread about size of 1 inch, so it can hold better in my stomach and did like the suggestion no drink or food after take honey about 15 min.  By keep doing this about 3rd week, my problem is completely cured. Nowadays, I do the maintenance by taking 1 teaspoon a day or anytime if I eat some spicy food then I feel some symptom come up I took it right away and that's it, no more medicine for me. However, for some other people you may have it as the 2nd help together with medicine which that was I did in 1st week and after it cure then I am ok with just this honey alone. And I found that buy it from amazon the price is much better, I hope they have some special offer if buy more quantity then get better price because I want to pack a lot of them when I go back to my country.

review/summary: Never go back to regular honey again!
review/text: This honey is wonderful for regular uses, it's thickness and wonderful flavor make things like simple toast and teas better!  But this stuff works wonders when I feel cold/flu symptoms come on!  I take a spoonful everyday for 3-4 days and have avoided getting sick this season.  It also works wonders on cold sores.  I am prone to cold sores when I get sick, and medications such as Abreva have done nothing for me.  A little dab of honey on the tingling area overnight zaps any chance of a cold sore appearing.  This is a wonderful product, I ordered a dozen jars when it was $22 and gave some to my mother who is also always on the lookout for natural remedies.  I can't say enough about this stuff...
