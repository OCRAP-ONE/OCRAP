review/summary: Good Product from a Great Company
review/text: I am a big fan of Bob's Red Mill products, which encouraged me to purchase these cranberries. While the price is a little high, they make themselves up in terms of quality.<br /><br />I enjoy putting these in my cereals, just munching on a few here and there as a snack, and they really shine in baking for thing like muffins and breads. They taste really good are aren't too 'tart', and are an healthy alternative snack compared to all the other junk food out there.<br /><br />One thing i'd like to point out, is that they are a little on the high side in terms of sugar with 26g per serving, and that sugar is added to these. However, this step is necessary with cranberries, if you have ever eaten a raw cranberry you know what i mean, they are extremely tart! So i think Bob's red mill did a good job to balance taste and tartness, unfortunately to get any good taste out of a cranberry you must add a decent amount of sugar. I personally would prefer them with less sugar, but alot others probably would complain about being too sour if they put less in.<br /><br />Also, you can soak these in water for a few minutes which will plump them up a little before baking with them, as they do come only slightly moist from the added sugar (they probably dry them out completely, and then add sugar water). Don't expect them to get too much bigger though.<br /><br />All in all, good product, 4 stars.

review/summary: Crystal Noodle soups kick @ss!
review/text: I discovered these soups during a camping trip at the end of the summer and have been eating them for lunch on most week days. I love their taste and the portion size. They make for a rather affordable, tasty, filling lunch or snack with under 300 calories. I only wish the packaging was smaller (less wrapping to dispose of) and the soups were more readily available locally but I will survive by ordering them online... Give these little crystal gems a try and you may just find yourself hooked!

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Fish, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. At least the first ingredient is fish, but I find it odd that its not "salmon" or "tuna" just "fish". If they were using quality fish, they wouldn't have to hide behind an ambiguous label. Also, the rest of the ingredient are disgusting! There are many by-products in this food. By-products are not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure, meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (not vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods.

review/summary: Not great, but not bad either.
review/text: I like these well enough.  I like the flavor and enjoy them when I have them.  The only problem I have with them are the thick, larger pieces are not very good and way too hard to chew.  I like the skinny, smaller pieces a lot better and wish they'd all be small and thin instead of thick and hard.  The other problem I have is the slight plastic-y taste they seem to have every time you start a new piece.<br /><br />If each piece was thin and there was NO plastic-y taste whatsoever, I'd give these a FIVE.<br /><br />Otherwise, they are not terrible as I do enjoy them once in a while, but I can't say I love them.

I had no prior experience with black garlic and wanted to try it out myself.  I made a few dishes with it and discovered that I'm not a fan of black garlic.  That being said, the garlic was exactly what it was advertised to be.  If you're in the market for it, this bag is a decent value for what you get.  I would recommend having an idea of whether or not you actually like the stuff as this amount of garlic goes quite far.

review/summary: THANK YOU, Natural Balance, for giving my dog more options!
review/text: My 3-yo Shih Tzu has had tummy problems for most of the 2+ years since I adopted her.  She had an ongoing vomiting/acid tummy spit-up problem that completely ruined the carpets in my home.  The vet was helpful in some respects (indicating that it was probably an allergy to the food she was eating, even though it was very high-quality food); but it was a neighbor who had been through the same thing with her now-older Border Collie when he was young that really got me on the right path.<br /><br />What is that right path?  Natural Balance products.  Missy now eats the Natural Balance Vegetarian dry food because it is one of their allergy products and I just recently started supplementing the dry food with this Duck and Potato Formula Dog Treat Roll.  It is intended to be used as a treat during training and I'm sure we'll get to that eventually but, for right now, it is the "icing on the cake" to motivate Missy to eat her food.  I cut one small slice off the roll and then cube it very small and mix it in with her food--she goes BONKERS for it (if I wasn't sick with the flu right now, I'd have done a video of her reaction!).<br /><br />The roll comes in at least two sizes that my pet food store carries--this wonderful little 8-oz roll and its much bigger cousin.  I am averse to the smell and look of canned dog food, so I avoid it except when it has been necessary for Missy to have prescription food when she's been sick.  What I loved about this roll is that it really doesn't look or smell like dog food at all!  It smells sort of like duck jerky and looks and has the texture of a firm salami.  It is firm enough to slice and dice VERY easily.<br /><br />Most importantly, my dog LOVES it and ever since I started mixing it into her food, my picky eater who just grazed the top layer off her food to get whatever special stuff was on top is now snarfing down the bowl and leaving very little!<br /><br />I got all new flooring in my home last month and Missy is a changed dog.  Thank you, Natural Balance, for realizing that not every dog can eat chicken and beef and that some dogs have tummy or allergy problems requiring other options!

review/summary: Our dog loves these and so do we!
review/text: Our dog Chalcy LOVES these!<br /><br />What I do is, I slice the whole roll into pieces that are about 1/2 cm. thick, and I refrigerate them.  Then, when we want our dog to practice tricks, we pull out one of the slices and break it into 4-5 little treats.  She is a Great Dane, so the treat pieces are pretty tiny for her, but she will do anything we ask when she knows she could get a piece of this stuff.  It really catches her attention.<br /><br />Not only does Chalcy like these, WE like them too!<br /><br />We think our dog probably has a food allergy, so right now she's on a wheat-free corn-free diet.  It's tough to find treats that are okay for her, and most of them are really expensive.  This stuff has a pretty clean ingredient list, AND it isn't too expensive.  So, I'm glad she likes this stuff.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone with a dog on a limited ingredient diet, or, really, just anyone with a dog.

review/summary: good packaged blueberry muffins
review/text: I make a coffeecake with two boxes at a time and add more dried wild blueberries and lots of pieces of pecans.  They are delicious.  Even without the extras, they are good; and one of the only boxed mixes with mostly winter white whole wheat, so they aren't real dark and scary looking to the uninitiated whole grainers.  I also use the water from the canned blueberries for the water required in the recipe (note: they use water and not syrup to can the berries-cuts down on the sugar content). The batter looks kind of blue, but after it bakes, it's hardly noticeable. If you leave off the streusel topping it also cuts the sugar content. Duncan Hines is trying-try it.

review/summary: Easy to Make, Tastes Good, Doesn't Keep Well
review/text: I love blueberry muffins, but hate how most mixes on the market contain artificial flavors, and sometimes even artificial blueberries!  Yuck!  So I was thrilled to see that not only does this muffin mix contain all natural ingredients, but it actually comes with a can of blueberries.  Nice!<br /><br />These muffins are really easy to make.  I made 12 medium muffins and each one had a nice amount of crumble topping.  They bake up nicely, just watch them so they don't burn, and you'll have perfectly done muffins.<br /><br />I use unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil to cut down on fat, and they're just as moist and hold together just fine with that method.<br /><br />The muffins are sweet and moist, and have a nice amount of real blueberries.  So tasty!<br /><br />The only bad part about these is they simply don't keep that long.  After a couple of days they take on an odd taste (I stored mine in a glass container) and the topping got really soggy.  I tried refrigerating a couple, and that made it much worse, really changed the taste to the point it was almost unpalatable.  They got soggy and gooey, and really not that appetizing.  If you plan to make these, I highly recommend choosing  time when you know they'll all get consumed within about 2 days or they'll not be nearly as good.<br /><br />All in all, a great muffin mix, as long as you won't have leftover muffins for very long.

review/text: I saw an earlier ad today from this seller "Daily Market"  offering King Arthur Bread flour in a 41 lb bag for $15.70.  I was sort of suspicious about this because I've NEVER seen KAF bread flour in anything more than a 5lb bag.<br /><br />So I contacted King Arthur flour Co. about this, basically what they indicated is that their bread flour is available in various combinations of 5 lb bags, but if it is a 40 lb, it is NOT legitimate, as KAF does NOT package their bread flour in anything larger than 5 lb bags.

review/summary: below expectation
review/text: Over the years I have tasted dozens of balsamic vinagars. In general, the better products cost more but at any price level there can be considerable variation.  At this price, I expected much better. This vinager is thin and lacking body. It has a band almost insipid taste that is lost in every dish. Expect to use twice as much as you normally do to preserve any distinctive taste. You should be able to get a similar product at half the cost.

review/text: I bought this along with an oil & vinegar pour for a small Valentines Day present for my boyfriend. He is a great cook and likes to whip up a light appetizer to tide us over when dinner is cooking.<br /><br />I was very happy with the purchase. The vinegar has a nice slightly sweet tang, and goes perfect with a good olive oil and french bread. This doesn't have an overly acidic vinegary taste like some cheaper balsamics might. He was wonderfully surprised and I will be adding this to my shopping list again.

review/summary: Even my husband could taste the difference!
review/text: Decided I would try a more expensive balsamic vinegar to see if all were "created equal".<br />I make a side dish regularly for my family....saute' fresh brussel sprouts in garlic and olive oil until soft...then pour balsamic vinegar on them and serve hot or cooled.  The last time I made them I used this vinegar -- but did NOT tell family they were eating a more expensive balsamic vinegar.  My husband (who is the LEAST picky person I've ever met) said at the dinner table while eating the sprouts - "wow, I really like these sprouts this time.  They taste so much better, what did you do different. "  I took great pleasure in telling him it was because he was eating them with expensive balsamic vinegar!  He usually takes pride in the fact he doesn't care and can't tell the difference between poor quality or good quality things!  How sad for him to realize he just gave me the "approval" to buy expensive vinegar! I figure if he can tell the difference -- then it certainly is a great product!

review/summary: The Most Delicious Lobsters In The World
review/text: In my humble opinion, Maine lobsters taste better and have more meat than any other lobsters in the world. The title "Alive Maine Lobsters" is not quite accurate, because catches can be in the coastal area from North Carolina to Nova Scotia. My father placed an order with Hancock Gourmet Lobster Company for me and they were delivered at 6:18 am on Dec. 24th.  The lobsters were alive, healthy, and ready to cook.  I got a pot of water boiling and my wife walked into the kitchen to see what I was doing.  She got mad and wouldn't let me put them in the pot.  I had to buy a salt water aquarium for them and now they are my new pets.

review/summary: Bait & Switch tactics by 1-800-Flowers
review/text: Below is a note that I sent to 1-800-Flowers regarding a recent order that I made on their website (through Amazon).  1-800-Flowers first presents you with a reasonably priced item for sale, then they slap you at the end with a last minute service fee that is equvalent to 1/3 the cost of the item.  This is just plain wrong.  If I did not need the item, I would have gone to their competitors.  My issue is not with the product, but with the business practice.  You be the judge:<br /><br />Good Day,<br />I just placed an order with your company, the confirmation number is attached.  My reason for contacting you is to raise my displeasure with the pricing.  As you can see from the details below, the "service charge" is 1/3 of the cost of the item that was ordered (there was no previous mention of a $20 service fee).  I do not see why you believe that this type of "bait and switch" online tactic wins repeat business (I am assuming that you are competing for loyal customers).  If you are going to sell reasonably priced items, you should not surprise the customer at checkout with excessive fees.  These actions only reduce the value of the product and of the service in the customer's opinion.

review/text: I have used this company before and was satisfied with previous assortments they sent. I was a little disappointed this time, however, with the arrangement sent. The roses seem nice but they didn't put any gypsophila in so they looked plain. Just the green leaves of the roses and then the roses themselves. For a deployed soldier sending his wife a little token to remind her she is loved, this missed the mark in my book.

review/summary: Organic, yes.  Healthy, not so sure.
review/text: I was just starting to think about healthy foods, granola, etc, and this came up as a good deal.  If you are thinking about adding or switching to granola, this has a great taste!  Who doesn't like sugary maple?!?!?  This was great!  I was eating granola, it didn't taste like cardboard, I can eat healthy has it's not so bad!  Well, I have one of those Weight Watcher cards from a few years back *ahem* and I calculated that 3/4 cup of this is 4 points.  3/4 cup isn't so much, but it's fine since this is granola, for me, it took a lot longer to chew so I was satisfied.  The 2 other reviews says it's healthy...yes, probably healthier than Frosted Flakes or Froot Loops, I suppose.  The box doesn't even claim "healthy", just "organic".  So be careful if you are looking for "healthy" too.<br /><br />A week later, I bought Fiber One Caramel Delight and for 1 cup, it was only 2 points and the flavor was GOOD!  So, if you are looking for good flavored granola only, I'd recommend this.  If you are looking to eat more healthy, try the Fiber One Caramel Delight first, I'm going to review that for 5 stars.<br /><br />FYI - I paid $12.20 (with subscribe and save) for a pack of 5.  I like to post what I paid to help others in their decision at the time of purchase since prices change so frequently here.

review/summary: Yummy Granola Cereal!
review/text: I have tasted a lot of granola cereals in my life, but this is quite possibly the best.  It has a very pleasing taste and is not too crunchy.  No cholesterol, 6 grams fat (1 gram saturated), 110 mg sodium, and has 3 grams dietary fiber.  There are 230 calories per serving, so a bit more caloric intake compared to a "regular" breakfast cereal.  Whole grain oats is the primary ingredient, followed by sugar.<br /><br />These make a great breakfast cereal, especially topped with a friut treat, or alternatively, a very good dry snack can be made by mixing in some nuts, dried fruit, raisins, etc.  In either case, the rolled oats are exceptionally tasty, and this will likely become a favorite.<br /><br />By buying a case of 6 boxes, the price savings are significant.<br /><br />kone

review/text: I've always had a thing to foods that bring a burning sensation to my tongue, and when I was given a bottle of this as a Christmas gift, I had finally met my match. Not knowing the potential of this sauce, I eagerly downed a cap-full of the sauce to see how it tasted. Mouth-burning, forehead sweating, runny nose, and teary eyes ensued. Holy cow was I surprised at how damn hot this stuff is. And since then I have been hooked.<br /><br />Just a forewarning to any that decide to use this stuff: when I make chili dogs using this stuff, half a cap-full is more than enough to get your mouth burning. I got my first bottle in Christmas of 2007 and I finally ran out around June of 2008. It's well worth the price since a little bit is all that is needed to tease your stomach with an ulcer.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Favorite for years
review/text: UPDATE: Received and have ground, brewed and drank this several days now. We tasted NO difference in this bag from our years of drinking Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. It is up to our standards for daily brew.<br /><br />We had been buying from this roaster direct, but the savings thru Amazon on shipping are significant, doubly more if you set up the subscription. I'm left wondering is this batch is what the roaster would consider less than their freshest/premium because passed a certain number of days. Most of the roast date label (see below) was torn off this package. As mentioned in my review of their Decaf Espresso, I the label should be intact. On the buyer side, no one should assume you will get the absolute freshest roasted coffee via a longer supply chain and at a significant discount. (But that too could change soon.) It looks like the bag I received was roasted in 2011 since the only remaining digit is a 1 at the far right.<br />=============<br />We have been drinking Ethiopian Yirgacheffe for many years. Most recently buying 5 lb Whole Bean from Coffee Bean Direct and prior to that from a roaster out of Texas. Our tastes greatly prefer the African coffees, including Kenya AA, over the South and Central American and we like the medium roast which maintains the nuanced flavor. (Needless to say, I'm not a fan of "Charbucks" :-)<br /><br />I'm going to try adding this subscription to our others as it allows ordering the coffee in single bags while keeping the postage under control. NOTE: The coffee we have purchased DIRECTLY from Coffee Bean Direct has a label on the bag indicating the roasting date. I just checked an empty one and it shows 34310, meaning the 343rd day of 2010. That's early December if my math is correct. I will check the bag I receive via Amazon to see how old it is when it arrives. Normally the coffee is in our hands within 7-10 days of the roast date.<br /><br />For us, treating the roasted beans like the perishable item they are maintains the flavor to the end of the bag. Here are the steps I take:<br /><br />When the bags arrive (not just Coffee Bean Direct, this includes other roasters sending whole beans) they are not evacuated like you see with some of smaller the European ground coffee packs. Maybe the one-way valve ISN'T so one-way or they just don't go through the necessary steps :-)<br /><br />Before it goes in the freezer I evacuate the bag with one of the hand held vacuums that has a high level vacuum. (It is a Shark brand and while mediocre as a cleaning vacuum it is killer to evacuate these bags. It turns them into a solid brick AND the room smells like fresh roasted coffee!) After evacuating I put a piece of shipping tape over the one-way valve to keep air from leaking in. The bag stays evacuated until opened, several months in one case. Bags are stored in a deep freeze that has to run a defrost cycle very rarely.<br /><br />When needed we refill a sealed ceramic canister with enough frozen beans for several days drinking. We do our grinding prior to each brew.

review/summary: One of the best bag of beans
review/text: After being in Eastern Africa and having Ethiopian coffee, then going back to the USA it was pretty hard to find beans from Ethiopa.  I know Starjerks and some other have them and mix them into blends but not as good as getting them direct.  I took a chance on thse beans, and it was a good bet.  Grinding the beans has a wonderful aroma, and the taste is just the way I like it.  The coffee comes out dark and heavy, and in the light it has a oilly look to the coffee.  Just the way I like it.  I have shared the beans with others and have been a hit.  I will definatly get more.

review/summary: Distinctive Brew at a Good Price Point
review/text: Nice consistent beans, and a perfect medium-light roast for a smooth, flavorful everyday drip at a good price. Neither oily nor burnt, so nutty North African flavor comes through. I occasionally blend with a darker roast and use French press for a nice cup with or after dinner. I just re-ordered 5lbs.

review/summary: A very good coffee at a great price
review/text: I like many coffees, but I am particularly drawn to African brews. Coffee Bean Direct Ethiopian Yirgacheffe in the 5 pound bag beats any price I could find. This coffee has the characteristic fruitiness of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. I like coffee strong and freshly brewed. This coffee is best prepared in small amounts in a press. It loses much of its appeal after 15-30 minutes "cooking" in a coffee pot. I found that it takes about 20% more than I typically use when brewing in a standard coffee pot to produce the strength that I like. Not the absolute best coffee, but well-worth the price. It keeps well when sealed and frozen.

review/text: I have purchased this coffee previously and found it to be very good.... just what I was looking for.  I recently ordered more and the two batches were worlds apart.  This last batch was roasted a long time ago, it seems.  I've ordered a lot of the Coffee Bean Direct selections and had only good experiences.  However, this batch was OLD.  Either I've been lucky with all previous orders or this is the rare instance where the coffee was not as advertised.  As a "coffee nerd", I know old coffee when I see/taste it, and this stuff was old and brittle.  I hand grind with a ceramic burr type grinder.  This batch was old.  Buyer beware!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWHATY">Coffee Bean Direct Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I have researched the different coffee blends available and chose this one and I like to grind the beans just before I make coffee or grind some for the week, delicious.  Everyone has their own idea of great coffee, this is the one I chose.  I invite anyone wanting to try the gourmet coffee to read all about the different countries coffee beans and determine what is best for you.  By small quantity first and if it's the one, treat yourself to a larger amount.  I suggest the bean, so you will want a good electric grinder.<br /><br />What is really great is  my family buys with confidence from Amazon.  Just about everything we need we purchase from or through Amazon, with the certainty we will be pleased with what we purchase.  Johnnie

review/summary: Did I get a bad batch??
review/text: Received my 5 lb. bag of beans and immediately used my hand-grind coffee mill to get some beans ready to brew.  First impression was lack-luster, weak aroma of ground beans.  The resulting coffee was very disappointing--flat tasting, high acid and astringent to the palate.  This coffee actually left my stomach upset.  If you like the low-quality, rancid tasting coffee they serve at "greasy spoon" restaurants, you'll love these Ethiopean beans. I've been a customer of Coffee Beans Direct for several years and I've never had such poor quaility beans from them.  Cancelling my subscription now.  Does Goodwill take coffee bean donations???

review/summary: Nice, aromatic coffee
review/text: I am thrilled that Amazon is shipping to Hawaii now!!<br />I purchased a bag of this coffee about a month ago so my daughter, in college on the continent, could bring it back with her.  Now I do not have to wait until she is on break! :D<br /><br />I love African coffee, and it is neigh on impossible to find in the islands.  I had been ordering direct from another roaster until they changed their shipping terms and it cost $25 to mail 2 12 oz bags: loved the coffe, but... too much for postage.<br /><br />The coffee I received from coffee bean direct was not the best Ethiopian I have ever had, but it was still very nice.  They roast on the light side, which works well for this coffee.  It is very full bodied for a medium roast; earthy but not acidic.  The price is excellent, and you can't beat the shipping charges! As soon as I saw that Amazon will now ship here, I subscribed.  Now I do not have to hope for a courrier (visiting friends or family) to bring me the coffee I love.<br /><br />We fairly shocked our daughter by consuming the 5 lb. bag during her 3 week vacation.  That said, I did not have any issues with the flavor degrading.<br /><br />It looks like Amazon and coffee bean direct stock all my favorite beans.  now I just have to figure out how to set up the subscription so that I can rotate through my favorites without having to store 50 lbs of coffee ;)

review/summary: very good coffee at a great price
review/text: it's a bunch of coffee.  if you have two people drinking about 4-6 cups a day (i think our grind & brew carafe counts five ounces as a cup), which i think was our rate, it will take you about month to five weeks to get through it.  after four weeks it can lose a good deal of its flavor, so you want to try to use it before then.  but for the price, you can't beat it, and if the last little bit gets a little stale then you can always move on to another bag.  but, if you don't think you brew at least four cups a day, then you may have too much spoilage.  they also sell one pound bags, which i've not tried yet.

review/summary: Great Value
review/text: This coffee, when used within a few weeks of roasting is outstanding.  All medium roast coffees are at their best when freshly roasted, but the Yirgacheffe especially has a wonderful taste.  Coffee Direct will do a medium roast which I usually prefer since it doesn't destroy or override the natural flavors you get from the growing region.  Coffee Direct will send it out fast, but I don't know if it is older if Amazon sends it.  5 pounds is not too much for our coffee loving family, but you might find you will need to give some away to go through it in 3 or 4 weeks.

review/text: I don't see how they can get away with calling it 'blue cheese'. I cannot taste any cheese chunks in this particular dressing. Calling it ranch seems more appropriate. This appeared to be the predominant flavor throughout.<br /><br />I know this is one of the 'budget' salad dressings available in the local grocery store. And it might explain the composition.<br /><br />But because Kraft is obviously famous for producing cheese products, they should put a little more work into this particular item.

review/text: This was my first foray into the world of "culinary salt" and wow, it's great!  I really like this and was shocked how different it tasted from 'regular' salt or even the regular kosher sea salt.  I wouldn't cook with this as I think you'd lose the subtlety of the flavor difference, but it's perfect for those things that you sprinkle salt over just before eating.

review/text: Very happy with this salt! Completely delicious. It is not as fine as some may want, but it is not coarse. They make a coarse salt too and it is just divine. I use this every day, and am very happy with the flavor and performance.

review/summary: Good, but not what I was hoping for.
review/text: I was looking for a type of chunky sugar bits in irregular sizes and bigger than this Pearl Sugar - so I am still looking, since I do not know what it is called.<br />However, I must say this Swedish Pearl Sugar works very nicely sprinkled on top of pretzel-like cookies and gives them a nice sweet crunch when you bite into them. I am pleased with the mistake that I made - and will be ordering more for the holidays.

review/summary: A delicious treat
review/text: Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review:<br /><br />MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol.<br /><br />In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like "it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then!<br /><br />Lastly, in regards to it having so many "food colorings" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring. I will be buying from them again and again.

review/summary: why so expensive on here
review/text: its cheaper in the grocery stores and u can find $1 off coupons online and print as many of them as you want which means a 4 pk would be $10 bucks instead of $20.
