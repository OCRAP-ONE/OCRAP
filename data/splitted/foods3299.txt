review/summary: much smalller than regular pigs ears - my dog says .. OMG THESE ARE EVEN BETTER TASTING ..... YUMMMMMMMMMM
review/text: My human opinion - these are gross, greasy and nasty dog treats that are a part of a once living animal and disgust me out to no end  .....<br /><br />Translated into "dog" .... ONE OF THE BEST EVER TREATS I'VE EVER BEEN GIVEN .....<br /><br />The crazed look of excitement in his eyes when I pull one out is unbelievable.  My dog REALLY LOVES THESE!<br /><br />As for being smaller than regular pigs ears - I actually think that's almost a good thing.  Pigs ears are so fatty, greasy and not good for dogs in large quantities and certainly contribute to any weight problems dogs usually have.<br /><br />Also, due to a heart condition I suffer from, it is physically impossible for me not to respond to my baby dog's face when he wants a treat (my baby - a massive APBT who is the sweetest full grown baby of a dog).<br /><br />Because of my own heart condition, I don't want to over feed/treat my dog, and make him suffer from being overweight because of my own physical needs .... so the smaller size is better.

review/summary: Good for road trips
review/text: I got these when I was planning a month-long road trip with my friend. We wanted to be able to have PB&J sandwiches for lunches to help save money and didn't want to have to refrigerate the jelly, so this was our solution. I tend to like strawberry more than grape jellies, and the same was true with these jellies. They were not the best quality you can get, but they were great for the trip. And there was a lot left over by the end of the drive...

review/summary: Fragrant and Delicious ... No Bitter After-Taste
review/text: I truly enjoy the taste and aroma of this delicious K-Cup selection, which does indeed remind me of those special mornings during childhood when my mother would make French Toast and serve it to the family with warm maple syrup on the side.  The coffee is medium-bodied (I would describe it as "mellow"), and doesn't have the bitter after-taste that so many flavored coffees seem to leave.  And I very much like the fact that it is Fair-Trade certified, which means that the coffee grower was paid a living wage for their crop.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this K-Cup flavor, but of course taste is highly subjective ... especially when it comes to coffees, which we all "doctor" in our own unique way.  (I drink mine with fat free non-dairy creamer and artificial sweetener.)  So I might suggest that you read as many reviews as possible when you are considering an unfamiliar variety, and base your purchasing decision on the general consensus rather than any one review.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Tastes exactly like its supposed to!
review/text: I really couldn't avoid trying Green Mountain's Golden French Toast after reading all the rave reviews. I hadn't come across another maple flavor yet and wanted to see how that kind of blend would taste coming out of my Keurig. I wasn't disappointed at all!<br /><br />This blend tastes exactly the way it's supposed to! Well, okay, maybe not sugary at all but the maple and cinnamon is spot on. This smells delicious while being brewed and is perfect on a night like tonight to keep warm while snow is dumping all over the city of Chicago outside.<br /><br />I think this tastes best with a little milk to soften the cinnamony flavor. Really lovely.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is my favorite of the flavored coffees (that right is reserved for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OHOITE">Timothy's World Coffee Winter Carnival K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> which tastes AMAZING!), but it's pretty good. I'll pick up another box when we run out of our back stock of different k cup favors.<br /><br />This is definitely worth a try!

review/text: I am a big fan of flavored coffee. I enjoy the variety of hazelnut, caramel, butterscotch and at Christmas, candy cane and eggnog flavors. The French Toast coffee has an attractive smell and taste, and I enjoy it. Note that the strength is on the milder side so this is not a good choice for a wake-me-up jolt of caffeine.

review/text: This is a delicious flavored coffee, however I just have to say that it doesn't really taste like French toast. I was very excited while it was brewing, because it smelled exactly like French toast. So I was kind of suprised when the taste didn't live up. Don't get me wrong, I'll use all of my k-cups, it just wasn't what I expected. I'm not really sure how to describe it, I guess it's got a cinnamon flavor.

review/summary: Wish I just bought regular coffee.
review/text: It's probably my fault for being hungry at the time.<br /><br />I was really there to buy coffee. I mean, real robust stuff that would send me ricocheting like a tracer round. But...I'll admit that when I saw the words "Golden French Toast," I immediately conjured up a brisk morning, blessed with the freshly-grilled glory of hot french toast drowned in a viscous flood of rich maple syrup. Mmm mm. Salivary glands, activate.<br /><br />I should have known that french toast had nothing to do with coffee, except for maybe they're ordered together at the local diner. But the words just sounded so good. So enticing that within seconds I had a box in my arms, ready to ring up.<br /><br />I'll tell you though, after popping one of these K-Cups in my B60, disappointment drowned my dreams as much as the diluted, dull flavor that doused my mouth.<br /><br />Yes, my java-jousting friends, "Golden French Toast" is far from golden. Instead, it's like a day-old slab of soggy old toast with syrup, poured over with watery coffee, then mashed together and run through a strainer. What you drink may be slightly recognizable, but then after that unsavory swallow, you may wonder why you bothered trying a coffee that tries to taste like food.<br /><br />All I can say is, if you want Golden French Toast, then make some. Just not in a coffeemaker.

The only thing preventing the product from receiving a 5-star rating from me was a slight delivery issue -not having any sort of 'Fragile' indications to UPS- that led to a frozen rootball when I received the package. However, Bonsai Boi was fantastic and guaranteed a replacement or refund if any health issues should arise come Spring.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: I received this Numi set as a gift during the holidays, well expecting that it would be something tea-related. It makes a fair little gift, too, and I was excited to try it. I'd like to add here that this was my first foray into "loose-leaf" tea, which I had wanted to attempt for some time.<br /><br />But to be frank, I've had tea bags that taste better than this. (Higher-end ones, mind you, not the bargain-bin stuff.) One of the flowering teas tasted extremely off - my mind kept confusing it with the aftertaste of tomato paste. Not sure why. Was it my underdeveloped palate? You'd have to make that judgment for yourself. The rose tea I remember being exceptional, however.<br /><br />Yes, you can use each flowering tea three different times, but you would have to use it within 24 hours - not sure about the logistics of storing some wet, soggy ball of tea leaves properly.<br /><br />Not all of the teas "bloom," or so was my experience. Or if they did, they had a tendency to be lopsided, their center of gravity pulling them downward. One of them was moderately successful in blooming properly, and that one was lovely. But some of the others? They looked like weird spiny sea urchins. I found that part amusing, but it scared others off from trying my tea.<br /><br />The tea pot looks small and I worried that the handle might break, but so far it hasn't broken or cracked or anything. It's cute, I will say that. As for its size, just fill it with boiling water again - not a problem, given the fact that I'm the only one who drinks tea around here. But it would definitely be enough for two or three people before requiring a refill.<br /><br />I wasn't super impressed by this tea set from Numi, but it wasn't a bad gift. The flowering teas in my version (maybe others had better luck?) were overrated, though.

review/text: I have always been a fan of hand crafted teas, and these teas are actually hand-sewn with flowers....amazing! (and I did some research to learn that the teapot is made by hand as well). So then I purchased it as a gift for my wife, and she and her friends loved it!  The beautiful tea leaves opened up in the glass teapot and provided a very unique experience.  The tea was delicate and delicious, and we were able to steep them multiple times.  Also, what made this set an exceptional gift is that it included both a teapot and the wonderful teas....just add hot water.  We plan to buy several as gifts for the holiday season this year.

The price makes absolutely no sense because you can buy this same thing ([...] ), with an added bamboo chest, FOR $5 LESS. Or you could buy the pot on its own ([...]) for $15 and four boxes of the tea for $16 ([...])... you'll get 4 times as many flowers for almost the same price. I am so let down by this. I would return it, but I can't since it has tea in it. I'm giving it away as a present because I can't stand to look at it.

Firstly, I don't know what the regular diet or pallet of these parents are, but according to my family, these are on the bland side, the last impression I got when I tasted these crackers was that they were overly salty. You want salty, go eat a Ritz. The nutrition information states that 30 crackers will provide 220mg of sodium. Well, unless you pile half a bag in front of your kid and plop them down in front of a TV and thereby introduce them into the life of the American couch potato, there should be nothing to complain about. (In addition, any competent medical authority will state that a child should average around 1 gram of sodium per day, that means 1000mg.)<br /><br />These crackers are small and that needs to be taken into consideration, observe your child closely and ensure they are ready for them. Our daughter started these when she was 9 months and has done perfectly fine with them. She usually consumes 2-3 crackers per feeding (nothing near 30). They are 'plain' flavored, I would describe them as buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Again, thanks to Earth's Best for a great organic, non-GMO product without the nonsense ingredients, Good Job and keep up the good work!

review/summary: The 6 box set of tiny crackers is a very long-lasting supply.  They're salty but better than others I've seen in terms of health
review/text: I think this is the best choice for babies in the cracker category in terms of health and likability.  I had tried other types of crackers and they just threw them after biting into them. They like these and eat them and only sometimes throw them. Babies are amazing at how expressive they are when they don't want food offered to them.<br /><br />My ten month old twins eat these crackers, but not every time they're offered, and they're fairly healthy with the possible exception of saltiness.  They're by far the saltiest thing they eat.<br /><br />Considering that they need to put things in their mouths due to teething and basic discovery of the world, this is a great product to have on hand just to give them something edible that can go in the mouth.<br /><br />Getting it in a pack of 6 at this discount beats buying them one box at a time at the store.  I haven't seen this in a big box store yet, so I believe this must be one of the better deals at the moment.<br /><br />One box of these for babies around the age of mine (10 months) will last a long time.  The crackers are tiny and since they're so salty, they don't gobble them up.  When you get the 6 boxes, you've certainly got a long-lasting supply.

review/text: Amazingly good crackers. We were looking in the organic food aisle at Kroger a few months back for the little ones and found these crackers. They taste better than Cheez-Its and Cheese Nips, AND they're organic and healthier for you. I wish they sold these with less of a baby/toddler theme, though; they'd probably sell more if they did.

review/summary: Kids love these
review/text: My kids love these crackers. They are more healthy than your high sugar high salt alternatives usually found in the store. They taste really good (about what you would expect from a Keebler cracker), but the ingredients are all things you recognize and would put into crackers you make at home. They are organic, so if you care about that - this would be a plus as well.<br />The price is fair, especially if you use subscribe and save. My kids have been eating these since they were toddlers and even though they are older now, they still enjoy them. Yes, they do have Elmo crackers, so they may not be welcome in your older child's lunch bag, but would be a great guilty pleasure for them to have as a snack at home.<br />I will also admit that I LOVE them as well!

I really enjoy snacking on these myself. They're baby bite-size, dissolve somewhat quickly if taken whole without any bites, nice and crunchy if you do decide to bite into them, not overly cheesy, and all of the pieces find a way to remain intact (including Big Bird's long beak) while in the box/bag.

When I received my order, I had only received 2 boxes with 10 foil packs in it.  I rated the purchase and thought nothing else of it.  The company contacted me by phone and asked how they could make my experience better and after I explained that I was disappointed with the amt that I had received, they attempted to correct their error.  I still feel that the picture is misleading and should actually be changed to show the smaller box you actually receive with only the 10 envelopes showing.  I am more satisfied with the company's customer service than with the actual product and will probably order from them again in the future but not with that product.

review/summary: I tasted the Rainbow - and color me hooked
review/text: Dare I say that these jellybeans are by far my favorite - yes - even better than Jelly Belly jellybeans.<br /><br />In my opinion, the humble jellybean should possess several qualities: 1) appropriate "pop" of flavor, 2) without being cloying or gummy, and 3) a satisfying, consistent mouthfeel.<br /><br />I am not completely enamored by "novelty" flavors of jellybeans.  I only require an assortment of the ubiquitous flavors: grape, orange, strawberry, lemon and cherry.  The Starburst package also offers green apple (which has become one of my favorites in the bag).<br /><br />Starburst jellybeans are a little smaller that other products on the market (with exception to Jelly Belly products).  The reason I feel that is important is because the food engineers at Starburst were able to achieve an intense flavor in each bite of the jellybean.  There does not seem to be extra gummy/jelly "filler," the sole purpose of which is to add heft/size to the jellybean, but which does not otherwise contribute to the overall experience of the product. Part of that great experience is the mouthfeel of the jellybean.  Because the Starburst product is a bit daintier than most others, the consumer gets to enjoy the initial "crunch" of the outer shell of the jellybean (which is also infused with the jellybean flavor), and then to have that crunchy exterior shell work its way into the soft jellybean nucleus as you masticate through both layers of the candy.<br /><br />So if you're on the market - or on the fence - about this Starburst product - do yourself a favor and enjoy one of life's simple pleasures and invest in a bag (or 6 per this Amazon product) of these great candies.

review/text: These are, hands down, the best jelly beans on the market.  There isn't a gross one in the bunch and each of them has an intense, delicious flavor.  Though I hesitate to pick a favorite, I have to say that I love green apple, a rare flavor in drugstore jelly beans.  Each flavor tastes like the fruit it is modeled after, not like the tart candy version of that fruit.  I even love the cherry flavor, and I hate cherry flavored candy.  I don't find them similar to Starburst candy, so don't let that put you off if you're not a fan.  Overall, they are delicious, perfectly-sized, crunchy yet smooth little morsels of fruit flavor.

review/summary: Delicious! Better than Jelly Belly!
review/text: I bought these for my wife after a co-worker shared some with her. She was surprised and excited when they arrived. As she was making her way through a bag of them I decided to give one a taste and was surprised at how flavorful and "juicy" they were. Each color is tasty and I don't end up with a pile of beans that I refuse to eat, like when I buy Jelly Belly beans.

review/summary: Starburst Jelly Beans - Much better than Brachs!
review/text: Although, a bit pricier than the average bag of jelly beans, the Starburst Jelly Beans are delicious, fruity and are far better than Brachs.  I've bought Jolly Rancher jelly beans as well but, they're more expensive than Starburst brand and taste no better.

review/summary: Fuller taste + last longer than other jelly beans
review/text: I started buying this Starburst brand of jelly beans rather than Jelly Bellies.  The Starburst beans are larger and last longer than Jelly Bellies, which is great because I only eat maybe 10 of these vs. 30 Jelly Bellies to get my junk food sugar fix.  Also, Jelly Bellies invariably have some weird flavors that don't go well together.  The Starburst flavors are pretty standard, and still taste good when you mix an orange, red, yellow, green and purple together.

review/summary: Okay
review/text: These jelly beans have a good taste, though I found them slightly grainy. They are in fruit flavors like regular Starburst candy and do not include licorice flavor. I found them to be a little heavy on the orange and lemon flavors, so if you really like the citrus flavors you will like these.

review/text: My Golden can get picky and eating is not a priority for him. I was worried during training he was going to be too anxious to not eat any training treats. Well...these he will eat and I am very great-full! However, they do not have the best smell (definitely not something I would eat). :) Will be purchasing more.

review/summary: Corgi Cocaine
review/text: We cut these up into small pieces for our Corgi pup (so each treat actually becomes 8-10 mini treats) to prevent throwing off his diet.  This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!

Although freeze-dried liver is pricey, you can cut the chunks into tiny chinks and use while training, rewarding, or just saying, 'I love you, my good dog.'

review/summary: Liv-r licious!
review/text: My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more! No limit on liver dusted treats!<br /><br />Two paws up for this stuff!

review/text: My three very finicky dogs love this product, and I like the way I can cut them up into small pieces for training.  There is only one ingredient in this: liver, all sourced within the United States, so I feel confident and safe giving this to my dogs.  I buy this on a regular basis.  It's priced better than any pet supply store I've seen, even the larger chains.  Qualifies for free shipping, which is also nice.

review/summary: Dogs love them!
review/text: My dogs love these... either straight up, or crumbled on food they would otherwise not eat.  They don't get sick of them and almost never ever reject them.  They do quite often reject other treats, and certainly after a while of the same other treats.  But then tend to always enjoy these. In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!

review/summary: Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried, Best Part Of Rudy's Day
review/text: I was intially introduced to Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats at my veterinarian's office.  Rudy, our Jack Russell Terrior, usually not all that interested in dog treats, responded like I'd never seen before!<br /><br />I bought a couple of cans (they are pretty pricey), but gave them to him sparingly. The tricks he'd do for the Pro-Treats were really entertaining.  Now, Rudy has to take meds. for his glaucoma and thank heavens I found the large size here which is a good value, so he not only takes his medicine, but gives great tricks in return each day! He's a happy camper, despite the loss of sight in one eye.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a><br /><br />Rudy says, "They are the best part of my day!"

review/summary: Great training treats!
review/text: Getting grain free treats for training usually leaves three options: hard biscuits (and who wants to work for those?), cooked meat (which is gross to handle), or commercial meaty grain-free treats which cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />These on the other hand, are very affordable, not gross to handle, and the dogs think they smell AMAZING.  They work great when your dog's attention is wavering - a waff of freeze dried beef liver usually snaps them back to attention!<br /><br />Also, being as they're only beef liver, I don't feel bad feeding my dog as many as needed for training.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best dog treats
review/text: I have a 2 1/2 year old black lab and these are her favorite treats! They are the best for training, my dog will do just about anything to get one of these treats. Even my 3 month old black lab puppy goes running to his kennel when I tell him to go to bed because he knows that a liver treat is coming his way. Since they are sliced small a large container of these will last a while. The only complaint I have is that my dog loves these so much that if she knows shes getting one she starts to drool, and she's not a drooler... So I gotta toss one to her quick!!

In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q">Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.<br /><br />Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love.
