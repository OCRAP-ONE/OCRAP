review/summary: This Stuff is Horrible
review/text: I think this product is horrible.  It has basically no odor control properties, it's expensive and the litter box needs to be emptied way more frequently than with other litter products. Worst of all it contains completely round crystals that end up rolling all over the floor (unlike other crystal litters which contain irregular-shaped crystals) making it nearly impossible to clean up from hard surface floors like tile and hardwood - I have better things to do with my time than chasing round crystal balls with a broom!  I thought this product would be a good substitute for Tidy Cats Crystals but it's essentially worthless. Very pretty packaging - very bad product :(

review/summary: Not Starbuck's Via..... But not too far off!!!
review/text: This is surprisingly good coffee!! I got hooked pretty quickly on Starbuck's Via instant packs and when my income went to "heck" in a hand-basket, I tried these due to the price savings. For those of you who are familiar with S/B's Via product, I'd say.... If we consider those a "10", then I'd say these Nescafe' Clasico Sticks are somewhere around an "8" or a "9".<br /><br />I carry a couple in my wallet so that if I encounter an extremely weak cup of coffee when dining out, I can add some of this and turn a cup of undrinkable crap into a palatable brew. For the price savings of this over the Via product, these are a "best buy" for me!!!<br /><br />:^)

review/summary: Freeze Dried
review/text: I purchased the product because I am using the Medifast diet program and I had to stop drinking coffee.  I only want coffee when it is nearly white with cream; which is not conducive to a healthy diet.  The Medifast has shakes I use in the morning so I decided I could mix instant coffee with the shake and I would be getting the caffeine... very important!  I started using the Starbucks Via product (which is wonderful) but at $9.95 for 12 individual servings, it was getting very expensive.  I looked for something that would be comparable.  This is not a comparable product - the processing method used is completely different.  The product is inexpensive (I received 96 packets for $13.)  Essentially, I got 8 times the number of packets for about the same money.  This more than makes up for the difference in quality.  Besides, when it's a mix in, it's not the primary flavor.<br /><br />Pros: Great price, convenient perforated flip top<br />Cons: Freeze Dried (large crystals), wouldn't  use for stand alone cup of coffee<br />Summary: Great price for a coffee mix-in (shakes, etc.)

review/text: I first had Monin Hazelnut syrup 20 years ago in a small coffee shop in Tacoma, WA. Fell in love, searched high and low to find it for home, and spent big bucks acquiring it off and on. Sometime along the way it quit tasting right so I quit using it. I gave the current Organic version a try and Lo, and Behold, it is the pure nutty fruity sweet taste I recall! Hurray! No more chemical aftertaste and not-hazelnut flavor!<br /><br />If you don't think you like nut-flavored syrups, but love hazelnuts, be sure to give this a try. I have also used it to make white chocolate hazelnut truffles!

review/summary: Five stars from the Husband
review/text: I am not a big hazelnut fan but I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Loves it so much that he went through it in about 2 weeks.  Now, I am trying to decide if I should get more of the organic version or try the cheaper non-organic version.  My husband is pretty picky so I was surprised he liked this at all.  My sister in law also tried it and is now ordering it as well.  If you have a hazelnut lover in your midst, buy them this!<br /><br />Also, a side note.  For some reason when I ordered this, I never got it.  I contacted Sweetsauras and they promptly sent me another bottle.  Someone, somewhere is enjoying a lost in transit organic hazelnut monin bottle.  It will probably be the next person to leave a review (I'm watching for you!).<br /><br />If Sweetsaurus is reading this, I would like to request they set up a subscribe and save for this item.  I would gladly buy three to six bottles at a time!  I want to keep my husband happy.<br /><br />UPDATE:  the company listened to my request and made a listing for six bottles at a time.  THANK YOU!

review/summary: yummy
review/text: i love fruit syrups on pancakes and waffles. plum syrup is impossible to find, so i was delighted to find this. the taste is rich and sweet/tart. you have to microwave the bottle for about 30 seconds before you use it, or it won't come out of the bottle. because the texture is like a thin jelly, it kind of "blops" out of the bottle instead of pouring easily. however, it melts quickly on your hot pancakes. i especially love it as a glaze on pork chops. the "blops" melt on the chops, and the excess is super in the pan to continually glaze the chops if you turn them several times to coat. i'll buy more again when i run out, only i'll buy more than one bottle at a time. i gave 4 stars instead of 5 because you must heat it to get it out, and it doesn't pour, it "blops". also i wish it was a larger size. it's now my favorite syrup, and i know you won't be at all disappointed in the flavor. mmmmm....

It is worth every penny and Starbucks "wouldn't pull a shot without it."<br />I even brew it straight up in my Bunn coffeepot for a nice rich pot of java that makes my morning a little more bearable.

review/summary: Bzzzzz...
review/text: I bought this tea because when summer rolls around, I am a little puddle of miserable. Seriously, my allergies attack with everything they've got and there are days where I simply cannot go outside. Last summer, I discovered green tea seemed to help with some of the symptoms, as did local honey. So when I spotted Bee Pollen Matcha, I had to try it, if only to keep on hand for when I make smoothies all summer. Mmmm smoothies. A little frozen fruit, a splash of tea, and I am in heaven. This is why I bought a blender!<br /><br />This is most likely a case of mind over matter, but the first few sips of this tasted like honey to me. I don't know if it actually does, it's not overwhelmingly sweet, but it tastes a touch like honey. Kind of like how Honeybee from DavidsTea tastes like...well, how you imagine a bee would taste. All bzzzz and the like. But it is sweet enough and flavorful enough that while I was drinking it at work, I kept reaching for it. I tend to place my travel mug on the corner of the desk and forget it's there until I lose my voice.<br /><br />This matcha is also a good addition to my smoothies, since it provides calcium and protein. As someone on a dairy-free diet, the ability to get calcium in my tea is very important to me. A friend of mine says that "drinking tea for the health benefits is like having sex for the exercise," but after a summer of allergies made manageable by local honey and green tea, I'm a believer. Do I think tea is going to magically make me skinner? No. Damn it. But I do firmly believe that teas like this matcha can help with things like allergies and vitamin deficiencies. If nothing else, this tea keeps me away from carbonated drinks like Coke and Dr. Pepper....mmm, Dr. Pepper. It also helps me cut back on sugary fruit juices and heart attack causing energy drinks. Matcha is all I need to get that rush to help me make it through my day. And this particular matcha is a tasty, tasty option. I love it! A sweet green tea that makes you feel like you're drinking something that will give you superpowers? That also helps you get your vitamins and bounce around your office like you just had a large can of Red Bull? Sign me up!

review/summary: Optimal balance, not too sweet, but enough so
review/text: There isn't much I can add to other reviews: the best thing is that these are velvety goodness that has the exact right amount of sweetness, taste, almondy smoothness. In many ways, similar to other great european chocolate-y things like Ferrero Rocher, or another great Fazer product, Wiener Nougat (which is also available from Amazon via third party seller(s)). For the longest time it was hard to get these outside of Finland (or at least Baltic area, tax-free shops in Scandinavia), but things are improving now.

review/text: This confection is nothing short of perfect. I was introduced to it as an exchange student, living in Oulu, in 1983. The combination of the hazelnut filling and the sweet milk chocolate provides a balance that the average, all sugar candy cannot deliver. If you visit Finland, you must try it. If you don't visit Finland, buy some here. You won't be disappointed. You'll be saying "kiitos".

Count me among the latter camp, I am not against seasoning on nuts in general but the flavor used on these is disgusting in my opinion. To me it almost tastes like chicken flavor, as though they were roasted in poultry seasoning. I have a whole can to eat up and I found rinsing and then drying them does help somewhat in getting the flavor off but I will not be purchasing again!

review/text: When I subscribed for almonds, I took my time and read the ads. I was looking for some that were roasted but unsalted and without added oil. When they arrived, I realized that they were coated with something that included MSG! I was looking for a healthy snack, NOT MSG. The MSG was not mentioned before I made the purchase. I kept them, but I was not happy and I cancelled my subscription immediately. I would still like to arrange for some healthy nuts to arrive periodically by means of a subscription arrangement, but now I am very hesitant to sign up for it. Who would imagine that someone taking care to avoid oiled and salted almonds in favor of plain roasted ones would be pleased to get them coated with MSG??? Not me!

review/text: Okay, I'll admit, I do want to be the only three star - that's just how I roll.  I am absolutely addicted to these nuts.  When I realized my habit was costing me $6 every few days I looked for alternatives.  Tada - Amazon.com!  A great value and the subscribe and save is "saving" me $10 every time I eat 4 cans (which takes about three weeks).  Anyway, I love them.  My ONLY complaint is that I think they are shipping a different grade of nut compared to the $6 can at the store - they are smaller.  After I eat my four cans, I always have to buy at least one more can to hold me over till the next shipment.  This is where I have noticed that the $6 nuts are bigger.  So that's my story, my nuts shrunk.  But I love em' anyway.

review/summary: I love them, but buy one jar at store before getting them in bulk
review/text: I find the flavor of these almonds to be wonderfully savory, the coating is barely covering the nut but really keeps them nice and crunchy.  I think the coating has the same flavor profile as old fashioned dry roasted peanuts, the slightly seasoned ones I remember my grandma always having a jar of.<br /><br />I guess these are really a love them or leave them type of product; you'll notice the very high or very low star ratings, not one 3 star review when I tasted these.  I think the split is because the almonds do not have the word "seasoned" in the title so people looking for plain almonds feel duped.  I also see that some people are mad about them containing MSG; it is listed clearly in the ingredient list so you can avoid it if you have problems consuming it.  Some people get sick or bad headaches so this is an important thing to be aware of if you are sensitive.<br /><br />I can see how someone would be put off by any flavor if they were looking for plain; my advice is to always hunt down the ingredient list to any food you are planning to buy without tasting first, especially if ordering in bulk.  I went to the grocery store and got one jar of these to see if I liked them, when these are gone I will be getting these in bulk here on amazon since I paid almost $6 for one jar.  Good flavor, good value.

Yes, they are seasoned, yes they have a hint of garlic, and yes they are salted, but these all make for a great combo of flavor. This was the first time I ever came across garlic being used to with almonds, and I think it really complements the nuts well. However, I must confess that I am a garlic fiend, and so I am of course biased, but it is still darn tasty!<br /><br />  Here it is folks, if you love almonds, if you love garlic, give it a try.

review/summary: This gulasch is delisch!
review/text: I picked up one of these packets locally to try it for the first time.  Like most seasoning packets, it is going to carry a fairly significant amount of salt (10% of your RDA, according to the U.S. Nutrition Facts information), but that's about it as far as dangers from this packet are concerned.  The labeling (all in German) claims this packet makes 4 portions--but they're very generous portions; our family of 3 had more than enough to satisfy everyone, and enough left over for lunch the next day.<br /><br />Basic directions (again, in German) are printed on the back, to wit: cut a pound of meat (beef, pork or poultry) into cubes and brown in hot oil.  Add about 1 1/2 c. water, bring to a boil, add contents of the packet and return to boil.  Cover, turn to low and cook 60-90 minutes, or until meat is tender.  (Or cook in a 400 degree F oven.)  Serve with potatoes.<br /><br />Each packet also offers another recipe; ours had "Budapest-style" goulash on the back.  Here's how that one goes: cut about a pound of pork stew meat into cubes and brown them in oil.  Add a generous 1 1/2 c. water and the contents of the goulash spice packet.  Bring to a boil, cover, turn to low and cook for about an hour.<br /><br />In a separate pan, cook about 2 ounces bacon until crisp.  Drain off nearly all the fat, then add two chopped onions and two chopped bell peppers (red and/or green) to the pan.  Saute for 10 minutes, or until the onions start to take on some color.  Add these to the main pan along with 2 or 3 tomatoes, peeled, seeded and diced (or use whole canned tomatoes, cut up), and cook another 10 minutes.<br /><br />We served this goulash over rice.  The original called for it to be served with potato dumplings, which would also be excellent.

review/text: I received this as a free sample at work.  I left it sitting in my refrigerator for a few weeks before I got up the courage to try it.  As soon as you open the bottle, you could smell an almost <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JX5NGA">Dr. Pepper, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> scent.  I had an adventurous friend with me, so I poured the soda into two small glasses. It tastes strongly of anise (the main flavoring of black licorice).  I happen to love that flavor.  My friend said she could taste the burdock root, but not being familiar with that flavor, I could not.  My only complaint is that it is overly sweet.  I'm not much of a soda drinker, so this probably is a non-issue for those that do drink soda with any kind of regularity.  It basically tastes like a "virgin" Jagermeister cocktail.

I liked the solid batch because I could make a wicked alternative to chocolate mousse with it. You can't do that with the part-liquid or all-liquid consistency coconut milk. But mostly I use it in smoothies and in curries, so no big deal. I like to buy coconut milk in bulk so I'll continue to order this.

review/text: This is an excellent product. A very flavorable spinach basil garlic fettuccini. I believe it is a bit over priced but you only get what you pay for. If your into a more healthy and still tasty pasta you may wish to give this a try. I served aldenti with virgin olive oil and italian seasonings.

review/summary: Scallops, No. Chicken Nuggets, Yes
review/text: I'm not sure why they call these Skallops. There is nothing about them that is even vaguely reminiscent of scallops. But they can easily pass for chicken nuggets in both texture and taste. Maybe this product has been around since before there was such a thing as a chicken nugget. Get yourself some dipping sauce and you've got a winner on your hands.

review/summary: Great product, but pricey
review/text: I really like the Worthington Skallops.  They are high in protein and fiber, low in fat and carbs.  Great for weight loss and a healthy meat substitute.  I think they are on the expensive side, however.  I still buy them, as a treat or when I have extra cash in the food budget.

review/text: I agree with previous review - these don't resemble scallops in any way, but they are very good. I don't understand why they are so hard to find.<br /><br />Recipe suggestion: cook ramen noodles, throw in a handful of chopped skallops when the noodles are almost cooked (just long enough to heat them up), drain most of the water then add the spice packet.  Not very classy but good and quick.

review/summary: not terrible, but a bit on the rubbery side
review/text: I've had a great many types of vegetarian meat alternatives from all over the world. Though these have soy  protein as well, they still have a bit of that rubbery texture/mouth feel that seitan "wheat meat" has. The price is for a very large can with quite a bit of product, so I thought that it was competitively priced with other similar products. I emptied the can and froze it for using what I need at a time, which has worked out well. It thaws perfectly. I don't think I will order again unless I need a shelf stable hydrated product. There are better tasting/textured options, including any of the Quorn chick'n tenders available with frozen foods.

However, I can get this same huge can for less than half the total price with shipping charged on Amazon at Fiesta Mart in the Austin area.  Go to the Worthington site to see if anyone near you stocks it.  Also, talk to a manager at your favorite store to see if they can get it.  I would love to see this wonderful product readily available everywhere.

review/summary: Silly people at Kellogg
review/text: Kellogg has a habit of putting objectionable ingredients into things it produces, especially when they have a kosher or vegetarian designation like Worthington and Loma Linda, both Kellogg products. In this case the packing broth has two interesting chemicals that I dare not name, so I emptied the broth down the drain and repeatedly filled the can with water to dilute the stuff. So, with luck, the concentration of broth ingredients has been reduced maybe tenfold. Ah yes, the "skallops" could be called Worthington "white meat", and they taste good with ketchup on pita bread from the Parthenon Amazon storefront.<br /><br />So, the question is whether Kellogg does these things as a cheaper alternative to having their own testing program for these chemicals. I mean, is it cheaper to sell this stuff as "food" to minority clients and deal with potential lawsuits than to run an FDA-approved testing program? Inquiring minds want to know.

review/text: My favorite chocolate and strawberry yogurt confection so far. I work at a german deli, and have tried the Milka Strawberry Yogurt, as well as Jogurette, and this is the best. The perfect balance of sweet strawberry and tart yogurt. It has real bits of strawberry and crispy rice bits that give it a little crunch. It is rather refreshing.<br />I ordered this in late spring and  I was a little worried about the chocolate melting, after reading the other review. It was still raining and cold here, so I chose not to expedite, but it arrived in perfect condition. Chocolate starts melting at 72 degrees, so keep that in mind when ordering. If it is hotter than that, either pay extra for the expedited delivery, or wait until it cools down to order.

review/summary: Terrible Customer Service
review/text: I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received.  They arrived melted.  I didn't realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED.  I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant.  Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared.  I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited.  So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery.  When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it.  Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated.  They cracked easily and no filling was discernable.  Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity.  My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service experience.

review/summary: A nice step up from plain rice cereal
review/text: Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.  This blend of fruit and grains (and, in some cases, yogurt) provides everything she needs for a good breakfast and keeps her full for several hours.  Plus, the flavors are not overly sweet.  One note:  at least two of these flavors include yogurt.  Some babies younger than 1-year may have a reaction to yogurt and other dairy foods, so just watch out for that.

review/summary: A well-balanced meal for baby
review/text: We feed our baby this Wholesome Breakfast at any time of the day, not just for breakfast.  We're happy she's getting a good balance of vitamins and minerals.  Most jarred baby food is pretty light on the calories and nutrition, but the plain cereals that are fortified with essential vitamins/minerals are so boring and don't train a baby to enjoy different flavors.  We've been mixing cereal into our baby's food to enhance the nutrition, but that's inconvenient and messy.  This Wholesome Breakfast provides the best of both worlds:  the vitamins/minerals of a fortified cereal but with the stronger flavors of a real food.  We particularly like that this food contains yogurt.  When she was young (~6 months old), our baby loved yogurt but couldn't eat it plain because it would cause a rash around her mouth.  She was never bothered by the yogurt in this food, though, perhaps because it was mixed with other things.  Now that she's older (10 months), our baby can eat all the yogurt she wants without a skin reaction, but for awhile, this variety of Wholesome Breakfast was the only source of her favorite food.

Maybe I missed that in the description, but in any case, everywhere I've read and according to my pediatrician, you're supposed to avoid cow's milk products before age 1 (why they make formula using cow's milk and not a much more digestible milk like goat baffles me and is a rant for another time--my son drinks the lactose free kind, in any case). I ordered another variety of "Wholesome breakfast" too: Pear, Apple, Oatmeal. Same thing there. I'm guessing they all have heavy cream in them.

review/text: I paid $55 for a 96 pack of Maggi and was initially excited when it first arrived. However, as I was cooking it I noticed that it had an odd odor to it, and when I tried eating it, I realized the noodles were very stale. I checked to see what the expiration date on the packs was, but there was none listed (conveniently). I opened some other packs, and found each one to be very stale... they must be months over expired--maybe even more than a year. This has been quite upsetting, and I would not recommend it at all.
