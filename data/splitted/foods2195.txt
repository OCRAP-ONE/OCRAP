review/summary: Creamy & Rich. The Best Chocolates Around!
review/text: I have been receiving these chocolates from my significant other for years now. Every holiday I get a new assortment. They are to die for. Milk chocolate is my personal favorite but I have tried the other flavors and types and they are all wonderful. The types of chocolates range from creamy filled bites to solid deep flavorful chunks and include lemon, coconut, orange, milk chocolate fudge, rice crisps, among others.<br /><br />Worth the buy by far!

review/summary: Amazing chocolates!
review/text: As with other reviews I was worried about spending so much on chocolates.  I was entirely taken back at how amazing these chocolates were!  I'm not huge on the chocolates filled with items (Some coconut and one that tasted like banana).<br /><br />One thing I will mention.  If you are ordering this as a Christmas present, you better hope that you get the box before it's seen by the person you are giving it to!  On the outside of the box it clearly says "Leonidas Belgian Chocolate".  That was an Xmas present ruined but the chocolates were still enjoyed.  Also, and I don't know if this was just my box or all of them, but you don't get a "map" as to what chocolates are filled with what.  This means that if you don't like a certain chocolate you have to gently bite into a piece that you take and hope it's not that certain flavor :)<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.  The box looks great that the chocolates come in which adds a nice "Fancy chocolate" touch to it.  They were also packaged very well so nothing was damaged in shipping.

review/summary: Minty taste overpowers licorice
review/text: I was excited to try this product as I love black licorice, mint and herbs.  When I opened the package, there was a pleasant aroma, so I was really excited to bite into a piece.  Once I did, I was surprised at the overpowering minty taste.  I recommend just buying a single box somewhere before buying a large quantity.  The regular Panda All-Natural Black Licorice product is much better, and I recommend them highly.

review/summary: Licorice that's medicinal
review/text: I study herbal medicine in my spare time.  I'm no herbal doctor, but I can recognize a good product when I see one.  The herbs in this product without getting into specifics are good for 1. Lowering Blood Pressure 2. Warding Off Infections Such as Colds, Flus, Etc... 3. Settling An Upset Stomach.<br /><br />There are doubtless more applications, but these would be the top among usefulness.  Be careful not to eat too many in one sitting, they can give you one of the other effects 4. Clearing The Bowels.  If you moderate and eat a few a day, you have earned yourself some of the best and cheapest herbal medicine out there, not to mention one of the TASTIEST!!! Yum Yum.<br /><br />Anyway, as an eastern medicine practitioner would say, most people are led by their tongues not their brains.  Do not feel guilty buying this treat, it's good for your tongue and your body.<br /><br />&lt;EDIT: I brought these to a meeting to give to a sick friend, he loves them. At these meetings, we have a couple Dutch men, Licorice is popular with the Dutch. My Dutch friend was chasing around my sick friend asking for licorice, he loved it. That speaks volumes for a product.>

review/summary: Licorice that lingers
review/text: I admit that I did not like this variety of licorice when I first tried it. I felt that the minty/herbal flavor (more like an "aroma") seemed out of place for a licorice candy. When that box was finished I bought the regular Panda licorice at my next trip to the store and, to my surprise, I really missed the lingering herbal bouquet. Missed it so much that I turned the car around and bought a few boxes of the herbal variety and then wrote my name on the boxes before I put them in the cupboard. Now they are a staple in our home - the perfect sweet for after dinner.

review/text: This is the only non-medicinal I have ever found that eases my symptoms of an on-coming hiatal hernia.  It soothes my stomach and, consequently, my anxiety about an imminent episode.  In the time I have been taking it (about 2 boxes/month for 4 mos.) my blood pressure has also gone down... maybe a coincidence, but that was the only change to my diet.  I love the black licorice, but I find that it gets me a little wound up, whereas the herbal does just the opposite.  Don't compare it to the black - it is a whole different experience.  Great stuff!

review/summary: Licorice, with a Kicker.
review/text: I became aware of Panda Licorice only a short time ago. It's just an excellent licorice, one of the best I can remember. As such, I tried to get another box of it at my local super market which has a rather nice assortment of candies. Well, they had a space for it but it was all sold out. It figures. In any case, next to the place was a few boxes of Panda Licorice Flavored with Herbs. So, I tried it.<br /><br />Wow! This stuff is really good. It's just Panda Licorice, but with an assortment of 18 different herbal extracts added. I don't recognize most of them on the list. One that stands out is peppermint leaves and you can imagine what that tastes like along with licorice. In any case, if you like good licorice, give this a try. You might be surprised.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I have had better in specialty shops, but for the price and for everyday snacking, this is very good licorice.<br /><br />Just for those who don't know, not only is a licorice a great tasking candy, but it's also good for settling nerves and sometimes it'll make an upset stomach a little less upset. Maybe it's just psychosomatic, but it does seem to work for me.

These are a great size to satisfy without overdoing it.  And they are especially crunchy so the pups really enjoy them.

The good thing about these is that they have no salt (which is good for me because I would probably have a heart attack because I consume so many). You can add salt to them if you wish, but you don't have to add the insane amount in salted seeds. Thanks for the good value and great option.

review/text: This sunflower tastes really great, very original flavor not over salted. And the size of a sunflower seed is decent though not very large. Overall, it is the best sunflower seed that I ever eat in America.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: I ordered the 10 pound case of unsalted sunflower seeds and within 5 days the package arrived.  I opened it to find it contained PUMPKIN SEEDS.  I reviewed the return policy and realized that I would be responsible for return shipping, which was half of the price of the product itself.  I emailed the company and they were quick to apologize for their error and offered my money back or to ship the correct item.  I chose to have them send the correct item and it arrived within 5 days AND they told me to keep the pumpkin seeds.  Great customer service and both the sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds are great quality.  I would definitely order from them again. I would have given this company a 5-star rating except for the small error they made.

review/text: First time I bought unsalted roasted sunflower seeds from Superior Nuts, but it won't be my last.  I've tried half a dozen vendors over the last 17 years, because they just aren't available from local retailers, despite my living in the Sunflower State.  These are bigger and tastier than any I can remember.  A great find!

review/summary: Bonne Maman Apricot Preserves - Superb
review/text: What a wonderful surprise when I dipped my knife into the newly opened jar of Bonne Maman Apricot Preserves! This all fruit, sugar & pectin treat is loaded with large slabs of the sweetest apricots that have ever landed on a slice of toast. While most jams amd preserves on the grocers shelf are using high fructose sweeteners and minimal fruit, Bonne Maman has created a rich preserve that is primarily apricots with just enough sugar and pectin to hold it together. These preserve harken back to the best homemade from many generations ago. Enjoy!

review/text: Its a shame to have to write this review, because nothing is wrong with the jam. It is the best tasting apricot preserves I have ever tasted. the problem is that 4 of the 6 jars arrived broken. It was a mess. This is the second time this has happened. Amazon was nice enough to give me credit on the purchases but I wanted the jam. I would not chance ordering this again. I am amazed of the poor packaging they used to send glass jars. They didn't even have " fragile" or " glass " printed on the outside of the package.<br />The jam is terrific, but find it in a store, don't order it.

review/summary: a guilty pleasure ~~ BUT I LOVE 'EM !!!
review/text: Frosted Flakes has been my favorite cereal since I was a toddler! I remember my mom taking a small box with her when we went to visit Aunts and Uncles because she was never sure if they'd have a box in the house. (OK, so once my Aunt had some in the house and she took offense; I guess my cousins liked Frosted Flakes, too!)<br /><br />They have that sugar on them that I absolutely crave; true, with all the dietary advice out there these days Frosted Flakes may be something of a guilty pleasure for me--but, then again, who cares! I pour myself a bowl, add some milk and I am ready to go to town!<br /><br />Others have noted that they come with an expiration date that is far enough in advance so you won't have to worry about eating them too fast; and they are right.<br /><br />Overall, Frosted Flakes has always been and probably always will be my favorite cereal. I don't know that I've ever actually met a person who can (honestly) say that they don't like Frosted Flakes. I highly recommend that you get some today and enjoy!

review/text: I buy a lot from Amazon, but have never purchased grocery items from them.  I thought I would take a chance on a less that 12 dollar purchase for four boxes of one of our favorite cereals and it paid off.  I was a bit concerned that the product inside the box might be reduced to crumbs due to the shipping, but was quite happy to find out it is all in good shape. The expiration date is July 2012, plenty of time for us to use the product. I'll be going back for more and will consider other products, as well. By the way, the cereal is almost $2.00 cheaper than I pay for it at the grocery store.  And, the size of the box is the big family size!  Buy it!

review/summary: Contains GMOs! We say NO!
review/text: Kellogg's Frosted Flakes cereal contains genetically modified organisms which have been patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in this product. They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate, an herbicide, which is linked to birth defects, cancer, organ damage and inflammatory bowel disease. It also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora. These GMOs have not been subjected to independent, long term, peer reviewed studies to prove that they are safe. These GMOs make my family sick. We do not pour pesticides on our food and we no longer eat anything that is an EPA registered pesticide.  GMOs are linked to organ damage, faulty insulin regulation and obesity, autoimmune disease, autism and a whole host of other health and environmental problems. Kellogg has contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California which is spreading lies to convince people that they should vote again GMO Labeling (prop. 37) in California on Nov. 6th because they don't want you to know that Frosted Flakes contain GMOs. Frosted Flakes are NO LONGER G-R-RRREAT. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled. Kellogg does not use GMOs in these countries. We are boycotting all Kellogg's products. Join GMO Free USA, a grassroots consumer email initiative that is contacting Kellogg en masse with emails to tell them to Just Label It or remove it. Americans have the right to know what's in their food! [...]

review/summary: great for energy @ amazon .com
review/text: For those of you who like coffee, but have never tried chocolate covered coffee beans usually referred to as CHOCOLATE COVERED ESPRESSO BEANS. I will tell you that eating your coffee is better than drinking it. Although, I often do both at the same time, because I really need a jolt in the morning. What is the difference? The liquid coffee acts on your entire body, but mostly IT ACTS ON YOUR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH YOUR BRAIN.The coffee beans also acts on your entire body including your brain, BUT,it acts mostly on your DIGESTIVE SYSTEM, and stimilates it to produce more electrical energy. The coffee beans really kick your system into high gear. If you like coffee, you'll love coffee beans. The dark chocolate also tastes really good. Try them you'll love them. Just one caveat however, dark chocolate is not the same as MILK CHOCOLATE, be sure to get DARK CHOCOLATE COVERED COFFEE BEANS.

review/summary: Please take the corn syrup out of the recipe!
review/text: I just bought 2 bags of the product. Tried and it was all PRO's until I noticed the big CON: one of the ingredients is corn syrup! I usually eat all organic food and love healthy stuff - I'm sooooo against corn syrup. I could've avoided the surprise, though, by reading the ingredient list that was disclosed in the product's page at amazon.com.<br />Well, as I said before, there are good things about the product, too. The chocolate bit is really creamy as they say, and deliciously bittersweet. It tastes so fresh and helped boosting my energy. Oh, and the delivery was really fast - I had it in two days!<br />Please, please, make them without corn syrup so that I can give it 5 stars :) !!

review/summary: Thin & crispy but too salty
review/text: I love blue corn tortillas and their products. I had been eating the Guiltless Gourmet brand Blue Corn Tortilla Chips for many years but ultimately found their chips a bit thick & bland. I decided to try out Garden of Eatin, and I am glad I did. Thinner and crispier than the GG brand with a richer blue corn flavor. If I didn't know they were baked, I'd think they were fried! My only complaint is the excessive salt which is super obvious on a dark blue chip. I just brush the extra salt off but this can be a pain. I'd buy a salt-free option if they offered it in their baked blue chips, but they only offer it in the fried blue chips. For now, these'll do. I like eating dipping them into my homemade, low-salt guacamole- YUM!!

review/summary: Too salty and nearly expired.
review/text: I ordered a case of these chips from Amazon because I like the regular Garden of Eatin blue chips and usually like baked chips better than fried.  I ordered a case (and put myself on subscription) to get the best price and figured I could eat a couple of cases a year.  But these chips are too salty - eating them actually burns my lips!  And all of the bags in the case I received from Amazon on January 5 have "best by" dates of February 3, 2010.  How am I supposed to eat 12 bags of too salty chips in less than a month?  Since Amazon does not allow returns on this item, I'll probably just donate my case to the food bank.  I highly recommend that before you order this item, buy a test bag at Whole Foods first.  And don't order a case unless you can use it within a month.  Learn from my experience!

review/text: These 1.5" rounds are cut too small for dipping, and may be too fragile for proper Tortilla dishes - so it's a shame I'm now stuck with a case of them.  considering the soy is at the end of the ingredient list after various oils and before the salt, then such soy is just a marketing gimmick to help excuse such a disappointing blue corn chip.  Target's Archer Farms Organic Blue Corn With Flax Seed Tortilla Chips - are much better and cheaper.  Thank you Amazon for double boxing this and sending out a 3 Month long dated product during a 50% off sale.

review/summary: Good, as long as they are still fresh
review/text: I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....

review/summary: I love the sesame in these chips, you will too!
review/text: I love sesame in general. It makes foods more satisfying. There are two brands of blue corn sesame chips I know of; this one and one by Kettle. I think I might prefer the Kettle brand a little over this one since they use sprouted corn. Somehow that improves the flavor a little. These are still a 5 star product though. Sadly, I just searched for the Kettle chips and found they have been discontinued, so not only are these a great choice for sesame blue goodness they are your only choice!<br /><br />Of course chips like these are pretty high in fat, so it is not a good idea to eat them too often. They are quite addictive as well. For a little addition to a lunchtime meal you will not be disappointed. I hope you like them as much as I do.<br /><br />-Dan

They should be labeled Corn & Black Bean chips.  They don't taste bad, as far as chips go.  But they are definitely nowhere near as good as the old Trader Joe's variety.

review/text: I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all. Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of "flavor enhancer".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.
