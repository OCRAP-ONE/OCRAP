review/summary: Fig-tabulous!
review/text: This was a gift for my 90 year old grandmother. She was so pleased with your product she didn't want to eat it too fast and use it up! If her friends were very lucky they got a taste of it too. No one had ever tasted a fig spread as delicious as yours. This is high praise indeed seeing as no one was younger than 70! I want to add my thanks to you for making me the best grand-daughter ever!

review/text: We are now on our third jar of the three jars I purchased and have thoroughly enjoyed all three.  I looked for a long time to find fig preserves that were as good as I used to make and believe me, these are better (and no mess too!)  I am stunned by the negative comment as we think it tastes terrific!  I am going to purchase more for Christmas gifts!

review/summary: Best fig preserves I can find - love them
review/text: These fig preserves are the best I have been able to find, and I've tried other types over the years.  I won't bother ordering or buying any other again.  They come very well protected, (no worry about breakage), are delicious, more fig than any other ingredient, and spread beautifully.  Yum.  Good on toast, with cottage cheese, with meats, over ice cream ....

review/summary: Not your Grandma's Preserves
review/text: You cannot imagine my disappointment.  The other reviewers say just like Grandma's homemade.  I suppose it is possible that my Grandma was a better cook than yours.  These are awful preserves.  And that is the nicest thing I can say about them.<br /><br />The packaging is spectacular, the quality, the flavor and the overall experience eating these preserves is way below par.  I did consume some, just hoping my initial experience was not good.  These preserves are terrible.  These are the worst tasting fig preserves I have ever tasted.  I was so excited reading they are just like Grandma's; I got the cherry flavored one too.  Yikes.<br /><br />Side-by-side, you could not tell the difference in the two jars.  They tasted identical.  The fig did not taste anything like figs and the cherry did not taste anything like cherries.<br /><br />They tasted identical.  They tasted awful.<br /><br />I am very disappointed especially since after reading the other reviewers; I was really excited to have finally found some good fig preserves.

review/summary: Love the salt, not the packaging.
review/text: I was dismayed when I ran out of Baleine (my favorite cooking salt) and could no longer find it in any stores.  I hadn't looked for awhile because one canister lasts about a year with nightly home cooking use, provided of course you're not doing something silly with it like seasoning your pasta water - get coarse kosher salt for that.  But so then, amazon to the rescue.<br /><br />Buying 6 seemed a bit egregious but I figured, what the hell, salt doesn't go bad.  I used to cook professionally and encountered this stuff when I worked at a ritzy country club in Florida.  The salt is fine grained and delicious.  The beauty of the fine granules is how easily and evenly they pour from the spout; just tip it upside down and it flows with hourglass consistency.<br /><br />Each cylinder has 2 aperture 'settings', a large single hole for quick pouring, and 4 small holes for slower pouring.  I almost always use the 'slower' one, and with a slight shimmy of the wrist from maybe 14 inches high, the salt lightly dusts whatever's beneath it.  As you get used to the container, you learn to measure your pours by time and feel, much the same way some chefs measure by pinch.<br /><br />I tried one replacement from the store with similar packaging and after 2 nights with it, decided that I couldn't take it anymore.  The granules were too large and the openings too small, which resulted in me having to violently shake the container to get anything out, thereby producing, shall we say, 'money shotesque' splurges of salt that would land sporadically on my proteins.  Who could live like that?<br /><br />So my take is basically the middle ground between the two other reviews.  Unfortunately, my salt also came with one container broken and half spilled.  But, I love this salt so much, that offense hardly makes the experience 1-star worthy.  For evenness and consistency of seasoning, it's a great product and hard to beat.  And now I'm stockpiled until the latter half of the decade.  &lt;3 the Whale.

review/summary: Never knew I could have a salt brand preference!
review/text: Love this salt!  I don't remember when or why I picked it up in the first place.  Initially I bought it at a local fancy kitchen store. When they closed I found a local grocery that carried it.  Well, it's no longer on the shelf there either, so now I am STOCKED with a package of 6 containers of my favorite salt courtesy of Amazon.  I'm not certain of the correct salt terminology, but to me this has a smooth, clean flavor.  Other salts now seem to have a big "bite" that seems harsh and overpowering on my food.  This salt enhances the food without saying "Hey! Look at me! Taste me! I'm SALT!"  Great on popcorn, eggs, anything.  I have used this for years, and now that I have several containers, I may just have to share with friends.  Arrived in perfect condition, though I understand others have not been as lucky.  Each container is large, with a "sprinkle/shake" hole, and a "pour" hole. I keep mine in an open container so I can grab a pinch anytime.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: Great salt in need of better packaging
review/text: Like other reviews here, this one is to say I love La Baleine salt and, when my six containers arrived, one had lost its bottom and emptied inside the shipping box. Luckily the six containers were packed within a plastic bag, so I did not have to clean anything up; however, I feel there's got to be a better way. Five stars for the product, one for the shipping.<br />I've never had a problem with a storebought canister of the stuff, so either these things were made to only ship in full cartons or retail stores go through a bunch of broken ones. My guess is that if they were packed in such a way that they could not move at all, there would be no problem.

review/text: A tailgating friend of mine turned me on to this cooking essential.  This seasoning is used more than any other in my house.  A great blend of peppers offers great flavor and a comfortable level of heat.  If you are a chili-head, this won't provide a sweat inducing burn (unless you use a ton), but it will provide a very nice flavor with enough heat for most people to notice.  If I want a little extra heat I add one of any number of other things.  But this seasoning is the first thing I grab for almost anything.  Eggs, pizza, mashed potatoes, bean dip, taco meat, grilled cheese, the list could go on and on.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't regret it!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: This is an amazing product. Gelatin is pure collagen protein, 9 grams of collagen protein per tablespoon. And the best thing is that it's hydrolyzed collagen which makes it easily digestible. When I heard that the Guiness Book of World Records for weight loss was a woman who lost over 300 pounds by taking collagen, I just had to try it. I've been taking collagen for one month and my sagging skin is noticeably firmer. This is so thrilling to me that I will be taking this for the rest of my life. I also noticed some research online that said ingesting hydrolyzed collagen will tone and tighten sagging skin, reverse wrinkles, get rid or cellulite, keep bones and cartilage strong, and ease<br />arthritis pain.<br /><br />I started taking a liquid collagen product but decided I could no longer afford it, so I was excited to learn that gelatin is the same thing, except you simply mix the powder in water or juice. You need at least 8 grams of collagen per serving once daily to see skin toning. The best time to take it is before bed at least two hours after eating. If you search for unflavored gelatin on amazon.com you will see one of the reviewers of another brand said she was taking it to get rid of cellulite and that it is working. I decided on this particular brand because it is not made from porcine/pigs. I like that it is kosher and made from beef bone. Just as a side note, in the olden days people always boiled bones to make broth or soup and that's how they got the needed collagen to keep their bones from getting brittle.

review/text: I had never tried Honeybush tea before purchasing this batch from Davidson's, and I couldn't be happier with it. In appearance and consistency, the ground tea is very similar to Rooibos, except it is a slightly darker red. The aroma of the tea is just heavenly. I should also mention that it makes a truly AWESOME iced tea. I normally don't type in caps, but I wanted to emphasize how good this is as a summer refresher. Heat water until close to boiling, then turn off the heat and steep the tea grounds until you attain the desired strength and color. Let the water cool down and then refrigerate it and you have iced tea that far surpasses any bottled brand. Lastly, you will want to store this tea in an airtight plastic container or canister, as it comes in a paper bag that is not really meant for permanent storage.

review/summary: Very Mild, Interesting Tea
review/text: Already a big fan of bush tea (Rooibus tea) I thought it would be interesting to try another one of these African teas.  The shipping container is very much environmentally friendly with a good seal, and you certainly get your money's worth.  Opening the container you will experience an absolute joy at the exquisit aroma emanating from the wonderful small granules that comprise this tea.  Be forewarned, you cannot use your usual tea strainer, you must use a silk bag or some such to filter out all the particles when you brew your tea.  Personally, I bought a Rooibus tea at Starbucks, and simply kept the teabag, tearing it open at the top, and reusing it to brew all of these African teas.  I must admit, however, that the flavor is quite subtle.  Perhaps it would be enhanced with honey or sugar, but I prefer my tea without, and this one just doesn't have a strong enough flavor to make me switch from Rooibus.  Good for an alternative once in a while, but be forewarned, it is very, very subtle.  Some folks add dried cranberries and a bit of orange to enhance the flavor.  I have't tried that, good luck to you if you do.  One very important benefit, though, is that there isn't a microgram of caffeine in this tea.  It is caffeine-free.

review/summary: Great base for Herbal Blending!
review/text: I specifically chose this tea due to the fact that the price per ounce beat any tea blend or otherwise in my area.  Ounce per ounce of loose tea you simply couldn't beat the price... plus free shipping? I blend my herbals in my own concoctions and brew them in my infuser.  This is a finer grind than I am accustomed, but I solved that problem by shoving a coffee filter into my infuser before adding the tea.  It is not heavy, dark or woody at all.  It is light, fresh and almost sweet.  I love it with my chai blends as well as with the greys.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, it is superb as an iced tea and I've begun blending for the purpose of brewing to ice.  I highly recommend not only this particular tea... but also the company.  Well packaged, though I do suggest repackaging for long term.  I would and will buy again!<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />PS - It's decaffienated!

review/summary: This has made me rethink honeybush
review/text: I was surprised when this honeybush proved to have a slight black pepper/cinnamon smell, and even more unusual, a slight burning sensation in the back of the throat.  It is not unpleasant at all, but it is not like how I expected honeybush to taste on its own.  If it helps, the sensation reminds me of the same feeling one can have from very freshly-pressed olive oil.<br /><br />However, I've only had it blended with red or green rooibos before, and in those bags, honeybush seemed to make the result a sweeter taste--but never something even slightly "peppery."  Maybe this honeybush is so fresh that some constituents are still in it that aren't there once aged.  In referencing internet resources, it appears a constituent of cinnamon makes up part of honeybush.<br /><br />The bag arrives completely sealed, and with a zipper-like top (not rolled as the current picture shows).  Once opened, it has a nice deep smell (again, slightly peppery) and a darker color than any red rooibos.  It blends well with rooibos, but shifts the flavor to something slightly spicy and, in my opinion, still needing something to sweeten it up a bit.<br /><br />My wife likes it a lot and we will be using it as one of our many tea options from now on.<br /><br />The price is a steal for what you get.

review/summary: Somewhat Disappointed
review/text: I drink Rooibus and Honeybush regularly.  Overall, good quality (although I preferred Inaba and Kalahari) and I like the organic aspect, but this doesn't strike me as bulk tea (having bought many loose, bulk teas in the past from various internet tea merchants), as much as crushed leaf remnant, more like what what we would find in a tea bag or even remainders of the sorting process.  If someone knows better, I would stand corrected.

review/summary: Delicate and mild
review/text: I like this tea a lot.It is milder that Rooibos tea and tastes less acidic (I must say that Rooibos tea is not strong-flavored but I still find that Honeybush is even milder without loss of flavor).I like my tea dark colored but I cannot always have black tea so this Honeybush is a perfect addition to my tea repertoire. It has a mild pleasant aroma too.I like that it has no caffeine, it's dark but never tart or bitter.I often brew the same batch twice with good results. It is my second purchase and I am still well-pleased.

review/text: I was quite enthused to try this tea, based on reviews. Upon opening the bag, there was a slight scent. Once brewed, there was a flavor which I cannot describe, but which I did not like, followed by a very subtle lemony aftertaste. I am very fond of rooibos tea and had expected something similar, or at least an herbal quality which this tea does not have. It is just not for me. I will use the rest of my pound of honeybush to dye fabric.

review/text: Very Good Product. I've drank twenty bags @ $4. Couldn't afford that very often but buying in bulk and organic from Davidson's makes this excellent cup of tea a bargain. The picture doesn't do the bag Justice as it has a zip-lock feature. It will take some time to drink all of this one bag and I purchased 4 different varieties. The zip-lock bag would do well if I were were drinking from only one. I vacuum packed 3/4 of each and stored them in the freezer. The partial bags are in the fridge ready to use. I'm looking forward to drinking these fine organic teas for some time to come.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy & amazing value
review/text: Residing in Canada, finding honeybush is quite difficult except in pricey upscale tea shops. My local tea shop has it but the price is approximately 20$/oz.<br /><br />Here comes Amazon and Davidson's Tea where I could finally buy it in bulk for a reasonable price. The honeybush appears fresh and it has that strong aroma when you open the bag. Once brewed, it is not the tastiest drink but it is good served hot during a cold winter or iced cold during a hot sunny summer day. I add cinnammon, cardamom and/or lime zest to add taste to it.<br /><br />It is healthy, caffeine-free and cheap, what could I ask more ? One advice though, transfer it to a sealed contained as Davidson's bags are not made for long-term storage.

review/summary: Good tea if you like "spicy" notes
review/text: I like this tea and I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned that it is different from other Honeybush he had tried - it is a lot more "spicy." The only other honeybush tea I'd had was the Tazo brand, which is kind of sweet. This tea is not sweet per se, but has a very spicy, peppery nose. Since buying this tea, I looked back at the Tazo tea because it tastes so different and I noticed that the Tazo one adds "natural flavors" which I think account for the sweetness. This tea is pure honeybush with no added flavors, and so the taste is a bit different. I do not think the grind is too thin, all the honeybush/rooibos teas I've had have a very small grind so I think that is normal.

review/text: Overall, I am moderately satisfied with this product.  Ordering was easy (of course); it was delivered as promised; the reclosable bag is very nice; the flavor of the tea is fine.  My only problem is that the tea seems to have been ground.  The bits are so small that none of my tea balls/strainers can contain them so there are many floating in the tea, clinging to the cup, etc.  I prefer my tea without solids and will not order this product again.

review/summary: Smooth and mellow, good flavor
review/text: Very pleased with this tea. It's my first purchase of honeybush tea, and certainly will not be my last. The tea has a very smooth flavor, even when you steep it for a long time for a stronger brew. Very pleasant!<br /><br />It also blends well with other teas - I like to mix it with decaf English Breakfast plus a small pinch of peppermint tea. Very tasty.<br /><br />The tea is very fine in consistency. I'm used to that, since the decaf black teas I drink are also powdery due to the decaf process. I was, however, expecting larger pieces since honeybush is naturally caffeine-free. Not a big deal since I have fine mesh baskets that I use with other teas, but I was hoping this would be different. Oh well, it still tastes great, which is all I really want in a tea.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: Not All Enchilada Box Mixes ARE The Same
review/text: The local stores obviously think they're saving shelf space by only stocking this 'enchilada box mix' in the product line.<br /><br />Well, it DOES taste different than it's chicken counterpart--and this is not a good thing.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fritoey-pie flavor, this would be the product to purchase. It could be prepared with ground turkey or veggie meat crumbles.<br /><br />But I can't recomend utilizing seafood because of the 'heavier' flavor throughout the mix. I've prepared it several times and I just have problems detecting the cheese taste which is supposed to be throughout. I got more of a 'chili' taste. both upon my first and second bites.<br /><br />The product is edible. But it's not one of the enjoyable dishes. And I did not end up feeling like I was eating a delicious dish which I'd want to eat again--or serve to others. Save your money.

review/text: I have respect for the Wellness brand and have previously bought my dogs other Wellness treats.  These WellBars are marketed as "bite size."  My corgis love them!  And, they can certainly eat them in one bite.  But, for a medium dog, I consider these larger than bite size.  Luckily, the bars are easily broken in two to provide a smaller snack.  (Weight maintenance is a high priority with my chow hounds.)<br /><br />Each bar has 24 calories.  The first few ingredients are:  ground barley, cane molasses, ground brown rice, whitefish, and sweet potatoes.  There's no wheat, corn, soy, artificial preservatives/color/flavor.<br /><br />This is a big box of treats.  I do wish that the bag was resealable, but that's a quibble.

review/summary: Bad for teeth
review/text: Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd.  As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness.  After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.  They're also made by Wellness.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9GNPM">Old Mother Hubbard Classic Oven Baked Chick' N' Apples Dog Biscuits</a> Or, Get Naked dog biscuits, which are also very good.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L80MZ2">Get Naked Super Antioxidant Biscuits for Dogs, 12-Ounce</a>

review/summary: SMELLS GOOD even I want to eat it
review/text: This smells so good . Doesnt' smell like cardboard boxes. Comes in thick plastic bag to prevent puncture and letting the freshness go out.  There's no sealable zipper or anything so I have to use a clothing pin.<br /><br />My dog eats it when she wants to.  I leave it next to her bed she won't touch it sometimes. But sometimes she does eat it up.  She should eat it up fast or else it will become stale.<br /><br />Smells fruity and a hint of gingersnap cookies.  I gave it to another dog and he ate it like there was no tomorrow.  I gave my dog a wellness lamb jerky .. she ate it like crazy. I gave the other dog lamb jerky... he ate it like crazy.<br /><br />My conclusion is that not all dogs like fruity gingersnap cookies. Still have 60% left.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very good but I should stick to a guarantee treat....the lamb or any line meat jerky offered by Wellness.<br /><br />Not sure if I can eat it . lol

review/text: These are the best ones of the Wellness bars because they're completely grain free. My dogs love these. They also contain no artificial preservatives. Highly recommended. However, I wish these came in a 50 oz box like the other flavors. The 20 oz box at 8.99 is the same cost at the pet store (and it is 45 cents per ounce) versus a 50 oz box which is just 30 cents an ounce. The product is fantastic, though. A++++

review/summary: 4 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: Well the kind folks over at Wellness Pet Food heard about my website and sent me some treats to try! They ended up sending me a big box of their WellBars that have Yogurt, Apples, and Bananas in them. Totally vegetarian, oven baked with lots of vitamins! I'm sure you have read one of my other reviews about Old Mother Hubbard, they make outstanding healthy treats. Turns out that WellNess is owned by Old Mother Hubbard. Who knew? As usual Dad ran me though a barrage of tests to see how much I really wanted the treat. Let's just say I had to work very hard. Those silly "sit ups" that little dogs do, roll over, sit, stay, down, etc, just to have him put the treats in my Everlasting Treat Ball! I made short work of it and devoured my new delicious and healthy treats. The only thing I'm a little disappointed about is I found out that they have WellBites that are soft treats. They even have one that's Lamb and Salmon flavored... Those are two of my favorite things in the world. Now I have to talk Dad into buying them for me...<br /><br />Conclusion: Outstanding healthy dog treats! A must buy for a healthy pup.

review/summary: Buster Loves Yogurt and Apples
review/text: We can't change our dog's diet much.  Unfortunately he is highly food motivated and loves to visit our local hardware for treats.  In fact, he keeps a supply at the hardware.  He had never been diagnosed with any food allergies but after buying a large box of commercial treats to keep at the hardware, we started to notice some problems.<br /><br />A local pet store recommended another flavor of these treats.  He liked them but we didn't notice an improvement in his symptoms so I tried these.  After all, apples and yogurt are some of my boy's favorite things!<br /><br />He loves these treats.  Although his symptoms have not cleared up entirely, they did improve.  His friend at the hardware likes to feed him a lot of treats at once so we consider them well tested at this point and we just ordered our third box.  Dogs like 'em and mom approves!

For this reason I would not buy these crunchy treats again, although I must say they smell good!<br />We feel the reason for his not eating the crunchy treats is that he is accustomed to the soft Wellness wellbites that we have been giving him for over a year.

review/text: A friend of mine first got me hooked on this when he had a sausage and cheese plate at a party. I have always liked "Honeycup" brand mustard, but it was a little bit too thick for my tastes. This was a great compromise, and has a really strong kick but isn't burning hot. I can go through a bottle a month, so it got expensive, but buying six like this cut a good percentage off of it. Great deal!

review/text: Bought this mustard because I hoped it would taste like Johnsonville Mustard Sweet N' Hot which I can't find anywhere.  This mustard is not at all sweet, and the hot part of it tastes like pure horseradish.  Even though I like horseradish and I like mustard, I am disappointed that this "Sweet Hot" mustard isn't sweet in the very least.  Too hot/spicy to spread on crackers for cheese and cracker snacks (overpowers the taste of the cheese completely), and makes my son gag.  He likes sweet mustards, but this mustard is not sweet.

review/text: This has been my favorite tea for more than 30 years. I always drink it at my grandmother's house. I am a red tea lover, and I compare all other teas to this one. The flavors blend perfectly and are complemented by a small addition of sweetness. Honey is the best, but stevia works well too. Red Zinger is close as my second favorite, and Tazo African Red Bush falls in a weak third place.

review/text: Mighty great coffee, awesome one day sale pricing, and cool old fashion packaging. One problem, liked to never of broken into the goods. That top was really glued on, not good for old farts with bad hands. A rusty knife may work, but I sure don't want to cut some precious coffee packets. Some kind of pull string, like on those old dog food bags, or a ductape seal would do the trick.<br /><br />Well, shiver me timbers. I just learned. via another old fart, that there is a secret passage into the EkoJava coffee chest. By golly, there's a hidden perforation under the label, no signs or maps, about two inches down from the top, that opens the goods real smart. Just run a fingernail around the perforation and twist the top right off. Who would of ever guessed?<br /><br />Now, more Java for me mates.

No mess, nice canister, good coffee. The price is decent when it's on sale for $10; I think the list price is too steep.<br /><br />I brew it in a solo cup with an ez filter. Less mess, less waste (of water. I don't like the amount of water I waste rinsing away coffee grounds.)<br /><br />I'd like to see them come up with a stronger blend, a variety pack, and a refill option to cut down on price and packaging even more.

review/summary: Eko admits the issue with Sumatran grind
review/text: My review is impacted by the use of this coffee and brew method - not on the sole quality of the taste.<br /><br />We bought two EkoBrew baskets, a can of the Sumatran, and one of the Honduran. When the Sumatran refused to brew a full cup we contacted the company. Received a nice email that explained the grind was "pre EkoBrew" and they admit to it not working well with their single serve basket. That being said, they apologized and suggested for us to use less coffee with a smaller cup setting - as well as offering us a refund for the inconvenience.<br /><br />So, I'm not sure if the taste is fantastic enough for more than two stars, since I can't brew a proper cup with their own product. I gave them an extra star for customer service.

review/summary: Very good quality just too expensive
review/text: I tried the EkoJava packets a while back when they were on sale for $10. The 4 star review is actually due to the cost of EkoJava more than anything else. At $10 the price is as good as or cheaper than k-cups much of the time. At $12 (as of the time of this review) it is 48 cents a cup. I have never seen it at full price, but $15 for 25 cups is too much money I think. The good part is that the quality of the coffee is very good. I am not a coffee connoisseur by any means, but the Ekojava is some of the best unflavored coffee I have ever had from my Keurig.<br /><br />I think it might be ground a bit too finely though. The brew time is pretty darn long (even double sometimes) but I have not been getting short-cupped at all. I would worry about it more if I was getting short-cupped. At first it looks like all of the coffee isn't going to fit below the solofill line, but just shaking it back and forth to even the top off is enough to get the grounds enough to go below the line (I did not tamp it down at all.)<br /><br />My only other complaint is that when you open the EkoJava packet with the perforated line on the package, the hole to pour the grounds out can be a bit small. I get around it by either using scissors, or opening it with the perforated line in such a way that makes the hole bigger.<br /><br />Overall, IF you can get EkoJava on sale at a point where it is the same price or cheaper than k-cups then I say it is a good buy assuming you already have a solofill. The coffee I think is very good quality, there is a lot less plastic waste than using k-cups, and there is still some of the single-serve convenience<br />of k-cups since the EkoJava packets are also single-serve.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: This is the perfect measuring of coffee for the Keurig. Tastes great, nice bold (but not too strong) coffee. You can't beat the price

review/summary: too fine grind
review/text: I found the grind too fine for my solo refillable/reusable cup...it clogs the mesh and only brews about 1/3 of a cup...when I use a regular k cup disposable it brews a full cup.  Also if I use my solo refillable with regular grind (Maxwell House for example) it brews a full cup.  So I cannot use my ekojava except tearing open several and putting in my regular coffee make!  :-(  not happy!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL46Y0">EkoJava, Sumatra Single Serve Coffee for Solofill Cup, 25-Count</a> Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers
