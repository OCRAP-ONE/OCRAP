review/summary: Really yummy dip, great for recipies!
review/text: This dip is good hot or cold.  It is very easy to make and also makes a good roux for a spinach-chicken casserole. YUM. This dip, and all the SK dips, are great fun to experiment with -- I love having them in my pantry to bust out at a party or liven up a dinner dish.<br /><br />Each box has 2 dip packets in it so you get 12 dips in a 6 pack.  I got it in mega sale so it came out to about a buck-fifty a dip, what a great deal!

review/summary: Not usually a fan of Iams, but this works like a charm, and they like it
review/text: My dog had an expensive and painful bout of pancreatitis, the vet prescribed this food for me.  Generally, these specialized diets don't impress me when you really look at the ingredients, but the first few ingredients on this can are: chicken broth, chicken, whitefish, brewers rice, corn grits, chicken liver, beef by-products...and so on.  I generally look at the first 5 ingredients and I thought these were pretty good.  Still, my dog was VERY sick and hadn't eaten in 3 days, the vet tried the Hills prescription diet and she didn't want it, finally my dog ate a few bites of this food.  In conclusion, my dog doesn't have the greatest constitution, if you have a greyhound, you know that solid poopies are a blessing, and with this food, she did great.  She liked it and didn't get diarrhea, so I can't complain.  Except that the price is a bit much, come on, lets be real.  But compared to a vet visit, this food has worked wonders.

Pleasant, tantalizing heat, nothing overwhelming. But it's enough heat that it might kill mild-mannered persons dead, so take care. The liquid the chiles are packed in is also excellent for cooking, so don't waste it.

review/summary: excellent
review/text: I lift weights and eat a low carb diet and was looking for something I could consume that was sugar free but would satiate my cravings for sweets. This was a great buy.<br /><br />As I kid I became familiar with the taste of carob through carob malt balls. I ate them all the time. And while I do love chocolate, carob to me is a distinct flavor and I don't consider it 'fake chocolate.' I had never eaten carob in any other way and wondered if it wouldn't make a good hot drink. It definitely does. Mixing almond milk, Stevia, vanilla extract, and Chatfield's carob powder, it makes an incredible sweet and delicious hot drink without any sugar added.<br /><br />When I first tried making a hot carob drink with this product I made the mistake of just mixing it with hot water. This was actually disgusting. The carob powder however becomes delicious with the addition of a creamy milk and sweeteners.<br /><br />I look forward to doing more with this powder. For example I've already successfully made some delicious gluten-free carob muffins. I also plan on adding some to my protein drinks. There is no sugar added to this product so I can do so freely.

review/text: I have Interstitial Cystitis and am unable to each chocolate. It was depressing trying to find a chocolate substitute as nothing seemed to give me my chocolate fix until I found this wonderful product. Chatfields Carob Powder is the closest thing I have tasted to chocolate and believe me I have tried many many brands. My favorite recipes so far include the carob latte recipe on the back of the can, brownies, and carob cookies. My husband is very picky and he said if I wouldn't have told him it was carob he would have never known. If you are unable to eat chocolate or want a healthier version I highly recommend this product:)

She has had it a number of times and there have not been any problems.  What I like best this that there is no mess.  The color does not bleed and the product does not become soft until she is eating it.  This is a good product for my small dog.  Make sure you check with your vet to make sure it is alright for your dog.

review/summary: A distinct and caramelized taste
review/text: When I was a grad student, the father of one of our friends was a connoisseur of fine spirits and liqueurs.  He introduced us to a number of wonderful products, many of which were the rums distilled by Lemon Hart. Most of the rums distilled by Lemon Hart are Jamaica rums.  Demerara Rum, however, is from a special variety of Guyana sugar cane.  The rum distilled from this cane has a burnt, caramelized taste that is very distinctive.  We usually drank Demerera rum straight, thought I suppose that it might also go with well with a little water and ice.<br /><br />The flavor of Demerara is too strong for it to be a good mixer.  One of the few mixed drinks that we ever attempted with Demerara was called "The Quarterdeck Number 2" in Trader Vick's book of mixed drink recipes.  The Quarterdeck consists of Rum and Sherry, but Demerera tends to even overwhelm the Sherry.<br /><br />Our other favorite rum drink was hot buttered rum--a drink that we had so often on cold winter nights that we came to refer it as "HBR".  The recipe in Trader Vick's for HBR was too sweet for our taste.  Instead, we favored a recipe for "Hot Buttered Comfort" that I found in a Southern Comfort magazine add.  In our version, you put a shot of dark Jamaican rum and a cinnamon stick in a coffee cup, almost fill the cup with boiling hot water, then place a pat of butter on the top.  Demerara rum was not generally the rum that I favored for HBR, though sometimes I was in the mood for it.  I should note Lemon Hart's dark Jamican rums are better suited to HBR and other mixed drinks.

review/text: These rawhides are the only ones my dog will actually spend the time and effort on. Other rawhides, including Dingo's non-beefy ones, are usually just left alone by him. I would recommended that you have a area for your dog to eat these though, unlike one of the other reviewers I've found that these can mark lightly colored carpets/rugs. (luckily for me it was just a bath mat). However, since my dog loves them it's a five star item.

review/summary: Dogs love them, Amazon Distribution Center needs to be careful
review/text: Like the most recent reviewer, my most recent purchase of these had a slash across the top of the bag--my slash didn't cover the width of the bag, more like two inches but it is easy to spot. This leads me to believe that when the people at Amazon Distribution Center(s) are opening the cases / boxes that contain the bags, they're not showing due diligence when working with sharp tools. Today our dog's treats, tomorrow someone's hand? PLEASE BE MORE CAREFUL AMAZON SHIPPING EMPLOYEES, I don't want you folks to cut yourselves or my dogs treat bags!<br /><br />Other than my complaint about the bag, the bones are well loved by my dogs and the slit in the bag has not reduced their desire to have their daily treat.<br /><br />I'm still awarding the product a five star rating since I suspect that it's not the bone' manufacturer that is responsible for the slit top bags.

review/text: My Shiba Inu (who already is somewhat picky) usually goes for the regular Dingo knots, so I though something with a little extra beef would be a plus. The first thing I noticed upon opening the bag was a very strong "smoky" smell. Not like BBQ ribs or Brisket smoky, but more like "Charcoal" or "burned beyond belief blackened meat". It was not pleasant to this human, but to the dog...?<br /><br />Nope, it's a no go. She took a couple of whiffs and walked away. Guess the dog doesn't like them either. Now I need to find someone who wants an opened bag of stinky charred dingoes.

review/text: I heard that cat grass is good to keep cats out of houseplants, which had become a problem for me. I also heard it was good for their digestion and helps with hairballs. I have seen outdoor cats eating grass and know it is natural for them to want to do so on occasion.<br />So I gave this product a try. It sprouted in a few days. At first my cats weren't sure what it was and were not eating it so I snipped a few tops off with scissors and put some in their dry food dish and also around the vita greens bowl. They caught on quickly and in no time all three of my indoor cats were nibbling on the cat grass. They have since nearly entirely stopped eating houseplants. I will definitely buy this again.

review/summary: Best Premix I have found
review/text: This is my first review on Amazon, but I am so impressed with this product I had to share.<br /><br />When you open the bag, the first thing you will notice is how vibrant the color is and how fresh it smells.  Nothing is stuck together and it reminds me of instant potato flakes.  When you add water to it, you will smell it in the next room, it smells like freshed cooked meat loaf.<br /><br />I have been home preparing my dog's food for almost 10 years now and havn't really found a premix my dogs liked.  But let me tell you, the minute I added warm water to this and mixed it into their meat mix, they smelled it and were waiting to eat it up.<br /><br />I have a female American Eskimo that is very picky about her food and a male EskiePom that has a sensitive tummy.  Both dogs licked their bowls clean and neither had any tummy issues or loose stools.  That was 3 weeks ago and they are still cleaning their bowls.<br /><br />I am excited to try more products, because if they are anything like this one, I will be thrilled!<br /><br />Thank you Grandma Lucy for making a great product!

review/text: Nice product to use if you are doing the raw diet for your dog. It adds the needed Nutrients that you need when using fresh meat. Reminds me of instant potato flakes though.  Might not be great for weight loss.  It does have lots of dried vegetables.

review/summary: Just what I was looking for, for my weapons collector
review/text: This grenade set is just what I was looking for to give to my friend that is a weapons collector for him to display in his office. He uses them for paperweights. :) This only thing I wish is that they would have had an enamel or varnish finish on them. Instead they appear to be an unfinished cast product with an oil coating to prevent oxidation. While this method is effective to prevent oxidation, it is rather messy for handling on a daily basis. The shipping was spot on. Shipped out quickly and tracking issued right away. I will definitely be doing business with this supplier again!

review/text: This product was exactly what I was expecting. The grenades were made of metal and true replicas. I wanted to take the grenades apart to paint them, which was simple. They look great on my wall. Shipping was super fast and the products were well protected in bubble wrap. Recommend these babies for sure.

review/summary: Just how I remember them to be.
review/text: OK, here is the deal with these.  Don't expect them to be real or anything.  They are DUMMY grenades so they are mass produced to look like the real thing.  One thing I can say tho is that they look like exactly what we used as practice grenades..well, the baseball anyway (I never got to throw the pineapple or lemon).  If you unscrew the fuse you will see that it has a used primer body attached to it.  It won't be painted, or anything special because these are training dummies and gets thrown around over and over.  If you want it to look authentic, get some olive drab spray paint and paint it.  Mine still came somewhat coated with gun powder..lol<br /><br />They are ok items.  Good price for all three and good for my purpose.  I made them into shift knobs for my truck and gave the other two to my friends.

review/text: ****<br />This is a fine chai spice tea from Stash, made from blended black teas, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and natural flavors of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. Many chai spice teas (which I drink plain without milk or additional sweetener) nauseate me, but this one did not---I loved it! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation, and enjoyable cup of tea. I brewed the tea as I always do, leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3-5 minutes recommended brewing time, and the tea never turned bitter, just got stronger and tastier!<br />****

review/text: My husband and I go to Jamaica about every 9 months (7 times so far). We are addicted to this (VERY HOT, habenero) hot sauce. He eats habeneros whole, I can't handle that, but after 5 years of regular trips to Jamaica and lots of jerk meats this is really great. I especially use it on Chinese and Thai food for an awesome kick. Normally we bring back a case of the sauce from our trips because it is soooo good, but now that I can buy it on here for 1/3 the price I buy it for in Jamaica I can save room in my suitcase. YUMMMY. If you like hot and spicy, this is freaking amazing stuff... Ya Mon!!

review/text: This is the base hot sauce (part of the recipe) for my chicken wings, which are widely acclaimed (at least among people I know).  No other sauce has the great habenero flavor without having overpowering heat (i.e., you can taste the pepper flavor). However, make no mistake, this is no sauce for babies, it should be consumed judiciously.

review/summary: Wrong ingredients list
review/text: Don't buy this food if you are looking for the primary ingredient to be meat.  The ingredients list on the product page on Amazon says "Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Meal, Ocean Fish Meal" before any grains are listed.  This is wrong.  The package as well as Chicken Soup website list it this way "Whole Grain Brown Rice, Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal"  While it's possible that it may still contain enough meat, I still don't trust that it does.  Any dog food you buy should contain 1 or 2 (Meat)meal ingredients before any grains are listed.  If it doesn't say "meal" after the meat, it means the meat weight was measured before the meat was dehydrated.  If it says "meal" after the meat, the weight was measured after the meat was dehydrated.  Therefore, "meals" constitute more meat in the product composition than meats listed without meal after them.<br /><br />From the ingredients list on Amazon for this product, I expected the meats included were less fatty, hence the "light" description.  This is not entirely the case.  They have reduced the meat and upped the grain in this formula.  Either get the regular version of the Chicken Soup food or consider another food.  For more info on dog foods, google "Dog Food Analysis".  Some good budget friendly alternatives that are better and cheaper than this product are the Diamond Naturals dog foods.  Amazon carries these foods as well.  Search for "Diamond Naturals (meat here) and Rice"  They have chicken, lamb, and beef varieties.  Also, Diamond Naturals makes the Chicken Soup line of foods, but they are typically cheaper.  Just some food for thought.

All my dogs eat this and they love it.  The grocery stores are starting to stock premium food, but it costs more by the pound than this does.  So I keep it coming via Amazon, much to the distress of the Fedex and UPS men.  There are times when I run out before I realize it and have to grab a bag of another premium brand at the grocery store.  If the store brand is in one dish and the Chicken Soup is in the other, they ignore the store brand.

review/text: I can not really tell you too much about the flavor because this burned all the taste buds off my tounge. Before I tried it, I thought it smelled good. I could smell the pinapple juice in it. It made me think of the tropics. <p>Now to put the taste in context. I eat Dave's Insanity Sauce and have no problem with the heat, as a matter of fact I asked the salesperson for something hotter because I was getting used to eating very hot foods. I eat Blair's Sudden Death Sauce and think it has good heat. But Da Bomb was easily so much hotter than those two it burned my tounge like nothing else I have tried. I found myself by the kitchen sink washing my mouth with water. For those who eat tobasco, move on, this is like asking for car battery acid. But for those who are eating habanero's and think Dave's is mild, then this might be what you are looking for.

I usually eat Dave's Temporary Insanity on all kinds of stuff, I use the Da' Bomb Beyond Insanity/Dave's Insanity quite a bit with certain foods, but I can barely touch this stuff. The burn is so much more powerful and lasting compared to any of those that I can only handle a small amount. I'm not buying the 234k Scoville rating either.<br /><br />  The flavor is good. You can't even remotely taste it unless you eat very hot foods all the time. I highly suggest the entire Da' Bomb line to give you a good range of heat options. I also noticed there is a ghost pepper sauce on Amazon too, first time I've seen it.<br /><br />  My second bottle and I'm hooked.

I usually make my salsa with about 6 jalepenos, 3 serranos and 5 jabeneros per 28 ounces of tomatoes...but it tastes too green if ya know what I mean...and no one wants to eat it but me...but this stuff ROCKS...I can add it to anything I want...anytime! It actually made my eyes water for a few minutes the first time I tried it and that hasn't happened in a very long time...even burned my lips. AWESOME! I just bought 6 more bottles. It relaxes me...so I know it's hot because it gets my endorphins going! Absolutely love it!

review/summary: Ground Zero is a good sauce. Hot as Hell too.
review/text: When I first bought this I read the whole bottle and saw the 234,000 Scovilles marked on it and thought to myself this won't be that hot. Well I opened it up and it smelled really hot but good. I could smell the fruit in it.  I tried some on my finger and it blew me away. Definitely not 234,000! I think they lie to you so you take a lot the first time and almost kill yourself, lol. I know it's hot. As for taste not bad, but not excellent. You can't really taste the pineapple or lemon and lime juices. I just taste the heat. But good sauce overall and it's really good on cheese.

I tried a toothpick tip and was sweating and salivating and I eat habos pretty often that's why it stunned me b/c this stuff is made with habo's. It is just very concentrated.

review/summary: This is not the sauce to play around with!
review/text: This hot sauce can be used to make hot sauce!  It is HOT and is no joke.  A little goes a long, long, long, long, LONG way.  This is not the sauce to put on a sandwich or taco!  This is something you use as an ingredient.<br />I bought this to put in a beef jerky marinade I concocted.  In about a pint of marinade (1/4th of a quart zip lock freezer bag) I put about 3-4 drops of ground zero in.  I also made some spicy garlic and onion dill pickles with a drop of Ground Zero.  That's the best (and I believe most appropriate) way to use the sauce.<br /><br />This is also great for the days when someone claims they can handle any hot sauce.  Give them a drop (or toothpick dip) of this and let Ground Zero do the talking.<br /><br />As kids, I would prank with friends and trick someone into eating hot sauce.  This stuff is one to keep away from the next generation.  I have to say this is the first hot sauce that actually made me panic a bit.  The burn was instant, the burn was long and the burn was deep.  During the pain, the extract oils seemed to just disperse in all directions.<br /><br />The bottle is like an old time medicine bottle.  Not the most elaborate display but it holds in the heat.  The sauce is thick like the consistency and flow of a rich seafood cocktail sauce but more brown/earthy than red.<br /><br />The only con I have is a personal one.  It's difficult for me to deduct a star for this but this is a personal rating of the overall product and not just the heat level.  That being said, personally, I didn't like flavor.  I enjoy a more vinegary/salty taste in a hot sauce.  Ground Zero is very earthy, thick and herbal tasting.  The ingredients list pineapple but I can't taste anything fruity.  It's palatable for sure, just not my preferred taste.<br /><br />Also, I did not purchase this from Amazon or the company offering it.  I purchased this about 2 weeks ago at a hot sauce shop here in Virginia.<br /><br />Search YouTube for "Da Bomb Ground Zero Reviews" and watch live reactions.

review/summary: A little goes a long way
review/text: It shipped immediately from British American Imports and was here in a couple of days even with Super Saver Shipping! So - I tried this tea and found it very tasty and full-flavored. One bag is enough to steep 30 oz of water (I steep it in a quart mason jar, which is nicely insulating for a long time), so it is more cost-effective than a generic brand of decaf tea which requires two bags to get any flavor with, and Red Rose is good but also not up to steeping 30 oz per bag. If you like it super strong that may not work for you, but one of these is equivalent to two usual decaf bags for me. It has a big flavor.

review/summary: Reduced Sodium?  NOT!
review/text: I bought these chips because of the lower sodium, and was I surprised!  Not only were they not as labeled, but they were exceedingly salty, more than chips not labeled as such.  60% reduced sodium?  Exactly how much more salt would there have been otherwise?  For a 1 oz. serving, the sodium is listed as 70 mg.  It happens I also have a bag of Cape Cod reduced fat (not reduced sodium) chips, and for the same size serving, the sodium is listed as 110 mg.  In a taste comparison, the Cape Cods were nowhere close to being as salty as the Boulder Canyon chips.  Now just maybe this first bag was a fluke because of malfunctioning salting machinery at the plant, but where's quality control?  So what to do with 11 bags of salt-laden chips?  Anybody out there with high blood pressure feeling suicidal?  On second thought, I'll open another bag and see if there's a difference.  To be continued....<br /><br />Update:  I've now tasted more than 6 of the bags, and they're all very salty.

review/summary: Fantastic taste - best grits around
review/text: Apparently the other reviewer for this product has his underwear in a wad about the price - I don't think the other reviewer even tasted this product!  Yes, Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but the company fills a very unique niche (Gluten-free products, unusual flours, etc.) and I'm willing to pay the price to keep the company from disappearing. Plus, every product from Bob's Red Mill that I've ever tried has been superior, including these grits!<br /><br />Now about the grits - as a native Southerner, I've eaten grits all my life but I'd never had a yellow, coarsely ground corn grit before I tried Bob's. From the moment my family tried these grits about two years ago, we've eaten no other grits.  We cook these grits every weekend, usually Saturday and Sunday mornings.  Oh, we've tried a few regional products (Lakeside yellow grits are good, too, and more finely ground), but just not as good as Bob's. I like the more coarse grind of this product, and the flavor is exceptional. The corn flavor comes through, but not in an overpowering way - not to sound like a geek foodie, but Bob's yellow grits have a fantastic taste and mouthfeel.  It's hard to explain, but I recommend you try them.  If you're not sure you want to bite off a multi-box purchase via Amazon, then check your local grocery store (Publix in the Southeast carries Bob's) as do many organic/gourmet grocers.<br /><br />Oh, and never follow the directions on a bag or box of grits - that's the reason non-Southerners think grits are nasty, because they make them without the necessary amounts of butter, salt and milk or cream.  Also, these are not quick cook grits, so it will take about 20 minutes from the time the water boils to achieve smooth, cooked grits.  To feed four people (assuming you also have pancakes and a meat for breakfast), use three cups water brought to a boil, then gently shake about 2/3 cup of grits into the water.  Once the water/grits combo comes to a boil, immediately lower the heat to simmer and stir frequently. [A note about lumps: if you don't stir often enough, you get lumps; if you dump the grits in, rather than shaking them in slowly, you get lumps.] Add about two or three tablespoons of butter, then an unholy amount of salt. I'm afraid to measure how much salt we actually use (we salt to taste as we cook), but I would guess we use two or more teaspoons of salt.  To avoid oversalting, start with one teaspoon of salt, taste when you're almost almost done, then add salt to taste.  Depending on how thick you like your grits, add additional water (we prefer to use 1% milk) to thin them out a bit.  You can also add crispy bacon or country ham to your final product for flavor.<br /><br />Any Southerner can tell you that grits left in a pot to cool become polenta... so go ahead, and impress your Yankee and West Coast friends by "grilling up" leftover slices of your breakfast for dinner. Remember, the Americas introduced corn to Europe (including Italy), so grits came first.

review/summary: Offensively bland
review/text: While cooking in an area where my usual brand was not available, I tried three different brands from the local grocery stores over the past two days, including this one. Already shopped at a local "italian" grocery, but they only had instant and tubes of already cooked polenta. Results so far: Bob's Red Mill was the worst. In fact, it made the worst polenta I've ever produced.  This product is flavorless and cooks almost instantly. I prefer to take the time to make polenta right so the flavor develops. While it does not claim to be instant polenta or reconstituted cooked grains, something is clearly wrong. I threw the batch away and the entire bag. We cook polenta frequently in many ways--creamy under braises; stiffer and flavored with broth, herbs and cheese as a side dish; grilled; and sauteed. I like the equivalent of an authentic, excellent Italian or high-end restaurant version of polenta. Bland cornmeal mush is not the same thing, and that's what you will get with this product. Whatever the price, this was a waste of every dime I spent.

review/summary: I'll never feed my dog's Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul or any other food made by Diamond
review/text: Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the "voluntary" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through "other" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.

review/summary: Be prepared to buy more "tools"
review/text: I like the idea of this kit but was highly disappointed that several of the drinks require an immersion blender. The gelification is extremely difficult without one. The recipes that come with it are terrible. The videos are nice for technique but they managed to mess up the recipe for a screwdriver! Also be aware that most of these recipes take quite a while to make and must be consumed almost immediately after they are finished. It's not really something you can pull out at a party to entertain your guests with. You will also go through the included ingredients really fast. The screwdriver recipe needs 2 pouches of gelatin for one drink and considering the kit only come with 10 of them, that's one expensive screwdriver and it takes over an hour to make. I think most people would be better off buying the ingredients by themselves and looking up the recipes online.  The included tools consist of a set of measuring spoons, a small slotted spoon and 5 plastic pipettes. Assuming you own any kitchenware, the only think you may not have are the pipettes and you can pick those up or order them really cheap <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IQTSE0">Plastic Transfer Pipettes 3ml, Gradulated, Pack of 100</a>.

It's a German thing.Reese is my favorite and my mother's.Today is a good day..

review/summary: The Company is Great, the Aspargus....
review/text: It's white and it's asparagus. The taste is mediocre and the number of spears per bottle almost adequately serves four. What is unfortunate about this is that I was charged-by the vendor-the exact price of the product, $6.95. Far too much. This is a convenience not worth the price. If you can, buy Fauchon or Reese's both of which are far superior and offer far more for the price asked. If, however, you have no other access then this is, as I said, adequate. What I can say is that the product was perfectly packed. The asparagus is in a glass jar that is so cleverly contrived that I really believe it could be dropped from a plane and survive. Would I buy from MexGrocer again? Yes. Would I buy their asparagus, no.

review/summary: Smooth Ceylon Tea
review/text: This is one of my favorite Ceylon teas.  It is really smooth and well balanced.  Not too strong.  It has a very subtle hint of orange.  It goes well with milk or without.  Great tea!

review/summary: Finicky cat LOVES these
review/text: My 20 year old FINICKY cat loves, no, DEMANDS these now.  I mix them in his food and he now eats just about the whole serving.  I've never seen cats (I have 3) like any treat like they love these.  The older cat needs medication a few times a day and nothing is more miserable than giving cats pills (should be an olympic event IMHO). I had discovered "Greenies" which are like little cat carmels with a hole in the middle to hide the pills that had great success with him. He really liked the Greenie caramels, HOWEVER from the moment I gave him the little crave hearts, he would no longer take the Greenies (sigh).  We've resorted to chopping the Greenies in half, embedding the pills AND A CRAVE HEART to get him to take them again!  I don't know what it is in these goodies but I wish it came in a bottle!

review/summary: My cat will BEG for his medicine just to get this treat!
review/text: I had no idea how much my kitty loved these treats until he got an upper respiratory infection. The antibiotic pills I had to give him had to be pushed down his little throat! He was not happy about that, of course. For ten days, twice a day, my little guy had to endure my fingers shoving 2 pills down his throat almost causing him to puke each time. I felt so bad for him that after the first couple of times I started rewarding him with these treats. Well, after a couple of days he was coming up to me, asking for his pills because he knew these treats would soon follow!<br /><br />If your cat will let you shove pills down his throat just so he can have these treats - that speaks volumes!!

review/summary: Complex But Not Busy
review/text: The jar calls this a "sweet mango sauce," but don't think this is some fruity dessert.  The mild sweetness doesn't interfere with the sophisticated spices that make this a dinner you could serve good company.  It's a complex sauce with a bold, rich flavor, delicately nuanced but not busy and cluttered like too much store-bought ethnic food.<br /><br />I could wish for a little more robust texture.  This sauce pours out of the jar very thinly, and I need to simmer longer than the allotted time to make it stand up.  But that's a minor issue, since I can eventually make it work, and the flavor more than makes up for the inconvenience.  This sauce is a new regular in my household menu.

review/summary: Delicious Mango Curry
review/text: I first tried this sauce with fresh naan and Tilda Basmati rice that perfectly compliments the complexity of the sauce. Chicken breast pieces, olive oil grilled onion, fresh peas and baby corn make for an abslutely delicious Indian treat that is guaranteed to please. Top it with a coconut kheer for desert and you have a real winner!
