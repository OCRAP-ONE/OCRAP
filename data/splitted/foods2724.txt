review/summary: Weak cider flavor, strong artificial sweetener flavor
review/text: I guess you get what you pay for... I thought I'd give this a try since it's cheaper than the big-name cider K-cups, but it was a waste of money.  I would hardly even call it cider.  It has a very weak cider flavor, but a sickeningly strong artificial sweetener flavor.  It really tastes bitter and leaves a bad aftertaste.  I hate to throw things away, so I guess I'll save the rest of the K-cups for sometime when I'm really desperate!  Would definitely not buy again!

review/summary: No Apples In Sight
review/text: This is Crap. There's no apples in it. This is a waste of money, I bought three boxes, tasted one k-cup, poured  it out and tossed the remaining boxes in the garbage. I didn't even want to give it away to anyone in fears they would never speak to me again. This is no comparison to Naturals apple cider, which I constantly buy and drink every night, well almost every night.

review/summary: Great Instant Sugar Free Cider
review/text: I am surprised by the negative reviews here.  I mean, instant cider (the kind you get in the packets) will never taste like real cider.  This is actually better than the brands of instant cider I have found.  Yes, it is sweet, and the caramel "finish" is a nice addition.  This is the only K-Cup product I have found that is sugar free, which I appreciate.  If you enjoy instant cider, I wouldn't hesitate.

review/text: I was surprised to see this sugar free version of a favorite of mine and was although looking forward to it, I ordered with a bit of skepticism as oftentimes these drinks can be a bit "watered-down" for my liking.<br /><br />I'm pleased to report that this product was exactly as advertised...a great sugar free hot cider beverage with a nice hint of caramel.  While you can certainly taste the caramel in the beverage, one of the joys of this product is when you first bring it up to your face to sip...the aroma of caramel along with spice notes of the cider is really a snapshot of fall.  This is a product that you and your entire family will enjoy guilt-free!

review/summary: Horrible Smell, Inconsistent Quality...
review/text: I picked up a box of these at either Target or the Navy Exchange...can't remember. They are absolutely terrible though. The smell alone is enough to make you want to toss out the entire box, but I figured I'd at least try it. Thankfully they don't taste as retched as they smell, but they're still not good. I made two k-cups on two different days thinking maybe the first was just a bum cup...nope.<br /><br />My husband went to make a cup and he remarked right before putting the cup in the machine that it felt and sounded empty. Well, all he got was water with the slightest tint of brown to it. He tried a second cup...same thing happened. He finally said screw it and put in a k-cup of decaf coffee...came out perfect, so it was the cups that had the issue, not the machine.<br /><br />I absolutely do NOT recommend these. I can't compare the smell to anything, but it's truly disgusting. There has got to be a better cider k-cup out there somewhere. For now I'll just stick to my packets of cider mix that require some hot water. At least they have a pleasant smell, and actually taste like cider!

review/text: I loved these when I ordered and used them last year.  I kept an extra box in a cool, dry place over the summer.  When i went to make a cup tonite, was dissapointed that it simoly tasted like hot water.  Figuring that it might have been just one pad pod, tried FOUR additional pods with the same result.  Checked the box and expiration is next month....but no warning on the mix evaporating in the cups.  What a waste....very dissapointing since i had thought this was a great drink to curb cool weather munchies.

review/text: I had high hopes for this, despite knowing from reviews here that it contained a sugar substitute. I love hot cider, and especially caramel cider. It smelled great brewing but when I went to take a sip -- ick! The artificial sugar makes this intolerable for me. People who routinely use stuff like Sweet n Low will probably love this. Me, I'm just glad I got this in a sampler rather than buying a huge box as I was tempted to do. Grove Square needs to offer an option that uses real sugar because I think they got it right otherwise. Disappointed. Wanted to really like this.

review/summary: Horrible.  The worst k-cup I've had by far.
review/text: I've probably tried 40+ (maybe more than that) k-cup varieties thus far and this is the only one that is just plain horrible.  The powder rarely comes out correctly (and the fact that you are talking about a powered cider should stop you right there), it has a far too-sweet taste, and well, frankly, it just tastes bad.  My wife and I found the Green Mountain naturals Cider cups on clearance locally (we liked them so much we went back and bought like 16-18 boxes), but I have problems with sugar so I thought I would try this.  Bad idea.  It is borderline undrinkable.  It is, however, better cold than hot, but that's not saying much.  Low price, low quality.  Even the physically cup itself isn't made as well as the "real" k-cups.  It is made to fit in a Keurig brewer.  It is not a true k-cup.  Note that the title says "for Keurig K-Cup Brewers".  It is worded that way for a reason.  Avoid like the plague.  If you can handle sugar, check out the Green Mountain version.  If you can't, well, I've not found a better choice either.  In fairness, apparently everything this company makes isn't horrible.  My wife loves their Peppermint Hot chocolate.  Neither one of us can stand this crap however.

review/text: I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, but this product really isn't that bad. There really isn't an after taste and not as intense as I thought it would have been as some of the reviews have made it out to be. The flavor is not amazing, but not bad either. I was expecting a little more zing. All in all, I paid 9.99 for 24 cups and I am not disappointed. Yes the "natural" and "real" product is better (I have tried both), but if I see this product at that good of a price again, I will definitely buy it. 3 out of 5 stars for value and taste (yes it's still enjoyable).

review/summary: Cant use this in a Keurig!!!  WTF!
review/text: This product doesn't fit into a  Keurig K-Cup Brewer.  You just use a knife to puncture the lid, dump it into a cup, and fill it with hot water.  Could use a Keurig to fill it, I suppose.  Wasted 3 until I realized this.  I gave it 1 star because it tasted OK.  Use the Keurig name to charge extra.  Not acceptable.

review/text: I'm allergic to aspartame and have bad kidney problems after drinking it unknowingly.  I ordered this product and would not have if it had said SUGAR FREE.  I would've had a clue that I couldn't drink it.  Ingredient labeling should be mandatory.  It certainly wasn't advertised correctly and completely wasted my money.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I was very hesitant to order this product because of the negative reviews. I'm so glad that I went ahead and ordered because it is so tasty. It's warming and relaxing on a chilly fall day. I don't ever drink anything that is sweetened with sugar and I am used to the flavor of aspartame so I found no odd flavors in this at all. I also bought the natural apple cider ones made by Green Mountain Coffee from my local BB&B because they are so expensive on Amazon. I found that I actually don't like those as much as the Grove Square. They are very acidic and don't contain any of the delicious seasonings. If I doctor up the plain apple cider with a shot or 2 of Torani sugar-free brown sugar and cinnamon flavoring then the Green Mountain version almost tastes as good as these Grove Square cider cups. If you regularly use artificial sweeteners in your beverages then I don't think you will be at all disappointed in the flavor of the Grove Square Spiced Apple Cider Cups.<br /><br />As a side note, I always clean out my used K-cups in order to put them in my recycling. Because they contain an instant powder, there is nothing left behind in the Grove Square cups. The Green Mountain apple cider cups contain a really gross mush of nasty reconstituted apple. It's a little off putting.

review/text: I was very excited to find a cheaper cider. However, it is most likely worth the expense to get green mountain brand. Unfortunately I did not realize that the product was artifically sweetened. When it came I saw on the box that it was and tried it anyway. Luckily one of my roommates enjoyed it so was not a total lose.

The Cider flavor on the other hand is wonderful.  In fact, I would go to say that the Cider K-Cup is my favorite K-Cup product.  My family uses our machines daily (sometimes hourly) and when we have it, the Cider pack is one of everyone's favorites.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it's taking 3-5 weeks to ship at the moment!

review/text: I am not sure why all the negativity about this product. I think it tasts pretty good....even my husband thought it was good; better than the spiced cider and he is pretty picky. a good drink for a cool, fall evening or winter day. We have our own well and only use well water or botten water which has no chlorine in it....I think if you are on city water and using city water it would definitely alter the taste. My daughter and son-in-law, and my colleague also enjoy it. I tried my colleagues and am ordering my own.

review/summary: Take the bad reviews seriously....
review/text: I am addicted to caramel apple cider - and being only 10 calories and fairly inexpensive, I wanted so much to like this product. I thought even if it wasn't the best cider I'd ever had, it would at least be a good enough substitute for when I was watching my weight and couldn't afford to go to Starbucks. I was so wrong - what a waste of money! First off, it smelled so bad that it made me nauseous. I brought it to class with me, and was worried the whole time that everyone around me could smell it. Then, the taste was unbearable. I took a sip, gagged, tried adding some fat-free whipped cream, sugar-free caramel syrup, and cinnamon - still disgusting, the awful cider taste overpowered anything I put in. Needless to say, I wasted $10, will be throwing out all the k-cups, and will have to look for my cider fix elsewhere. Take the bad reviews seriously - I wish I had!

review/text: I was a bit leery when I ordered this product but it is fabulous!  No aftertaste at all and if you set it on a smaller cup, it is just the right strength--not too weak at all.  I do doctor it a bit though.  Before I brew, I put about 6 cinnamon red hots in the cup, along with a cinnamon stick.  Then when done, I add a light sprinkle of my own mix of cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Almost as wonderful as my freshly simmered REAL apple cider!  The "caramel" part of this drink is what really makes it yummy!  Perfect for that cool autumn night, or anytime.  Highly recommend this drink!  And the price is wonderful too.

review/summary: Very Bad Taste
review/text: This product is made with aspartamane, but that doesn't bother me. I only drink diet sodas instead of regular ones whenever I have the occassional soda (try to limit it to 1-2 a week) so the taste doesn't bother me, I also use Stevia and Spenda at home so I'm accustomed the the different sugar-free flavors.<br />I had such high hopes for this drink. I was looking forward to having a cup of hot cider at work. Granted I didn't think it would taste like real cider but I'd been looking forward to a hot apple-y drink.<br />When my shipment came in I brought it to work and had my first cup. Immediately I could smell it. It smelled really good at first. If you put your nose too close you can smell kinda a sickly-sweet scent. I tried it and nearly spat. It tasted extremely chemically and entirely overwhelming. The "caramel" was caramel only insofar as what a machine can reproduce. It was not caramel as I was expecting, not even slightly.<br />I tried letting it cool and drinking it cold. It was perhaps a teensy bit more palatable.<br />I tried watering it down. That helped. The Keurig at work only goes to 12 ounces. So perhaps ones that go to 16 ounces might diffuse the flavor a little more. This is why I gave it a 2 star instead of just 1.<br /><br />Now these things just sit forgotten in a drawer. Maybe I can figure out something to do with them...

review/summary: This is a delicious DESSERT!
review/text: After reading Feeding Baby Green: The Earth Friendly Program for Healthy, Safe Nutrition During Pregnancy, Childhood, and Beyond I make most of my babies food because it is exceedingly difficult to find nutritionally balanced ready-made baby food. However, I do keep a few ready made pouches on hand as back up.<br /><br />I have some gripes about modern baby food in general.<br /><br />1)Most of them are loaded with sweet carbs and are not nutritionally balanced for babies needs, but they do not reveal this easily.<br />2)They are formulated according to what babies will eat happily and costs little to produce, versus what is actually good for babies.<br />3)For babies up to one year old, the perfect food is human milk which is 50% fats, 37% carbs and the rest is protein and vitamins/ minerals. After 6 months babies need increasing amounts of protein. None of the organic "baby food" on the market even attempts to provide this proper balance of nutrition in their foods.<br />4)The predominance of the carb dense baby foods are directly contributing to the obesity epidemic in America. These foods are getting babies hooked into an addictive and damaging insulin cycle that gives the USA the highest rate of childhood diabetes in the world. People think that "organic" equals "healthy" and that is what the marketing from the baby food companies wants you to think. There is organic junk food too and the VAST majority of organic baby food on the market is dessert, not nutritious food.<br /><br />Having said all of that, this flavor of Baby Gourmet food is the yummiest Banana pudding I have ever had. But make no mistake, it is dessert and I only break this one out if our baby needs a little help getting started on the healthy stuff. I would never give him more than a couple bites of this in one sitting.<br /><br />Notice that the Nutritional Facts are not revealed on Amazon's description or on the Baby Gourmet website! Well, scrupulous Mommies, here it is! Total Carbs 12g (with 10 grams of sugar). 0 protien and 0 fat. Thats not added sugar, it is sugar from the fruit ingredients (complex carbs) which is better than table sugar (simple carbs). However, this food is recommended for babies 8+ months and they have increased protien requirements, not increased carb requirements. Keep this in mind when choosing what to feed your children and balance out the ratios (fats, carbs, protiens) at every meal for a healthy thriving baby.<br /><br />Was this review helpful?

review/summary: Raw Organics going back to Paradise
review/text: Raw is eating from your Organic garden of fresh grown fruits and vegetables.It is also all the nuts growing from the mountains that surrounds us through out the land from the forest. Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .<br />I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don't care for the meat itself and no pork.<br />I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.<br />Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I'd like to make home made all fruit yes that's right not jelly or jam.<br />Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.<br />So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.<br />well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption.

review/summary: Recipe of Spicy Sesame Linguine seems to have changed for worse & Price gone up by more than 50%
review/text: We have been ordering Spicy Sesame Linguine for the past 2-3 years as this was our favorite pasta! However, we recently realized that the taste of this linguine has lost its sesame flavor completely. The pasta now looks very different in color and texture and from our experience has now become completely tasteless.<br /><br />Moreover, the price of this pasta has increased from around $13.71 in 2010 (via Subscribe & Save) to $20.30 in July 2011, hence the price has ramped up MORE than 50%!<br /><br />What a pity the manufacturer of this pasta seem to have changed the recipe for worse. We were so disappointed that we even sent a complaint note on Amazon, who informed us that they have informed our disappointment to Al Dente. We hope that Al dente will make this pasta as delicious as it once used to be. Thank you.

review/summary: I'm Buying In Bulk From Now On
review/text: If they sell this locally, I haven't found it yet. When I head out to the Detroit area I always stop at the Westborn  Market in Dearborn MI. This is a high end green grocer with a ton of food delicacies that carries all varieties of Al Dente pasta. Despite the fact that this pasta is dry and not freshly made, it more than makes up for it with the wonderful variety of flavored pastas it makes. I use the sesame flavored fettuccine with Asian stir fry. It is a little spicy and has a texture that is often lacking in pasta. I've also tried the chile fettuccine which complements tex mex dishes, the wild mushroom which is divine with a hunter stew, stroganoff, or mushroom ragout, and the spinach and whole wheat which are great with anything.<br />These pastas are lovely and wildly flavorful and work with a fast evening meal or something a little more gourmet. They cook quickly and require no special work. Just prepare them until they are cooked yet firm.

review/text: I originally discovered this pasta at my local QFC supermarket at $4.49 per 12OZ unit. The price point being a little rich for my blood, I only bought it on certain occasions. Buying it from Amazon in 6 packs at $2.33 per 12OZ unit and the free shipping option, along with the $5.00 off promo code that cuts back the per unit price about 25 cents, makes it a much better buy and now a regular addition to the dinner table.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for the fair deal and stocking Al Dente Pastas.

review/summary: Tea Antioxidants
review/text: Tea Antioxidants<br />----------------<br /><br />Antioxidants can help the body protect itself against free radicals--molecules that can damage cells. Antioxidants in tea called flavonoids can do that.<br /><br />Whether iced or hot, Teas made from real tea leaves provide more than great taste. Like fruits and vegetables, regular and decaffeinated brewed teas contain natural antioxidants called flavonoids* (10-22, 68, 69). Research suggests that antioxidants can be beneficial to health by helping the body protect itself from the harmful effects of "free radicals" (1-9, 26-30, 73-75). Free radicals, molecules which occur in the environment and are naturally produced by the body, can cause damage to cells. Chronic damage by free radicals is one factor thought to contribute to the development of many chronic diseases including heart disease or cancer. An average cup of brewed green or black tea has 150-200 mg of flavonoids (10-21).<br /><br />Currently, tea's potential health benefits are the focus of many scientific studies, and new research is emerging regularly. The American Dietetic Association in its Position Paper on Functional Foods included black and green tea as functional foods. Based on the available scientific research, the paper stated that the health benefits of drinking black or green tea include possible reduced risk for coronary heart disease, as well as gastric, esophageal and skin cancers (33). Tea and tea flavonoids have also been shown to help strengthen the body's immune system (34-43, 57-64), protect teeth by inhibiting plaque bacteria (44, 45, 56), potentially fight free radicals produced during strenuous exercise (76-80), and possibly increase calories burned during everyday activities (65, 66). While this emerging research is promising, more studies on the role of tea and tea antioxidants must be completed before drawing any conclusions about tea's contribution to health and wellness.<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Heart Health Research<br />---------------------<br /><br />Heart disease is a major cause of preventable disease and death in all regions of the world. In America over 40% of all deaths are caused by heart disease which affects over 64 million men and women, almost one quarter of the US population (1). In light of such a high incidence of heart disease taking simple dietary steps to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease could have a significant impact on public health. As part of a healthy lifestyle regular tea drinking may help maintain a healthy heart.<br /><br />Current Research<br /><br />A number of population studies conducted around the world including studies in United States and Europe have consistently found that drinking black tea is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease. Three separate analyses of research showed that drinking three cups of tea daily reduced the risk for cardiovascular disease death or heart attack by about 10-12% (3, 4, 80).<br /><br />One of these analyses reviewed 17 population studies and assessed the effect of tea drinking on stroke, heart attack, and all types of coronary heart disease. Results showed that the rate of heart attack decreased by 11% among those who drank three cups of tea per day (3). A second analysis included seven studies and evaluated consumption of dietary flavonoids and risk of death from heart disease. Reported in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, investigators found a 20% reduction in risk of death from coronary heart disease among study participants who consumed the most dietary flavonoids (tea was the primary source of flavonoids) when compared to study participants who consumed the least dietary flavonoids(4). A third review of 10 studies showed that drinking around 3 cups of tea each day reduced the incidence of heart attack by 11% and reduced the rate of death from heart disease by 11% (80). Together, these studies show drinking tea regularly may help maintain a healthy heart as a part of a healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />How can tea do that?<br /><br />Since heart disease is a complex disease with multiple risk factors there are several possible roles tea may play that might explain the reduced risk of disease observed in people consuming black tea. Clinical studies have shown that tea flavonoids may promote good heart health by improving endothelial function (44, 45, 46) and by reducing blood cholesterol levels (64, 66, 68, 79).<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Tea and Body Protection<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />A healthy immune system protects the body from infection and disease. A number of test tube studies have shown that some flavonoids help immune response by acting as anti-allergic (135, 136, 137), anti-inflammatory (138, 139), anti-viral (140) and anti-bacterial agents (80, 141, 142, 143). Furthermore, flavonoids have been shown to modulate the function of blood cells that are relevant for the immune response (81) and in both human and animal studies flavonoids have been shown to fight bacteria (80, 141, 142, 143) and thus improve resistance to infection. In addition, cell studies have shown that flavonoids in black and green tea have anti-inflammatory properties (138, 139).<br /><br />Studies specifically on tea flavonoids in test tube and animal research found that tea flavonoids may help maintain proper immune response by helping control inflammation (138, 139, 144) and by reducing the production of proteins involved in inflammation (145). These properties suggest that tea flavonoids help improve resistance to infection. Research conducted in test tubes and small pigs suggests that tea flavonoids may also help sustain a healthy gastrointestinal tract by promoting the proper balance of bacteria in the colon (146, 147). Emerging research has also found that tea antioxidants can inhibit the growth of unhealthy bacteria and promote the growth of good bacteria in the gut. In addition, recent test tube-based studies have found that tea flavonoids can kill bacteria known to cause stomach ulcers (148, 80, 149).<br /><br />Theanine, a unique amino acid found in tea, activates specific cells involved in the "first line of defense" cells of the immune system, which may reduce the risk of viral and bacterial infections (127). This suggests that regular tea consumption may help support the body's immune system. Researchers from the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University recently published new data indicating that theanine can help the body ward off infection and disease and may strengthen the immune system (150). In a follow up human clinical trial, published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, these researchers showed that after drinking 20 ounces of black tea daily for two to four weeks, participant's immune cells produced two - four times more interferon. Interferon is a protein that helps strengthen or improve the body's immune response. Coffee had no effect on increasing the production of interferon (127). While research on effects of tea on the body's immune system and its potential to help protect the body is just emerging, experts are encouraged by these promising results.<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Tea and Appearance<br />------------------<br /><br />The possibility that green tea helps with weight loss has been a recent topic in the media. What is the potential role of tea in helping maintain healthy weight? Unsweetened, fresh-brewed tea, both black and green has no sodium, no sugar, no fat and virtually no calories, yet tea is a satisfying, aromatic beverage. This makes tea an ideal choice for a weight control plan that is part of a healthy lifestyle, especially when substituting for other sugar sweetened beverages. Another factor to potentially helping maintain a healthy weight is that regular tea contains caffeine which has been shown to increase energy expenditure (number of calories burned)(17,18). In a study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, consumption of 3-4 servings of oolong tea was shown to increase energy expenditure and the rate of fat breakdown. In addition, subjects drinking tea spent energy at a 3% faster rate and burnt about 70 more calories a day than those consuming water (57).<br /><br />Some emerging research on energy expenditure conducted with tea and tea extracts has suggested that increases in metabolism and rate of fat breakdown may not be solely due to caffeine in the tea. One study measuring the effect of green tea extract on energy expenditure in people showed that drinking either caffeinated water or tea extract significantly increased the number of calories burned, but in addition the rate of fat breakdown was significantly higher for participants drinking tea extract than those drinking the caffeinated water(58). In a second study researchers looked at group of flavonoids in tea and its effect on weight loss and body fat. They found significant weight loss and a significant reduction in total body fat in the people drinking tea flavonoids (equal to 3-4 cups of tea per day) when compared to participants drinking the placebo (66).<br /><br />While this is active area of research; the preliminary evidence suggests the tea drinking can increase energy expenditure and fat burning. However, there are no conclusive studies that tea drinking has beneficial effects on weight loss. Still, tea is a satisfying, calorie-free beverage that can be substituted for sweetened beverages and is a delicious alternative to plain water in a healthy weight management plan.<br /><br />*While tea is a naturally rich source of antioxidants, it is not a substitute for fruits or vegetables which provide a wide range of antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. Please consult your doctor regarding a diet/nutritional plan that is right for you.<br /><br />Lipton's Unique History<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Sir Thomas Lipton was a Scottish-born entrepreneur and innovator who decided in 1880, at the age of 40, that he would make tea accessible to all at acceptable prices and with a guaranteed quality. Before Thomas Lipton, tea had been expensive. It was a beverage for the rich and variable in taste as a result of improper packaging and transportation. Thomas Lipton acquired tea estates in Ceylon (today Sri Lanka) and organized packaging and transportation at low cost to sell his teas 'direct from the tea garden to the tea pot'. In 1893, he established the Thomas J Lipton Co., a tea packing company with its headquarters and factory in Hoboken, New Jersey.<br /><br />LIPTON teas were an immediate success in the US. Thomas Lipton was knighted by Queen Victoria, who made him Sir Thomas Lipton in 1898 at the age of forty-eight.<br /><br />Thanks to Sir Thomas Lipton, LIPTON is the world's leading tea brand and present in more than 80 countries.<br /><br />LIPTON. The company that serves tea to the world.<br /><br /> Reinventing Tea<br />------------------<br /><br />Sir Thomas J. Lipton pioneered many practices in tea manufacturing and the company he founded has continued this tradition of quality and innovation:<br /><br />  * 1890: First manufacturer to buy his own tea estates to ensure quality and consistency<br />  * 1890: First manufacturer to sell tea exclusively in packages<br />  * 1906: Created first British blend of tea to be imported into Japan<br />  * 1910: First to use printed tags with brewing instructions<br />  * 1944: "Brisk" tea launched in US<br />  * 1954: LIPTON introduces the Flo-Thru double-chamber teabag<br />  * 1964 LIPTON Iced tea mix introduced in the US<br />  * 1972: LIPTON Iced tea in a can introduced in the US<br />  * 1999: LIPTON Cold Brew launched, iced tea prepared with real tea in cold water<br /><br />More than 100 years of "firsts" and innovations has enabled LIPTON to bring more tea enjoyment to more people in the world than any other tea company.Sir Thomas would be proud. But he wouldn't let us stop here. In that spirit of tireless inventiveness, research and discovery, LIPTON is helping to shed more light on the exciting health benefits of brewed black and green tea, including the protective qualities of flavonoid antioxidants.<br /><br />LIPTON. Constantly reinventing the way the world enjoys the goodness of tea.

review/summary: Excellent healthy delicious organic soup base! Great for kids!
review/text: A friend told me about this product. She is very health-conscious when it comes to food for her kids. One of her kids has allergy, so she has also been looking for good gluten free food products. She first found this line of soup base in a high-end food store in the East Coast and tried it out. Her whole family loved (and still loves) it. She sent me one as gift a few months ago and we tried it out and my kids love it too. We used to boil meat and vegetable or 2-3 hours and used the soup to cook food for the kids. This was very time and energy consuming. We tried other soup bases in the past but the kids complained about being very thirsty after drinking those. This one is great. It saves us a lot of work and the kids still get healthy delicious soup! I recently found it on Amazon & bought 5 different flavors. The order arrived within 2 days with my Amazon Prime membership and we now can enjoy the different flavors.

review/summary: Pleased
review/text: Really enjoyed using this product. I love that it is vegan and gives a similar flavor to things as the non vegan versions. We made our Mexican fideo with it finally and we had really missed it, but no more. Good value and good flavor. Can't wait to try it in other stuff.

review/summary: Great soup base
review/text: I like that it is vegetarian and low sodium. It is not salty and has a very bland taste which taste like vegetable powder. It is great as a filler or soup base.

review/summary: Great for my faux chicken noodle soups and beyond...
review/text: I initially purchased this because my daughter wanted homemade chicken noodle soup. Just when I thought that I couldn't have chicken noodle soup again ( being vegan) I find this seasoning. How pleasantly surprised I was too. I made my faux chicken noodle soup and the results were amazing! Not only is this base gluten free, low sodium, but vegan as well, and I can use this seasoning on other items as well, like salads and other soups and stews! A bit pricey, but well worth it!

review/summary: Tastes GREAT
review/text: I don't write many reviews yet read a whole lot of them.  I have been slowly weaning my hubby off of meat and meat stuff for a long time now. This usually means that I cook two meals most nights.  At least I no longer have to use seperate bullion.  this tastes like the REAL deal according to my hubby.  He can spot a substitute from a mile off and he didn't pick up on this till I told him.  I made chicken noodle soup (added real chick at end for him and TVP for me) and the same broth, noodles veggies etc for both.  HE LOVED IT.  PS the "beef" tastes just as good, made a nice gravy with onions and made salsburry steak for him and salsburry veggie burger for me.  It also passed muster.

review/summary: Pistachio Review
review/text: I thought the shelled pistacios would be a huge time saver.  It's certainly nice, but the product itself isn't as fresh.  Once that pistachio leaves the shell and is exposed to the open air, it really starts to lose out on flavor and texture over time.<br /><br />Basically, big time saver, but you lose a lot in flavor.  I'll go back to the shell.

review/summary: great value
review/text: I have done comparative shopping and found that shelled pistachios actually are the best value and buying on Amazon's Subscribe & Save can't be beaten.  Thy are fresh and taste great.  After dried cashews and dried hazelnuts, they are the nut lowest in fat content.  I use them as a snack, in salads and I chop them up and add them to pistachio pudding.
