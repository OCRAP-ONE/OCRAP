review/summary: Freaking delicious
review/text: I love these.  I'm not sure they count as "healthy", since they do have like 200 calories apiece and a fair bit of fat, but they claim to have a very low glycemic index (probably because of the nuts), so that's something.  Anyway, delicious.  I just wish it were possible to get them cheaper.

review/summary: Overpriced bars, but REALLY delicious!
review/text: These taste great: the apricot flavor is not too overpowering, the bar itself is not too sweet, and I personally love the coconut aspect of it. One bar is honestly enough to fill you up if you are hankering for a lunch but either can't make it, or are on a diet. I don't suggest it as a meal replacement though.<br /><br />Also, this bar is perfect for a post work-out snack, whether it be intense cardio, or weightlifting.<br /><br />My only question is some of the ingredients: "Chicory Fiber" and "Apple Fiber"?? Are these merely included to up the Fiber content to fool carb-conscious folks into picking these up? Are these fibers even effective fibers??<br /><br />USEFUL: If you hate coconut (which a lot of people inexplicably do), you will not like this bar. There seems to be an overabundance of coconut in this bar, from the combination of the "Shredded Coconut" and the "Coconut Chips". I am assuming they made those distinctions because combining them into one Coconut ingredient would have pushed it ahead of the other main ingredients on the list, and this is supposed to be an "Almond & Apricot" bar.

review/text: I purchased the Almond & Apricot bars for myself and enjoyed how fresh, tasty and convenient they are.  Well, my college aged son discovered them in my pantry on one of his weekends home - now I have to replenish the KIND bar stash frequently since he loves them as well.  His favorite variety is the Macadamia nut one but he also lieks the Fruit & Nut delight.  We both like they are nutritious and filling without being overly sweet.  Well worth the money!

review/summary: Love these bars!
review/text: I discovered these bars some time ago at my local grocery store - they were on this little display with some other things. The next time I went there, I couldn't find them. And I couldn't really remember what they were called. So, I was very excited when I saw them at Starbucks probably a year later. They are, of course, way too expensive there! I wasn't able to find them reliably anywhere around town, so I found them online and now I have two boxes (two different flavors) auto-shipped to me from Amazon. Now I have begun to see these in stores more often so I've been trying some other flavors.<br /><br />I used to eat Kashi cereal each morning but now I have one of these bars with my requisite Dr. Pepper. I'm not sure how long ago I changed my breakfast choice, but I have lost about 15 pounds (that needed to be lost) since I changed over to the bars. I definitely didn't change earlier than November, 2010. And, instead of being starving at 11 a.m., I don't get seriously hungry until later.*<br /><br />* These claims have not been evaluated by anyone, and no animals have been tortured to prove them.

review/text: The bar is a great snack to eat when I'm in a hurry. It's has a great taste and a chewy texture. Also, it's satisfying to get that nice crunch when you bite right into one of the almonds. The only problem I have is that it's hard to just eat one. I often find myself reaching for more. The fiber content is also an added bonus. Overall, this bar is a great, healthy alternative for a snack.<br /><br />For those who want the nutrition facts: it has 170 calories, 11g fat (5g from saturated fat), 16g carbs (13g sugar), and 4g protein.

review/summary: Great taste for Fiber & Protein
review/text: I just discovered these KIND Fruit & Nut, Almond & Coconut, All Natural, Gluten Free Bars at an airport. These were great.  They come in other flavors, but this is my favorite.  Almonds, because they are healthy, high in fiber and coconut is just yummy! Noticed they are sold in local supermarket but only in single bars, not by the box.  So, it is good to see them offered on Amazon and at a comparable, if not lower cost. I found them easy to munch on during the flight, filling (no meals on flight the flight) and was a great meal substitute with a bottle water.  I suggest you check the carb, fiber, protein content on each flavor as the % varies based on ingredients. I would not recommend these for anyone who wears dentures or braces, because they have a moist, but chewy consistency.  But, if you can take time to chew without worries, it's a very nice treat.

review/summary: KIND with Chocolate!
review/text: I love this bar. I am fond of most of the KIND flavors, but this one has slightly different properties because of the chocolate (which is really dark and yummy) ... I don't know why others don't like it. This bar manages to be slightly crispy and chewy at the same time. I am not a huge sesame fan, but it works in this recipe. It's dangerous for me to buy a whole box; I want to inhale them all at once. I suggest to try one out from a store and then order them here online in bulk if you love them as much as I do.

review/summary: Sooo Goood!!!
review/text: I had my first KIND bar at Starbucks... The first taste of the Mango Macadamia and I was in heaven. One day, a Barista at Starbucks recommended the Fruit and Nut Delight and I have been hooked since. My boyfriend, who is picky about things, LOVED this bar.  I am thrilled to have found them on Amazon.com and will Subscribe and Save!  They are nearly [...]in health food stores..Ordering them this way saves me money.  Jillian Michaels also recommends them as a healthy snack bar for kids. She was the reason I decided to locate them in bulk.  They are gluten free and anyone who can't eat gluten and have had these bars are rejoicing!

review/summary: Kind Bar!
review/text: These bars are delicious!!!  I've always been a sucker for coconut and almond so I figured this flavor of Kind Bars would be right up my alley.  I was right.<br /><br />The bars are incredibly soft and moist; they bend by themselves if you hold them horizontally.  The crunch of the almonds plus the sweetness of the coconut and honey is so tasty, it's hard to have just one bar.  Amazon makes a good deal.  Only about a dollar per bar when I ordered them.  I will definitely order more :)

You can taste the apricot, as a subtle aftertaste, but other than that, it might as well not be in the bar. The coconut pieces linger in your mouth, so carry a toothbrush close-by.

I don't feel guilty indulging with these.  They are great to take along to the office, for lunch or snacks, or on the road, and, considering their size, they are really quite filling and satisfying! They are, of course, a little pricey, but, buying them by the case from Amazon (especially if you use Subscribe and Save) makes them less expensive than they are at the local health food store. Excellent!

review/summary: one of a KIND, delicious gluten free bar
review/text: I have never been one to rely on nor crave a bar. Following a gluten-free and low- allergy controlled diet, I stumbled across these KIND bars while looking for nutritious options for my teens, thinking I would be able to try them. Well indeed they truly are scrumptuous. My 18 year old loves them and when running out the door will grab one or two for the road. I have only tried the Walnut and Date and the Cranbery, Almonds and Oxidants as I follow a blood type diet and do not love things that are too sweet. We are on our second box of each and I will be looking at the other varieties to try in time.

I stumbled upon these at a local store, bought one of each flavor, and just fell in love.  The Almond Coconut is my favorite.  It really tastes like a candy bar!  It's so nice to have something so healthy in my bag so that I can avoid temptation when temptation strikes!

review/summary: Tastes great, but watch how many you eat daily
review/text: These bars are made from a host of natural sources and taste great, but are also calorie dense and high in fats (nuts are high in fat), high in carbs, and are very sweet. I ordered the apricot/coconut which is heavenly, and almost inhaled two boxes. I started to notice some weight gain and when I checked the calorie count, I was shocked to see that one little bar has up to 190 calories! I was eating up to 3-4 bars a day because they taste so good and are small and light. I realized that I consuming over 700 additional calories daily. Yikes! I think these are great for athletes and runners who burn lots of calories and need the extra fuel or as a snack in between meals. The only problem is that they are small and light and for me I don't get enough satisfaction from just one bar.

review/summary: FYI...Almond & Apricot has coconut
review/text: I bought the Almond & Apricot flavor, however the bar has an overwhelming coconut flavor.  Looking at the ingredient list it is "Almonds, dried coconut, apricots, ...etc."  This would be fine if you like coconut, but I do not.  Just a heads up.

review/summary: Not "healthy"
review/text: These bars may be made of ingredients you can pronouns, but they are not exactly good for you.  The contain high amounts of sugar and fats.  Not the kind of thing you can eat as a snack very often.  I like the taste, but I have found bars that are actually good for you, so I won't be buying these anymore.  Also, I find them way overpriced.

review/summary: Eat at your own risk
review/text: Kind bars taste great and pack a nutritional punch, but they pack another kind of punch as well.  On October 10, I bit into an almond/fruit bar and broke a front crown.  What made it worse (and more expensive) is that I was en route from Chicago to San Francisco at the time so the accident made it imperative to seek emergency dental care for a temporary crown in SF and then have the permanent crown made upon my return home.  Total sticker price for that Kind bar:  $1665, not counting the cost of the bar itself.  I called Kind's corporate headquarters in New York and was referred to its insurance company, Chubb, which declined to assist me with any of my bills on the grounds that the company was not negligent.  That's a matter of interpretation, I think, but rather than pursue silly litigation that would cost more than I've already spent, I think I'll just do my civic duty and warn Kind's buyers in the most public way I can think of to beware when eating these bars.  They're delicious, but they can break teeth.  Let the Kind eater beware:  caveat emptor, caveat vore.

review/summary: Horrible tasting and WAY overpriced and may break your teeth.
review/text: I was looking for a healty snack and these got good reviews. My first impression was that these are very small and extremely bland tasting. The almonds were slightly soft and did not thaste very much like almonds, but it was edible. The second bar had a spot that tasted really bad as if one of the nuts were bad. The third bar was ok, but then it was almost every bar after that was bad. I ended upo throwing the last few bars away. The packaging was sealed properly and it was well within it's expiration date. These bars also have a way of twisting your teeth around to the point I thought I might have damaged one of my teeth. If you want an equally healthy snack for a better price, pick up a bag of mixed nuts/trail mix from your grocery store.

review/summary: a better snack than most granola bars
review/text: The almond and apricot bars make the best emergency snacks I've found. The bar is pliable rather than extra chewy or crunchy, and while it's definitely sweet it's not as sweet as the ones with yogurt. Finishing one is usually enough to fix a hungry headache or blood-sugar crash, and satiating enough that I'm not rooting around for more food if I've somehow skipped lunch. The gluten-free is an extra bonus; I've got a few friends with celiac, so being able to share with them is quite nice.

review/text: I buy these often, and I get a pretty good deal from amazon compared to getting it in the stores.  I keep some in my desk at work, gym bag, and ocket book for when a hunger attack comes on.  I like that it is low glycemic too, I don't worry too much about a rapid spike in sugar.  It is very sweet for those with sensitive taste buds.  Not a meal replacement but a good hold off until you can get a meal.

review/text: We love Kind bars and regularly get about four of the varieties.  They are delicious, healthy, and reasonably priced on Amazon.  You pay a lot more for them in shops, that is, if you can find them.<br /><br />They also make great gifts, especially 'thank-you' gifts. I just sent two orders to my daughter and brother.<br /><br />We are delighted with the Amazon subscription program.  We automatically receive three different Kinds every two months, but if we run out, it is easy to get an extra order quickly. The service is excellent.

review/text: I use these bars (macadamia and apricot are my favorite) as meal replacements on the go. They have a tremendous energy punch and satiate my hunger for a long time. The best thing about them is that they taste like real food, not some dry rice crispy treat like so many others.<br /><br />Getting these through Amazon is wonderful because I finally get fresh bars (usually expired in the health food stores near me if I can find them at all) and a terrific price. I definitely recommend subscribing. It's a great service.

review/text: After searching high and low for some kind of snack food bar to stash in my purse that wasn't chock full of soy, hydrogenated oils and other nasty things I gave these a go - and I was amazed!<br /><br />These are delectable - really almost like eating candy, only good for you. I tried about four different flavors so far and have liked them all. I appreciate that the labels are quite clear, so those of us who can't have soy can see at a glance exactly which ones we can and can't have.<br /><br />These did not get mushed or sticky or stale the way so many things do - they are a fantastic option and I will definitely be buying more!

review/summary: One of my favorite
review/text: I absolutely love the flavor of the Kind bars, and this one is my favorite.  For people complaining about the fat.....NUTS HAVE FAT.  But that is the only source of fat in these bars.  Nuts are also full of vitamins and minerals..oh yes and PROTEIN.  These actually do taste like candy, and are a great pick me up snack.  If you want something filling though, and more of a meal replacement...go with Clif bars.  They can keep you going for quite awhile.  My real complaint with these?  The price.  No matter where you get them, they are on the high end.  I have 4 children and I cannot afford to keep these around as a regular staple.  Even buying directly, you have to get them in cases of 72..for over a 100 bucks.  Larabars if I am savvy I can get for about 1.00 a bar, and even though the texture is different (since they pretty much pulverize the nuts) are awesome and simple healthy organic, non GMO, gluten free, raw diet, vegan, most are lactose free variety's, and if the word peanut is not in the ingredients they were made in a non-peanut plant.  Kind can boast most of these too....larabars do take a couple extra steps.  they are also free-trade certified.....Oh and they have 19 flavors of their basic bars.

review/summary: great sweet treat
review/text: Every once in a while, I'll have a KIND bar for my 3 'o clock snack at work. I had no problem polishing off my whole box in around 2 weeks all by myself, because they're so delicious!<br /><br />Like other reviewers have said, the bar tastes really sweet. I'm a candy/chocolate-loving person and I prefer the KIND bar for my sugar fix. It does have 16g carbs, of which 13g are sugar, so while it may be "all natural", it has quite a bit of "all natural" sugar. While not the healthiest snack option, its satisfying and yummy enough to keep me away from my even less healthy options.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed the Almond & Apricot bar, my favorite is the Macadamia and Apricot. If you're worried about a lot of chewiness like some of the other reviewers, try the Macadamia option. It is truly melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the soft macadamias perfectly complement the sweet chewiness of the fruit and coconut with an amazing texture. I haven't tried any other flavors, but I will soon!

review/text: I usually don't like "nutrition" bars- if I'm hungry and in a hurry, I don't like to try and choke down a grain-type bar that requires a lot of water  or liquid to get it down. These bars are great because there's no grain involved. It's just a delightful blend of dried fruit and crunchy toasted almonds- a bit of a tang to balance out the sweetness. Not TOO dry- still moist, chewy, crunchy, and very delicious.<br />I realize grains may be important to some people, but I usually just have trouble eating those style bars.<br />This, I look forward to- and in a pinch, it makes a tasty dessert- healthier than lots of other things.
