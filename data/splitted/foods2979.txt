review/summary: Maybe it really IS jet fuel
review/text: I'd like to give the manuafacturers the benefit of the doubt, but this stuff is hard to swallow (no pun intended).  I love strong coffee, from the Sumatras to the other dark roasts.  That's why I purchased the Jet Fuel.  I also purchased the Kona coffee from the same coffee co. - that is a great roast and I would recommend to anyone.  But this coffee actually has the aroma of old cigarettes...not too appetizing.  I could have just received a bad batch and I'll look to return what I have left (I did give it a few tries).

review/summary: Not as good as usual
review/text: I have ordered many other types of coffee from GMC before and had no issues, however these k-cups were not as good as they usually are. There were grounds in most of the coffee after brewing, which is unusual for k-cups and a few of the cups were perforated in the box. I will order kcups again from this seller but I was a bit disappointed in this shipment.<br /><br />The flavor of this coffee was great!!!

review/summary: Not unique
review/text: I read many reviews before buying both Jet Fuel and Black Tiger because I really wanted an extra strong k-cup brew. I hate to say this but neither of these brews are stronger than any other "extra bold" brews I have tried. If you get this just know that you still need to use a smaller amount of water to make a strong cup of bold tasting coffee. I think the new Starbucks bold brews actually make a stronger cup of coffee.

review/text: A little on the acrid side of bitter, but what else could you expect when you order a coffee named "Jet Fuel"?<br />Definitely one of the best bang for your buck coffees available for the Keurig machines here on Amazon.com. I also loved the no hassle packaging, no extra stuff that will take up room in my recycling bin.<br />I'd buy it again, but I will have to resupply my vanilla creamer stash waaaay more often. I usually like my coffee black but this one is a bit much! If you love super bold coffee, go for it! If you are a breakfast blend with cream and sugar kinda person, maybe opt for the Donut Shop K-Cups instead.

review/text: If you're looking to upgrade from Donut Shop, Jet Fuel is a deep roast that retains Donut Shop's nutty flavor. IMHO Coffee People blends tend toward the weak side, and Jet Fuel follows the trend.

Midnight Magic really is "jet fuel".<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GV90">Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>

When I opened the box, loose coffee scattered all over the floor, and all of 47 cups were stained/soiled with coffee.

With the trouble of sweeping the floor and cleaning each individual remaining cups, buying this product from Amazon does't save me anything. I've been such a big fun of this coffee, but I will not give another shot.

review/summary: Harsh flavor, and yet still  not strong coffee by my standards
review/text: I went out on a limb and purchased this 50 pack of Jet Fuel because of so many good reviews.  Let me start by saying, I like STRONG coffee.  Espresso is fine with me, and when I make my own coffee I make it as strong as can be.  If all I have is instant I  at least quadruple the amount of coffee to water.  In other words, I like a strong coffee, and Jet Fuel by my standards is strong in flavor only.  Okay strong isn't the best word; HARSH would be a better word.  It's not a pleasurable drinking experience.<br /><br />I took some to work to let a coworker try it, and I think he nailed the aroma and flavor of this Jet Fuel coffee.  He said it's like a dirty ashtray.  After he said that it clicked in my mind.  Dang, yes that is what it tastes like.  Now, I will give the benefit of the doubt that I got a bad batch, but so far since I was a sucker and bought 50 of them, I keep drinking them usually adding instant coffee, or another nicer flavored coffee to it to kill the ashtray flavor because all of them taste the same so far.<br /><br />Be warned, I'm no stranger to harsh coffee, but this IMHO is not a pleasant harsh.<br /><br />J

Alright, I'll admit that there are some coffees that are stronger than others, but not very many that are stronger than Jet Fuel. And, this is actually my wife's favorite brew, so no more excuses girly men! This has a very dark, strong flavor with just the right amount of bitterness to round out the flavor. However as mentioned in the title, it's for adults. We drink this as our every day coffee, but also keep some more milder flavors for guests and "weak men".

review/text: Update to my review:  August 2012:  It appears they have changed the formula for this coffee.  It now tastes very thin to me.<br /><br />It used to have a good film of oil on the top after brewing (I don't know what that oil slick is called - but I see it on all the good coffee I drink).<br /><br />Anyway, oil spill is not there any more...<br /><br />Nor is the taste...<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />First Review...<br /><br />For my taste buds - this is it.  Rich and full - with no burnt taste.  'Hint' of sweet finish - i.e. not bitter.<br /><br />Hard to believe this is pod coffee.<br /><br />Five stars!<br /><br />------<br /><br />About my tastes...<br /><br />I have been drinking K-Cups for two years and tried about 2 dozen types of coffee.  Most recently, Timothy's Espresso, which I found it to be thin - and almost undrinkable (after my experience with Jet Fuel).<br /><br />I just order Black Tiger - but not in yet - so no comparison.<br /><br />Also, I often drink Newman's (my wife picks up at Sam's Club).  I thought that was pretty good until the Jet Fuel.  Newman's is fairly rich - but has a slightly over-roasted taste for me... again,compared to the Jet Fuel.

At that rate the savings will pay for the entire Keurig coffee maker in less than 10 weeks.<br /><br />The flavor is strong (but good), so you might want to add creamer to mitigate it.

review/summary: Great for Making Larger Cups
review/text: What I look for in a Keurig cup is the strength to make large cups of coffee.  This one has it and with a pleasant flavor too.  I am able to brew a large into my travel mug and then top it off with the smaller setting into the same mug and it still tastes great.

review/text: I love the coffee itself except for the fact that the package only had 48 cups not 50 and i get grounds in my coffee about every 4th cup.  its not a ton of grounds but enough to be annoyingand i dont want to have to put a strainer on top of my cup but it looks like i may have to.  other than that it is wonderful, almost as strong as i like but will be getting espresso kcups next time.

review/summary: Awesome Fuel for the Morning
review/text: I've been a huge fan K-Cups for the past 6 years at first I started buying from Bed Bath and Beyond but the selections were very few. So I decided to try something different and found Jet Fuel. The taste is amazing with a rich, strong bold flavour. Its very comparable to some of the Starbucks and Kona brand coffee but at half the price.

review/text: Out of all of the bold K-cup coffees that are available on Amazon, I drink only two.  Jet Fuel is one of them.  It is so smooth and flavorful, but without the bitterness that some bold coffees exhibit.  Coffee People has done a great job of formulating a coffee which will "kick-start" you in the morning, but I must confess that even if Jet Fuel was de-caf, I'd still drink it just for the exquisite flavor!

review/summary: The best K-cup so far!
review/text: We bought a Keurig for Christmas and have gone through the 80 cups that came with the machine along with well over a dozen cases of other flavors that have been 'highly recommended'.  Jet Fuel has been our favorite thus far.  In fact, we've reordered it twice already.<br /><br />That said, we prefer strong coffee.  Jet Fuel tastes perfect no matter which size you make.  There is NO bitterness or aftertaste that you find in some of the other k-cups.  I'm picky, I'd be the first to complain!<br /><br />If you like strong coffee, try Jet Fuel.  Other flavors that have been superior are: Green Mtn. Espresso (hubby alternates between these two), Emeril's Big Easy Bold, Revv, Timothy's Parisian Nights, and Paul Neumann's Organic EB.<br /><br />Donut House and Timothy's Midnight Magic were EB's that were highly rated, but I found them to have bitter/weird after tastes.  I have not enjoyed the flavored coffees at all.  GLoria Jean's Butter Toffee was particularly dissappointing.<br /><br />If I had to buy only one flavor of k-cup, Jet Fuel would be it.

review/summary: Jet fuel
review/text: I like home made espresso, starbucks bold drip coffee and bold coffee that's not bitter. Jet fuel is bold, but not strong as home made over the gas range espresso or starbuck's bold drip. It is much smoother than black tiger though, and the strength is similar to black tiger. If you drink black tiger after jet fuel, you will definitely notice Black tiger's bitterness. When I use one jet fuel with 4oz water serving choice,  it gets pretty close to starbuck's.<br /><br />Before buying from amazon, I used to buy emeril's big easy, but jet fuel is stronger, and through coffee people and amazon's club, this is the cheapest way to purchase coffee for keurig machines. Cheaper than Costco or sams club.

review/summary: Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]
review/text: ASIN B0029XLH4Y - All right, I'm going to start by saying something negative about the Keurig coffee makers, which I will later explain better in my review of IT. Here goes: this coffee maker makes the weakest dang coffee in the history of the free world. You get a choice when brewing: itty bitty cup of semi-strong brew or sort-of-big cup of brown caffeinated water. This displeases me. I bought the thing because I love coffee and would like to mainline it but cannot. Now, I've learned to live with and even get around some of the deficiencies of the maker, but finding the coffee that makes the maker look good... tough job, but someone's got to do it.<br /><br />Jet Fuel is fantastic. It makes Keurig look like the geniuses they ought to be. This stuff is strong enough to overcome the wimpy options of the maker and then some. It's not bitter, but it might taste bitter to folks who aren't hardcore coffee drinkers. To me, that "bitter" taste is sharp, crisp and maybe a little chocolate-like. This is the stuff to wake up to, the perfect morning jolt.<br /><br />If there's a true negative for me, it's the individual cup issue, from the ecological point of view. You get a plastic cup with a foil lid and, inside, a small paper filter filled with grounds. It is, generally, thrown away as one piece. This means that the (unnumbered) cups, which may be recyclable, cannot be put with the plastics; the foil cannot be put with the rest of the foil; the biodegradable filter and grounds not only don't go into the composter, but they'll biodegrade very slowly, deprived of air, sun and water in their little foil and plastic casing. It's possible to take the thing apart and deal with the individual pieces appropriately, but that defeats the convenience factor of the maker. Someone's got to design a better k-cup, but I can't take points away from Jet Fuel for a flaw that all k-cups share.  On the up side of the packaging, Amazon's packaging is awesome - not just frustration free, but 100% recyclable!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

"Jet Fuel" tastes good & wakes me up. It seems at least a time-&-a-half stronger than most other coffees, is full-bodied, &  is consistently, equally great cup after cup: I've had a hundred of them so far. It's my favorite. I bought 50 cups on sale for $20, but the regular price at the time was only $21! Since you'll probably only need one cup in the morning, it's a great deal. Also: It arrived less than 48 hours after the order was put in

review/text: Love this product. It's a liquid. So it instantly mixes into water. I carry around a few packets. It turns any water, bottled or tap, into something that tastes great. Artificial sugars sometimes give me a headache. Stevia, the one time I tried it, gave me a strange rash. So I was looking for a drink mix that didn't have any strange sugars. This liquid has about a third the calories of a normal soda. So for the first time in my life I'm avoiding all the sugar of soda, plus drinking more water. If I'm exercising, I'll drink it, and take a minute during a break, to dilute it further. So one packet goes a long way. Try it-tropical is my favorite of the Tropical/Cherry/Lemon options-tastes mostly like peach to me. Equally important, I'm not using a lot of plastic bottles as Flavrz comes in small packets.

review/text: In my opinion, this product adds practically no flavor to water and what little flavor it does add is unpleasant!  I feel like I have been duped by all the other positive reviews for this product.  Thanks to everybody who wrote these glowing product reviews for fooling me into wasting my money!  I would like to return it for a refund but apparently that option isn't available for this product.

review/summary: Good flavor, not sugary or full of food coloring
review/text: I like to flavor my water or I will not drink as much as I need to. But, I dislike all the artifical flavoring and especially, all the artifical colorings added to most drink mixes. With these you can add a light peachy flavor by adding to a regular bottle of water or a sweet peach drink adding to 12 oz water. Too bad it has to cost more just to have water flavorings that are not full of artifical stuff!

review/text: I made the first pot of this coffee this morning.  I noticed right away that the brewing smell was funny.  Then I took the first sip and thought - hm, kind of weird.  So I took a second sip - and decided that was more than enough. It tasted like I imagine moldy particle board would taste if I chopped that up and soaked it in hot water. I tossed the rest down the drain!  This is the single worst coffee experience of my life - weak "Folger's" diner coffee is nectar in comparison.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  I would give this zero stars if I could.

review/summary: It's not bad
review/text: It's just not all that great. My 2 steaks were completely different sizes and I fixed the smaller one for myself and my father for lunch. For what I got, I paid too much. Knowing how to shop for meat and hitting sales at the local stores can yield better quality for a cheaper price. If the bigger steak turns out to be the bee's knees, I will update this review.<br /><br />I wanted to try some prime beef, if this is prime, then I am better off eating choice for half the cost.<br /><br />I won't likely buy again.<br /><br />EDIT: so I weighed the other bigger steak and it came out to weigh right around 24 ounces, I don't have a digital scale, so I guess you can give or take a few ounces on that. The smaller steak was easily half the size of this one, so I am feeling pretty cheated. I had originally rated this a 3 and I am going to reduce that to a 2. The steak I have eaten wasn't spoiled and it wasn't a bad steak, just not worth the price at all.

review/summary: extremely nutritious
review/text: I don't get the bad reviews, surely you knew what you were buying. If you don't want multigrain, don't get this.<br /><br />I for one love this product. I can't buy it at my normally store. For pasta I usually get Barilla Plus pasta which is multigrain, high in fiber, with 10 (count them 10) grams of protein per serving. But locally I can only get a few pasta types in Barilla Plus. All the couscous varieties are made with standard semolina flour.<br /><br />So I get this from Amazon. My nutrition philsophy is to not worry so much about counting calories, and instead worry about making sure each calorie has nutritional value. Normal non-multigrain pasta has 0 nurtitional value. Pasta products like this though have it in spades, and there is no guilt in eating a pasta meal like this.<br /><br />I don't eat this product plain though. I cook it with zucchini, chicken, stewed tomatoes, and onion. And I use chicken broth instead of water for the liquid, and lots of oregano. It is a good 1 skillet dinner.<br /><br />But ya, great product if you care about eating healthy, want to put on muscle and need protein, or want more fiber in your diet, or all three.

This herbal tea (caffeine-free) is certified organic and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "Grown in the high desert regions of the Cederberg Mountains, the shoots of Rooibos have been hand gathered by South Africans for generations. It is prepared like a traditional tea, undergoing meticulous drying (oxidation) and cutting. Organic Red Mellow Bush has an earthy vanilla taste and pleasing orange color with hints of autumn straw. With an anti-oxidant level comparable to green tea, Rooibos has no caffeine, is rich in minerals, very low in tannin, and is relaxing to the nerves. No wonder they call it the miracle tea. Discover the wonders of Rooibos!" What an invitation!<br /><br />It is my husband's favorite tea, and is pure premium rooibos. If you haven't tasted rooibos before, it is a pleasant, earthy, herbal flavor that most people like.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love rooibos, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****

This is a wonderfully tasty rooibos with a rich,almost caramel taste when drunk with cream. Brew for 20 minutes or more to make a stronger brew--it never gets bitter like black tea.<br /><br />Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. The boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees, reduce landfill by 131,200, and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions. Numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or "natural flavorings".

review/summary: Yogi's NEW, and, very ambitious blend!
review/text: Yogi, 'Perfect Energy Vanilla Spice Tea,' is an ambitious grouping of Green Tea, and Black Assam Tea, with several herbs and spices making recent news, for promoting health benefits.  The added bonus resides in one of the Yogi Principles: "We work with what nature already offers rather than trying to concoct it.  We don't have laboratories.  We have kitchens."  That said, it's no wonder the, all natural Yogi brand, has a dedicated following.<br /><br />I personally really like this blend.  The fragrance is enticing, and there is just enough spice to mask some of the underlying earthiness detected, likely from the herbs.  It IS a very mild tea. I've resorted to two bags per cup for full flavor, which is why I took off one star for this review.  Once brewed, I add a little Rosemary and Lavender honey, and it's yummy.  With two tea bags providing approximately 160 mg of caffeine, I would normally expect to feel jittery.  The fact is, I'm quite the opposite. I don't feel particularly more energized, but I do feel somewhat more focused to task.<br /><br />Here's a list of ingredients: Green Tea, Black Assam Tea, Cinnamon Bark, Rooibos Leaf, Honeybush, Ginger Root, Licorice Root, Stevia Leaf, GotuKola Leaf, Ashwagandha Root, Shatavari Root, Shankpushpi, and lastly 15 mg of L-Theanine.<br /><br />Interestingly, L-Theanine Suntheanine, has had several clinical trials with some evidence that it assists in managing stress, anxiety and PMS, while enhancing the immune system.  The problem is, that the recommended dose is 50 to 200 mg/day.  With only 15 mg per tea bag, you'd have to drink four cups for the minimum therapeutic effect.  Perhaps when coupled with Shatavari, and Shankpushpi, which both provide some nervous system support, too, less is required to offset the caffeine jitters. Surprisingly, it does seem to work.<br /><br />I've noticed a little more diuretic effect than with simple teas. Perhaps this is a result of the Shatavari Root, which is 'Indian Asparagus,' but I'm not sure.  You will want to avoid this tea, if you are allergic to asparagus, or any of the other ingredients.  And, as with many other herbal tea blends, it is not to be used by pregnant, or breastfeeding women, infants, or children. It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with ALL the listed ingredients.  Yes, there are benefits, but also potential side effects. For example, Ashwagandha Root is not recommended for those with thyroid disorders, or liver ailments, without consulting your physician. Enjoy, the bounty of nature, but always be informed.<br /><br />Will I purchase in the future?  Yes, I think I will.

review/summary: Tastes great and provides a nice energy boost.
review/text: A few times a week at work, I'll drink diet soda in the afternoon as a pick-me-up.  I know soda isn't very healthy for you, so I've also tried a few different flavors of hot tea.  Unfortunately for me, a lot of teas are caffeine free.  And those that do have caffeine are typically of a low dose.<br /><br />Therefore, I was eager to try Yogi Perfect Energy Vanilla Spice tea.  The Oregon-based company advertises the product as a natural energizer, without the jitters.  Each tea bag contains 80 mg of caffeine, which is about the same as an 8 ounce cup of coffee.  One of the first things I noticed is that each tea bag has a large amount of ingredients.  There are 14 different herbs listed, including Organic Cinnamon Bark, Green Tea Leaf Extract, and Stevia leaf.  It also contains natural vanilla flavor, Organic Chai Spice Flavor, and Vanilla Bean.<br /><br />You are instructed to use 8 oz of water and steep the bag for 4-6 minutes (longer than a typical tea bag).  Simply put, this is a great tasting tea.  I especially think it's good for people who are not used to drinking normal tea, since the Stevia leaf adds natural sweet flavor.  You don't need to waste calories by adding in your own sugar.  So in terms of taste, I would give it 5 stars.  In terms of energy boost, I would give it 4 stars.  It did not give me as much of an alertness boost as coffee does, but there was definitely a noticeable pick-me-up.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great product for those that like mildly sweet vanilla flavor, or for those that need more caffeine from their tea bag.  I will definitely be ordering these for my office.

review/summary: A matter of taste
review/text: I love Yogi teas in general. I happened to have just ordered twelve varieties of it, including this one, when I was offered a free box to try out. I simply adore their Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut, and figured that anything else with vanilla in it would be as good.<br /><br />I drank three cups of this tea, steeped at 4, 6, and 8 minutes. I found it had practically no flavor steeped at four minutes, and had a bitter taste, somewhat dirty tasting, at eight. Unfortunately, even at six minutes, I found the tea to be too weak for my liking. The vanilla flavor was almost undetectable to me. I added a bit of cream, for this often will bring out the flavor of weak tea, but I just did not find this tea tasty. Whether it gave me a "lift", I can not say, for I don't respond to coffee either.<br /><br />Yogi's Vanilla Hazelnut tea has a strong vanilla taste, and I was probably expecting something like that, but it is an herbal tea and can be steeped for a long time without becoming bitter. I figured I was merely disappointed, as I love Yogi's herbal teas so much. In the interest of being fair (and also because I had almost two full boxes), I gave one box of the Perfect Energy to a friend who drinks tea and had not sampled any of the Yogi brand.<br /><br />Here's the email I got two days later:  "I like it because it was smooth, flavorful, not too sweet and gave me the energy it promised! I would really love that other box!" Obviously, she really liked it a lot!<br /><br />Tea is a matter of taste, especially teas that are blends, such as this one. If you're looking for a lot of vanilla flavor and no caffeine, I'd recommend their Vanilla Hazelnut. If you like a more subtle taste, and do want caffeine, you might want to give this a try.

Face it life as we know it takes a lot of energy, but I need my espresso in the morning, and I drink coffee until the early afternoon.<br /><br />I love to savor caffeine products, and the ones that taste the best win me over.  Life is too short to drink anything that isn't close to perfect.<br /><br />What I really enjoy about Yogi Vanilla Spice Perfect Energy Tea is that it lives up to its name.  I start to unwind with tea and lower the caffeine content late in the afternoon, but I'm a connoisseur of both coffee and tea beverages.<br /><br />This tea is especially smooth and good tasting.  I've drunk all kinds of Green and Chai teas, and I've had all kinds of flavored teas, both black and herbal.  To me Vanilla Spice is smooth and tasty enough. I do not like teas that are too spicy--too much black pepper, too much ginger, etc.<br /><br />Add to this the herbs that calm, the caffeine that boosts so gently, and the antioxidants that purify and cleanse, and this tea is just about perfect.  At least it's a perfect fit for me.  (At $3.51 per 16-count box in a group of six, it is a bit more expensive than what you find elsewhere, but I think it's a fair deal.)<br /><br />Taste *****<br />Health ****<br />Cost  ****<br />Feel  *****

I've never seen Yogi brand tea's before, and Vanilla Spice sounded pretty tasty, so I was pleased to be offered this. It's pretty good! I needed to add a few cubes of sugar to it to sweeten it up a bit, but the vanilla spice flavor is good...very subtle. You can definitely taste it, but it's not at all overpowering. As for the energy, I couldn't really tell any difference. I'm usually pretty energized in the mornings just from a good nights sleep and a nice breakfast, so I can't recommend purchasing this if you're looking specifically for an energy tea. As far as teas go though, it's definitely a tasty one, and I'll have to look into other Yogi brands to what else they have to offer!

review/summary: Good Afternoon Tea
review/text: As far as flavored teas go this is a rather nice blend with smooth yet bold vanilla spice taste.  It has a good bit of caffeine in it as a pick me up and can be a nice change for an afternoon cup of coffee.  Beyond the caffeine it also purports to be a healthier choice than many other energy drinks.  While I was not overwhelmed by this tea, as I tend to like heartier blends, I would give it a qualified thumbs up.
