review/text: We love having chili year round, but during the cooler months we have it more often. We can also make larger batches and freeze it so when not up to cooking can just pull a container out, fix a salad, veggie or both,and some garlic bread..yum!.dinner is done. Lawry's has a wonderful blend of flavors for the chili. We have tried a dozen different kinds and we feel that Lawry's is the best! This is making me hungry, I think I know what we're having for dinner!!

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

review/summary: Much better than Emerald chocolate almonds
review/text: Emerald chocolate almonds was something I always wanted to like, but it just wasn't there. I was intrigued when I saw that Blue Diamond offered their own [dark] chocolate almonds. Blue Diamond is my favorite go-to snack for salty, spicy, or sweet while on the Keto diet, so of course this flavor had to be good as well.<br /><br />The first bite gives you a delayed reaction, from "hmm, I guess this is alri-ohhhh there it is!". Once the flavor hits your taste buds you are able to truly appreciate the flavor. It tastes just like you are eating some dark chocolate. However, unlike the Emerald almonds, it is not a bitter chocolate taste. It's sweet and delicious!<br /><br />I would say it is probably my second favorite "dessert" flavor - just under the Butter Toffee.

And another. And another.<br />I made lunch out of them! The wasabi flavor is also amazing, but gives me a sour stomach, so I avoid them. These are blissful, however!

They use stevia to lightly sweeten so no added sugar, and the flavor is just addictive so be warned on your portion control or up your workouts to compensate. Now if the dried mango market would start using stevia. Tired of added sugar.

review/summary: Perfection
review/text: This box is amazing.  It contains all 50 flavors and each in its own compartment.  To make it even more perfect, there is a clear plastic insert that keeps all the jelly beans in their separate compartments and keeps them from getting mixed up when the box is possibly tossed around during shipping.  Not one bean snuck out of its spot.  The flavors are both fascinating and creative and really do taste like what they are supposed to with only a couple exceptions.  They were fun to play with and we took turns blindfolding each other to taste the flavors and see how well we could guess what we just tried.  Some were hard and many were challenging but a few were easy and quick.  It was a fun game and it really was harder than it sounds.  It also made us realize how much taste depends on sight.<br /><br />On the inside of the lid is a picture that shows the jelly beans in their compartments with their name underneath, which really does help tremendously.  The box also gives you ideas for flavor combinations to try, as does the Jelly Belly website, such as blueberry + blueberry + buttered popcorn = blueberry muffin.  Those were fun to try out.<br /><br />This is a great gift and the jelly beans were fresh and flavorful.  If you love jelly beans, you can't go wrong here.

review/text: I fell in love with the chocolate version of these candies when a friend brought them back from a trip to Germany. A perfect combination of chocolate, cream, and crispy wafer. I thought I might prefer the hazelnut version since I'm not a chocolate lover, but in this case, the chocolate version is better because it offers a better balance of flavors.  The hazelnut cream and milk cream are too uniform, where the chocolate offers a better combination.  These aren't bad; I just prefer the chocolate in this case!

review/summary: Best. Candy. Ever.
review/text: It's true.  This has got to be the best candy ever.  The chocolate version isn't bad, but it's so different they should have just called it something else.  This version of the Happy Hippo is completely filled with that delicious hazelnut cream that is inside the Bueno bar.  A friend of mine and I found a store that had 3 cases of these.  We each bought one and agreed to split the third.  I think we ate them all within two weeks.  That's 10 boxes of 5 pieces each times 3.  That's 150 pieces of candy in less than two weeks...and we wanted more.  Once you start eating these, you can't stop, and you don't care.  They're that good.  The only problem with this candy is that i can't buy it any time i want.  They are near IMPOSSIBLE to find here in the US.  My kingdom for a single hazelnut hippo.

review/summary: It's A Blend.  Questions Is, Is It Good For The Price?
review/text: Let's not compare a straight Kona coffee we had in Hawaii to a medium-priced blend that includes possibly as little as 10% Kona (what it takes to be a "blend.").  Heck, I've bought extremely cheap coffee at the market place (bulk) in Guatemala for about two bits a pound that I only wish I could find at a reasonable price here.  Yep, strained it through a cloth and it was fantastic.<br /><br />Can we look at this Boyer's Kona Blend 40-once bag of blended coffees (including Kona) for what it is?  And we'll all have opinions, I'm sure.<br /><br />Not a connoisseur by any means, I just want my coffee handy; but I do appreciate the various types and nationalities and have tasted many.<br /><br />This cannot be compared to the best pure Kona, the cheapest but terrific Guatemalan "people's coffee" or a Louisiana blend with chicory.  It can only be compared to "typical premium blends" sold in the USA and I think this is a good one, a nice buy at this price (below $20 shipped for 40 ounces).  Only you can decide whether it might be your favorite blend or favorite coffee or not; but it's sure worth the try.

review/text: Our whole foods diet makes eating tricky sometimes, so when I saw KIND bars in the supermarket I was really excited. Our tastebuds are used to nearly no sugar, no salt and absolutely no preservatives or additives so these bars hit the spot. The coconut and almond bars were chewy and crunchy with just a hint of sweetness and they were filling. One bar and I was ready to go for the morning! Mr. MVP had one KIND bar and a yogurt and a piece of fruit and he was on his way. Our supermarket had them for $1.50 per bar so $1.20 per bar is a decent price!

Eating one at the first pangs of hunger buys me a hour before I need a real meal, which is a life saver.  I have taken them on road trips and camping, and they are great there as well.  I love the fact they aren't covered in chocolate, as I'm not a fan of using candy for food.  The fact that they are gluten free means I can bring a box for celiac friends without concern, also a big plus.  I only wish I could buy them locally, but the Amazon subscription is almost as good.

review/summary: Best Bar Ever!!
review/text: This nut bar is made to perfection. It has the right amount of sweetness and the textures are unbelievably amazing. The ingredients make this one of the most delicious snacks and it's just enough to keep you going because it fills you up. You cannot go wrong with these bars, they are my ultimate favorite snack to keep on hand. I could live on these!

review/summary: Hm-hm, good stuff
review/text: My wife tried several different brands and types. Although I am not a big fan of snack bars, I liked this one. Pretty good, nutty, fruity,  not too sweet, not too "healthy", nothing exaggerated. Just feels natural. I like them as a snack with a tea or cofee during a brake at the office.

review/summary: sooo good and no guilt -- what could be better?
review/text: I love these bars and even eat them once in a while as a substitute breakfast with yogurt.  They are so good, and not fattening and make a great on-the-go snack in the car or on the plane.  I have tried many other bars, but none even come close.  Every time I give one to a friend, they are hooked.  My 3-year old grandson loves them too, and I feel good that he asks for them as they have no artificial anything and aren't that high in carbs.  The deal on Amazon is the best with automatic shipping.  In most places they cost $2.00 or more each.  In bulk on Amazon they are $1.50 with no shipping charge.  This one is my favorite flavor, but I like most of the others almost as much.  So, happiness in a bar. . .

The flavor profiles of the bar subtely blends the fruity flavors of strawberry with the nutty crunch of peanut butter and almonds. They contain 190 calories in total and 100 of them are from fat and also are a good snack for the 4 gms of protein that you get with each bar.<br /><br />Overall a great healthy snack for your mid-afternoon after meal or late evening hunger pangs.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: So, there must be some mommies out there like me who buy these bars for kids but won't eat them yourselves? You pop them in the lunch box together with the fruit in the bid to get them to stay off the junk food in school? Most of the time, these bars turn out to be a complete waste cos the kids will tell you that they are the worst thing ever. And you are wracked with guilt thinking you've scarred them for life. But then, you do it again anyway. And so, one day, I tried 1 of these bars and when I asked how it was - the answer surprised me. "They're delicious, Mom. Really yummy" I was stunned. A nut bar that passes the test. I'm so glad there's Amazon. I bought 2 packs - one fruit and nut and another variety pack. She loves all that she's tried so far.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I took a couple to the office. One day, in hunger, I finally opened one. And Oh. I. see. They're good. Really good. They're crunchy without being hard, a little sticky without being too sweet, a good mix of textures without them sticking to the space between your teeth. And at the end of the bar, you feel something in your tummy. Not full exactly but at least it does the job to stave off the hunger pangs.<br /><br />I'm now looking at other flavours to buy because this is going to be the Snack Of Choice 2012 for this household at least!

I tried it for the first time and it was so good, such a delightful and fulfilling taste that is both good and good for me.  I like the fact that it is all natural, no funny taste and no yacky after taste.  You can actually taste the fruits in each bar. I have a sweet tooth and Kind bar satisfies my craving.  Try it and you will see what I mean.  I recommend this to anyone trying to eat sensibly and indulgent at the same time.

review/text: Love these! Like nuts just sort of stuck together. Only problem is when they get old the size of the bar does shrink. So eat them prior to 2-3 months are up.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like cardboard for a change
review/text: Finally, a nutritious snack that actually tastes good! I normally don't like apricots but this bar is not overpowered by the fruit.  It's the right combination of almond and apricot flavors so that it's not overly sweet or nutty.  I do wish it were a bit bigger in portion.  It doesn't feel like a meal replacement but definitely a good snack. Even if you're not a big apricot fan, I highly recommend giving this one a try.  The monthly delivery service also provides a nice little discount!

review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: I am allergic to wheat and hypoglycemic, so finding a wheat free, low glycemic snack bar sounded too good to be true.  Happily, it wasn't!  Every Kind bar I have tried has been delicious, and it makes a good "on the go" snack to keep in my purse.  It's also great to pack when I travel, since it is really hard to avoid wheat when I am eating out, and due to the hypoglycemia I have to eat meals on a regular schedule. I love the fact that Kind bars are made from real ingredients - the list of ingredient is short and I can pronounce everything on the label because it's the type of stuff I have in my pantry.  I ordered one box to try them out, then a few more to keep on hand, and now I have just subscribed for monthly delivery.  I highly recommend these bars!!

review/text: While visiting with my sister I was given the opportunity to try a Kind Bar.  I hesitated because let's admit, anything that comes in bar form and is good for you has GOT to taste terrible!  Well, now I know differently.  These are delicious!  My brother-in-law is diabetic and can eat these bars.  I find eating one between meals curbs my appetite.  They are crunchy, fruity and just plain delicious.  Haven't been able to find these in our area stores so I order Kind bars through Amazon and I'm pleased with how quickly and safely they arrive.  I recommend these to anyone who wants to find an enjoyable way to have a snack between meals and that's good for them, too.

review/summary: Excellent Snack.
review/text: These are really tasty, that's a fact.  Because they're made of fruit, nuts, and puffed rice, they're also reasonably healthy, making them a reliable snack.  I only wish these babies had a bit less sugar, therein allowing me to eat them more often than I currently allow myself to.  Of course, I'm sure that would mess up the flavor and make them an entirely different bar, so that's not really a possibility.)<br /><br />Overall, an excellent portable snack, with plenty of healthy fats and deliciousness.

review/summary: Satisfying & Delicious
review/text: These bars had a generous amount of nuts and the right balance of fruit without the overly sweet filling I dislike in other brands.  The result is a bar with enough protein to satisfy and just enough sweetness to give a little pep--a great bar for the grab-and-go breakfast with my coffee or for the 3 PM slump at work. The bars come in at 180 calories, which is just about right for a snack that also delivers protein, but maybe on the high end of snack portions for those watching calories. However, this is a nice sized bar; it doesn't feel like a tiny portion. This will become a regular addition to my pantry.

review/summary: Likely the best nut bar I've ever tasted
review/text: I had purchased these when they were about $15.50 for a box of 12 and although that is a bit pricey compared to a box of bars you can get from any other brand, it's much cheaper compared to the $3.29 that I had paid for just one bar at the airport and much better tasting than the rest of the nut bars produced by other companies out there!  Right before I was going on a transpacific flight, I wanted to get some snacks to hold me over so this was one of the items I bought at SFO.  As soon as I took the first bite, I remember thinking how good these were and knew that I had to buy these, once I got back to the states.  I ordered the Almond & Coconut ones and they are awesome!  One look at the ingredients and that tells you how there's nothing but all natural stuff in here and the taste is truly delicious!  Personally, I don't think there is a better tasting bar out there than this - it is so far THE best I've tried!

review/summary: Yummy!  A perfect snack
review/text: I purchased Almond/Apricot and Almond/Coconut and they are both delicious!<br /><br />These bars are made mostly out of almonds and other nuts, held together by sweet syrup (not too sweet).<br />Both have a hint of coconut flavor (Almond/Coconut has a slightly stronger coconut flavor). The apricot adds a bit of tang to the flavor, which I really enjoyed. I liked Almond/Apricot slightly better for this burst of tartness.<br /><br />Each bar is individually wrapped, long and slim, and easy to slip into a purse and bring along when you need a bit of pick-me-up on the go.<br /><br />I highly recommend these bars!<br /><br />I am attaching a photo with the wrapper off with one bite taken, so you can see the texture of the bar inside the wrapper.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: It's  a great gluten free snack to have with you when you don't know what's available for you in the "gluten free"  zone.  Some restaurants have gluten free food, some don't. At least you won't go hungry.  It's a delicious power bar snack.  Easy to have with you and much more affordable to buy online than in the store.

review/summary: Macadamia & Apricot - WOW!
review/text: I agree with the previous reviewer - these are very addictive!  I ordered the Macadamia & Apricot bars and they are simply wonderful.  The flavor is absolutely delightful.  The apricot flavor comes out first.  The macadamia nuts are evenly distributed so that you always get the nutty flavor along with the apricot flavor.  The third thing I got was the coconut (mmm, love coconut!).  When I ordered them I didn't realize they had coconut in them so I was very happy.  The coconut is not overdone either.  It's just enough to taste it along with everything else.  I am amazed at how they put these flavors together so wonderfully so that they all shine.<br /><br />I don't even like honey (can't stand it!) and even the honey flavor went superbly with the other flavors in this bar and was not at all overwhelming.  I caught the sweet undertones but most of the sweetness I tasted was from the apricots.<br /><br />I went on subscribe and save, then I went in and revised it to get MORE of them even more often!  BTW, the box I received had a 'use by' date of Oct 2013 on it, so they are very fresh.

review/summary: Very good taste, very healthy product...
review/text: This product tastes very good. The almond and coconut pairs well together. I can't find anything wrong with this product. It's not like the typical tasting fruit and nut bar, or a granola bar. Rather, it's in a field on its own. I appreciate how healthy it is for you (low calorie, low sugar, low sodium, gluten free, etc...) but you wouldn't know it by the flavor. I am certain you will like the taste of it.
