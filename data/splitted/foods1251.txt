The product arrived in a very timely matter and in perfect condition.  My tea party was a big hit with these dessert favorites.  I plan on ordering them again if I can find this same bargain.

review/summary: Good Popcorn - small size
review/text: This popcorn is described as being 28 / 3 ounce packages. However, the actual contents of each bag is 2.75 ounces. A significant difference. Clearly NOT the same as Pop Secret, and other brands, which provide over 3 oz a bag. Weigh your costs carefully when considering this product as compared to other microwave popcorn. The popcorn itself is good and buttery, as described. If you are accustomed to the larger size bags, remember to adjust the time on your microwave to insure you don't burn it due to over cooking.

review/summary: Delicious and hydrogenated oil-free
review/text: This is our favorite brand of popcorn. They do not use hydrogenated oil, MSG, or aspartame in any of their flavors. Most of the kernals pop and it tastes fresh with no aftertaste. We enjoy the Butter Lovers and the Butter Kettle the most. The 28-ct box is a great value if you enjoy popcorn a lot. I buy this exact box at my local Sams for less than seven bucks though. Perhaps Amazon will carry it comparably.

review/summary: Now - 22% Less poor quality popcorn
review/text: Put my Act II bag in the microwave on the "popcorn" setting.  I don't like standing in front of the microwave.  Bottom line, popcorn burned because now, instead of 3.5 or even 3.0 oz popcorn, Act II now has 2.75 oz.  Soon it will be 1.00 oz. It's suppose to be such a deal - right, "such a deal".  However, the popcorn is really poor so maybe less is more - at least they made money on me - but, never again. Act II, the show is over.

review/text: At some point during this candy's life, it was stored inappropriately. I bought these to sell for 25 cents each as a fund raiser. However, they had melted so much that the candy leaked out of the wrappers and re-solidified making it impossible to unwrap. Can't say this would be a consistent issue, but I won't try it again.

review/text: The product is what I ordered, I am very familiar with it and I love it, but the shipping was flat out horrible. It was not shipped in any kind of climate controlled container, so  they are a little melted, not too bad by itself, but the package was crushed 6 ways from Sunday, all the cups  melted then got smashed, it's now a great big chore (more like hassle) to unwrap, making it very difficult to enjoy. I would not order anything like that from Amazon again, stick to books and electronics.

After washing with Dove Beauty Bar, I feel confident getting out of the shower knowing that I am no longer covered in filth. It gets lathery when you agitate it with water, and this lather can be applied to skin on many parts of the body in order to remove dirt, residue, sweat, and odors. In conclusion: washing is a good way to make a person cleaner, and Dove Beauty Bar aids me in washing myself.

review/text: This tea came up as a suggestion when I was ordering some Tetley tea.  Since I had been to the Yorkshire, England area and I truly LOVE tea and all things British I thought I would give it a try.  Seems like it took forever to get here...over 2 weeks...because it came straight from England.  That was cool.  This is a really nice tea.  It can get very strong very quickly but once I figured that out I removed the bag a little sooner.  It has a nice rich flavor which I love for afternoon tea with a cookie.  My friends like it because it doesn't taste decaffeinated. Even my husband drinks it and he's not a big hot tea guy.  I bet it makes good iced tea as well.

It's lasted a little over a year but is now starting to go (I'm noticing my bread isn't rising very well.)  I'll be ordering another bag today.

review/summary: Superb!
review/text: I have been eating these chews, in this and several of the other flavors, since I was in my mid teens, (about 20 years ago).<br /><br />The taste is excellent, and they are not sticky on the outside. So, you don't have to worry about them getting stuck together, no matter the environment. I did the math, and these are a little over 20 kcal per chew, which is not bad.<br /><br />I gave this candy 4 stars because:<br /><br />1. They tend to stick to your teeth. This is not a huge problem, but it is worth mentioning, especially to those of us who have had a root canal or two :(<br /><br />2. They dry out as they age, unless they are in an airtight container. This is bad, because sometimes older chews get shipped to you. The hardening makes it difficult to chew, and they stick to your teeth even more. I suspect there may be a fix for this problem, like using one of those clay bears that moisturizes foods when you put it nearby. I haven't had a chance to test that idea, though.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't say if Amazon will ship you older chews or not. I have not yet ordered from them.<br /><br />All in all, a good candy that is not too sweet or caloric.

review/summary: taste is satisfactory - not yummy
review/text: I have been drinking coconut water for one year now.  It has really helped me improve my health.  I get far less headaches that is for sure.  I used to wake up with terrible headaches and after tracing everything it could possibly be and getting rid of those triggers, I still had headaches.<br />Now, I drink at least 10 oz of coconut water per day and my headaches have been cut by 75%.  At night, I will often hydrate before bed.  At the gym, I put it in my sports bottle.  It is so much healthier than the Alligator Ade and colored vitamin waters.  During gym days, I'll drink as much as 22 oz.<br />It's just pure coconut water with so much potassium.  Low potassium can cause muscle cramping and cardiovascular irregularities. A can of this stuff is perhaps one of the quickest ways you can hydrate and help yourself if you are experiencing symptoms of heat stroke or severe dehydration or JUST feeling a bit sluggish.  It has been an amazing experience for me.<br />Google "potassium and health" and you will see all the benefits of just a few guzzles.  A banana has about 450 mgs of potassium while 10 oz of coconut water has 650 mgs.<br />Also, it is soothing on my stomach and doesn't exacerbate car sickness and IMO, is best very cold.<br /><br />About this brand, "Nature Factor".  I purchased it here on Amazon as it was on sale.  I like the can (vs. the box) because it chills in the frig better, but I would have to say it's not the best coconut water.  It's not bad, it's just not YUMMY.  It  has a satisfactory taste, almost a non existent taste.  Whereas other coconut waters, such as "O.N.E." and "Harvest Bay" brand tastes really good and "Vita-Coco" tastes sour-horrible.<br /><br />I do not buy the waters with added sugar.  That defeats the purpose of the healthy drink and it really doesn't need any added sweetness if it is a good, clean coconut water.<br /><br />Also, instead of stocking my earthquake emergency stash with water, I have stocked with cases of coconut water.  Think about it.  If you need to hydrate during an emergency situation where resources are limited, wouldn't the electrolytes and benefits of coconut water be better than just plain old water?  Each gulp would be 5 times more beneficial.<br /><br />If you are curious about coconut water, this is a decent enough brand to give it a try.  Since they all taste so different, it's interesting to try all the brands to see which one you prefer.  Good health to you all.

review/summary: My 2nd fave coconut water, better flavor than ONE, VitaCoco, Zico--BUT Amy&Brian's is best tasting of flash pasteurized
review/text: I used to get several cases of ZICO on subscription here on amazon. But Zico changed their packaging AND processing (instead of fresh, it's now from concentrate). If it had still tasted the same, I prolly wouldn't care it was from concentrate, really. But when does a "from concentrate" drink EVER taste as good as natural. Have natural tangerine juice, then drink one from concentrate? Yeah, not the same.<br /><br />So, I've tried O.N.E. and VitaCoco and assorted brands found in supermarkets and Latino stores over the years. But I always went back to Zico. Now that Zico is horrible (tastes and smells funny), I needed a new coconut water for my daily fix. I decided to try this since amazon offered it to me in a Gold Box Deal. Well, it arrived today and I LOVE IT.<br /><br />It has a nice sweetness and a clean taste and it's got that refreshing quality that chilled coconut water gives. Heck, I even like it at room temperature. It's not the stinky-sour horror Zico now is.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic. That's a bonus!<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer that the can is great for chilling it up real cold.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently, this brand pasteurizes at quite high temps, so there is a legitimate concern that it loses nutrient content. I therefore recommend that, for those who want more than just a great taste, you either email the company and confirm if they have switched to flash pasteurization, or switch to Amy and Brian's (which flash pateurizes and has a BPA free container).<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer that says those other brands are tastier. I grew up drinking coconut water (my dad would split them open with a machete for us to sip straight out of the coconut), and this one tops O.N.E., which has been my Zico substitute until now,  and VitaCoco (which I do agree is sourish and way down the choice list). But what "tastes good" is subjective and we won't agree on best taste. But I can tell you this tastes really close to real coconut water fresh from a tree in your backyard (though nothing beats the real, fresh thing). I'm assuming changes in flavor are to be expected since coconut water will vary from nut to nut. Even Zico was not consistent formerly, sometimes sweeter, sometimes more water, depending, I assume, on the batch of coconuts. Any drink that's from actual fresh juice will have variations (and I guess Zico went to concentrate in part to standardize the flavor). So, I may just have a crazy good batch here in my hands. :)<br /><br />I've just signed on for a subscription and three cases are on their way to me, yay! Thanks, Amazon, for this alternative now that I'm exiled from Zico. Heh.<br /><br />Update: I tried Amy and Brian's CW after this one, and I actually prefer the A&B due to the sweetness. It has that lovely light, clean, fresh taste that Nature Factor has, just sweeter. That may not be the best for everyone (some folks will want it less sweet, not more, due to the difference in carbs). But for me, I love sweetness, so I'm hooked. But you can't go wrong with either NF or A&B. Enjoy either or both--as I will. So great to discover fabulous new beverages that are healthful.<br /><br />Addendum re Potassium: This possible potassium-compromising may end up being great for those who want, not just organic, but to minimize potassium intake but enjoy coconut water (ie, those on Ace Inhibitors or potassium sparing drugs, those with kidney function issues). I'd check with the company first--definitely-- to make sure of actual postassium content before considering it safe for the K-avoiding crowd. Something to consider, though, what with so many Americans on high blood pressure meds. But until the company confirms or denies or makes clear what it's ACTUAL end-product electrolytes/Potassium content is, K-avoiders should avoid all coconut water unless your docs okay it.

review/summary: tastes ok but all the good nutrients are cooked out
review/text: The taste is pretty good, but according to what i have read about canned coconut water, the liquid is pasteurized to a point where all the good stuff - like potassium, magnesium, vitamins- are basically vaporized.<br />Only the tetra packaged coconut waters are able to retain the nutrients as the coconut water is only flash pasteurized.<br />So if you're looking for ok taste, this drink is for you. However if you are looking for good taste and nutritious coconut water, go for one of the tetra pak versions.

review/text: I like the juice.<br /><br />But all the cans, even in the case packaging, every one is bent.  This is the second subscription delivery just like this.<br /><br />That means these are clearly 'seconds.'  Amazon is shipping Seconds!  Not the good product that this is.<br /><br />Once the cans are bent, the seal between the aluminum can (the inside of which is sprayed with a protective coating) is compromised.  Making this unhealthy to drink.

review/summary: I love the taste of Nature Factor
review/text: I bought several cans in my grocery store, but did not care for the taste.  I saw that Amazon carried coconut water, so I read all the reviews of the different brands, and I decided to try this one.  I am on auto-delivery...I really like the taste of Nature Factor, and I drink at least 2 a day.  Sometimes I run out before my auto-delivery is due, so I end up ordering in between my deliveries.  The price is reasonable also.  The cans in the grocery run anywhere from 69 cents to 99 cents apiece and do not measure up to Nature Factor. I know that I am getting a better product from Amazon.

review/summary: Decent taste and priced resaonably
review/text: I have been a long time fan of coconut water from drinking the ones in supermarkets which are great but lack portability to buying the many brands carried by Amazon.<br /><br />My favorite packaged coconut water in order of best tasting was Zico, One, then Vita Coco.  Unfortunately Zico decided to changed their formula and based on what others who have tried the old and the new have said, I will pass on that.  I decided to give this particular brand a chance and the taste is okay and priced reasonably.  I would rate this behind One for taste.<br /><br />I like the convenience of having it in a can but the cans look somewhat dirty compared to ones normally used for soda.

review/text: My mother found coconut water to be the only thing that helped with muscle cramping when she had chemotherapyI have tried just about every type of coconut water on the market and think this is the best.  Unlike some other brands, I did not think this had a strange after taste.  I also like the smaller can size.  It's easier to finish it in one sitting.  Plus, the organic label reassures me.  The only thing that would make me rate it higher is if I had more information on whether this is a fair trade product.

review/summary: Nature Factor Organic Coconut Water
review/text: I've tried a few different coconut waters over the past month or so - drinking during/after a long run to replenish electrolytes.  I won't go into the health benefits of coconut water in general here as I'm sure there is plenty of that information available elsewhere.  Specific to this product however, I have to say it's one of the best I've encountered.  I wouldn't desire coconut water (any brand) based just on it's taste, but this one tastes the best of the 4+ I have tried (including O.N.E.). It actually tastes fairly good chilled during a long run.  The container is easier to use while running on a treadmill than the cartons that other products come in also.  The fact that it is organic is nice too - I couldn't find any other organic coconut waters on Amazon.  Everybody's taste is different, so order a few different products and compare to see which one is best for you - but Nature Factor Organic is definitely worth trying.

review/summary: Wonderful Oregano
review/text: This Oregano is fantastic. The aroma makes your mouth water. The flavor is not overpowering as some other brands are.<br /><br />Others, with whom I've shared this with, really love it too. This is the best Oregano.<br /><br />Try it; it will be the one you come back to time after time.  Great product Starwest Botanicals!

review/summary: Super delicious. Ten stars product!
review/text: I am a big fan of oregano and I have tried dozens of different types in the past few years alone. This is definitively one of the best and certainly the most convenient in terms of price. Sweet and aromatic, it is very different from the mexican one. I like the mediterranean one much better. It's fantastic in almost any food. On veggies, chicken, pasta, in homemade bread, just to mention a few.<br /><br />One great thing is also that it is cut in very small pieces without hard woody residues (the hard stem of the plant I mean, which you find sometime especially in mexican oregano). Just before getting this, I got a little bag of mexican oregano at a local store and it contained so many big chunks of wood  that even paying attention to remove as many as I could before using it, some went through and one cut my gum. At which point I tossed the whole little bag.<br /><br />The price is super convenient! The bag will last you for years (unless you own a busy restaurant).<br /> My bag does not report the expiration date but I will store most of it in the fridge, it comes in a zip bag so I think the freshness will last for a long time.

review/summary: Essential seasoning for Arroz con Pollo
review/text: You can make Arroz con Pollo with your own broth, saffron threads and such, but Goya Sazon Azafran is a convenient little packet that makes a very savory dish. The only problem with Sazon is that the number one ingredient is MSG and we don't like that (kind of allergic.) But I have to say, it makes a very good Arroz con Pollo.<br /><br />We start with boneless skinned chicken (supposed to be parts but this is the low-fat version) and brown it in olive oil and add a chopped onion, 3 diced cloves of garlic and a half a green pepper, diced. Then we add the Sazon, coat the chicken and vegetables, add 1 1/2 cups of good long grain white rice and coat it in the mixture. Then we add 3 cups of good chicken broth and let this simmer until the rice is cooked and no liquid remains--about 25 minutes. We stir in a half a cup of frozen peas at the end. Now you are supposed to add a bit of chopped olives, capers and decorate with pimento, but one of us does not like olives, capers and pimentos. (Sad...) Even without, however, you get a beautiful yellow rice and savory sauteed chicken.

review/text: Too bad I can't find this in my local store, but at least I found it. This is very finely ground, but like fine cornmeal. I am diabetic, and quinoa is great for me, but grinding the quinoa myself never resulted in flour. My blood sugar is always lower the morning after I have quinoa with dinner, and this flour also makes good muffins and pancakes. It doesn't have gluten though, so they have better texture if use use at least some (unbleached, not enriched) flour. I also use it as a coating for saut&eacute;ed meat, fish, or vegetables.

review/summary: The classic!
review/text: Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach. Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds. The healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect. Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds. Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache. Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation." Oscar Wilde.

review/text: If you're buying in store for $5 it's solid, but there are much better tasting almond butters on here that are cheaper, especially with subscribe and save. Better consistency and less stirring too. Trader Joes is constantly separated and quite thin to boot even in the fridge. It's still thin in the fridge. Highly recommend Justin's Almond Butter over Trader Joes any day of the week. I've tried most out there. Maranatha makes a nice one I've only found at Wegmans (forget the exact type as they have a few different ones), not to mention Costco sells a giant jar of Maranatha's regular almond butter for about $10. Has to be a 24oz or so jar. Sunland tastes as good as the Trader Joes and is much cheaper on here. So if you can get it locally for $5-6, great. Otherwise, don't waste your money.

My first impression of it was that it was absolutely disgusting.  Doesn't taste a THING like peanut butter (obviously).  The next day at work, I decided to give it another shot, and it was better.  Day 3, one more chance, this time on a sandwich, and it's actually pretty good. Nutritionally, the only difference between this & peanut butter is that this has zero sodium.  Other than that, they're pretty similar. I would definitely buy this.  You just gotta give it a chance.

I've tried all kinds of treats from packaged varieties to cut up cooked turkey and organic nitrite-free hot dogs and cheese.<br />My dogs and all the dogs I've shared them with love the New Balance treats. Although my dog does like the duck/potato, I found it too crumbly when I cut it into bite size bits to put in a pouch. The turkey and lamb rolls stay pretty solid and my dog likes those just as well.<br /><br />That is the only reason I gave it less than 5 stars - for my purpose as dog treats to carry in your pocket or pouch, the duck/potato texture was not the best.
