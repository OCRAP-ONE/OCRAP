review/summary: Dog loves it, but it's LOUD
review/text: I got this and the "tricky treat ball" in the same order.  Both are treat-dispensing toys that keep dogs occupied for longer than most other toys.  My basset hound likes both toys, but seems to really like the tug-a-jug.  I put his kibble in there and it keep him occupied for quite a while.  He really likes grabbing the rope, and unlike the picture the rope on mine is made of rubber instead of twine.  It will probably not last long.  Also, this toy is LOUD.  Much louder than the tricky treat ball.  But, he seems to prefer this over the ball, so it gets my recommendation.

review/summary: Fun for the whole family ...
review/text: We've had this for almost a week, and the dog still hasn't figured out how the treats fall out.  I think this toy is worth the money just to hear my kids and husband laugh at the dog as she tries to get the treats out.  So far the toy doesn't show any signs of wear, and our dog is a real chewer of everything she finds.

review/text: I have a wheaten terrier (medium-size dog) and bought the large size since his mouth is bigger - it works great as a game, treat, and way to get him to slow down eating his food.  It's held up great as far as wear and tear and I've had it for about 3 months now and use it all the time.

review/summary: Rope was chewed in one day.
review/text: Our pit mix loves to chew especially when bored.  We bought this thinking it was cheap enough and it might last a week.  He chewed through the rope within a day.  He loves the purple bottle though and carries it around the yard, sometimes trying to chew through that but he has not been successful.  We have been looking for maybe some kind of thick rope from a ship or something, maybe then this toy would work for our boy.

review/summary: Very good toy!  Wish it was a little harder to get the food out though.
review/text: This is by far the best doggy toy I have ever bought.  I wish it was a little harder to get the food out.  My dog Bailey is a master at pulling the rope stopper in and out to get out the little bits.  I tried putting in bigger dog treats, but they are too big.  Smaller dog food slides out pretty easily if Bailey gives the jar a whack.  He can get all the food out in under 15 minutes.  I need a puzzle toy that is more difficult so he can be distracted for hours.  If the puzzle toy is too difficult, he usually just gives up.<br /><br />But it's an awesome toy because it makes your dog think a lot and keeps them distracted, because lord knows that if puppies aren't distracted, they are going to want to play with you!

review/summary: The most durable toy so far...
review/text: I had to review this toy because it is one of VERY few that has not been destroyed within days (sometimes minutes).  Very good durability - the rattling of treats in the jar and the difficulty of getting to them perplexed my golden mix.  She likes this toy, but still prefers her treat-dispensing ball as she has become a master at rolling it to extract the treats.  I give the product 4.5 stars (but I rounded up) for standing up to the first two days of her chewing and trying to get the treats out without solving the puzzle.  It loses a half star because she generally gets disinterested after a few minutes of not being able to get treats out.  She does like to carry it around though!  Great toy overall!

review/summary: GREAT TOY!!!
review/text: Our lab mix, Walter, is a power-chewer and most toys that are not very hard don't last long with him. I saw this silly-looking toy at Walgreen's and it said it is bullet-proof plastic so I got it. My husband was skeptical and asked, "Yeah, but is it Walter-proof?" It is!!! Of course, the rope was history before 2 minutes passed and nearly all the rubber is off the top, but the hard plastic is scratched but still intact. I break up his hard biscuits and feed them through the top (the bottom screws off but if you put them through the top, you know they can fall out during play) and Walter flings it to the ground and rolls it around the get the treats to fall out. He loves it and it's almost always in his mouth. This is, hands down, his favorite toy. But, he's a smart dog and learned from a different toy (rubber ball with a hole in it) how to work treats out of a toy. You may have to demonstrate how it works to your dog.

review/summary: My dog doesn't play with it, but friend's dogs do!
review/text: I have two friends who have gotten this for their dogs and the dogs absolutely love it.  The bottom unscrews making it easy to put treats in.  Small kibble works best.  My Rottweiler doesn't really play with it, but I think it's just because it bangs against the hardwood floor and the noise scares him.  I'm going to try it outside once the weather gets nice.

review/summary: great idea but...
review/text: I was dissapointed in this one. The only way to get the treats out is to tug it on the ground but the rope encourages the dog to carry it around, throw it around etc... You have to fill it up to get the treats to come out and sorry but I don't want to give my dog 2 days worth of food. Maybe I would have been better off buying the smaller one.

review/summary: Great!
review/text: My 1 year old Boxer mix absolutely loves this toy ~ He was trying to play with it before I could even get it out of the packaging! It seems to be durable and is holding up well so far, my only concern is replacing the rope after my dog wears it out (he destroys rope toys in about 2 weeks usually). Other than that, I would recommend this to other dog owners whose dogs like to chew and play tug-of-war. Just make sure you don't mind little pieces of treats all over your floor - it's surprising how much treat actually dispenses, and my dog tends to overlook some of the dispensed treats when he is feeling playful. I wouldn't recommend this for small dogs, just because it is a good sized toy, but for medium to large dogs, this is great!

review/summary: Must Work For Food
review/text: Bottom screws open for easy loading. Last night,  I took some of their favorite treats, broke them in pieces, and placed inside the jug, along with standard kibble. They could smell the food but couldn't quite figure out how to get to it.  I played with them with this toy, with food spilling out erratically, and once in a while, one of their favorite treats spilled out. They have not quite figured out pulling the rope part, but they were rolling the bottle, bouncing it up and down, etc. to get treats out, whatever works. One of my dogs worked for 2 hours last night getting a handful of kibble.  My other dogs are watching, interested, not sure what this thing is, but I believe they will become engaged soon.

review/summary: Use a Plastic Coke Bottle Instead
review/text: So I bought this thing and my cockapoo wouldn't touch it, I played with her with it and tried to show her how it worked and even rubbed cheese on it, but she never figured it out.  So I got the idea that I could take a empty 20 oz coke bottle and fill it half way with kibble and maybe she would graduate to the tug a jug eventually.  Well, she loves the plastic soda bottles, but still ignores this toy.  I think maybe it is because they replaced the rope with a rubber faux rope.  She loves her rope toys, but doesn't like this rubber rope.  I recommend starting with a soda bottle and only moving to this if they regularly destroy the soda bottle.

review/summary: Wish they hadn't changed this toy
review/text: I originally purchased this item back in March of last year.  It worked out great with my yellow lab in dispensing a meal a day.  This version of the toy had an actual rope coming out of the jug.  After about half a year, the rope wore through, but given the low price of the toy, I was satisfied with 6 months of heavy use and recommended it to friends.<br /><br />I then purchased a replacement end of last year.  Unfortunately, the manufacturers had changed the toy so now it's a rubber rope in place of the original fiber one.  This toy lasted about 15 minutes before my dog had completely chewed through it, making the toy nearly useless.<br /><br />5 stars for the original version, 1 for new and unimproved.

review/summary: Great petsitter!
review/text: If you have a dog labeled "destructive when bored" DO NOT pass up on this toy! It's absolutely the best puppysitter. It's been three months, but when I put her kibble in it I still know that she's good for about 20 minutes while I do dishes or whatever. I hate constantly kenneling her when I need to focus on something, so this has been wonderful because it lets her play so much longer.<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />- Totally entertains her for a minimum of ten minutes<br /><br />- Can hold her dinner and then some, I can adjust her playtime with how much I put in it. The less I put in it the longer she plays<br /><br />- Easy to load treats in. just unscrew the bottom and you're good!

review/summary: Too much for pup
review/text: I have a lab puppy that is starting to put on too much weight. No surprise there. I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him.  He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that. Know your dogs preferences when purchasing these types of food toys.

review/summary: Good in theory, not in practice
review/text: I got this because everyone says it's great for your dog to play with when he's alone. My dog has several treat dispensing toys to keep him busy: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B11L46">Atomic Treat Ball Interactive Dog Toy, 3-Inch</a> , <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball , 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>, and Kong Puppy Kong Toy Medium. He does really well with all of them, the atomic being his favorite and the Kong coming in a close second because he really has to work to get stuff out of there. The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him, though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky, the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way, but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work, you have to tip the jug to get anything out and, well, my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs. I'm glad I got this on clearance at CVS otherwise I'd be a little peeved at paying so much for a toy that doesn't work.

review/summary: Great Toy, Impossible to Clean
review/text: Purchased this for my 3 year old Dalmatian who suffers from separation anxiety and boredom when my husband and I leave for work.  We put his breakfast in the Tug-A-Jug, and he went from howling when we left, to happily chasing his toy around to get his food.  He isn't a major chewer, but has ripped things up in the past.  This toy shows some minor scratches (we've had it for about 6 months), but they are all cosmetic-nothing structural.  So that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news?  The rope gets super smelly.  Since we wanted to use this to feed our dog breakfast, we aren't using the Premier brand treat inserts, we are using just normal kibbles.  After about a month of use, the toy began to smell, so we sent it through the dishwasher.  The only problem is that the rope never fully dries out, and the smell came back quickly, and worse.  Now, if we want it clean, I have to soak it in bleach water, then hand wash, then dish wash, and then put it in the oven on the lowest setting so the rope fully dries out.  For me, this is too much work.  We're ordering a kong to see if we can save on some of the clean up time.

review/summary: Didn't work well for me and my dog
review/text: Based on the stellar reviews, I bought this for my Husky Shepherd dog, Juneau. He would get all the treats out of the KONG so I decided to get him another toy to keep him occupied when I was away. The first few days he attempted to get the treats out of the busy buddy were not successful. He would sniff, push, sniff, push. The hard plastic made a lot of NOISE. Sometimes Juneau would drop the KONG down a flight of stairs to get the treat. I didn't mind the rubber KONG bouncing around. But imagine hard plastic hitting my hardwood and marble floors!<br /><br />After a week of use, I had trouble getting the cap back on. I found myself being the Busy Buddy, trying to get the cap to stay on! We tried to like this product but it just had to go back. I can imagine this toy might be better for those with carpet.

Once the knot in the jug dropped to the bottom she was able to empty all the treats quickly.  I used it again with larger treats inside and no rope.  That worked for about 20 minutes until she ripped the nub coating off the neck of the bottle and started crushing the neck portion.  I had to take it away and toss it, getting only 2 uses and less than 2 hours out of it.

review/text: My lab chewed up the rope in a couple hours. This alone is not a huge deal as the instructions with the toy say that a ball can be placed inside the container and have a similar effect as the rope. However, before I could even place a ball in it, the plastic developed a large crack from the dog just carrying his toy around the house and dropping it on our carpetted floors. He has other plasic toys that he has had for months with absolutely no signs of damage.

review/summary: Loved the toy but the indestructible plastic broke!!
review/text: I have a 3 year old black lab named Layla who LOVED the busy buddy.  It got to the point where she enjoyed having some of her meals put in the toy each day.  Layla never really chewed on the toy, just picked it up and dropped it, etc.  After about 2 weeks though the screw off bottom developed a crack that eventually split the top. The plastic on the screw off top doesn't seem as thick or sturdy as the rest.  I thought about buying this toy again, but decided to try a treat toy made of rubber which is her new infatuation! If you have a gentle dog and carpet try this toy out, but if you have a large one and hardwood floors maybe think twice!

review/summary: I was frustrated watching her try to get the treats!
review/text: I was very excited when the Tug-a-Jug arrived.  I was looking for new toys to keep my 1 1/2 yr old Lhasa busy.  This did keep her busy.  It kept her busy trying to get at the treats that she could see and smell without any reward.  The treats only come out when I turn it upside down and play with the rope.  I felt bad watching her trying to get the treats, and she tried so hard for such a long time. There is no way she would be able to turn it upside down.  It is also SO loud.  We had to take it off her the first day because my husband and I could not hear each other talking!  It was a waste of money. We will stick with Kong dispensers.

review/summary: great idea, but didn't attract players
review/text: I got the large size for my siberian husky. He sniffed around the treat-filled bottle and turned away. I tried to show him how to get the treats out by pulling the rope, rolling the bottle, etc, he watched me doing it, and still not interested in trying for himself. He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug-a-jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it. Later I introduced this toy to my coworker, who has a little puggle, and he immediately got one. He puggle chewed up the spiked ball on the bottle neck within 5 minutes...so I guess it's not that durable then.

review/text: I bought this based on a friend's recommendation, but was disappointed.<br /><br />Although I checked the sizing chart, the item seemed too big and heavy for my dog. I recommend going one size down from what they recommend.<br /><br />Also - although my dog loves playing with her stuff-a-ball toy, she will barely go near this thing. So - the one doesn't necessarily imply like for this item.<br /><br />I suspect this would work best for a dog with strong food motivation. My doesn't like it at all.<br /><br />As a toy, it's not much fun, unless a dog really wants food badly and is willing to put a lot of work into it.

review/summary: Very easy to destroy!  Not worth the money
review/text: I bought one of these last year for my pittie mix who was less than a year old, he LOVED it at first and had a great time throwing, kicking and rolling it all over the floor to get to the treats.  Then he started holding the jug down with his paws and puling up on the "rope," which didn't take long to tear in half.  I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea.  He started chewing on the rubber at the top of the jug and it came apart in pieces - thank goodness he didn't swallow any!  So I figured once again that maybe it would still be useful once I removed the rest of the rubber bits that were torn, again I was wrong.  He started to chew on the top of the jug itself (can't blame him it did smell like treats!) and the plastic quickly became jagged and sharp.  In less than 24 hours this toy was in pieces and in the trash.  It was definitely NOT worth the almost $20 I spent on it!

She just couldn't coordinate holding the jug in the correct position while jiggling the rope. She wound up frustrated, barking at the treats which she could clearly see... "they're right there in the bleepin' jug". She spent some time trying to figure out how to open the bottom of the jug. I guess she thought she had a better chance of getting the bottom unscrewed than getting the treats out by holding it at just the right angle with her paw while tugging on the rope. Sorry Vi

A week later we had to toss it because he had chewed off the neck of the bottle and it was cracked all down the sides.<br />He did LOVE it while he had it...but $10 for a week of entertainment is a bit much...

My original worry about the Tug a Jug was that it would be noisy on hard floors.  It never made it that far.  I had better luck with the Busy Bone toy, although she can get the Gnawhide rings off pretty quick. At least that one is still usable.

The knot on the rope (when we still had a rope) fit too tightly into the opening making getting treats out of the bottle close to impossible.  I had hoped this would be one of those toys to occupy her a bit more.  And for the price, think the rope would have been somewhat tougher to a chewer like mine.<br />If your dog is a chewer I can't recommend this.  Not what I expected or hoped for.....

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:55 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have a 43 pound border collie mix. He needs to be mentally stimulated so I bought this toy for him. He gets his dinner through this jug sometimes.<br /><br />I was nervous about purchasing it because of the reviews stating how the rubber "rope" was easily chopped, but I figured I might be able to replace it with a real rope if it breaks. To my surprise, the purple rope hasn't broke and I had this toy for several months now. My dog has been chewing it with his molars, but not very often. Also he may not be as a strong chewer as the dogs from other reviews.<br /><br />When my dog first recieved this toy, he kept pawing at it and pushing it with his nose panting with exsaustion. It took about an hour until he almost got the one cup of kibble that was in it. Later he got used to it and now he has a strategy. He pushes the back of the bottle straight up. He can empty the bottle in about 10 minutes now.<br /><br />A major problem I have with this toy is that the rubber spikes and the rope gets pretty nasty. It picks up hair from the carpet and dry food crumbs from the kibble inside the bottle and builds up to a disgusting slimy gunk. It is extremely hard to get all the crap out between the spikes and the inner edges of the rope.<br /><br />Over all it is a good toy for my medium sized mutt. It just gets dirty and hard to clean.

review/summary: Keeps her busy for a long time!
review/text: I always use some kind of toy or device to feed my dog, both to make her eat slower and to keep her from getting bored. This is the best toy I've found yet to keep my overly smart dog challenged.<br /><br />I've used Kongs filled with loose kibble, then kibble mixed with yogurt, kibble mixed with cream cheese or peanut butter, then kibble mixed with one of those and frozen. After 2 months of increasingly challenging Kongs, my dog finally graduated to the point that Kongs don't keep her busy or engaged for long. I also had been filling the Premier Waggle with her kibble, and she takes care of those pretty quickly too and seems to have gotten bored of the one repetitive move she used to get food out.<br /><br />So I got the tug-a-jug. My dog figured out how to get food out right away, which was disappointing -- then I realized I could put big chunks of treats in there to make it smell enticing and harder for the smaller food kibbles to come out. It works!<br /><br />I love that you can customize how hard it is for your dog to get food out by putting in objects that are too big to come out. I filled about half the jug with freeze-dried liver. Then, I put about half a cup of kibble per meal. It takes my dog a good half hour to get out all her kibble, and she really seems to love shoving, nosing, and flinging the jug around. She used a greater variety of movements than with the waggle, which is probably more fun for her.<br /><br />I also love that the jug is SO easy to fill! Kongs and even the waggle are annoying because they have small holes you have to shove the treats into, but the entire bottom of the jug screws off so you can just scoop the food in. Fast and easy, and my dog is delighted. Totally worth the $.

review/summary: Better than the Buster Cube; almost as good as a bully stick
review/text: We bought the "small" toy with the rubber rope for our 19 lb mutt who gets very whiny when he's bored. I must say it's the best treat dispensing toy we've given him. It's way less noisy than the Buster Cube and the same amount of treats/kibble lasts longer. Other treat dispensing toys have gotten chewed up quickly and this one hasn't. Benji is an easy keeper and doesn't need much food. If we put his morning ration of 1/4 cup of kibble in the tug-a-jug it takes him about 40 minutes to get it all out and by that time he's panting with exertion.<br /><br />I do *not* recommend this toy for use on bare floors if you are there to supervise as you probably should be. The jug itself is very hard plastic and Benji could care less about manipulating the "rope" to get the treats out: he simply throws the jug around until food comes out. If I were to give him this toy in our kitchen the noise would drive me crazy. On our carpeted living room floor the noise is tolerable.<br /><br />The only distraction that works better is a bully stick which of course is silent but they are expensive and I don't like to use them every day. Alternating them with the tug-a-jug has given us some peace and quiet. Altogether a good investment in our situation.

review/summary: Keeps the pup busy
review/text: This Tug-a-Jug turned out to be the perfect thing for our black lab puppy. We put his evening kibble inside and let him roll it around to get his dinner. The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!<br />2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.<br />3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).<br />4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on/off and the inside can be wiped down.<br />5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sturdy construction also means it breaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.<br />2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.<br />3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.<br />4. If your dog is really smart, he might figure this one out quickly. I'd recommend pairing this with one of the other Busy Buddy feeding products and switching between them often to keep your dog on his toes.

review/text: We just bought this toy, and it is definetly something our dog loves and is interested in for a good period of time. It took her less than 20 minutes to figure out she just had to chew through the rope. If they could do a second version with a rope made of Kevlar or a metal chain with knots -that would be much better!

review/summary: BULLET PROOF? Maybe for rubber bullets...
review/text: I have a 15-lb. schnauzer-mix puppy. She's easily bored, extremely destructive & likes puzzles. This looked perfect. It takes a bit of work to get food out so I knew this would occupy her for a while. The screw-on lid at the bottom of the jug was virtually seamless and very tight. When I ran my fingers over the seam before giving it to her I could barely feel it.<br /><br />I gave it to her at 8am before I went to work. I came home for lunch at 11:30 and she had COMPLETELY destroyed it! She located the seam and, somehow, wedged her teeth into it, worked her way around the circumference and pried the lid loose. She then chewed the lip off of the jug all the way around so the lid cannot be put back on it. She was lying there calmly and the food was all gone, so she had clearly long since finished all this in the 3.5 hours since I had given it to her.

review/summary: Dog won't touch it!
review/text: I have a 7 pound miniature poodle, and she is terrified of this toy. She tugged it a couple of times when we first gave it to her, but it made so much noise she has never messed with it again. I have tried to get her to play with it, but as soon as I get her to tug it, she gets scared. I think she feels like the bottle is following her. Also, we got this in the extra small size, and at the time we purchased it,(2009)it came with an actual rope. The treats are very hard to get out. Even for small treats, I have to push the rope in and tip it upside down and to the sides to get them out effectively. I know that some of the more recent reviews have talked about a rubber rope which might have fixed this problem, so maybe this is an outdated issue. Most of all I would just say this toy is probably not for dogs that have a more timid tendency or are scared of loud sounds.

review/summary: Too small
review/text: This product probably works fine at larger levels but at the small the bottle neck is too narrow to allow anything but crumbs to come through. With this sized rope and the storage available in the bottle the product would work perfectly if it had a larger opening to allow dog to pull out treats. Sadly this is not the case.<br /><br />I'm hesitant to purchase a larger one as I worry the bottle neck-rope width issue will be just as present as it is in the small.

review/summary: My dog now prefers this to the food bowl.
review/text: My dog absolutely loves this toy.  It takes her about 40 minutes to get a cup of kibble from it.  It is great for her mentally and physically.  It has also been a tremendous help to her digestion, as she was a "competive eater" when we adopted her, always wolfing down her food in seconds, and as a result having "intestinal turbulence" with alarming frequency.  The tug a jug forces her to eat slowly.  It took her a while to get the hang of it, so it was a supplement, not a substitute, for her regular meals at first.  But now that she knows how it works, I usually feed her one of her two meals in it each day.  The other day, I actually split her dinner between the food bowl and the tug a jug, and she opted to play with the tug a jug for 25 minutes before going for the "easy meal" in her bowl.  I can't think of a better endorsement than that!  The one drawback is that it breaks down somewhat easily.  We are on our third tug a jug.  Each previous one has lasted about a month before our dog has bent the end the food goes in enough that it can't be closed anymore.  So, we buy three at a time now.  They're not that expensive, and I think they're totally worth it.

review/summary: Waste of money and time
review/text: Worst toy ever!<br />-cheap plastic, not strong<br />-rope too thick prevents treats to fall out<br /><br />I have a super smart border collie and he got frustrated with that thing. Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it. The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck. Which makes it a very expensive useless toy, I could have just use a small empty water bottle for no cost!!<br /><br />DO NOT RECOMMEND!<br />Try the kibble nibble instead, I have one and it's way better even if sometimes the treats fall out of it too easily. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JU18S4">Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Food and Treat Activity Ball</a>

review/summary: My puppy doesn't like this...too hard to get treats out
review/text: My small, 6 lb Mini Schnauzer-Shih Tzu mix found this a bit frustrating.  As others have said in the reviews, she couldn't get the treats out...she knew they were in there, but they don't come out easily and I put in her smallest doggie food.  Heck, I couldn't even get them out unless I pulled VERY hard on the rope.  She likes the rope, but not for long...she'd like it better by itself.  I got the smallest one and she's a very smart dog, but it's just not for her.  Don't know what I'm going to do with this thing...just put it in her toy box I guess and hope she latches onto it once in a while.  It's a total waste of money in my opinion.  She likes the roller treat dispensers...I even made one myself with an empty plastic peanut jar, used an exacto knife to cut holes on two sides, and she can roll it around and get excited about her treats rolling out...even an empty butter tub can be used.  Save you money on this one.  Just MHO.<br />Update:  My puppy is now 11 pounds, full grown and will be 1 year soon and STILL cannot get the treats out of this thing.  I even have a hard time getting them out....I have to pull the rope HARD to get anything out.  Then I noticed my pup chewing on it and she was chewing the bottom off and, by the time I noticed what she was doing, she had it off.  She GOT the treats, but I threw the thing away....total waste of money I think.  Not MHO this time....experience!!

review/summary: Great but noisy and treats fall fast
review/text: This is great thing to try to distract dogs with, but I do have two caveats.  One, I would never use it in a house with hardwood floors, especially if you are noise sensitive! The bottle is quite hard and it does create a lot of noise if your dog becomes on who picks it up and slams it on the floor, as one of mine does.  The other spins it around and as a result is a bit quieter.  There is also no way of regulating how fast treats come out of the jug.  Once the dogs learn the concept of the toy, most learn not to touch the tug, otherwise you restrict toys from coming out.  In terms of safety, I have not had my dogs try to eat the rubber tug handle or the ball at the top of the bottle.  The biggest problem I have with them is that of massive hair accumulation from the dogs dragging it all over the carpet.

review/summary: Dog gets distracted by the treats
review/text: My dog loves tug-a-war with ropes and etc so I thought this would be a great toy for her, since she is left alone during the day while I'm at work.  The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the "scent holes" and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately.

review/text: My 11 month old Welsh Corgi figured this out the first time she took it from my hand.  However within a matter of hours she had the rope soaking wet and chewed mostly in half.  The rope is now soft and not a useable tool to get the treat out.  The knot was also too big and frayed to let any of the snacks out of the bottle.  You should also know that the snacks this company makes are too big for the extra small bottle.

review/summary: Great--for two days
review/text: My puppy is under 40 pounds, and loved this toy.  He chewed the rope apart in one day.  Well, I unscrewed the bottom and inserted a golf ball.  It did the job of the rope and made it tough to shake out the treats.  Kept the pup occupied for two hours.  Then he figured out that tossing the bottle would shake loose the treats.  the plastic bottle cracked in minutes.<br /><br />This would be an excellent toy if the plastic was tougher.  the design is great, especially with the ball addition.

review/summary: Not a good treat dispenser
review/text: My Akita mix pup then, and even now as an adult does not like this toy.  There are much better treat dispensers on the market, like "Bob a lot."<br />The purple dispenser is a large neoprene container similar to a water bottle for hiking.  My dog was afraid of the toy until I helped him get some of the treats out with the rubber attachment that slides in and out of the bottle.  He had no interest in trying to get them out on his own and still doesn't.<br />I have a 4 month old lab pup and she has no interest either.<br />I think it's a poor design.

review/summary: Dog doesn't use it at all
review/text: I thought this would be fantastic to keep my puppy busy but she just chewed the knob off the rope insert (ours was rubber) and that was that.  She won't play with it at all.  She is highly food motivated but this just doesn't do it for her.  Give her a Bully Stick and that's really something though!

review/summary: Keeps Dog Entertained, But Too Loud
review/text: My one year old pit mix is incredibly food motivated and can clean out any kong, no matter how tightly stuffed, in 10 minutes. I got this toy to keep her busy, and while it does take her a long time to clean it out, the toy is simply too loud. Roxy likes to kick this toy across the floor, sending it flying into the wall or the table. The hard plastic of the toy scrapes across the hard wood floor and then makes a loud "bang" as it slams into things. Not only is the noise really annoying, but I am also worried she might break something because the bottle is very hard.

review/summary: not for a chewer
review/text: My 10 month old Lab needed some brain toys, and this seemed like an ideal option. There is a problem to solve, and the reward is food - what could be better for a Lab? The problem is that she is a chewer, and though she did figure out pretty readily how to get the food out, she was way more interested in chewing on the rope. When I removed the rope - which also made it way easier to get the food out - she then thought it would be more gratifying to chew her way to the food, rather than rise to the intellectual challenge of tipping the bottle and dispensing a treat.<br /><br />And oh yes, this thing is loud when it hits the floor or cabinets in the kitchen, etc. Pretty durable, considering all she wants to do is chew it and it's not intended as a chew toy - but she has only spent maybe two hours with it total.

review/summary: Great idea but too hard in practice!
review/text: My dog is very smart, he got the idea of what he needed to do real quickly but it's just to hard for the treats to come out of the jar, even when we help him... the rope pretty much closes the jar hole and the treats wont come out. This toy made my puppy real nervous and unfortunately I'm returning it, even though I was super excited about it! :(

review/summary: good with some modification
review/text: I have a 5 month old Australian shepherd and she could not get the treats out--we couldn't either. What we finally ended up doing was boring a hole at the bottom; luckily my husband had the tools to make a smooth hole big enough for her kibbles. It now works very well as a treat dispenser, but my dog doesn't really play with it like a toy.

review/summary: Only good if dog is food motivated
review/text: I bought this to keep my Japanese Spitz occupied, no good. I don't know if it's too difficult for her or if she's just not interested in working that hard for food. She's good for a few minutes then gives up even though she'll get food from it.

review/text: Our two dogs are not really interested in this toy, it has pretty much sat in their toy box since we bought it for them. Not sure why, they seem to like most toys. It is very durable from what I can tell though.

review/summary: Save your money
review/text: This toy lasted about ten minutes.  First one i purchased had a rope tug, which my pup quickly chewed through, rendering the toy useless.  I bought another one after i saw that they had changed the rope portion to a rubberized "rope" and it seemed like a better solution.  Wrong! The rubber rope took my dog (who is not much of a chewer) about two minutes to completely chew into small pieces, again leaving her with nothing but a purple plastic jug.  Product is a great idea if they can figure out what will work better as the "tug" mechanism, but as is (both versions) are just poorly made and a waste of $$$$.

review/summary: Good concept, poor execution
review/text: Dog: 10 month old Lab/ GSD mix who's an aggressive chewer<br /><br />Good:<br />concept<br /><br />Bad:<br />-LOUD toy, keep in mind your dog has to drop this thing to get the treats to pop out and it is made of hard plastic<br />-NOT durable. Tug insert (plastic) broke off after about a week (should have used a rope here). I may do this myself but I'm still debating if I want to hear this thing get dropped over & over & over & over again...
