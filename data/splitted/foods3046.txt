review/summary: Better than Starbucks!
review/text: I love this stuff! I add sugar and half and half and get a drink that is very much like Starbucks Chai Latte. The price on the product has gone up since I ordered it on Jan. 7th 2011 -- so, I ordered the CS Indian Spice Chai tea bags instead. I put 2 teabags in MY K-Cup and it tastes exactly the same. You get 6 boxes of 20, so that is 60 servings for me (2 bags at a time) for the 13.95 (subscribe and save) these cups used to be. If I want the tea a bit stronger, I will remove the tea bags after brewing from the my k-cup and throw them in my mug. Let is steep a bit longer and it is wonderful!

review/summary: Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai
review/text: What I was expecting was a chai tea similar to one I find in popular coffee houses: a spiced tea infused with cream and sugar. This tea smells wonderful but the taste when you are drinking it is very plain to me. Also it is missing the cream and sugar elements so it has none of the flavor and body of a coffee house chai. I've also tried three other chais from Timothy's, Bigelow and Gloria Jean's and had the same reaction to them all during my side by side taste test. The K-cup chais are simply not the same as the coffee house chais. To approximate the coffee house chai you'll need to add your own cream/milk and sugar/honey and give it a little shake.

review/summary: Delicious with 5 spice aromas, not full of sugar and cream
review/text: This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend.

review/summary: Converted me to tea over coffee - it's that good
review/text: Before buying my Keurig brewer, I never really like black tea.  I would drink herbal tea from tme to time but black tea always seemed too bitter.  After trying Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast Tea, I was instantly converted.  There is no bitter taste and it's so much less acidic than coffee and therefore much easier on my stomach.  It has a mild, slightly fruity taste that is perfect with breakfast or really anytime of day.  I've tried it plain and with a bit of milk and sugar as well.  I honestly have become more of a tea drinker than coffee drinker since trying this delicious tea.

Another plus is that you don't have to wait for the tea to brew. Using the 10oz setting is just right for me. If you want a stronger brew then use the 8oz setting.

review/summary: Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!
review/text: If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you.  If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is "this is NOT chai tea."  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called "spicy clove tea."  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.<br /><br />I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a "traditional" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.  For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the "chai" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original.

review/summary: Great for regular chai or latte
review/text: I love this chai, and it makes a much better chai latte than I've tried in any k-cup before.  To be clear, this doesn't come with powdered milk or cream, so you have to add your own cream in order to make it a latte.<br /><br />I have disliked all of the pre-mixed latte k-cups I've tried because of a combination of artificial sweatener (which they all seem to insist on adding) and the powdered creamer (which is worse than fresh).  I add my own sugar and cream to this chai, and it is delicious!<br /><br />When I tried this without cream and sugar, it tasted slightly heavy on the clove.  With the cream and sugar, though, I don't have any complaints.

review/text: I love Chai Tea.  I don't even put sugar or honey in my Chai Tea.  This was just not right.  Tasted burnt out of the keurig and the cloves are overpowering.  No amount of honey and milk could make this right for me.  I am suffering through my 24-pack and may just throw it out.  Very disappointing.  I've had this brand/flavor in the bags before (although not recently) and liked it just fine.  Even bought it multiple times.  Not sure what is not working right with the k-cup formula.

I run it through the Keurig twice, once at 10oz and once at 12 oz and it comes out exactly the way I like it. You may not prefer as weak a tea, but that can be solved by running it through only once.  It has a clean, refreshing flavor.

review/summary: Very weak taste.....
review/text: I have purchased the Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea tea bags in the grocery store, and was impressed with the flavor. So when I saw they had them in the K-cups, I immediately jumped on them and ordered a box. I was so disappointed in it. It tastes nothing like their regular tea bag version. Weak is a word I would use. And I'm not sure what kind of spices they put it in, but it's nothing like any other chai tea I've had. I do not recommend this brand. If you're a regular chai drinker, you will notice the difference and likely be disappointed.

review/summary: Potent!
review/text: This stuff is surprisingly strong and potent. I've always had a problem with chai tea bags because they brew such a dilute cup of tea. But with the Celestial Seasonings Keurig chai, the tea is dark and opaque. I got a huge buzz off of the caffeine. Best of all, it's pure tea and spices, unlike the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte, which is full of artificial ingredients.

review/summary: Couldn't even finish one cup
review/text: I'm an avid chai drinker--many different varieties of both lattes and straight black tea.  We purchased this product because we noticed that the Cafe Escapes chai lattes--a sweeter, creamier blend--did not actually have much black tea in it, and we still wanted our morning caffeine.  Neither my husband nor I could finish one mug of this stuff, and we will end up getting rid of the box.  It was that awful. There was none of the subtle spice blending--just a watery slightly clove-tasting flavor undercut by a bitterness that almost had hints of coffee. Adding a little milk, as we usually do, didn't help at all.  If you enjoy chai, I'd recommend Bigalow or Tazo and skip this one.

I have fancier or more old fashioned tea brewing methods that I use when I have more time, but I default to this green tea when I need a quick fix.<br /><br />Now about the tea specifically - I have tried other green tea k-cups (competing brands), and none have been as clean-tasting and crisp as Celestial Seasonings.  I will continue to purchase this brand for my green tea needs.

Most of the k-cup assorted coffee produces light, watery coffee at 7.25 oz., but this green tea has  good color and taste even at the max. 9.25 oz.  I would recommend this green tea k-cup.

review/text: I enjoy chai tea very much and my partner drinks only tea, no coffee. So when we purchased our Keurig, we wanted to try several varieties of chai to find the perfect one. I shopped on amazon and bought several types with  reviews, cost, recognizable brand and speed of shipping being accounting factors ( in that order).<br /><br />Pros: Quick delivery<br />  The description is accurate and you get exactly what is advertised<br />  Known brand<br />  Fresh<br />  The price is moderate<br /><br />Cons: I mention price here again because it is cheaper in other forms ( tea bags)<br /><br />I prefer a non milk based Chai and so this was the ideal for me. I added sugar some days and drank it plain others and both were satsifying. My partner and I both enjoyed it above all the other flavors and I will reccomend and share with friends and family. I will continue to shop and attempt to find a better price, but would pay this again because it is worth it.

review/text: I tried this because I can't seem to find the Gloria Jean Serenity Tea which I liked very much.  The Celestial Seasonings was very very bland.  I even tried it on the smallest cup, and it made no difference.  There is no authentic flavor here.  I was brought up drinking green tea.  I especially like the Yama Moto brand green tea, but wanted something quick and easy in a k-cup. I like the Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice so I thought I would try the green tea.  I realize that coffee and tea are a personal preference.  For me, this green tea missed the mark completely.

When I purchased my Keurig, I was drinking Bigelow's English Breafast tea bags which I opened and used in the My K-Cup.  I had a rebate deal that sent me 2 boxes of the Celestial Seasoning tea K-Cups and I've been hooked ever since!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings is much smoother than the Bigelow.  I hadn't realized how bitter the Bigelow was, I can't drink it any longer!!  I'm a purest when it comes to my black tea, I don't like too many other flavors superseding the tea.<br /><br />I wish I could get this in tea bags too (to carry in my purse when at restaurants, at friends houses and what not)!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast is just an super-enjoyable cup of tea!

review/text: This is my favorite of the K-Cup Chai recipes. The spices are balanced though fairly strong allowing this tea to hold up well with the additions of honey (or sugar) and milk. It's wonderful served hot or cold. For the cold version, add your honey (or sugar) and milk, stir, and then pour over ice. When doing the iced version, I find it works best brewed on the 6oz size and then poured over ice in a 24oz glass. I prefer this to the Chai Latte K-Cups because I can control the amount of sweetener and milk.

review/text: Great flavor.  Just enough spice.  A love Chai Tea Latte flavor also, but this is nice when you feel like something lighter.  I will purchase more!

review/summary: not the best chai tea I've tasted
review/text: This India spice chai tea wasn't my favorite purchase. In fact, I am thinking I would relist the unused teas in the container and get rid of it. Hopefully someone out there loves it. It's almost a new box.

review/summary: Great Soup Fast SHipping
review/text: I lost a lot of weight a few years ago and have been able to keep it off so when Walmart quit handling this soup I was upset. I eat a can of this soup - Healthy Choice Chicken & Rice everyday ,so being able to get online and order through auto ship with Amazon.com is great. It always ships very quickly and with the email updates I know when it is going to be here. THANKS!

review/text: I seem to like soup a lot.  This one is "lower sodium" and cheaper than in store price.  But if you eat the whole can, you still get about 900 mg.<br />Make your own and freeze it.

review/summary: Dented Cans
review/text: We received 12 cans.  Four cans were dented beyond belief.  One was actually smashed.  4 cans were barely acceptable even though they were dented.  The other 4 were okay.  I considered returning the cans to Amazon but what would they do with them and repackaging would be a lot of trouble so I donated the dented cans to a food bank.<br /><br />Amazon offers a microwaveable bowl in a 14 oz. size.  We've ordered that before and it was much better.  I wil never order soup in the can from Amazon again.

review/summary: Damaged Goods
review/text: Gentlemen,<br />I enjoy doing business with Amazon very much, but something is very wrong with the Healthy Choice<br />Chicken- Rice Soup, especially at $32.89/12 pack. Several of my orders have arrived in a neatly packed<br />box,that when opened looked as though the cans had been in a train wreck,or major hurricane. Cans were<br />not leaking, but were dirty or dented badly, and very difficult to open. The taste was not as good in<br />several instances also.<br />Gentlemen you are selling damaged goods, and I am certain that you will fix this one very soon.<br />You are still number 1, but please fix the soup.<br /><br />John from FL

review/text: This is a low sodium low fat soup that uses good quality chicken and is very tasty. The rice is just the right consistency and is not mushy. I eat this soup all winter long.<br /><br />Shop for price. I buy this as part of a 10 pack (5 chicken noodle, 5 chicken rice) at my local Costco for ten dollars.

review/summary: Delicious and rasonably priced
review/text: I grew up in Minnesota, and Wild Rice was a special dish in our home, served on Holidays and special occasions. I've lived in Hawaii now for 30 years, and can never find except for mixed blends, that don't have even a quarter cup wild rice. So I've been limited to visitors bringing me a bag here and there. Thanks to Amazons FREE shipping and most reasonable pricing, I am now going to enjoy Gourmet Wild rice on a regular basis. Much healthier then white rice. Slow release carb.

review/summary: cooling effect in hot weather
review/text: Chrysanthemum has been used in Chinese medicine for many centuries for its cooling effect, especially in fevers.  I found that this has as much cooling effect to help ones body to acclimate to the temperature around them, creating a cooling of the body.  I take a blood pressure pill that does not allow my body to acclimate to the temperature around me.  Each pouch comes in a plastic pouch for easy to carry with you until you need to make a drink.  The taste is delicious, something akin to a honey drink.  The drink takes affect in under a half hour and lasts around 8 hours.  I don't drink this at night as it makes me very chilly, but during the day it is an excellent cooler.

review/summary: Good Smokey Flavor
review/text: Stubb's makes a variety of marinades and sauces which are just first rate. This Mesquite Liquid is certainly no exception. When you open the bottle, it smells just like standing next to a Mesquite fire. Full of flavor. We a few drops in our chicken wing marinade tonight, thinking we could always add more later, and I'll have to say, it was enough. It was great!<br /><br />I highly recommend it for your cooking needs. And one bottle is going to go a long way.

review/summary: The Worst
review/text: Don't know where to start about how bad this sauce was. It has an off-taste, but the worst was the amount of salt. Almost 1,000mg in a 4oz package! I don't even know how they can get it so salty. I took one bite and it kind of burned my mouth with the same aftertaste when you gargle salt-water. The House brand is infinitely better, I just thought I'd try a change.

review/summary: great for coffee
review/text: I tried a one-pack first <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0074A3WXG">Coconut Cream - 100% Pure</a>, having decided I like it, I switched to this.<br /><br />I am on a diet that requires me to temporarily be dairy-free and needed something for my coffee.  But I didn't want canned coconut milk, as I understand that the BPA-free cans contain BPS, which is nearly as nasty.  I wanted something in aseptic packages.<br /><br />When I first used it in coffee, it did taste slightly coconut-like, but not in an overwhelming way.  I am someone who can't use virgin coconut oil cause it's too strong, I get expeller pressed.  But this did not taste like too much coconut for use as a healthy coffee creamer.<br /><br />The package says to refrigerate after opening and to use within 2 days.  I do neither of these and it remains quite yummy & edible.<br /><br />I have also used it in a few recipes calling for coconut milk just by diluting half way with water.<br /><br />But my new FAVORITE is adding a tablespoon or two of this to a mug of homemade chicken broth and a bit of sea salt.  THIS IS INCREDIBLY YUMMY!

Depending on the type of Rausch chocolate you buy, there are only 3-4 ingredients....not all the other stuff other company's put in their brands.

review/summary: Good but not impressive
review/text: Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.
