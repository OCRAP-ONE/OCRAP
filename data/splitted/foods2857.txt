review/summary: not oil cured
review/text: There is a way to "oil cure" olives, and once done, the result is a lightly salted, meaty olive that still has a lot of flesh. This isn't that olive. It is salt-cured. The result is a dried out, very salty, leathery skin. Once cured, they wash off the salt and put oil on the olives.<br /><br />There is a place for salt-cured olives, but not when the title is "oil-cured".

review/summary: delicious and excellent in tapenade
review/text: I bought these olives originally to make a Sicilian salad using fennel, blood oranges, oil cured olives and olive oil.  The result was ok the first time but very salty.  The results were much better after that because I soaked the olives in filtered water several times over the course of a day or two to remove a lot of the salt.  I then used them exclusively (no green olives) in tapenade and they were delicious.  Highly recommended product but you need to rinse salt off them.

review/text: This jam is amazing.  You would never know it is sugar free and the super bonus is that xylitol is so good for your teeth!  This jam, more than the other Nature's Hollow jams (which I also LOVE) seems to be packed with whole fruit.  The flavor is fantastic and worth every dime of the added expense!

review/summary: Lovely sugarfree preserves, but the blueberry flavor comes across lightly
review/text: I'm probably being TOO picky, cause the truth is, I've never gotten a burst of true, full blueberry flavor in any preserve/jam of that fruit I've tried. I don't know if the heating lessens the flavor or what.<br /><br />So, while this wasn't as "true fruity" flavored as the apricot, it was very pleasant and I enjoyed it. It has the same semi-puree consistency as the other Nature's Hollow preserve I've tried. For sugar-free, this is really nice. Only 2 grams of effective carbs per tablespoon, with 20 calories per tbsp. Ingredients: blueberries, xylitol, spring water, fruit pectin, citric acid. I like that simple list of ingredients. :)<br /><br />I am eager to try the strawberry one, now. :D

review/summary: These were just discusting!
review/text: I bought these Nature's Hallow Sugar Free Bllueberry Jams last year and they were really delicious.  Plus they were sugar free with all natural and organic xylitol for sweetener.  BUT.....I just purchased a case of them and they were grossly spoiled.  One jar arrived opened and leaking all over the package so I threw it out.  The second and third jars I opened were thick with globs of fungus encrusted blueberry's and smelled awful.  Needless to say, I threw them out......that's thirty dollars wasted.  A fourth jar smelled ok and after tasting a little of it to make sure it wouldn't make me sick, it turned out to be ok....at least I am still hoping so.  I am actually afraid to open the remaining jars.  It's like the company had a few really old jars left and sent them to me to clean out their inventory.  Well, I can tell you that they have lost me as a customer.  I use to buy their cookies for my old uncle but NO MORE.  He is old and might not recognize if they are spoiled, loaded with fungus, or rancid.  I won't be responsible for his demise by buying from an unethical company.  I already told the company about the opened jar upon arrival but I hadn't opened any more at that time.  I don't expect to hear from them!  I definitely DO NOT recommend this company any more.  Beware!

review/summary: Great Alternative To Walden Farms
review/text: I have moved in the maintenance phase of the Ideal Protein program. My chief complaint with their products has been the liberal use of Splenda. Walden Farms products are encouraged.<br /><br />Xylitol is an acceptable sugar replacement on IP. I had been using this jam prior starting IP. I actually found it in my gourmet grocer back in TX.<br /><br />I mainly use this as a topping for protein pancakes since I don't customarily eat bread. It is a great convenience item when I don't want to take the time to prepare my own from scratch.<br /><br />Perhaps not as fruity as a french jam but it is a fantastic alternative to sugar free products artificially sweetened.

I didn't expect the whole blueberries inside. It's filled with them! Everyone in my household loves it and even non-dieters pick out this jam to use on their toast. I warm some up to use as a pancake topping and it's great.<br /><br />I will buy this again and I want to try other flavors of Nature's Hallow now.

review/summary: Steep too Long and It's Bitter
review/text: The mint in this tea is very good, but it's not the oily strong mint that I get with some flavored teas. The mint leaves are dried and they are a bit weak. When steeped for too long or if too much tea is used, the tea gets very bitter. However, I can put in a spoonful of the leaves in the hot water, and refill or top off the cup two more times without losing major flavor of the tea.<br /><br />This mint teas is wonderful for after dinner. I love the way it seems to settle my stomach. It's become a regular after-dinner tea. I received it as a gift, and while I have tasted some teas with a stronger, oilier mint flavor, this one is nice in that it doesn't have the essential oil floating in it that can sometimes irritate the lips or the stomach. This has the real mint leaves dried in the tea to steep. Adding a few sprigs/leaves of fresh mint to the tea and lightly mottling/crushing them in the cup right before adding the water makes a huge difference and really enhances this tea.<br /><br />But even without that, this is a great tea, high quality green tea, delicate flavor. Just don't use too much of the tea so it doesn't get bitter. As for steeping time, I just throw the spoonful in with the hot water loose, so I steep it the whole time I'm sipping it and it doesn't get bitter or lose flavor at all. I prefer that to using a strainer or bag for brewing. I love drinking tea and herbal mixes loose like that.<br /><br />I think most people, especially for the price, will like this tea if they like mint teas in general.

review/summary: Love this tea, but it needs more mint.
review/text: This tea is great, but alas, it has a big flaw for me, there is a lack of strong mint flavoring in this mix. I definitely expected a strong mint taste mixing well with the green tea, but there's a lack of mint taste here. You can see the leaves in there, but the taste is lacking.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great green tea. I suggest steeping it for longer than the directions say, but definitely not longer than 3 minutes. Maybe even adding a bit of spearmint herbal tea will help?

review/text: Just tried this tea with my wife last night, it was very good, but just not quite as good as I had hoped.<br /><br />The tea turns out to be a little bitter (even with 100% correct steeping time) and the mint isn't quite as strong as I would like.  Also, you do end up having to put in a little extra tea to make it strong enough.<br /><br />Think of a mint medley bagged tea with less mint and a better green tea and you'll have a general idea what it tastes like.

Convenient stores do for $42.66 (that's including tax)for 24 20 oz bottles. Much better price than Amazon's price. But still way too high.

review/summary: Does not taste like a diet soda
review/text: I am not a huge soda drinker but when I want soda I want a Coke! That's bad in my case because I'm fat! About 6 weeks ago I decided to try the Atkins diet. The Atkins diet is a lower carb diet so I had to give up sweets and sugary drinks. I needed a replacement for my occasional Cokes. I tried regular diet Coke but found that it had an after taste. A friend suggested Coke Zero.<br /><br />I love it! The taste is very similar to regular Coke (not exact) but a very satisfying alternative.<br /><br />Overall, if your looking for a GOOD tasting diet soda I don't think you can do better than Coke Zero.

review/summary: Great taste, REALLY!
review/text: I love the taste of Coke Zero.  Not as much as regular Coke of course - but when I don't want to consume all the calories in a can of regular Coke, Coke Zero is a GREAT runner up.  Way better than Diet coke in my opinion because it tastes more like the real thing.<br /><br />If you are used to diet coke, then switching to this you may not like it, just as you may not like the taste of regular Coke.  But if you are like me and prefer the taste of non-diet coke but want no calories - this is the way to go.<br /><br />I wish they would come out with a caffeine free version though.  Maybe that is asking too much!

review/summary: OK, but I prefer Diet Coke
review/text: This is a review of the product Coke Zero, not this particular packaging option. In short, I wasn't impressed. Now I'll admit I'm a long time Diet Coke drinker, so I bring that bias to the table. But I found Coke Zero too sweet, with a sticky taste sort of like regular Coca-Cola. I know that taste has its fans, but if you're a Diet Coke regular you should know that this version of Coke is sweeter.

review/summary: Taste is ok but cost has become a form of price-gouging the consumer
review/text: I did enjoy Coke Zero and have been a consumer since it made a public debut years ago.  But I hope the public is aware of two things.  The first - this diet soda does contain the chemical sweeteners Acesulfame potassium and aspartame.  Contents are the center of controversy and may be harmful ingested on a daily basis.  Secondly, Coke has 'in stealth mode' kept pricing the same but for less quantity.  The packaging look did not change so consumers for the most part will not recognize this important difference.  Cases for instance just months ago contained 24 cans.  Now, so-called cases contain only 20 cans.  A pack of the recent past contained 12 cans - now you only get 8.  Coke is a very profitable company and therefore it is not logical to assume these decreases in quantity were to cover costs of the turn-key product.  Coke is more than likely passing along additional profit-taking to us.  Consider your options is my final opinion of this product.

review/summary: Price way too high for Amazion
review/text: In the store you buy 3 for $12 Thats $4 a pack, But you pay sales tax. The Reason i want to advoid paying Sale taxes with free shipping i want to fire my local Sheriff.His deputies are very unprofessional they call you by your first name instead of sir and they break every law in the book. You name it. Speeding non emergency Running though red lights non emergency. Park at the fire lane at a local publix to get groceries. And they even get autographs at the Stadium while every fan was restricted not allowed near the visting teams bus outside the stadium. The Sheriffs name is Ken Mascara of St Lucie county. The Deputy was very rude when he pulled me over for accidenly leaving my brights on. I told him that,Instead he called me by my first name instead of sir and he replyed "" I dont belive you and i dont care"" and it cost me $115 total for my ticket. His Mother works at St Lucie bowling lanes and she wont even ask him to visit me, So i can workout the problem. I even went to Deputy supevisor at Fort Pierce and he wont let me see the sheriff cause hes afraid the Deputy might get fired. The only way to fire them is stop paying the local 0.5% local sales tax that the lame stupid voters on avenue D in Fort Pierce. So i decide to look at Amazon.com. I bought video games,Movies and TV Sets with free Shipping.I even bought Sony Playstation 3 with free shiping with No Sales taxes.So,,Sheriff Mascara if youre reading this i like to speak to you personaly see if i get this problem worked out against Deputy Ron.

review/summary: Good, long-lasting flavor, a most excellent gum!
review/text: It only takes a cursory look at my reviewing history to realize that I haven't exactly made a career out of rating gum, but this new Trident Vitality is so darn good that I thought I'd better get in a few words on it. I've tried all three of the available flavors and can't seem to choose a favorite.<br /><br />The Mint with White Tea flavor reviewed here is definitely pretty awesome. The gum has the physical profile of an old-school Chicklet. I'm really impressed with the nice mint blast of flavor that I get when I bite into this gum. That initial flavor burst is really something. And man, does this gum LAST. I can usually go a good 3-4 hours and still get some flavor out of this stuff. That makes it a good value in my book for sure.<br /><br />Typically retails for around $1.39/pack at my local grocer, although I've caught it on sale for under a dollar once or twice. I can't keep a pack at work without everyone mooching a piece off of me.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Bad texture and no flavor!
review/text: I got this one and the citrus strawberry. Lets start with the packaging. What the hell? What's with the little flap? Why couldn't they just do the sleeve thing like everyone else? I know they were trying to do something different but it seemed wasteful and cheesy to me.<br />  I will give this a few pros, when you first bite down the texture is really nice... all except for the flavor goo in the middle. I do mean goo because it feels slimy in my mouth, gross! Once I get past that.. The flavor seriously drops in a few minutes and the texture gets all weird and soft... It's like, "seriously, ewww, what is this weird squishy thing in my mouth?" so I just have to spit it out.<br />  I think this gum was a waste of money and I found it in the discount bin!

review/summary: Greatest Gum Ever
review/text: I have never entered a review for any product but I feel so strongly about this product. I have always chewed gum but just for 5 mins or so and only once or twice a week but with this gum I find myself chewing it at least twice a day.  It keeps it's flavor way past the time that other gums would loose theirs and it remains soft.  I passed out samples to friends of mine at a movie a couple of months ago and now every one of those friends chews this gum. It only took once for them to try it and now it is also their favorite gum.  I used to buy it in bulk at Sam's but they couldn't keep it in stock so now I buy several boxes at a time through Amazon and get it for the same price and free shipping.  It is a great product!

review/summary: Like chewing on tinfoil.
review/text: Tastes like generic spearmint without as much as a hint of white tea, or anything else for that matter.  The first time I had a piece, I clamped down with my molars and thought I had accidentally taken in some of the foil from the blister pack.  Nope.  I've since had six more pieces, pretty much just to freshen my breath and then I throw it out.  The sensation of biting on something metallic has occurred repeatedly with this gum and no other.  Even if it didn't do that, the taste is nothing special and I definitely would not buy this product again.

For those who haven't tried Appenzeller-it's a very strong cheese with a bit of a nutty flavor that's commonly used in fondue.

review/text: I like this little piggy bacon cooker, but you can only cook 4 slices at once.  Also, I find that it works much better if you put a paper towel under the bacon as it soakes up the grease. It you are making several batches, use a clean paper towel for each batch.  Makes really nice crispy bacon without all the mess of stovetop cooking.  Cleans up nicely in the dishwasher if you use paper towels, otherwise you have to do some scrubbing before it comes clean.  All in all I would recommend this product.  Love the cuteness factor of the piggy lid handle. Would make a great gift.

review/text: I bought this bacon tray because it had a vented lid. And what a difference that makes.<br />I used no paper towels. All the grease drained onto the tray because the bacon is held on a grid raised above the bottom.  It did a great job, the best microwave bacon I ever had. I found that 3 minutes 15 sec was right for a full tray<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049WV8S8">Joie Piggy Bacon Tray</a>. No spatters in the oven, the clean up was a breeze.

review/text: I feel silly writing a review for a bacon cooker, but it is so good I feel obligated! This product is amazing, and nobody will know that you made your bacon in the microwave. You can adjust cooking times to accommodate for different bacon eaters (eg, my family all likes their bacon differently; I like mine super crispy, my mom likes hers to bend). This tray is also very easy to clean after. The only negative is that you can only cook about 5 pieces of bacon at once.<br /><br />*Note: If you are willing to look around for them, you can find these trays at Home Goods, TJ Maxx, and Marshall's for about $6.

review/summary: Easier than pan frying
review/text: I place a paper towel on the grilling plate and another on top to absorb grease and find that works for me.  Also microwave times vary according to the brand and thickness of the bacon.  You will need to play around a bit to see what works best for you but this is a nice improvement over a grease spattered cooktop. And accoring to several sources, microwaved bacon has 37 fewer calories per slice which means you can eat more bacon.

review/text: I have been using this product for the past couple of years, and I love it! We have 3 at home because we use them so often each person wants their own. These a great for creating crispy bacon, even super thick cut slices. Regular slices take about 30-45 second per slice, whereas thick slices take about a minute per slice. Also, these need to be cleaned often. I tend to use it 2-3 times (keeping it in the fridge after draining out all of the oil), then I clean it because if not it takes much longer to cook each slice. This is a must have time saver.

review/text: For years I used a "Making Bacon" pan that was invented by a pre teen.  It was great except you have to use paper towels to keep the grease from coating your microwave.  All the fat dripped in the pan and clean up was easy.  I purchased this plan thinking that the lid would keep the grease from flying and I would no longer need to use paper towels.  First the little pig face popped off after two uses and we have not been able to reattach it.  I cannot seem to get the cooking time right with this pan - either over cooks or under cooks.  The ridges of the pan are not tall enough to keep the bacon out of the grease.  This unit is going to the local thrift shop and I hope I can find a Making Bacon pan to replace it.

review/text: I couldn't find this in stores and was happy to find it here. Great flavor! Now I can make zaatar pizzas at home whenever I want. I would purchase this again. It arrived in a soft mail envelope and the plastic container was bent, but most of the zaatar arrived in the plastic container rather than loose in the envelope.

review/summary: Incredibly Rich and Naturally Sweet
review/text: The natural sweetness of both nuts, and the rich oils from the macadamias, made this rich spread an unbelievable treat.<br /><br />Though I am not typically a "chunky" fan, the bits (rather than chunks) of nuts throughout didn't seem to endanger the creaminess of this nut butter. In fact, at room temperature I found it a bit too "melty." Once stirred and refrigerated, it became the perfect spreadable consistency.<br /><br />Because of the light sweetness, I had anticipated devouring this as a healthy "frosting" on brownies or graham crackers - but I found another unlikely yet delicious match, Tamari with Seaweed Organic Rice Cakes. I can't quite say why (nor can I say what possessed me to trial this combination), but the sweet, salty, and earthy flavors simply melded into the perfect savory snack that pretty well eliminated my afternoon sugar craving.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? As good as it is, it is hard to justify such a price tag for a half pound jar. Easily devoured within a week by a single person (that would be me), it turns into a pretty spendy snack! Nonetheless, if you want to enjoy some of the best, I recommend it.

review/text: I use the pump for my Monin Sugar Free Raspberry syrup. The pump is very easy to push down while dispensing syrup, you can use one hand...a child would be able to operate this pump with ease.<br />The pump is easy to wash and dry.<br />The only thing I wish would be different is when the pump is lifted up out of the bottle to change bottles or for washing purposes, it will quickly drain whatever is left in the straw. It would be a good idea to lift the pump out of the bottle over the sink or garbage can.<br />You may want to double check to make sure this pump fits your bottle. Check the ounces!

review/text: I lived in Italy and grew very accustomed to great coffee.  LavBlu is as good as any I've had.  It costs a bit more in stores, so if you order more than three cans or so, it's probably saving you money.  If you order six or so as I do, even with the shipping, it's a bargain. Buy the Rosa if you're making on the stove as this is too fine for a stove.  With a machine, it's just outstanding.  New Lines Sales is easy to deal with, quick and responsive

review/summary: Makes great espresso for a great price
review/text: I am an espresso fanatic and I make espresso at home 3-4 times a week. I have used both Illy Espresso as well as the Lavazza in Blu. Both make excellent espresso with lots of crema, which is the brown foam on top of the espresso shot and is formed only when the espresso is made right. I can hardly tell the difference in taste between Illy and Lavazza in Blue, although Illy comes in a specially pressurized can which keeps the coffee fresher much longer after the manufacture date. For the price, Lavazza in Blu is probably a better choice. However, I have only seen Lavazza in Blu being offered by Amazon Marketplace stores and not Amazon directly. That means you won't get free shipping on this item. So I buy Illy on Amazon since it's free shipping and costs about the same as Lavazza+shipping. If this item is offered by Amazon directly in the future, I would buy Lavazza in Blu in a heart beat. Also, I would stay away from the slightly cheaper Lavazza alternatives. They don't produce much crema. Hope this helps.

review/summary: LavAzza, Take Me Away
review/text: I received this coffee from Whole Latte Love when I purchased my new espresso machine, a Gaggia Espresso Color.  I really enjoy this espresso.  It works beautifully with my Gaggia, which tends to be picky about the grind.  I consistently get that lovely, caramelly crema and it tastes nice and smooth, with chocolatey highlights and no bitter aftertaste.  With this espresso and my Gaggia, I feel like I am taking a mini-vacation every time I make a cappuccino or latte.<br /><br />Before I used this coffee, I was using Illy Espresso, fine grind.  This also works well in my Gaggia, but I think the flavor of LavAzza in Blu is just a little more robust, so my preference is for using LavAzza, until I get around to purchasing my own grinder.

review/summary: Best in a box anywhere
review/text: I've tried a dozen crepe recipes over the years. Few taste better and none are easier than what comes in this box. It's the only store-bought mix I've seen that requires six eggs. Probably not the healthiest thing in the world, but it tastes fabulous. I make these every other weekend. The only trick is to add the dry ingredients slowly, using a whisk to blend them with the liquids. Then, let it stand for five minutes and give one final, vigorous stir before cooking. The resulting crepes are light and delicious. If you make too much you can only store them in the fridge for about a day, two at the outside. Even though they separate a bit, vigorous stirring will reblend them to the point that they will cook just fine even if they don't look as good as they did straight out the box.<br /><br />Suggested fillings:<br /><br />My favorite is a warm banana filling. Make 2 1/2 cups of simple syrup (water and sugar) in a non-stick pan. Add six thinly sliced bananas, a tablespoon of bourbon vanilla, and three teaspoons of pumpkin spice mix (blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice). Cook over medium heat for around four or five minutes until the liquid reduces and the bananas barely begin to get mushy. Splash in a little cr&egrave;me de banana liquor to finish, stir once, and serve. The easiest way to fill the crepe is to place it on a plate, spoon the filling into the center, and fold in both sides. Dust with powdered sugar for an elegant touch.<br /><br />If you want something easier and sweeter, simply lather some Nutella chocolate/hazelnut spread onto the crepe after the first flip while it's still in the pan, layer in fresh bananas, fold and slide onto a plate to serve. It's quick, easy, and kids love it. Dust with powdered sugar for an elegant touch.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: One of the Best Crepe Mix I Have Tried So Far
review/text: The Canterbury Naturals Classic Crepe Mix is an instant hit in our family circle.  Its taste is quite authentic.  Our family has travelled to France often and think this mix is 100% close to the French version we had in Paris.  I initially had some difficulties mixing the batter, but I found that it's a lot easier to mix after storing the batter in the fridge for an hour or two and mix again.  It tastes great with strawberries, banana and whipped cream as a snack or with ham and cheese as a light meal.  I subscribe to the delivery service and always keep them on hand.  It's easy to prepare once the batter is ready (keep in the fridge and use up within 2 days) so I always have a quick snack/meal within 15 minutes.

And although I'm sure it was just a mix up, when I got what was supposed to be 6 boxes of crape mix I got 5 crapes and one flat bread mix. Overall I think this is a great product due to taste.

review/text: If organic truly matters to you the fact that tuna oil is added to this puree is truly offensive. The mercury levels in tuna are high enough that pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid  certain amounts,  yet it is okay to add to a babies food?  And it is not specified as derived from organic or wild caught tuna.  This carries absolutely no logic and just goes to show what happens when a major food company attempts organic.  Garbage, complete and total garbage.

review/text: The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.  Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top.  No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber.  It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.

review/summary: Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7
review/text: I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day. I asked myself if I've researched into the plastic used. Glad to know that it doesn't contain BPA. Recycling #7 can be good or bad plastic. I've read that it's best to go with #1, #2, #4 and #5 plastics. So I decided to err on the safe side. I am giving this a 3-star because it's probably not a big deal but since I know about it, I don't want to live with that uncertainty that I may be harming my baby.<br /><br />Previous review:<br />My baby ate 5 tiny spoons of it the first time he tried the peas. After that, it kinda got boring for him and then I mixed it in with his cereal, and he ate it all. I would describe the taste as non-offending. It is neither sweet nor sour and is mild tasting to be one of the first foods to introduce.<br />I had thought the product would contain only organic peas and water, but it has more (like tuna oil etc.). I guess that's alright. We use quite a few vegetables and fruits from Earth's Best and I think it's good to offer different brands.
