review/summary: Best Coconut Water on the Market
review/text: I have tried over 10 different coconut brands (Vita, Co2, etc) and this is HANDS DOWN the best coconut water - and the only one I drink. I don't know why, but the other brands have a funny taste. My family also agrees this is the only one that doesn't taste weird. The can tastes better than the glass bottle but I am not sure why.

review/text: This is the best tasting natural coconut water on the market. It may be the soil it grows in, but whatever the reason, it is great without being too sweet.  This is a pricey brand but it is affordable on Amazon prime.

review/summary: best tasting --but MIGHT have one drawback for those who suffer from acid reflux
review/text: I love the taste of this product.  Hands down it is the best-tasting over ONE, VitaCoco, Zico (although pretty good), and that one with Brian in the title.  That said, unfortunately, I have noticed that this brand of coconut water does kick up any issues with acid reflux/gastritis.  I investigated as to why and found that it has 20% chloride which is a good thing if you don't have high acid in your stomach already.  But Google this and you'll see that adding extra chloride will aggravate any acid issues you may already have. I was so surprised because I expected any coconut water to be so alkaline that any acid issues just wouldn't come into play.  Still, I'm heartbroken and don't want to accept this because of the fabulous taste Nirvana offers.  I may try mixing this with Zico to reduce the reaction.  Hey, it may not happen for you so I'd give this brand a try because it does taste fabulous.  Though other general sites on coconut water claim that all have chloride, this is the only brand that I've found that actually posts the amount on the product.<br /><br />Update:  10/9/2012  --okay, so I fell in love with this product and continued to drink it regardless of any possibility of acid flare up.  Happy to report that other than the first time or two, every other drink since then has caused me no problem whatsoever. I know it's only been two days since the original review, but I've had about 6 cans since then.  So don't put off trying this drink because of possible acid.  It might have been a fluke deal.

review/summary: My favorite coconut water!
review/text: This is my absolute favorite coconut water. I have tried a lot of brands and whenever I see a brand I haven't tried I buy it immediately hoping that I will find something better than Taste of Nirvana. I haven't found it yet. However, when my friends tried it, they did not like it, saying that it was too sweet. So, if you don't like sweet coconut water, your options would be Zico or Vita Coco, but I will stick to Taste of Nirvana.

review/text: This is by far the best tasting coconut drink I have ever had. I came to realize that coconuts from different parts of the world taste noticeably different. And if that's the case I prefer the ones from Thailand. And even among those, I prefer this brand. They are light, fragrant and not overly sweet. It is even more amazing that it's 100% coconut juice and no other ingredients.<br /><br />Now I just have to figure out how to get these again at my new address that has no doorman to receive packages.

review/summary: FINALLY AUTHENTIC COCONUT WATER!!
review/text: I've tried most of biggest brands in coconut water here on Amazon. Zico, Vita Coco, Naked, and O.N.E. They all tasted watered down, some tasted rancid/bitter, and others tasted artificial and just plain awful. To put it best, they all tasted stale. I was drinking Zico before this, because it was the most tolerable to me personally in terms of flavor/consistency. The flavor is comparable to sweetened corn water(?). I decided on a whim to try Taste Nirvana after finding that the S&S price was almost the same as what I was paying for Zico. There is a huge difference in flavor! Taste Nirvana is subtly sweet the way nature intended a ripe coconut to taste like. The consistency is very rich and almost creamy... I AM IN LOVE!!! The flavor really quenches my thirst, and for me personally, I tend to notice that my lips become a vibrant shade of pink as well as moisturized whenever I drink a great quality coconut water. I know it sounds weird, but maybe some girls can relate? After drinking this coconut water my lips have been full, soft, and a rosy pink color (don't need lipgloss anymore)--so I know it's working! I will never switch back to any other brand! Thanks Amazon for carrying such a wonderful product.

review/summary: Hooked!
review/text: I came across ZICO at the supermarket and really liked the coconut water. I wanted to check Amazon because I figure that anything that goes to the retailers must already be mass produced, processed, giant corporate, ect. Since I try to avoid these things as much as possible and I know that the supermarkets are really just a few giant suppliers on the shelves, I use Amazon quite a bit and I look for the most natural stuff I can get. Taste Nirvana is one of those items that does what it says: Nirvana in a drink. Aside from sticking a straw in a coconut in Thailand, this stuff is the real deal. No aftertaste like ZICO (and ZICO's not bad mind you), just smooth as silk and satisfying. I'm completely hooked on this stuff and I plan to be, that is of course if the ever sell out to a company like Nestle and go and ruin the stuff.

review/text: One of the best tasting coconut water! It have a very sweet taste to it. The other coconut water brands (Vita CoCo / O.N.E / Zico) had a sour taste to it, well at least from Amazon.com. I notice when you purchase the coconut water from gas stations / Walgreens, they don't really have that sour taste to it. The glass bottle version of this is way better/fresher than the can version, spend a few bucks more to get the glass version its worth it.

review/text: Although bearing only a fairly marginal resemblance to the sweet traditionally known as Turkish delight, these are pretty good. The inside is a semi-reasonable facsimile of traditional Turkish delight (although far softer and less chewey in texture) which is then coated in a very think outer layer of milk chocolate.<br /><br />As chocolate bars go... uh... well, they're low-fat, I suppose! I think the innards are pure gelatin and sugar.<br /><br />Do be aware that these come in a variety of packs containing different numbers of bars. At least as of the time of writing, these do not all work out at the same cost on a per bar basis. So it may well be worth your while doing your homework before deciding which deal is right for you.<br /><br />Enjoy in Moderation!<br /><br />Theo.

I love gummies but will be a wary of purchasing an Albanese gummy again.  These will certainly last a long time, but I cannot recommend this product to other folks.

But one of my staple pantry items is canned/jarred mushrooms for convenience's sake, as I can be out of fresh mushrooms and still want some for my omelette or other meal item.<br /><br />This is my fave so far. I've had the white mushroom from this brand, but prefer these. The small slices are nice with eggs and in soups.<br /><br />Granted, no canned mushroom is gonna have the texture or nice flavor and earthy scent of the fresh variety, but for handy pantry E.R. use, these are fine.<br /><br />Organic. No BPA in the cans. Nice.

Generally, I love Ethiopian coffee.  But this barely passes for coffee, let alone good coffee.  If I could give it no stars, that would be my review.  Don't waste your money. Skip it....

review/summary: Very good coffee
review/text: The Copper Moon Ethiopian Yrgacheffe Coffee is very good nice smooth flavor and not bitter. I have had the Starbucks Ethiopian and like it as well but this brand is not as bold as Starbucks so if you are looking for that flavor I would not recomend. Normally I like a bolder cup of coffee but I really like this one.

review/summary: MY one and only disappointment with AMAZON in all the years I have ordered from thewm
review/text: I am so very disappointed in AMAZON and this is the first time in all the years I have ordered from  them. Since there is no other way to contact them, I will write about it here. MAYBE they will listen.<br />I ordered this item and  ordered two BY MISTAKE. Within a few hours I realized my mistake and took the proper steps to cancel it. I was told it was in process and they would try to cancel it. They did/could not. The next day I attempted again to cancel the second order, the one made in error. They would try...and they did not!This was an entire day later---surely they could have cancelled it with a day's notice. So now I , as a partially handicapped senior citizen, have to send one order back via their "simple method"---not so simple for me. Also, this item is packaged for very large amounts, for institutions or restaurants, which was NOT clear when I ordered it.<br />I am so disappointed and I will be cutting back my ordering from AMAZON for certain.  Maybe there should be a way to contact customer service to actually SPEAK with them so this sort of thing does not happen to any of us.

review/summary: 4 at the very least!
review/text: As an aspiring "wannabee" chef I am constantly on the lookout for additions to my daily creations. At first glance one would not assign much thought to this product. The main reason I chose to try it was because I read the nutritional information and found it to be acceptable as far as carbs, sugar, etc. I have in the past used thickeners of different kinds to accentuate, or should I say thicken, gravies, broths, etc and to be perfectly honest not very impressed with the products I tried. They always seemed to bring their own flavor twist to the mix. I tried cornstarch (the ever popular, but a little pain as far as the execution), similar products like "I can believe is not starch?" which had a subtle after taste that eventually discredited all my efforts to impress and that is exactly what I am speaking about. You want to have a few secret weapons to dazzle the discerning gourmets in my tribe. Finally, not too long ago, I came across this product on a website that I regularly do commerce with that sells what I like to call the best soup bases for the wannabees of this world. Seafood Bases, Poultry, Beef, Ham and many more. I personally buy only the Seafood line for I adore all possible variations of the seafood variety: Stews, Soups (with a capital S-chowders, bouillabaisse or parihuela, depending what side of the world you are facing, seafood like scallops, mahi mahi, salmosn, I do not want to get myself started so I will just say just about everything and anything that comes from our great oceans, not to say that I do not also adore some of the sweetest shrimp that derived from river waters). Last time I bought my soupbases I browse through their extensive selections ranging from sauces to spices and herbs and all in between, and I found this Trio White Sauce & Cream-Style Soup Mix, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 4), but not the amazon package just a single one for I no longer get compulsive about anything I read about until I try it and really like it. As the title claims is just for white sauce and soup mix but do believe it has many more uses for it works flawlessly and without changing basic flavors it thickens and delights the hungry crowd I must feed. As a matter of fact I went back to the website today and was about to purchase one or two more of the packages when I decided to check Amazon and I found this very nice price compared to what I was going to pay. Be that a white clam chowder, chicken a la king, any type of gravy including beef with a white twist? Crazy, I know, this product does not present any problems dissolving, it is almost too easy as a matter of fact, and in the end I wrote a whole page and I do apologize, my fellow amazonian reviewers (must say that there is nothing more valuable to me than the opinion of those who sincerely want to voice their opinion and let the rest know about a particular purchase-thank you always!) 4.5 Stars

review/summary: Foul, foul, foul
review/text: This tea is foul and undrinkable. I didn't even buy it on Amazon, but it is so bad that I felt obliged to go online and warn anyone else who might make the mistake of picking it up. At first I thought the problem was in my water supply, and then I thought it might be my tea kettle... I could hardly imagine that any tea could taste so bad and still be sold in stores, so it took 3 full pots, begrudgingly drunk down, before I realized the problem was this cheap crap. Granted it was 99 cents at Walmart, but the flavor doesn't even distantly resemble green tea in the least. The aroma is like old, wet toilet paper, and the flavor is even worse. It leaves a film on your mouth and an aftertaste that just makes you feel dirty on the inside. Even now, I just brewed one more pot to make a final judgement call, and the mug is sitting on my desk, wafting up its awful stench at me, mocking me to drink it. I am now throwing the rest of the box out and never buying this again. I would not serve this tea to my worst enemies.

Luckily, I found it at WallyMart and paid only $0.99 for 20 bags. It would make a great gag to serve this to people you didn't like who had no choice but to choke it down.

review/summary: Better than nothing at all, I guess...
review/text: When the grocer ran out of my favorite green tea, I decided to try this variety on the strength of reviews for other Carrington teas on Amazon. The other varieties must be better than this one. Its flavor is bland, partly owing to the fact that each tea bag only contains 1.75 g of tea leaves as opposed to the standard 2 g found in other brands, like Celestial Seasonings. While this is certainly better than having no green tea in the house at all, I won't be rushing out to repurchase any more unless nothing better is available.

If you've ever had a glucose test and they give you that nasty orange drink, that's what this tastes like. Perhaps I'll try a different flavor next time.

They have a very intense taste and the jelly filling can stick to your teeth for a moment or two until you swish it away with your tongue.<br /><br />  But then there are the people like me who could eat them all the time.<br /><br />Jerry

After shipping, two 1lb. bags for 20+ dollars really wasn't worth the price.<br />Very acidic, after about three, my mouth actually starts to hurt.<br />Nutritional information is in about every language other than English.<br />From what I can tell, three pieces is about 100 calories. I can't eat just three.

You know how when you are in the shower and you want it as hot as you can take it, but not any hotter. This stuff hit the spot for me.

review/summary: can't be compared to fresh roasted chestnuts
review/text: I have never had packaged chestnuts before, but fresh ones are never sold where I live now and I decided to try this. It was horrible compared to the real thing. I can't compare these to other brands of preserved chestnuts, but the flavor was strange and I was surprised to find the chestnuts dark brown and sticky. Then I found a chestnut covered in a green film of mold. Needless to say, I will not be purchasing these again.

review/text: OK for pureeing in desserts, or crumbling in stuffing, for example.  Not at all acceptable if you want a roasted chestnut snack. For that only fresh roasted will do.<br />But good value for the price, the jarred chestnuts from France are just too pricey.  I don't like that they're from China, wish the company could find a European source.  Probably won't buy again, unless country of origin changes.<br /><br /> BTW, I found these at local supermarket during the holidays, if you want just one package.

Nowhere in the language or description of the product do I remember that being mentioned.  There was Hebrew language indicating that it was Kosher.  There was a company in New Jersey that distributed the product, but it is a product of China and comes from China.  Just not sure that I want to use the product with that information in hand.

review/summary: Hits the spot....
review/text: Precooked versus freshly roasted chestnuts is a rhetorical discussion. There is no discussion.  Fresh wins hands down every time, but....<br /><br />If you missed the holiday rush (like me) to stock up on chestnuts, you are faced with a craving problem.  After Christmas, finding fresh chestnuts is close to impossible. These chestnuts solved that problem for me.  But, I want to be clear... these chestnuts do not have the consistency of freshly roasted chestnuts.  To compare fresh versus prepackaged is like comparing apples and oranges.  There is no debate.  But, if the question is on quality of a prepackaged, cooked chestnut (compared to another prepacked chestnut), that is a valid debate to have.<br /><br />If you are looking to kill a chestnut craving, these chestnuts may fill that spot for you.  If you are craving the consistency of freshly roasted chestnuts, you are going to be sadly disappointed, as many of the reviews will attest.  Just have realistic expectations about how a prepacked, precooked food will be.<br /><br />I've tried a number of frozen and precooked chestnuts and these chestnuts are the only ones I find edible (so far)... In fact, I just ordered my 3rd and 4th package of the six pack.  These chestnuts are great for snacking and relatively lower in calories than most other nuts.  Yes, some chestnuts are dark brown and sticky but it doesn't take away from the taste.  I really recommend putting the chestnuts in the refrig though, the flavors seem to pop more.  Of the different precooked brands, this one works best for me so far....but everyone's tastes are different.<br /><br />And, as a side note, the chestnuts get a thumbs up from my cats that usually do not eat human food.  It's a sad day when I have to go into another room to quietly open a bag of chestnuts.  If the cats hear me rustling that bag, they come running.  They LOVE to eat these chestnuts.

I eat them right out of the bag. I have not used them for cooking, but I imagine that they adapt very well to any recipe. I LOVE them!!!! In fact, I am going to the kitchen right now to open a bag for my afternoon snack. They are very comforting. Don't know what I would do without them!!!!!

review/text: These are so yummy! They look like little brains, which cracks my kids up too. These are a great low-fat, high protein snack that fills you up. If you've never had chestnuts before, you might want to buy just one bag to start. They're the kind of thing that people either love or hate. I love them, but they have a unique texture that isn't for everyone. But once you fall in love with them, this is a great inexpensive way to buy them, especially if you have Amazon Prime. Give them a try!! If you like them, that's great because they're so great for you, and if you don't, share them with a friend who does. Either way, win-win!

review/summary: GREAT HEALTHY SNACK!
review/text: I grew up with chestnuts and for years I roasted my own (seasonally) and had to deal with what I found inside (good or rotten) after roasting them.  Well, no more roasting for me!  I now can eat chestnuts anytime and these taste just as good as roasting them yourself after you've put them in the microwave on high for about 15 seconds.<br /><br />I also find the flavor very good.  Although the darker color took some getting used to, it makes no difference to the chestnut flavor at all.  I found them moist.  However, chestnuts are a drier nut. (My grandfather always ate them with his wine!)<br /><br />Chestnuts are also part of my diet.  They're low in calories, no cholesterol or fat and have a lot of Vitamin C and some iron even.  Much better than any other nut to munch on IMHO.<br /><br />I was buying these at my local grocery store, but due to the Christmas season, they're out. If they don't restock, I'll be buying them again on-line.  These are a staple in my household.  Everyone loves to munch on them....esp. after they've been microwaved a wee bit to get them warm.

review/text: from wikipedia: In the United States, Castoreum has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a food additive, often referenced simply as a "natural flavoring" in the product's list of ingredients. It is commonly used in both food and beverages, especially as vanilla and raspberry flavoring.<br /><br />Castoreum (pronunciation: /k�'st'ri'm/) is the exudate from the castor sacs of the mature North American Beaver Castor canadensis and the European Beaver Castor fiber. Within the zoological realm, castoreum is the yellowish secretion of the castor sac in combination with the beaver's urine, used during scent marking of territory. Both male and female beavers possess a pair of castor sacs and a pair of anal glands located in two cavities under the skin between the pelvis and the base of the tail. The castor sacs are not true glands (endocrine or exocrine) on a cellular level, hence references to these structures as preputial glands or castor glands are misnomers.<br /><br />/wikipedia entry<br /><br />i USED to love raspberry flavored everything, and used the heck out of this extract.  i always assumed the natural flavorings had something to do with raspberries, not beaver butt.
