review/summary: Nice flavor
review/text: One of the better K-cups I've tried. Generally I'm not a fan of flavored coffees and I'm picky about hazelnut flavors. This is a nice medium body roast with just enough hazelnut. Drinking coffee straight, it's a nice touch of nuttiness with very little bitterness. Adding cream and sugar really brings out the nutty flavor. For my family's tastes, we brew these cups with a tablespoon less water than usually to make it a little stronger.

review/summary: great product and seller
review/text: I was slightly concerned about the split reviews, but I must say, I'm glad I decided to order this product. It arrived a couple days before the expected delivery date, and all of the pieces were in perfect condition. More importantly, they all tasted lovely. Out of the 16 pieces, If I remember correctly, there were only 5 repeat flavors. The doubles were some of the best flavors anyway, so I didn't mind. Some bottles seemed to have more alcohol content then others depending on the alcohol used, however, they all tasted sweet and delicious. These are a rare find in local liquor stores, usually showing up only around the holidays, so ordering them is definitely worth it.

review/text: My dog did not like this at all, so I had to mix it with a brand she does like, Acana, so that it would not go to waste. After a few months after I purchased it, I got a notice for a recall.  I had to throw away all the food, which included an expensive bag of Acana since I keep the food in a big container and throw away the original bags. Amazon informed me that I had to deal with the seller on this issue even though I bought both products from Amazon.  So I informed Taste of the Wild of this in a letter with the refund request due to the recall and the cost of the Acana food, but they chose to ignore that.  I will not buy from them again.  Customer Service is not good.

review/text: I've had my dog on this food for several months, and he absolutely loves it. His sensitive digestive tract handles it very well, and he has no issues with allergies with this food since it is grain free.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I will no longer be purchasing this through Amazon since they increased the price by 4 dollars in one month! It is no longer cheaper than at my local retailer, so I will just make the drive and keep those extra dollars in my bank account. If the price goes back down, I would absolutely keep ordering it here.

They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea. In general I'm not a big fan of tea with flavorings added, preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing.<br /><br />Overall, the green teas seem good. The herbal infusions are fine. The black teas tend to turn bitter if you don't brew them very briefly...even then they have bitter overtones. Tazo's assortment, and Tazo teas in general, are fine---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not anywhere near as good as Numi, or Aspen, or other super premium teas made with only "real" ingredients and minus all of the flavorings. I'm more used to these high quality teas, which Tazo attempts to be, but disappoints...so overall Tazo Assorted gets a 3.5 to a 4. For this review, I'm rounding up, since so many people seem to enjoy these teas, and I'm in the clear minority. If your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality, no doubt Tazo's teas will appeal to you, as they are a great improvement. They have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences. If you don't enjoy Tazo's teas, though, know that there are many, many teas made with all real ingredients, teas that cost only a fraction more, that may be just the thing you were looking for.<br />****

review/summary: It's a decent marinade but it doesn't taste like teriyaki
review/text: Most Japanese teriyaki sauces are light, smooth, velvety, slight salt, undulating sweetness, and subtle flavors such as soy and/or wheat infused into "generic teriyaki".  Each company has the same base and has it's own "secret recipe" where they cure the "teriyaki sauce" in barrels. I like most teriyaki sauces since they come from similar bases.  This sauce however doesn't taste like a generic teriyaki based sauce.  It tastes more soy sauce based.  Soy sauce is more pungent, more salty and usually overpowers any flavors that attempt to infuse into it.  So the end product is a salty, pungent and sourish soy sauce.  I don't think that this sauce uses inferior ingredients, you can taste that it is made with good materials, but I can't categorize this sauce as a teriyaki.  It lacks the underlying sweetness of teriyaki, not sugar sweet but the barrel cured sweetness.  I could call this a crazed soy sauce but even then, one could not categorize this as a soy sauce either.  It's not a terrible sauce, I could use it in many new dishes but just don't ask me to work with/treat it like a teriyaki.  It's unique, it sort of reminds me of a filipino adobo in a good way.  If I were the company, I would re-brand this flavor as something unique, sort of like Maggie Seasoning sauce.  Maggie is well known by name all over Asia and Asian communities, it's not a soy sauce, it's not an anything sauce, it's "Maggie".  This would work since it really has a great unique powerful flavor.  Like I said before, it's not teriyaki but it's not a terrible sauce.  I used this sauce with butter, olive oil, garlic, salt, fresh ground pepper, and marsala wine to cook a great mushroom sauce, it was absolutely divine over rice.

review/text: I didn't buy this off of Amazon, I got it from a chinese grocery store for about $6.  I went for dim sum with my family and my mom ordered chrysanthemum tea and it was really good.  I bought this so that I would be able to enjoy the tea at home instead of having to go out to a restaurant just to enjoy the tea.  The tea I had at dim sum was pretty much all flowers and made a greenish yellow tea.  The Golden Dragon tea is >90% dried greenish/brownish leaves and &lt;10% of flowers making a dark brown tea.  This doesn't taste the same as the other tea.  It's not bad but if you're looking for a chrysanthemum tea, look for one that is all flowers.

review/summary: Celiac Alert/Wheat/Nitrates/Nitries/Food Safety
review/text: I hope some of you will find something here useful, heretical views and all ;^) !<br /><br />The Nesco spices are typical of other pre-packaged jerky mixes.  While I don't share the concerns others have about the presence of nitrates/nitrites, and I am not personally impacted by MSG (although I sympathize with those who have adverse reactions to it), I do want to give a heads up to any Celiac sufferers out there that the Teriyaki flavor contains wheat.  This isn't really a big surprise as most Teriyaki sauce also contains wheat, but I thought it was worth pointing out.<br /><br />For those who are concerned about the nitrates/nitrites, and who disagree with my view (and that of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Cancer Society and the National Research Council) that they are benign, and even beneficial, I would like to point out that they are there to protect you against food poisoning.<br /><br />However, the spices and the cure are packaged separately, so it is possible to leave the nitrates/nitrites out entirely.  Of course, you are taking a (potentially fatal) risk when you do so.  It is true that you may be running your dehydrator above the 140 degree mark, but the temperature is not uniform throughout your dryer.  I do process whole cuts (not ground) without cure, but the meat has been carefully handled, and I use a torch to pre-treat the exterior of the meat before drying (or cooking at very low temperatures, as the case may be).<br /><br />All and all, this is a complex topic, and I would suggest a lot of reading about the issues of food safety before making a choice to leave out using a cure.<br /><br />Here is a reading list for those who are interested:<br /><br />The FDA "Bad Bug Book" available free on the web. Search for "Bad Bug Book: Introduction<br />Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook<br />The "Bad Bug Book""<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805888">Cooking for Geeks: Real Science, Great Hacks, and Good Food</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393058298">Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing</a><br /><br />Worth searching for on the web:  "low temperature cooking", "nitrates (nitrites) vegetables", and "no nitrates (nitrites) added"<br /><br />As for the ingredients of the Nesco Seasoning, here is what the packaging lists:<br /><br />(Apologies in advance for typos and transcription errors:)<br /><br />ORIGINAL FLAVOR:<br />DEXTROSE, SUGAR, SALT, SPICES, NATURAL HICKORY SMOKE FLAVOR, MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN,DEHYDRATED ONION, DEHYDRATED GARLIC, LESS THAN 2% OF CARAMEL COLOR, SILICON DIOXIDE, CALCIUM SILICATE<br /><br />TERIYAKI FLAVOR:<br />SUGAR, SOY SAUCE POWDER(SOYBEANS, SALT, WHEAT, MALTODEXTRIN), DEXTROSE, SALT, SPICES, MSG, 2% or LESS SESAME OIL, DEHYDRATED GARLIC, DEHYDRATED ONION, NATURAL FLAVOR, CITRIC ACID, SILICON DIOXIDE<br /><br />HOT-N-SPICY FLAVOR:<br />DEXTROSE, SALT, SPICE, SUGAR, NATURAL HICKORY SMOKE FLAVOR, DEHYDRATED ONION, DEHYDRATED GARLIC, MSG, HYDROLYZED SOY PROTEIN, LESS THAN 2% NATURAL FLAVOR, CARAMEL COLOR, SILICON DIOXIDE, CALCIUM SILICATE<br /><br />(Note that none of the above flavors contain nitrates/nitrites, they are all in the separate CURE packets, listed next.)<br /><br />CURE: SALT, SODIUM NITRITE(0.62%)<br /><br />If you do choose to leave the cure package out, you may want to add some table salt if you like a salty jerky flavor. Just be sure you understand the issues involved - nontyphoidal Salmonella, Clostridium Botulinum, and their various cronies are not your friends. And if anyone eating your jerky is immune compromised, then please do not leave out the cure.  After all, what is worse - your scientifically unfounded fear that one day they may get cancer from the preservatives, or the risk that they will drop dead in the here and now from a pathogen that flourished in a slightly too cool dehydrator?<br /><br />Anyway, these seasonings make jerky that tastes good, and while making your own seasonings from scratch is probably a better choice, the little packets are very convenient when you are tired or in a hurry.<br /><br />Bon App&eacute;tit and best wishes to all !

review/summary: Easy, Excellent Jerky
review/text: These 4 Jerky spices are super easy to prepare-mix with water add your fresh meat & marinate for 12-24 hours in the fridge.  All are excellent in flavor and make fantastic home made fresh Jerky.  The clear favorite with my family & friends is the Garlic & Cracked Pepper style, closely followed by all the other flavors.  I gave a less than perfect score because the Teriyaki flavor tastes almost the same as the Original flavor(both are delicious), I expected more of a soy sauce/tamari taste and it seemed a little lacking only in that perspective.  I bought the big box because I wanted lots of flavors, variety and the ability to make a bunch of jerky...I would buy this again, but I won't need to for a while!

review/summary: Good item, good value
review/text: My husband loves to make jerky with his new dehydrator and these spice packets make it quick and easy to mix up and cure the meat. We did not really like the flavor or the smell of the Teriyaki but the other three flavors are great. To be fair, we usually do not like anything flavored with a teriyaki seasoning so it's not surprising that we did not care for it here either. The pricing on this item makes it a great value. This combined with buying meat on sale makes for a nice quantity of jerky at an affordable price that you just couldn't touch if buying prepared jerky in a store.I may not purchase this combination again since we do not like all the flavors but I will definetly purchase more of this brand of seasoning from Amazon.

review/text: This pack was exceptional for a "newbie" jerky maker like myself. I have to say all four flavors were good, but I preferred the original recipe. it tasted just like jerky you would buy for 5 times what it cost me to make it.<br />I do recommend adults with kids use the hot stuff. The kids ate all the other jerky but the spicy was too much for them so that's what I got to eat most of. All in all, this kit was excellent and the price was even better.

review/text: I really enjoyed this variety pack. It allowed me to quickly make several different types of jerky to choose my favorite (Cracked Pepper and Garlic is AMAZING). All of the flavors so far have tasted good. I've made the original, cracked pepper and garlic, and the Teriyaki flavors. The Hot & Spicy sounds good as well and I can't wait to try it. These spices work great with ground beef and the Nesco jerky gun, or mixed with water and used as a marinade for a sliced roast. The cure seems to work fine and the jerky has lasted several months in the freezer.

review/text: Nesco jerky seasonings/spices have always made the jerky I make taste great.  This bulk package is no different.  Each flavor I have used has turned out some very tasty beef jerky, and the price for all of these is unbeatable.  I had read some previous reviews saying that some people had been shorted on certain seasonings, but this was not the case with my order.  All counts were correct, and it is exactly what I had ordered.  I highly recommend these Nesco seasonings to anyone who wants to make the seasoning/curing process as easy as can be.

review/summary: Good deal, good stuff !
review/text: We purchased this before from Amazon and loved it, so we purchased it again!  Everyone loves the original flavor!  The Hot and Spicy is a little hot for us, so since we use ground turkey that comes in a 2.5 pound container, we use one Hot and Spicy and one Original.  That makes the people who like the hot & spicy happy, but isn't too hot for us !  The Teriyaki is a little bland, like many people pointed out.  So, I throw a little extra liquid Teriyaki in there to help it along.  The Garlic & cracked pepper is really good too !!  We have a Nesco dehydrator and put it on for 8 hours, using the round tip on the jerky gun.  It comes out like a Slim Jim, but so much better for you - less fat, etc... Yes, I know there are chemicals in this too... We also use the dehydrator for fruits and herbs...  When we run out of this 24 pack, we will be reordering from Amazon !

review/text: This a pretty good jerky making product. I bought a dehydrator and have been making quite a bit of jerky. It is assorted flavors so just find which you like better. I mix them together. I don`t know how other people do it but I can`t see making a batch of jerky and tossing all that mix away after. I always drain and put in the dehydrator and freeze the left over liquid mix, and add more to it next time I make a batch. I always marinate in a couple of large glass bowls but I do think it might be better if I can find a large thick sturdy clear plastic bag for that. It certainly would take up less room in my fridge, and I think I could take it out often and shake it up more thoroughly with out any spilling in my fridge. Good stuff this. Making home made Jerky is not a cut and dried deal. It takes a lot of trial and error and, a lot of research. This is good stuff and seeems to be a very good blend of seasoning to cure ratio.

review/summary: "The espresso of teas"
review/text: Guess what. Stash really means it when they call this "the espresso of teas"! "Robust" in their description is code for "This sucker will rouse you after a night of throwing back pints of ale and carousing at the local pub." It is a dark, rich, and strong brew, but to say it has only one note is plain wrong. I am sitting here drinking a cup as I write (I buy mine on Amazon in the 3.5 oz pouches, so I might not show as a verified purchaser.), and I taste a range of flavors in the lower register. There are toasty warm notes, licorice, tars, and, yes, bitter notes, as befits its dark nature.<br /><br /> If a light-hearted tea is more to your palate, you must look elsewhere, but if you are seeking a strong, rich, flavorful, cup of tea, with a bit of an edge, this is it.

review/text: i gave up my wonderful cup of morning coffee because i like it with cream [i need neither the calories nor the estrogen] and switched to a pot of tea in the morning. with skim milk, its ok.  did you know they put powdered milk in skim milk? sorry. i digress.<br /><br />your basic standard big-name tea bags are all mediocre so being half-scot i decided to just go for the floor-sweepings in rite-aid's brand. on sale, they are 100 bags for $2.50! and no worse [or better] than the standard types like lipton - even fairly close to the twinings types.<br /><br />well, i have grown a little weary of vaguely-richer-bodied-than-hot-milk-in-the-morning taste so decided to GO FOR THE REAL THING . Leaf tea rather than dust tea. so. what to buy?<br /><br />i purchased some loose breakfast tea at my neighborhood co-op [GOOD! very GOOD!] -shoulda stopped right there, but decided on a private order as the co-op tea is in a common bulk jar, where you scoop and fill a little bag. thought to myself, if i buy some thru amazon my tea will be a lot fresher.<br /><br />so which brand? i've purchased 'stash' semi herbal tea bags in little boxes at the market in the past, so when i decided to go for GOOD tea, thought. yes, 'stash' will be a nice tea.<br /><br />wrong wrong wrong. its flavor lacks all subtlety. no, actually, it lacks all flavor. no, actually, its bitter. and not in a nice way. and costs a lot more than the co-op's.<br /><br />now, i happen to like a lot of bitter things. heck, i like to nibble on baking chocolate [it has NO sugar] and boy is that bitter. i suck lemons for fun. well, that's sour, not bitter, but you get the idea. so i am not being picky. its downright rough.<br /><br />my advise is to check out your local food co-ops and health food stores. if you don't have one in convenient distance from your home, i suggest moving.  ;-).<br /><br />leave the 'stash' people's bulk tea to those who don't read these opinions before buying something on-line.

review/summary: Great taste, slightly expensive
review/text: Ssamjang is always good for Korean BBQ, and this brand seems to do it justice. The taste is just right. The price is 30-40% more than at your local Korean grocery store, but the convenience of Prime makes it worth ordering, especially for a guy like me who doesn't own a car and needs to Zipcar to the nearest Korean grocery store.

review/summary: Way too small
review/text: There were no Measurements of this product.  They were way too small for what I wanted to use them for ( party favor containers).  The boxes were about 3" across the middle (it tapers down), 2" deep, and 4.5"  tall.  Don't get me wrong; they're cute if you want miniature popcorn boxes.  Check out Hobby Lobby.  Target has some tall hard plastic ones in the dollar section at the front of store.

review/summary: Luscious Lemon Luxury
review/text: I had a craving for a lemon something sweet.  Not pie.  Not candy.  Cake?  Oh, a bit too much.  But the craving would not go away.  I thought about baking some lemon cookies, but dismissed that idea.  I'm a good baker, but I was not in the mood for it.<br /><br />So I went to the supermarket and checked at the bakery.  I got donut.  Well, I didn't buy donuts; I mean the bakery had no lemon cookies.  Then I checked the cookie aisle.  These were the only lemon cookies I could find.  I was shocked!  And they were on the top shelf at the end of the aisle, where the merchandisers like to place the pricey stuff.  Not that one could miss that green and yellow package, and why do they show a cockatiel?  I was skeptical, but the craving had evolved into an obsession, so I bought them, expecting to be completely disappointed.<br /><br />They are wonderful!  Best new cookie I've tried in many years.  These are sandwich cookies with more heft than Oreos.  The cookie is made short and not too sweet.  The cream is a perfect concoction of smooth, lemony and sweet.  The overall flavor and texture of this cookie is truly fine.  They are unquestionably lemon, but not overbearing.<br /><br />Best of all, these go wonderfully with tea.  There's nothing worse than an overly sweet cookie with tea!  A perfect match with black, green or oolong.  I wouldn't recommend them with a spiced tea.  I enjoyed them very much with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AR158W">Numi Organic Tea Magnolia Puerh, 16-Count Full Leaf Tea Bags (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />Bonus points for those looking for cookies made in a nut-free factory.

Every time I fly home to Saskatchewan, I go on a shopping spree and fill a huge box with goodies from home.  Then I ship it south to Indiana.<br /><br />Today, I decided to check on line to see if Dare Cookies could now be purchased on line at a reasonable price.  I was delighted to find they were available through Amazon!  As an Amazon Prime member, I can even get them shipped for free.  That's a real bonus.<br /><br />Now if someone will just start selling EatMore Bars!!!

review/summary: No Longer from New Zealand-----Horrible Water!
review/text: DoNOT Buy this Water. This water used to be delicious but the have recently within the last 3 months started making changes to this water. Cheaper packaging and the water is no longer purchased from New Zealand it is actually now purchased in different parts of the US and they charge the same price at my local Whole Foods as if it was still from New Zealand. The water now tastes horrible....it tastes like it has sediment or contaminents in the water. I inquired about the change in the water and here is the email I rec'd: Although Eternal was previously sourced in New Zealand, there are many reasons for our decision to change to a US-based source. Your naturally alkaline spring source is nestled deep in the Great Smoky Mountains of Eastern Tennessee at the base of English Mountain.<br /><br />I am now searching for another water to drink.

review/text: I drink a ton of water throughout the day while at work - and this is the only water that actually tastes good. I don't know what it is about Eternal, but it has this really pleasant clean velvety taste to it that I have yet to find in other bottled water. If you were to drink this water and then take a sip of Fiji water, the harshness of Fiji would knock your socks off. (I am not sure about the alkaline and how it effects clarity - as I'm tired on matter what during the day. I don't feel a difference from drinking this specific water. However, not even coffee helps!)

The chocolate mint taste is not overpowering in flavor, but you can tell it's there.  I am weird - I was concerned, the first time I made a pot of this coffee, that the mint flavor/scent would permeate my coffeemaker, coffee pot and/or plastic travel mug.  I'm pleased to report that this did not happen!  This is a lovely coffee, not too strongly flavored but not too mild, either.  Definitely one of my favorite varieties of this brand.

Natural Balance now has a very similar limited ingredient, duck and sweet potato product, but for some reason, that one makes the dog's stomach run.  The biggest cons with this product is price and availability.

review/summary: Absorbs, doesn't track but heavy and unpleasant perfume.
review/text: In search for a non-tracking highly absorbent kitty litter, I found this Ever Clean product. The reviews sounded good so I ordered three boxes for the three litter pans in the house. The order came quickly with each box of litter in it's own Amazon cardboard box. The FedEx delivery man must have been annoyed at the weight because he left the boxes on the ground outside the deck box I have by the front door specifically put there and noted for package deliveries. It is a good thing it rained prior to the delivery!<br />Anyway back to the litter itself. I have a 16 year-old cat who was diagnosed with diabetes last spring. She is receiving insulin twice a day and is doing well but drinks and pees alot more then she used to. With other litters I have tried, the urine sunk right to the bottom of the pan becoming muddy and difficult to scoop. The Ever Clean litter absorbs and clumps well, but has a heavy coarse sand-like consistency. It also has a heavy (to me) perfume to it that I do not care for. After scooping the pans each night, I can smell the perfume throughout the house and on me. It is better than the odor of cat urine but is a very heavy floral, not a fresh smell at all. I have never liked litter that comes in a box because it seems like you lose a 1/2 cup or more of litter between the walls of the box. At the price of the Ever Clean, every bit counts.<br />I have since discovered Cat's Pride Fresh and Light which I have mixed with the Ever Clean. The Fresh and Light jug is much easier to handle weight-wise, absorbs well, doesn't track and has no odor to it. Eventually the Fresh and Light will be the sole litter I use.

review/summary: Best cat liter I have tried
review/text: I have 2 cats and this liter literally eliminated all odors from the liter box room. this liter clumps up very nicely making it easy to scoop and helping you conserve the liter which will save you money. Has a good but slightly strong and powdery smell to it. and I must say there is alot of dust when pouring in liter. I would keep your cats away when you are scooping/refilling so they don't inhale the dust. But the odor eliminating, fair price, and clumping make the dustiness well worth it. Buy this liter.

review/summary: Love this soup
review/text: I absolutely love this soup.  Unfortunately the cans arrived dented.  But when I called Amazon to complain, they credited my credit card without any issues at all.  I wish they had had more of the soup so that I could have ordered more instead of the credit.

review/text: For any candy bar lovers, I STRONGLY recommend these. They ARE a nice light crisp snack, just sweet enough with wafer and cream layers, chocolate...so tasty! My husband and I first tried these when we were in Victoria BC for our honeymoon. Our tastebuds fell in love with Coffee Crisps. We've been known to playfully fight over them. Anyone we know who went to Canada, we asked them to pick some up for us. Now they're available on Amazon, and thanks to Amazon Prime, we can get them within two days! Super nice!

review/summary: God's gift to candy
review/text: These candy bars are wonderful. When I go to upstate New York I put up with 45 minute waits at the border (in each direction) just to buy this candy. It has a wonderful coffee flavor, and its very light. I wish they would market this candy bar again in the US
