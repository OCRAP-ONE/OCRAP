review/summary: Great Price, Okay Tea.
review/text: Maybe I have become a bit of a "tea snob" but I don't find this tea very appealing. It tasted somewhat weak and, though I wouldn't call it stale, it just didn't taste fresh at all. I usually brew leaf tea, and only buy tea bags to make it easy brewing tea at work or on the go. I would not recommend this tea. I was happy when the last box was finished. My kids liked it okay, but thought it was too bland (as did I).

review/summary: Love the tea...not the price.
review/text: I absolutely love this tea...I find it much more tasty and soothing than plain chamomile for an evening "unwind" drink. When it was no longer available in my local grocery store, I found it here on Amazon for less than 20 bux for a pack of 6 boxes. That was several months ago, and I'm nearly out of my stash. I came back to order some more, and was shocked to see the price had nearly doubled! After a bit of digging, however, I came across Amazon's own listing under new/used which offers the same product for not only less than half the price of the main listing, but also less than what I paid for it initially, and includes free shipping. The only difference is that it takes 2-3 weeks shipping for the cheaper Amazon product. Well, I'm pretty sure my stash will last that long, so I think I can endure the longer wait. Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Not so good...
review/text: I had high hopes for these pods as I am on a continual quest for a strong decaf coffee pod that will work in my Senseo.  I've been through them all it seems, until I came across this one when reordering through Amazon recently.  Unfortunately, these missed the mark considerably. They are a poor match for the Senseo which tends to either pour water through them too fast or pool water in the pod around them, which results in coffee that resembles tea or colored water.  Don't know what to do with the three boxes I bought.  Maybe Amazon will take them back, or I can break them open and utilize them with my espresso machine? Nonetheless, I've spent enough time trying to find a worthwhile decaf pod; I'm now going to buy a Coffeeduck and allow myself to have a decent cup of coffee with my Senseo and a premium ground decaf of my choice and liking.

review/text: I used to drink rich, strong coffee, but the caffeine was messing with my blood pressure.  Baronet decaf is a good compromise for me.  I love it.  While it isn't really espresso, just dark roast.  It is tasty, with overtones of chocolaty goodness.<br /><br />It's not the same old medium roast blend most other coffee companies use for decaf.

review/summary: A good whole bean flavored coffee
review/text: A good resource for whole bean amaretto flavored coffee, especially if you don't live near a shop that carries whole bean amaretto coffee (in my case, a town).  A nice medium roast.<br /><br />The bags are vacuum sealed, keeping the the beans as fresh as you can short of roasting the beans yourself.  This allows me to order 5 lbs at a time.  I open and use one pound at a time, leaving the other bags sealed in their bags to stay fresh, then when I'm down to my last pound, I simply order again and before my pound is gone, I have another 5 lbs of fresh coffee at my door.  Even if my local shop carried whole bean amaretto now I don't think I would go back to stopping off to buy it there.  Ordering it online, getting this freshness and home delivery is just too convenient!

The smell is overpowering on the butter and not real butter but fake butter.  Not sure what it would have been like if I used oil instead of margarine. I think it was the fake butter that made the mix bad.  I love Pillsbury but this version is terrible.  Bought it by accident.  Hope that doesn't happen again.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/text: I can only add three things to what others have already said - the aroma of this rice mix will fill your home and you will love it.  Comparied to plain brown rice that I buy at the store (Mahatma) this mix has three times the fiber per serving.  And lastly the cooking directions on my bag differ slightly from the directions here at Amazon - the bag does not say to rinse first (so I don't), and the bag says to cover AFTER you have brought to a boil and reduced the heat.  Other than these comments I can only agree whole-heartedly with the first five reviews, that this totally wholesome food item is scrumpdiddlyumscious.

review/text: I'm really a white rice kinda person - raised on it, like it.  As my tastes matured I learned how much more flavor there is to be had -- basmati, jasmine...in white rice, jasmine is my favorite.  I started trying to eat better several years ago, but never truly learned to appreciate brown rice.  Instead, I ended up mostly cutting rice from my diet.  Now that I have found Lundberg Wild Blend, rice is back in the lineup.  I look forward to the nights when this is one of the sides.  It has a nutty taste, yes, but also a bit of sweetness.  We love it!

review/summary: Incredible flavor and texture brown rice
review/text: This rice blend is the best tasting rice i have ever experienced. I use a zoji rice cooker with fuzzy logic set on the brown rice setting. Iuse canned swanson chicken stock instead of water and put butter in the bowl before cooking.  The net result is a mind blowing goodness that is nutty and extremely flavorful. The texture is also very pleasing. This is a great blend. If you want great reviews on your dinner presentation then this should be part of your dinner plate. Raves are guaranteed if you make it this way. I have not tried to cook it any other way as i have found gourmet perfection and there is no need to modify or mess with this good thing.

review/text: Obviously rice isn't a low-carb food per se, but this wild blend has significantly less impact on my blood sugar than the jasmine variety I grew up eating. It's flavorful and has a wonderful chew -- and it cooks up just fine in a rice cooker (we use 1.5 cups of liquid per cup of rice). The 6-pack boxes we order two sets at a time keep us stocked for a few weeks. We do find, however, that the rice doesn't smell very good after only a little while in the storage bin. Doesn't change the flavor or its smell once you've cooked it, but I'd recommend washing out your storage container between refills.

review/summary: Add us to the Lundberg fan club!
review/text: First off, we all love rice at our house. I also love wild rice and rice pilaf,<br />although the others are not all that big on those dishes.<br /><br />So, when I read the descriptions on this, I thought it sounded really tasty, but<br />had some real hesitations about buying six packs of the rice. I wondered how we'd actually<br />manage to use six bags before it went bad.<br /><br />Well, the bags are not all that huge. Each bag is one pound of rice. I guess I had a hard<br />time visualizing it, but the bags are fairly small. I don't have one in front of me, but they<br />are maybe 6" square.<br /><br />Anyway, we made the first bag this weekend, putting it in a crock pot and letting it cook<br />on low for 2 or 3 hours. Hubby is the chef in our house, and he used beef broth with the rice.<br />We had it with some sausage for dinner. Let me say - WOW!<br />This is really tasty rice! Between the four of us, we managed to wipe out the entire pound<br />of rice (yes, it was that good!), and were figuring out what the next meal with the rice would be!<br /><br />Watch your prices on this - they vary widely, even across Amazon. But, as long as it stays in the price<br />range on this listing, then we'll be buying it again. Seriously, this stuff tastes great! It was<br />tasty, filling and actually easier to chew than I thought it might be (I have troubles with crunchy foods).<br /><br />Thank you Lundberg for a really great blend of rice.  You've converted us!

So we'll proceed, the texture is unique but not bad, the flavor is nutty and relatively strong, which is good I think...<br /><br />I prepared the rice in a zojirushi rice cooker, 1/4 cup of rice, 1/2 cup of water, cooked it on the brown rice setting for approximately 50minutes in all.  serving size was plentiful beside some chicken and veggies.<br /><br />I will try it with some chicken broth tomorrow, an excellent 0 carb addition to rice ussually.<br /><br />to followup, I prepared it again, this time I did half cup of rice and 1 cup of chicken broth.  rice maker seemed to prefer this quantity, and the chicken broth made the overall flavor so much better.  I actually did not mind eating it at all.

This can generally only be found at boutique health food stores or Amazon, and amazon is cheaper and more convenient.

review/summary: Wonderful nutty rice
review/text: Of all the Lundberg rice blends, this is by far my flavorite.  It has a rich nutty flavor and is a good source of fiber.  I sometimes blend in a little more wild rice  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5OMA">Lundberg Organic Wild Rice, 8-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>  You can also make your own custom blends with various Lundberg rices.<br />Ca $20 for 6 bags, w free shipping on orders >$25 (the price at the time of this writing) is a good deal.<br /><br />The only problem is that it can be hard to cook it just right.  Oddly, most published rice cooking instructions produce wet undercooked rice for me.  The following is my formula which works just right for any brown rice.  It produces firm dry, but fully cooked, rice, which is particularly ideal for mixing with cooked meat and/or vegetables (e.g., stir fry) or adding to soups immediately before serving.  To cook white rice, just alter the time to 15--20 minutes.<br /><br />COOKING INSTRUCTIONS<br />1) add 1 1/2 cups of water to an uncovered 2 1/2 quart sausepan<br />2) on HIGH bring the water to a boil, in the meantime measure 1 cup of rice.<br />3) as soon as the water begins to boil, turn the stove OFF (or take the pot off the burner), add the rice, and stir*<br />4) set the stove burner to LOW, set a timer for 30-40 minutes, and cover<br />5) when the timer goes off, immediately remove from the stove, uncover, stir and "fluff up" the rice with a plastic spatula, and leave uncovered for 1/2 hour.<br />6) after a half-hour, cover the rice until time to eat it.<br /><br />*If you simply dump rice into a pot of boiling water, and slap a lid on it, it will boil over and make a mess---you need to let the burner (particularly if ceramic) and pot (particular if heavy) cool down a little before you put the lid on.  The quickest and easiest way is to simply turn the burner off for the few seconds it takes to stir in the rice.<br /><br />DO NOT SUBSTITUTE BROTH FOR THE WATER; DO NOT ADD BUTTER OR OIL---you'll almost certainly get wet, undercooked, rice.  If you want to add flavor, add olive oil or butter, and Braggs Aminos or bullion AFTER the rice is fully cooked.<br /><br />CAUTION<br />On my glass-top (Kitchen Aide) range, I've found that I cannot cook ANYTHING simultaneously with the rice.  If the oven or ANY other burner is in use (or if the stove is merely warm from recent use), the temperature sensing circuitry of the range turns off the burner with the rice, with the result that the rice is undercooked.<br /><br />SALVAGING UNDERCOOKED RICE<br />You can't just put the rice back on the burner---you'll get glop.  Assuming that you started with 1 cup of dry rice:  Pack the rice into a 24oz covered casserole, for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MZPII">Marinex 23.7-Ounce Small Round Casserole with Lid</a> and microwave for 5 minutes.  The result will be PERFECT rice.  Really!!!  IT REALLY WORKS!!!<br /><br />COOKING IN A MICROWAVE<br />Add 1 cup dry rice and 1/2 cup water to a 24oz covered casserole, microwave 5 minutes(at "low" or half-power).  Add another 1/2 water, microwave 5 minutes(at "low" or half-power).  Add the third 1/2 cup water and microwave 5 minutes(at "low" or half-power).<br /><br />General Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.<br /><br />To see my, "How to Cook Rice" for more details<br />click on "See all my reviews" above, then click on "So you'd like to know" guides on the left side of the page

review/summary: Nutty and healthy replacement for white rice
review/text: Keeping in mind that rice is one of the least expensive foods on Earth, this rice is very expensive.  This blend is very tasty with nutty and earthy flavors.  White rice (except Basmati) has almost no flavor by comparison.<br /><br />This rice has a long cooking time at about 1 hour or more.  For 2-3 people, I use 6 ounces of rice and 2 cups of chicken broth or filtered water.  This is not the same ratio of rice to water as the cooking instructions on the package.  I cook using a small rice cooker or stovetop at a low simmer.  As with all rice, I add a teaspoon of oil (grapeseed or olive) and a California bay leaf.  I don't think this rice would go well with saffron.<br /><br />Don't stir the rice while cooking except at the very start unless you want the rice to breakdown and get mushy.  Fluff rice with a fork before serving.

review/summary: Great rice
review/text: I have been a lifelong lover of white rice and am trying to eat more healthy so I ordered this based on the reviews.  I was not disappointed.  This rice is delicious!  It's nothing like the plain brown rice you get in the store, it's slightly sweeter, more nutty and has a better texture.  It's very easy to cook in a rice cooker (though takes awhile) or baked in the oven.  The aroma is outstanding.  I can't say enough good things about this rice.  It's delicious with grilled veggies, chicken or shrimp for summer.  It's also very filling.  I haven't tried it yet, but I do think it would also make a good porridge or even rice pudding.  I have tried it rinsed or just straight from the package and both ways are great.  The price is also very reasonable.  You get 6 big packages and a little goes a long way with this rice.  I never have to cook more than a cup for dinner for my family.  I have to try the other flavors from Lundberg now!

review/summary: The best rice I've ever had.
review/text: We almost exclusively eat brown and wild rices, rather than white, and love them, but we mostly ate them mixed with meats and vegetables to add to their somewhat bland flavors. Then we tried Lundberg's Wild Blend on a whim (it isn't sold at our local middle-of-nowhere market, but we saw it on the shelf in Whole Foods). We're now buying it in bulk here on Amazon. It's absolutely delicious. It has a robust flavor that is wonderful all on its own, even cooked in plain water rather than broth, and its aroma is mouth-watering. It's high in fiber, so it's very satisfying, and its flavor seems to wonderfully complement everything we've so far tried. I highly recommend Lundberg's rice blends--we're trying a couple of their other varieties now.

review/text: Changed eating habits to shed weight a while back.  Have always liked "long grain & wild rice", but was looking for something better than offered at our grocery store.  After reading the reviews of this rice, ordered two of the 6-packs to qualify for free shipping.  It is really excellent.  My wife and I enjoy it very much.  I prepare it in a rice cooker. I've found that for a slightly crunchy texture, the water to rice ratio should be around 2.5:1 (2.5 parts water to 1 part rice).  For something softer, a little more water.  Highly recommend this product.  You won't be disappointed.  Amazon price much less than the grocery store.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I've been making the switch to whole grains over the last few months. The hardest part by far has been rice. I love rice. I could eat it at every meal. I make fried rice, serve it with meats, mix it in soups, etc. Most brown rice I've had has been a sticky, clumpy mess--hardly a substitute for the jasmine long grain rice which I adore. Thankfully a friend of mine recommended Lundberg rice, and this is the first variety I tried.<br /><br />I was a little skeptical looking at the package, and even more so once I started cooking the rice. It smelled very nice as it cooked though. I mixed in a teaspoon of butter and a little garlic and herbs, and served it alongside some grilled salmon. After a few bites, my initial concerns melted away. This was easily some of the tastiest rice I've ever had (white or otherwise). I loved every bite of it. I couldn't believe how good it was actually. I'm so, so happy to have found a brown rice that is a substantive replacement for all of the nutrition-less carbs that are in white rice. I plan to use this rice for most of the applications where I would have used white rice, but still treat myself to some fried rice made with white rice once in a while.<br /><br />Flavor, texture, and nutrition are all aligned with this Wild Blend. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves rice--white or otherwise.

review/summary: Really surprised at how good this is.
review/text: I'm trying to not eat so much processed foods and white rice and potatoes. Sweet potatoes get old after a while, so I decided to get some wild and brown rice. I checked reviews of quite a few, and it seemed as if the Lunberg rices had the best, and and this one in particular had the best and sounded like something I would like, so I ordered it along with a rice cooker.<br /><br />As soon as I got them, I opened them and got everything ready to make a batch. I followed the instructions, using a 1:2 ratio of rice and water, adding salt and pepper. After 1 cycle on my rice cooker, it wasn't quite done and was really dry, so I added another part water and set it for another cycle. It was okay. Nothing spectacular, but way too much as I was the only one that would eat any of it. I tried another batch the next day, and used beef broth instead of most of the water 1 rice, 2 beef broth, 1 water. it turned out better, but I messed up and put veggies in way too early. Talk about mush!!! Just made another batch with chicken broth 1 rice, 2 broth, 1 water and some garlic and pepper. I only used a quarter cup of rice, and it was perfect for just me. the kids have decided they will stick to the white rice or the rice dishes from a box.<br /><br />Now that I got my recipe down and figured out what I was doing, I absolutely loved it. It had a nice nutty flavor. It went well with the grilled chicken and veggies I had for lunch. I'm looking forward to adding different seasonings too, depending on what else I am making for dinner, maybe even add some mushrooms for a healthier mushroom rice than the ones you get in the store!

review/text: I've been using Lundberg rice for years and never once have I been disappointed!  If you haven't tried the Wahani,  that one is also one of my favorites!<br /><br />I love this rice with roasted chicken and 365 brand whole leaf spinach from Whole Foods!  The perfect meal.  I make extra and sometimes turn the leftovers into some kind of a rice salad with peppers, scallions,  beans sometimes,  and a nice vinaigrette and toasted pine nuts.  It's nice to have some extra laying around in the fridge.  Good in soups,  too.<br /><br />I usually make this Pilaf style using sauteed onions and sometimes sauteed sliced mushrooms,  with carton  chicken stock for the liquid in my rice cooker.  Turns out wonderful every time,  and my husband loves it.<br /><br />Since there were so many packages I left all but one in the box and stuck it in the freezer.<br />Watch out for pantry moths,...they get right into the unopened packages.

review/summary: We love it!
review/text: My family loves this stuff- it's sooo good! (It is very flavorful w/ a slightly nutty taste) I used to buy it all the time at our local grocery store, but we moved to another state and no one sells it here. I had to resort to buying it on-line because we simply cannot live without it. It's my 3 yr old son's favorite side. I usually serve it w/ salmon or roasted chicken.

review/text: This Wild Rice Blend, single bags, is very hard to find in area stores. Having to buy six bags at a time leads to some problems, ie: long term storage. I had E-mailed the producer asking the best method, twice0 but have yet to receive a reply.  Wouldn't it be nice if they would in 2 bag containers????<br />Paul Ziegelmair, FPZiegelmair@charter.net

review/text: Brown rice alone can be pretty rough going.  However this rice blend is both nutritious and tasty.  It sort of reminds me of Uncle Ben's but it's heartier and more flavorful.  Toss in a bullion cube into the boiling water for additional flavor from time to time.

review/text: Lundberg makes the yummiest rice products I've ever had. I eat their brown rice cakes and now this brown rice/wild rice mixture. The brown/wild rice smells fabulously while it cooks - very nutty smelling and tasting.  Their brown rice has a distinctive Lundberg stamp taste to it. This pack of 6 from Amazon even ships free if you can pair it with some other item you need to reach the $25 mark. I just can't recommend this product high enough. It's both very affordable, nutritious and very delicious.

review/text: Until trying the Lundberg Blend of Wild and Brown Rice, I was not a fan of brown rice but now am happily converted!  I did rinse the rice before cooking it in the rice cooker with a splash of oil, a few extra tablespoons of water and additional cooking time until fluffy and tender.  Five stars for flavor, texture, quality, and simple to prepare.  After just one serving of Lundberg Wild Blend of Wild and Whole Grain Brown Rice, I am happy I ordered a pack of 6 bags which were well packaged and arrived within two days after I placed my order.

review/text: This stuff is amazing. I just got a rice cooker with veggie steamer (Aroma brand) and this rice is the perfect compliment. It takes about 45 mins or longer but I don't mind at all. Slow food is where it's at anyways. If you are in doubt, just get it and I guarantee you will be hooked. It's way healthier than white rice so eat up! My girlfriend made fun of me for buying 6 bags of rice on Amazon but now I'm a hero... Super Vegetarian Man.

review/text: While looking for a distinctive, heart healthy rice, I discovered Lundberg Wild Blend, a delicious combination of Wild and Whole Grain Brown Rice.  Yes, it takes longer to cook (averaging 45 minutes) than the popular 3 nanosecond microwave white variety, but it is so much better for you!  A fraction of the starch and glucose of the others, Lundberg's is not only healthier, but it's tasty too and complements many main dishes like no other.  Try it!!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G82L62">Lundberg Wild Blend, Gourmet Blend of Wild and Whole Grain Brown Rice, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I purchased this rice because it is recommended by Clean Eating Magazine.  Where I live finding 'specialized' grocery stores do not exist and I found it impossible to find wild rice that wasn't white rice with a flavor pack.  This rice is very good with different textures and flavors you would expect from a wild rice blend.  Don't try to speed cook it, it takes the full 50 minutes. I also like to add chopped dried mushrooms.<br />The 16 ounce bag size is the perfect size so that you don't have open bags or boxes of rice in your pantry for months.

I would recommend this to anyone, but urge you to cook it COMPLETELY.  It really is worth the extra time.  I usually cook it for about 50-60 minutes in the micro on medium in my Pampered Chef black steamer thing.

review/summary: Wild About Rice? This Is a Wild Price!
review/text: Six one-pound bags for $15.00! Even my feeble math tells me that $2.50 a pound, less than Lundberg rice varieties cost in California supermarkets.<br /><br />Of course the price is irrelevant if you don't eat rice often enough to justify six pounds of extra weight in your cabinets. Also, there are still a couple of people -- make that a couple of billion people -- who prefer white rice to brown, but that's not a problem. Lundberg markets several varieties of white rice -- jasmine, basmati, sushi rice, etc. -- as well as an assortment of brown rice blends. This particular blend of wild and whole-grain brown rice is one of the most flavorful and aromatic, perfect for pairing with savory ragouts and goulashes. Note that if you order two varieties of Lundberg rice together -- that's twelve bags -- you get free shipping.<br /><br />No, I don't own stock in Lundberg, though I wish I did! Not only is the company marketing highly palatable rice but it' s also an ecologically responsible grower, using 'organic' farming techniques profitably and maintaining large areas of wetland habitat in northern California for migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway.

review/summary: My Favorite rice blend
review/text: I've been into Brown rice for the last few years for the health benefits. I got a little bored and tried this Brown and wild rice blend.<br />It is probable the tastiest rice I've ever had. It has a sort of nutty flavor and aroma that plain rice can't match.<br />Just looking at it on the plate compared to plain rice it looks so much more impressive.<br />I use a rice cooker and when it's cooking it smells so good. In my pressurized cooker it seems to require less water than<br />I'm used to but with some fine tuning I made it perfectly.I always wash it first to avoid it being sticky.<br />I can't imagine going back to plain rice any time soon. I had company over and couldn't wait to see their reaction to this rice.<br />They loved the smell and the taste. I had to share one of my bags with them. I will definitely reorder before my last bag is done.

review/text: I purchased this rice blend to go along with my newly acquired rice cooker. The rest of my family prefers plain white rice, but I dig my carbs complex like wicker furniture; thus the birdseed-like package impression appealed to me.<br /><br />I was unprepared for how good this rice is. It needs no salt or other flavoring. Just a pat of butter or a splash of olive oil, and the lovely nutty chewy blend of this rice shines through. I may end up gifting out the rest of the packages in this order; it's too good not to share. Expect another order from me very soon.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/summary: The liver flavor is better
review/text: Neither of my dogs likes this flavor as much as the liver flavor. One of my dogs spits this cracker flavor out, while she will happily eat the liver crackers all day. My other dog likes these crackers, but is not crazy about them. She also likes the liver flavor better. The container is handy for keeping the treats fresh.
