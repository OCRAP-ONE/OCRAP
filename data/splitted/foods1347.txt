review/summary: Really good treats for training
review/text: I've been using these for my puppy with training and he absolutely loves them.<br /><br />The only inconvenience I find is that, while each piece varies greatly in size, they are pretty large.  So, I cut them up into pieces appropriate to the size practical for training.  Each time he gets one it is just a little piece, and that works great.<br /><br />Since I do cut them up, I don't find these to be expensive at all because they really go a long way.<br /><br />The other important thing is the list of ingredients.  They are not full of junk.  In fact, there is NO junk in them.  Just beef liver.  I like that, as I really try to know that I'm giving him good quality foods and treats.

review/summary: Great but expensive
review/text: It is a great product. It is very nutritional and our dogs absolutely love them. My only issue is that it is outrageously expensive. It is about four times as expensive as coffee per pound, and coffee is already expensive. Liver is a very cheap meat so why $25 per pound. Our problem is our dogs will do anything to get one of these treats, so were stuck.

review/summary: All Natural and Dogs Love them
review/text: We have been using these dog treats for a long time.  The dogs love them a lot!  You cannot go wrong with these because they are all natural.<br />The only thing that I would say is a little disappointing about them is that some of the pieces are very small making them no good as treats.  You end up with liver "dust" when the larger pieces are used.  I generally take this "dust" and mix it into home made dog food for extra flavor.  Therefore, no product gets wasted.

review/text: We have a miniature Dachshund named Buck. We used this product to house and obedience train him. Now we use this as his daily treat, and he loves it! My Vet. told me this is a nearly prefect low fat treat. As a result of using Pro-Treat, we hardly ever have to use a leash while walking Buck. If it were not for local leash laws, we would not own a leash. The only problem I see with this product is the inconsistent size of the peices. It ranges from powder to 1 inch square, and every thing in between. I have done lots of research and Amazon is the best place to buy this stuff

review/summary: Great liver treats-extra benefits for white dogs
review/text: These treats are 100% beef liver--nothing else. You can't ask for anything healthier than that! Just don't overfeed them. They're treats, not food. Remember that. Your dog would prefer you forget that distinction, because he will love them that much. If you have a small white dog you are probably familiar with the red eye stains. Most people don't know that adding liver to their diet every day will get rid of that ugly stain. Don't exceed the recommended amount. The stain that's already there won't go away, it will have to grow out and be trimmed away by your groomer. But in a few weeks you should notice that white hair is growing in at the base of the old stains.

review/summary: Great dog treats
review/text: These dog treats are great motivators. At first the price seems high, but they last a long time because only a few need to be used in each training session. The piece sizes are not uniform, so I often break larger ones in half. The only downside is a tendency to crumble if you carry them in a pants pocket for too long.

review/text: When I first go my Havanese puppy 1 1/2 years ago, the breeder suggested these liver treats for using when training.  My dog will do ANYTHING for these treats.  They even use them at the name brand pet hotel we use in Phoenix.  You have to be careful not to give too much, but my dog, Tanner, got over his separation anxiety when I started the routine of asking for a kiss, then giving him a treat and then leaving.  Now he just wants the treat, I have to beg for the kiss.

review/summary: Training Reward-High Protein and Non-greasy
review/text: Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats are wonderful used as a reward during obedience training. For a dog motivated by food, this is high in protein, low fat, and not greasy so that you may keep it in your pocket! Because a great deal of  treats are used during positive reinforcement training, I have found that by cutting the squares into pieces the size of my pinky fingernail, the dog is not being overfed and will be able to take the treat without having to stop and chew it up, clean the crumbs, etc. This product is especially good when training puppies, because it is a soft treat to chew, therefore, no pressure or pain on those sensitive gums while the pup is in the teething stage. I cut the squares up and place them in a plastic container. When the pieces are gone, there are powdery crumbs left which I sprinkle over the dogs food at feeding time. There is no waste with this product. I have been using Pro-Treat for more than 15 years. The quality is excellent, and I found the best price to be on Amazon after doing a considerable amount of comparison shopping.

review/summary: Rolls Royce of dog treats.......
review/text: This product is a real bargain, considering the fact that dogs love liver. I've used this as an addition to another dog treat product I use for my dog. My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded with<br />Pro-Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2-3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to break into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!

review/text: Freeze-dried liver treats are easy to carry around in a treat pouch, don't have to be refrigerated and, so far as I know, are healthy, high-protein snacks without a lot of chemical additives and preservatives. All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them. Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite-size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage-shaped moist food from the pet store and cut-up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and/or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer.

review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product.

review/text: Pro-Treat Freeze Dried Liver Dog Treats / B000255OIG<br /><br />This is the sort of product that makes me wish I could give more than 5 stars... My puppy absolutely adores these liver treats - our dog trainer calls them "puppy heroin". With these treats, training becomes an absolute snap, since the puppy is willing to do anything for his smelly liver treat - and you will have his undivided attention during the entire training session.<br /><br />These liver treats come in cubes and slices about a half inch on each side. I slice them thinly three or four time lengthwise, and then again two or three time crosswise. The liver treats fracture easily, and the taste is so addicting that only the tiniest slivers are necessary to reinforce good puppy behavior. These treats are also low fat and low preservatives, so they are very healthy for your puppy and that makes them even more perfect for training. Really, once you try this treat, you will never need another!<br /><br />As always, purchase and shipping from Amazon was easy and painless, and the liver treats were packed carefully enough that there was no extra treat breakage - which is remarkable for dried treats.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: dog treats - beef liver
review/text: The dog loves these treats. But why is this particular package size not sealed? All other size packages of this product are strongly sealed, so that a plastic rib must be torn off to remove the lid. At least some tape could be used around the lid on this size. Please consider doing something to provide assurance against tampering.

review/summary: Gimborn Liver Bits Treats
review/text: We have been using these treats for a very long time, decades, and find they are accepted by almost any of our pets: dog, cat or ferret. They are their reward for taking their meds nicely. We prefer the largest size tubs for economy and convenience, which are usually not available at the pet stores. Thank you for carrying these.

review/summary: Travis loves them; inconsistent in size.
review/text: I have ordered these a number of times for my terrier mix (part pit bull?) - usually a little cheaper than in-store.  I initially used them for training only and then found that with the larger pieces I could jam a piece or two inside a chew toy, hide a treat toy or hollow bone that has already stood Travis' test and this can give my dog hours of enjoyment.<br /><br />My issue with them - and why I went with a 4 instead of a 5 - is the size of the pieces are inconsistent.  My first couple times there was a good mix of some larger squares - 3/4" - 1" cubes and smaller that I use for training bits.  My last order was completely smaller pieces - making it difficult to use it inside a toy/ bone as they come out too easily. Play time no longer lasts as long.<br /><br />I am hopeful that my next order in line with the others and have a mix. I would have given it a 5 prior to my last order.<br /><br />As a training treat these are AMAZING.

review/text: My two boxes absolutely LOVE these freeze dried liver treats; it is one of their favorites.  Both dogs do their kidney bean dances in the kitchen when we take the lid off.  The only bad thing is the treats are small and they only recommend a few daily.  (But, I guess that's not too much of a bad thing given these are a little pricer than the average dog treat)

review/text: I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.<br /><br />The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.<br /><br />The amount of product for the price is great!<br />I would most likely purchase again.

review/summary: Great treat to use as a high value reward!
review/text: My 4 month old aussie loves these! Whenever he's fixated on something (like another dog while we're on a walk), I quickly wave it near his head to redirect his attention. It's one of the only treats that can bring his focus back onto me. The other thing that works is hot dogs, but those aren't as easy to carry around as these freeze-dried pieces. Because of the power it has over my dog, I mainly only use these treats for special training sessions when I need a high value reward (e.g., for recall training). They aren't especially smelly, but some dogs can smell them yards away. I've been followed many times at the dog park by doggies that smell the leftover powder in my jacket pocket!<br /><br />The downside is that when I cut it into too small of a piece, it can crumble apart. Regardless, I think that these should definitely be diced down to a smaller size if one wants to use these treats as a training tool. The tub says that only a few should be fed per day, and it is to my understanding that too much liver isn't good for the dog. I've uploaded a picture of the feeding guidelines that are printed on the side of my 21oz tub and I'll also provide them here:<br />-------------------------------<br />Weight........................3 Times Daily<br />-------------------------------<br />10-30lbs....................1 to 2<br />30-60lbs....................2 to 4<br />over 60lbs..................4 to 6<br />-------------------------------<br /><br />So, for example, for a 60lb dog, about 4 pieces can be fed up to three times each day. Some people commented that only a couple can be fed to a large dog each day, but that information appears to be inconsistent with what is suggested on the tub. From my interpretation of the above table, the recommended daily amount is actually closer to a dozen than just a couple of pieces. I hope I'm not missing something here?<br /><br />I've also uploaded a photo of the front of the 21oz tub showing that it is made in the USA. It has a May 2, 2014 expiration date printed on the underside of the container.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!

review/text: I've been using Freeze Dried Liver treats to train and reward my dogs for about 20 years.  It is like dog heroin for my dogs, there is nothing they won't do for these treats.  It makes training a breeze.  My current dog, Samson, will sit in front of the pantry and drool until I give him a treat.  The treats are expensive so I cut them in quarters so they last longer.  These are 100% meat, no scrap or filler.  These are the only treats I give Samson, my Rottweiler.  You can't go wrong with these treats.

review/text: These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog.

review/summary: Great treat, but probably not for small dogs
review/text: These treats are similar to the PureBites, however, since I have small dogs (Peke mix), I generally don't give them these snacks because they are more suited for medium and large dogs (or small dogs with large mouths). Smaller dogs have a hard time biting down on them and there is the possibility of choking because the pieces are too large and dense for their small mouths, so I have to break them up into smaller pieces before I give them to my doggies. The PureBites, on the other hand, are flatter and easier for them to chew. The snacks appear to made in the same way, so if I had larger dogs, I would give them either this snack or the PureBites.

The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping.

review/text: My 2 year old German Shepherd loves this treat.  I keep it on my counter as a quick and handy treat for "mini, spontaneous training sessions".  The only issue I have is that most of the treats are a bit big and difficult to break into smaller pieces which is necessary for obedience classes where we go through many treats.  Therefore, I do not use these treats for that purpose.  (The container recommends only 3-4 cubes per day for large dogs).  Having said that, they are an excellent treat for occasional use and I would highly recommend them.

review/text: By far this treat is the best one that I have bought.  We used it to crate train out puppy and whenever he saw us going for the bucket or smelled it being opened he would run for his crate and sit in there until we gave him this treat.  The large bucket is the most economicay, but it does have a really strong odor when you open it; for that reason we always keep a small ziploc with the treats in it that we use regularly and only open the bin to refill that bag.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the sizes of the treats varies incredibly - but if one is too large we just split it, we will give 2 of the small ones, and the powder and bits at the end just go in his dinner one night for an added treat!

review/text: Kuhne Bavarian Style mustard is the real deal.  It is what you will want with Bavarian cuisine, with bratwursts and many other sausages when a sweet mustard is desired. It is dark-ish brown with a nicely sweet taste well balanced by acidity and mustard flavor.  It is a sweet style so you may want to serve another mustard like a Dijon along side for those wanting a little different taste.  I used this mustard with Bavarian-made Bratwursts and it was great.  This is also the standard mustard for use with weiss wurst the standard Bavarian white sausages eaten with pretzels before noon.

If you truly want ceylon/mexican cinnamon, use this link instead<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAU1F0?ie=UTF8&force-full-site=1<br /><br />DO NOT ORDER FROM LATIN PRODUCTS!! I received the wrong type of cinnamon poorly packaged. It looked like it was done at someone's house and they used twist ties to seal it in thin plastic bags. I complained twice (first Richard, then Lance) before anything was done. francisco (lowercase on purpose) came to the phone with a nasty disposition. When I did attempt to talk, he kept talking over top of me, being irate because it was not an error, his bait and switch of the product was deliberate. He said "I don't care about your business, I'm the owner".  After being threatened with legal action, he emailed me a label to ship it back, "I'm going to weigh it and if any is missing you won't get a refund". What reputable business comes to the phone with a combatative demeanor and attitude?  This operation is a team of con men in my opinion. Clearly he told the truth when he said he didn't care about my business and I'm sure he will against the law, put this merchandise back in stock.<br /><br />There are several addresses floating around for this 'business'.  Save yourself the hassle by ordering from someone else!

I am so glad I can order these online, I wish they were available to all kids to enjoy in the US, but for now this will have to do. The texture is so nice, and it is not overly sweet and they do not stick to your teeth. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great new treat!

review/summary: Mutant toucan down under?
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers. These gummy candies really don't stuck to your teeth!<br /><br />Personally, I prefer other Haribo candy, including the "gummy bears", but I'm sure I would have loved these as a kid. The exotic-looking toucan is a sure kiddie eye-catcher, although I suspect your kids will think it's a parrot. The actual candies have the shape and taste of tropic fruit. Thus, the banana actually tastes...banana (well, sort of).<br /><br />Yes, this is perfect for kids.<br /><br />It's also perfect for adult nerds...<br /><br />Thus, you can guess what fruit the various gummies are supposed to represent (I never made them all out - what on earth is the white pineapple supposed to be, for instance?). You can also try to identify the exact species of toucan illustrated at the package. I just did. It looks like a Keel-Billed Toucan, expect that the main colour of the beak should be blue, rather than yellow. A mutant toucan down under? In Sweden, Tropi-Frutti has a Toco Toucan at the package instead!<br /><br />Well, what can you say?<br /><br />And yes, I'm writing this in a somewhat flippant mood...

review/text: These gummies are far less chewy than any other gummy I've ever had and they were outright sugary.  I don't know if I happened on a bad batch, or if Haribo's Tropi-Frutti gummies are meant to be so sugary and less chewy, and I'm not talking sugary as a person who prefers less sugar, I'm talking sugary as in the amount of sugar completely over powers the fruit flavor.  I won't be buying these again, especially since Haribo makes so many other wonderful gummies.

review/text: If you are buying this, chances are you already know what for, and what to do with it. Maybe because someone else already made some delicious vegan dish with it, and you said, "Is there kennel ration in this? It taste pretty darn good."<br /> If you didn't like what they made you wouldn't buy it. Unless you yourself are a very creative cook and said, "Hey, I'm making a vegan curry dish that is gonna knock your slippers off."<br />or a chilli dish, or some spazgetti, or even some sausage like stuff, without having to kill a pig. The possibilities are endless. Great price, lots of protein, next time you'll buy 3 bags I bet.<br />If you have some cooking skills, have some spices and herbs, know how to make a great vegan broth to soak this in, you can make some great cuelty free meals.

If I pull this bag out her little tail is wagging like crazy and she will do anything I ask to get her treat. When you open the treats smell really good,  I've been tempted to try one; they smell so good.  The only draw back is that you need to put them in the refrigerator once you open the bag.  I highly recommend this treat for picky eatters.

review/summary: Perfect reward for all sizes
review/text: These are the best treats for nutrition & convenience.  They're roughly the size of a fat pencil (pre-schooler's pencil?) sliced into 1/4" discs.  They have the texture of hard salami (but no grease) so they don't crumble in your treat bag or even if you just stuff them into your pocket.  Their size makes them perfect for teeny to giant dogs; and they can be used as small reminders all the way to a handful for huge jackpot rewards.  I volunteer at a local vet clinic and always have some in my pocket; I haven't had any dog turn it down yet!  My lab-boxer mix is super-fussy about his food (Lab? Fussy about eating? Go figure!) and I can't tell you how many bags and boxes of high-end treats I have donated to the local shelter because they had no appeal to him, but these treats he absolutely loves! They are pricier than most treats but are (for me) well worth the cost.

review/text: I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.

review/summary: difficult to review for a cat but...
review/text: The product seemed great from the human viewpoint: high protein, no grain, quality ingredients and relatively reasonably priced on Amazon. However, my cats would not touch the food. I have one, older female, slightly fussy part Maine coon and a second, very large young male, an outdoor stray who has adopted us. Neither of them would eat it, both preferred the dry food  (Wellness Salmon). I usually give them both wet and dry food. The wet food, a different brand, is always eaten first but this time, both bowls of Wellness Canned cat food were left pretty much untouched after the first taste and remained so until I tossed the food the next day! I know cats are very particular ...they often dislike something for no reason I can understand and it doesn't necessarily imply a faulty product ...  but if a young, hungry stray decides against it, in this case, I reckon something is off with the product.

review/summary: She must be a picky eater.
review/text: My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure. Apparently healthy food is less appealing to cats...

review/summary: Cat loves this and it's a high quality food
review/text: I have a 1 1/2 year old cat and started feeding him canned food after reading about how cats don't naturally have a strong thirst drive and need most of their water to come from their food like in nature. Also as another reviewer said, this food doesn't have any of the crappy by-products that "Science Diet" and other highly marketed brands have. These brands even have by-products in their canned food.<br /><br />Cats are carnivores so the majority of their diet needs to be meat (aside from the small amount of veggies you might find in a mouse's or rabbit's stomach in the wild).<br /><br />Aside from that, my cat LOVES this food and it is very good for him. He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one.
