review/text: Hunger--at least in my experience--makes me fairly useless. Sometimes I just can't stop to eat, but don't like the feeling of low blood sugar. These bars are perfect pick-me-ups and quite portable. I make sure I have one in my disc golf bag and in my camera bag.

review/text: This fruit and nut bar by KIND is very, very tasty.  Travels well, even in the heat.  No problem with melting or not being able to handle due to the heat.  Nuts do require chewing so would not recommend them to anyone with chewing issues ... otherwise, they are superb.

review/text: Nice taste, but too tough to chew for me. It has a good smell of coconut skin & not too sweet. However, I prefer the Kind Bar Almond & Apricot without yogurt (love it!) since the bar is softer/chewier.  If you like a bit sweeter taste, choose the one with yogurt.

review/summary: Completely inedible
review/text: The first bite was horribly rancid, and I rushed to the garbage can to spit it out.  Then I rushed to the bathroom to brush my teeth and get rid of the last foul particles.  Even though this was not a normally refundable item through Amazon, they did give me a full refund, but they were not interested in my offer to ship it back to them at their expense to find out what went so horribly wrong.  The food safety system in this country is horribly broken.  After the peanut scancal of last year, it would be nice if something had changed and people were more responsible for what they put out there.<br />  In my opinion, the problem was improper storage temp. at the ware house, or ingredients too old.<br />Really a shame because it is such a good cause otherwise, and I love nuts.

review/summary: Taste good but...
review/text: These bars are tasty. Recently, many brands of health bars have come out with chunks of fruits and nuts glued together with a sticky sweetener, such as aguave syrup, honey or evaporated cane juice. KIND Bars are not exceptional among these bars, and all of these types of snacks are very good in my experience.<br /><br />What makes KIND Bars different is that a portion of the profits is directed to the PeaceWorks Foundation, which is a charity that supports peace in the Middle East. By "peace in the Middle East," they mean support for the "Palestinian Resistance" againgst the Israeli "occupation." This charity is considered centrist, and it rejects extremism, which it finds to be ineffective.<br /><br />Executive Manager of the PeaceWorks Foundation, Fathi Mohamed Hamdan Darwish, had this to say about the strategy of driving Israel into the Sea: "That solution is unrealistic and ineffective and can't be realized. We as a Palestinian people have historically paid the price of hundreds of thousands of martyrs and injured people and haven't reached this solution."

First time I served this to my dogs, my cat got in their bowl and started eating. This is the first time the cat has ever eaten the dog food! Went by again, but much too expensive for the small cans. cans are only 5.5 ounces and I have to feed each of my dogs touch cans for one meal.  Wish they would make this in 13 ounce cans and lower the price.

review/text: I can't even begin to say how delicious this mousse mix is.  We've tried many different ones and this is the best.  It reminds me of the Chocolate Budino from Bertucci's.  The dark chocolate makes it nice and rich without being overly sweet.  It has real chocolate chunks in the mix that melt in the microwave - I think having the real chocolate makes the difference.<br /><br />So easy to make - just put the mix with some whipping cream in the microwave, stir it, then whip up some whipping cream with a mixer for about a minute, then add the melted chocolate mix.  Let it set in the fridge.  It takes a while to firm up - but when it does, it's very rich!

review/text: I love York Peppermint Patties like you wouldn't believe, and in fact this is perhaps the only mint-flavored *anything* I actually enjoy (except for Wrigley's peppermint gum).  However, once you bite into one, the taste of mint will inadvertently satisfy your tastebuds so you won't feel like eating anything else.  In this sense, you can't literally MUNCH on a bag of these because sooner rather than later your tastebuds will say "Okay, no more mint please!"  The only way to eat a York Peppermint Patty is right after supper for dessert.  Perhaps this makes York Peppermint Patties the ultimate dessert since you won't get the urge to stuff down too many at once and make yourself sick.

Opening the patties would scatter the chocelate covering, and make a mess.  Once passed the mess, the patties tasted fine.<br /><br />It has been explained to me that taking extra care in the shipping, would make the cost prohibitively expensive.<br /><br />Would like to thank the "Bice Wholesale" Company for the efforts they took to send me a satisfactory product.<br />Sorry to say, they were only partially successful.<br />In this particular case, one could honestly blame the summer temperatures, and/or the heatwaves that pestered the Mid West and East Coast recently.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Adam B.

The mints arrive in a presentation box, a display that many small companies use to distribute the candies while collecting money on the honor system.  For someone like me that (as a kid) wanted a vending machine of his own, this is a cheap and harmless substitute.

Although cutting thousands of US jobs and moving to another country evidently hasn't brought the price down, just the quality (and probably safety) of the product. Look for Pearson's Mint Patties instead, they're still MADE IN THE USA, and they're usually cheaper as well.

review/summary: Sweet, yes. Alpine, not so much.
review/text: I've been suffering through an incredibly hot season, more sauna than summertime. I've had enough sweat rolling down my back to charge neighborhood kids three bucks a pop for a Slip 'N' Slide ride, and I'm finally at the end of my sweaty rope. I came here looking for something, anything, to help me beat the summer heat.<br /><br />I've watched those Peppermint Pattie commercials for years. Eating one gives 'the sensation of shushing down a snow-capped mountain,' they say. It's like 'yodeling in the frigid Alpine snow,' they tell me. It feels like 'a giant soothing Sno-Cone down your pants on a hot August afternoon'. So they say, in these commercials.<br /><br />Hogwash.<br /><br />On a particularly sweltering recent afternoon, I put their advertising to the test. I ate forty-six of these little patties -- and I got a 'sensation', all right. Not of skiing or crooning or cooling my undies, though. More like the feeling of three pounds of chocolate crammed down my colon, and a faint minty tinge to all five senses. You ever HEARD peppermint? I can't recommend it.<br /><br />Bottom line: Eat a Pattie if you're looking for a nice sweet treat. But if you're suffering through a summertime heat wave? Drop in a Sno-Cone. Your colon -- and your BVDs -- will thank you.

review/text: As with most of the reviews here my tins arrived with 75% or more of the wafers crushed. We ended up using a spoon to eat the crumbs of the 1st tin we opened. Outstandingly delicious but I cannot imagine serving these to guests as the chocolate had also melted and you cannot avoid getting chocolate on your fingers as you pick at the small remaining wafer tubes that are available. What a mess. If these had arrived whole they would get 5 stars instead of just 2.

review/summary: These Contain Milk
review/text: I bought these at a specialty store before ordering them from amazon.  They did not contain milk at that time.  I loved them, and decided to order a case.  Milk, as of the writing of this review, is still not listed as an ingredient on this website.  There are stickers over the ingredients, which include milk powder.  I called the company and was told the recipe had changed.  They were very nice and offered a refund.  Unfortunately, we opened one and ate some before I noticed the sticker.<br /><br />Even if you don't mind the milk, please be aware that they will arrive in crushed bits, not in wafer rolls.

review/summary: Petrodex small dog dental chews
review/text: I have used Petrodex dental chews for many years now. I have 3 shihzhu-poodle mixed breed dogs each about 15-18 lbs. I have tried various other products before staying with this one:<br /><br />Greenies---made them intermittently vomit green particles almost pea soup or gazpacho.<br /><br />Merrick bull twists---the dogs loved them, but they smelled and the dogs eventually smelled of them as well.<br /><br />Nylabone---they didnt like these as much, but sometimes they really did chew on them a lot. They last a looooong time, but when the dogs chew them, they make a lot of crunching noises.<br /><br />Petrodex they love them like a treat, eat the full stick in 1-3 minutes (depending on how much they want to tease the fast eater when his brother still has his), they dont smell, dont leave a mess and causes no ill effect on the animal. Their teeth and breath are fresher with them and need for tooth cleaning is almost nonexistent when given daily.<br /><br />Vendor Pet Food Direct is EXCELLENT to work with. Never a problem. Fast delivery<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00068K63C">Sentry HC Petrodex Dental Chews, For Small Dogs 24 ea</a>

review/text: This is a good quality oil and a nice, tasty brand.  The label of the bottle shows it is 1 liter - slightly more than 1 quart - of  oil.  We like to use this type of oil because it seems so natural, and we have allergies to soy in our home.  So much oil in the grocery stores is canola (popular with producers because birds and animals will not touch the plants), or "vegetable" which is always a soy-blend, and usually a GMO product.  Try it, and enjoy.

review/text: This stuff is sunflower oil - which has a higher burn point, better fat profile, better health effects, and great taste - compared with Corn or Soybean. It's priced like corn or soybean - and because it's European Union stuff - it has to meet the more stringent EU food safety regulations. Sunflower isn't something that's GMO at this point.<br /><br />Honestly - there is reason not to be using this - at this awesome price - and with this great quality. Will definitely buy more.

review/text: Using the SproutMaster I've had great success with these, full trays of sprouts effortlessly. One container will produce a massive amount of sprouts.<br /><br />If you don't know much about this kind of sprout, beans and peas are a good source of vegetarian protein. Sprouts, as they grow produce enzymes, which can play a number of roles in digestion and even immune system function, because most of your immune system is in your gestational tract. Sprouts are also a great source of fiber, and antioxidants. During the winter it is great to be able to grow a fresh, live food, because veggies at the grocery store are usually quite wilted or picked well before their peak. Sprouts, eaten fresh, are a plant that on a per-size basis, is pretty much the most potent and healthy thing you can feed yourself.

review/text: I'm an 82-year-old male with a swollen prostate.  At night I was getting up every two hour to urinate.  This cornsilk tea cut my trips to the bathroom in half.  For me it was not enough by itself and I eventually started taking Avodart to shrink the prostate.  But I have found cornsilk tea helpful for the prostate.

review/summary: Good taste for an artificial vanilla
review/text: As with most Wilton products (except their fondant), this has an excellent taste for an artificial vanilla. It is not strong however, so recipes should use the full amount asked for... do not reduce it. Purchase several of these at a time for my bakery when Mexican or real vanilla is not used.

review/summary: ARTIFICIAL flavor!
review/text: It is unfortunate that the wording of this item description doesn't make it clear that this is artificial flavor. Real vanilla is always brown because vanilla beans are brown. The artificial vanillas are by-products of wood processing and contain petro chemicals.  Do your taste buds and body a favor - use the real stuff even though your cake/frosting will not be pure white.

review/text: I have been buying these for years.  They are great -very filling.  The other reviewer is correct - they are on the sweet side.  I love them.  I keep one in my purse at all times.  There are more than 3 varieties made, but they are the only 3 Amazon carries.  The yogurt covered bars are even sweeter - but I love those too.

review/summary: Sweet and bland
review/text: Not something I'll buy again - rather bland puffed rice and nuts (mostly Brazil nuts and almonds), sweetened with glucose syrup and with some raisins mixed in - the only fruit I could taste, though the ingredient list includes apricots and peach.  The result is bland as well as overly sweet.  Though "Eat Natural" yogurt-coated almond & apricot bars are even sweeter, they're far tastier and would be my choice if I were to buy "Eat Natural" bars again.  I prefer Larabars to either - though I know they're not everyone's cup of tea.  (And the dates and other fruit used to sweeten Larabars seem more natural ingredients to me than the glucose syrup used to sweeten "Eat Natural" bars.)

review/text: This is a very good bar. There are lots of nuts and different kinds of fruit, but there is a bit too much sweetener (honey, etc). Good for breakfast, or half of one as a snack to get me through to lunch/dinner.<br /><br />Great price! Cheaper than Kind bars, although not as many different kinds available.

review/text: I'm eating this bar as I write and it it very yummy. Very nutty, not overly sweet or sticky, chewy, with a great little crunch.<br />If you love nuts like I do they're very delicious and if almost a little exotic, like you're treating yourself to a healthy dessert. Satisfying taste and hunger-wise.

review/summary: I'm nuts about these bars!
review/text: I love nuts, but I don't eat them straight out of a jar because I would eat way too much. These bars are the perfect compromise. They're chock-full of whole almonds and Brazil nuts, with lesser amounts of hazelnuts, filberts, peanuts and dried fruit. The high percentage of nuts keeps the bars from being too sweet. I bought these as a Christmas treat (they're a great alternative to fruitcake), but I liked them so much that I bought another box for after the holidays.

review/summary: Dry and tasteless...
review/text: This bar is from a company in the UK, which is interesting because this is pretty much how I remember all their food tasting when I last visited.  A chunky, crunchy texture with an odd amount of soft pockets as you bite through is completely ruined by the strange sweetness that arises from whichever ingredient is holding the bar together.  Too dry, too many strange textures that just seem the result of sitting on a shelf too long, probably won't please most people unless you've completely given up on fat, sweet or savory flavors in your diet.

review/summary: Bland because they're too sweet; there are better options
review/text: These are much too sweet for my tastes. I couldn't really taste the nuts or the fruit because of all the glucose syrup (the second ingredient on the list - honey would have been a much tastier sweetening option, but they only used a tiny bit of honey) and all of the bits of puffed white rice (again just another form of sugar) overpowers any other tastes. All I tasted was sugar and bland white rice. I did give it two stars because the bar did have a lot of nuts. Too bad I couldn't taste them. A much tastier option is the Kind brand fruit and nut bars. Theirs are also gluten-free, and they use honey as the primary sweetener and use the sweetener more sparingly, so that you can really taste the nuts and fruit. Amazon sells that brand too, and I'll be going back to that brand. These two are my faves from them:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVYF0">KIND Bar Nut Delight, 1.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVYEQ">KIND Bar Almond & Apricot, 1.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />Thought I'd give the Eat Natural brand a try just for variety, but it reminded me that just because something is natural, doesn't mean it's good for you. Too much glucose is not good for anyone. And remember, hemlock is natural too. That's certainly not good for you either... :)

review/summary: EXACTLY THE SAME INGREDIENTS AS KERNEL SEASONS!
review/text: I purchased this brand as I wasn't so satisfied with the Kernel Seasons cheddar cheese. The reviews convinced me that this was the best on the market. As it is the ingredients and nutritional value are EXACTLY the same, number for number, word for word.. They must be made by the same manufacturer and packaged differently. So to sum it up --I paid $10.81 for 6.14 ounces as compared to buying 6 of the Kernel Seasons which would have come to $13.57 for 17.10 ounces. Big difference, I paid almost 100% more for this product which of course isn't so great either. I feel ripped off but what can I do, you can't win em all. How would I have known if I didn't order the Paragon brand and compare.. This is just my consumer alert to others.<br /><br />This is Aug 20 2012 and I just corrected my previous review. I said I paid almost 50% more and it is really 100% more. Sorry, I never excelled in math.

review/summary: Better than I expected
review/text: I purchased because I could no longer find the Target Archer Farms kettle corn flavor in my local store or online. This was not bad and much better than the stuff I'd purchased in my local grocery store, but not quite as good as the Archer Farms.  The only thing that was a bit of an annoyance was that it is very fine powder so it makes a mess when shaking onto your popcorn. Also the sodium is a little bit high per serving (75 milligrams per 1/4 tsp).  I wish that information had been in the description before I ordered it.  If you can tolerate the sodium this a great find and I would rate this 4 stars.  If you are watching your sodium then this may not be the product for you.  The 1/4 tsp serving size is not enough for 3 cups of popcorn.  For the sodium content & annoying messiness, I rate this 3 stars.

review/summary: surprisingly good
review/text: i was really ready to hate this, but as they say on the packet---unusual but unusually good.  Its 100% manioc (tapioca) and you add oil and eggs and milk or water (i used rice milk).  The rolls I made came out surprisingly bread like, chewy in the middle, crispy outside.  I think they taste better once cool (less eggy smell) but----seriously----a lot more like bread than i ever imagined, and a healthy tasty snack.
