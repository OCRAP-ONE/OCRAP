review/summary: Does Not Contain Crack Cocaine, Just Seems That Way
review/text: These cookies have one small flaw that makes it difficult to give them five stars, they are almost literally addictive.  If you open a package of these cookies and do not eat them all at once, then I bet we can count the hours they will last.<br /><br />They are delicious.  To my memory they seem amazingly similar to another brand of sugar goop sandwich cookie, you know which brand I mean.<br /><br />If you miss "real" cookies because of your gluten free diet these cookies are more like their regular counterpart than any other GF cookie I have had.  They also seem genuinely vegan too.<br /><br />If it were not for the fact they are as addictive as crack cocaine they would be the perfect occasional snack. Not recommended for daily use, but really, really good.

review/text: I purchased these from Whole Foods for my friend as a gift.  She has Celiac's (sp) and always talks about how crappy gluten free treats are.  I gave her a box and she LOVED them.  I even ate one and I honestly could not tell the difference between an Oreo and Ktoo.<br /><br />I recommend these cookies and Amazon is cheaper than Whole Foods.

review/text: My 5 yo loves these cookies.  There are very few gluten free, egg free cookies out there that taste good, and these are one of them.  My father visited and ate some before I could tell him they were my son's "special" cookies, and he couldn't even tell they were gluten free.  I sent a package to my son's school so that for special events they have them on hand, and my son isn't excluded....in fact just yesterday they had a Teddy Bear Tea, and even he was able to have a plate of cookies like everyone else in the class.<br />I am so glad we found these...

I used these as the bottom of an ice cream cake and it worked out great. Next plan is to try it as a pie crust in place of a graham cracker crust.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: I was excited to try these, as they get rave reviews.  I've not had a sandwich cookie since I went gluten-free 10 years ago.  Sadly, I was unimpressed.  This surprised me, as other Kinnikinnick products are really good.  Right away I noticed that they do not look like the image on the package--golden and rich.  Instead, they appear pale and not particularly creamy.  Looks did not deceive.  They don't have a vanilla flavor at all.  In fact, there is no flavor, just overwhelming sweetness.  The cookies are OK, though they are very crumbly.  They have the barest hint of vanilla.  The filling has pretty much no flavor, is gritty, and leaves a powdery residue.  They are way too sweet and come off tasting synthetic. I scraped the filling out and just ate the cookies.  Despite my craving for a sandwich cookie, I would never buy these again.  The search goes on.

review/text: If you're gluten free and have been longing for that Oreo flavor, texture, and deliciousness - your wait is over. These are the real deal. The consistency  of the cookie is just right and the flavor of the filling couldn't be more perfect. They did a good job to even match the design on the tops of the cookie to match what you'd get from Nabisco.<br /><br />You get 21 cookies per pack and these aren't diet food at about 50 calories per cookie, so save these for dessert only!<br /><br />I haven't tried it yet but I bet these would also make a mean pie crust or crunch a few up as topping on an ice cream sundae.

review/summary: Almost as good as Oreos?  Not quite...
review/text: I was really excited to try these cookies because I really love Oreos.  After reading rave reviews, I went out and got a package of them from Whole Foods.  Maybe it's the fact that I have just recently been diagnosed as Celiac (1 month ago) and the amazing taste of real Oreos is fresh in my mind, but these just don't do it for me.  They taste nothing like real Oreos and probably have more in common with a Hydrox cookie.  If you are on a GF diet, you can eat these and pretend they are Oreos, but you have to have a strong imagination, because they leave a LOT to be desired.  I'd much rather do without (or make some home-made GF oreo cookies).

It's the package... when you pull out the plastic tray it's really hard to fit it back in the bag lol.

review/summary: Good Chewing All Day Long
review/text: I like to eat, so in between meals I chew Xylitol gum. I have been having trouble finding my previous favorite (Xpry Green Tea) so I looked around for other brands/flavors because I wanted something that other than mint but I also didn't want artificial flavors like Xpry fruit flavor.  I am pleased with this gum.  It is true that when you first begin to chew it, if you aren't careful, it has some crumbs that could fall apart.  When I start chewing, I keep it in a pocket of my mouth to keep all the gum in one area until it has chewed up into the normal gum consistency.  The flavor is present in the beginning and fades, which I don't mind.  With both the initial texture and the flavor, I am ok with these because on the rare occasions in which I chew conventional (artificially dyed/flavored/sugared) gum, I am horrified by the ridiculous flavor that annoyingly never goes away and the super-soft texture that never dries out.  I have been chewing xylitol gums for over a year and don't like other gums any more.  So for me, this gum is great. The pieces are round, and about twice as much as Xpry, or even more. The gum stays soft a long time and sometimes I chew a single piece for hours.  The gum also does fine if you take it out, set it down for awhile, and put it back in your mouth and resume chewing later.  (Like re-steeping a tea bag).

review/text: I have waited for the Starbuck's K-cups.  Finally, they're here!  I've only tried the Breakfast Blend and it rocks!  If you want a stronger brew then use the middle brew button but I find that the larger cup (3rd button on the B-60 and B-70) to work for me.  I'll try the others in the near future.  I've been drinking Gloria Jean's Capuccino (middle brew button) and Coffee Barista's Columbian.  They are excellent!  I like a strong cup of Joe but not bitter and these 3 are great!  You pay a little more for the Starbuck-s K-cups however, I feel it's worth it.  I'll pay just about any price for a "GOOD" cup of Joe.  People, stop your whining and enjoy your coffee -

review/summary: Great Way to Start the Morning
review/text: Starbucks' Breakfast Blend is a tad more bitter than their ubiquitous <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0069AFIN4">Pike Place Roast</a>.  If you are looking for a good K-Cup to start your morning, this coffee will work just fine.  At times, it feels a bit acidic (more so than other brands), so I would recommend some form of creamer here.  For whatever reason, these K-Cups do NOT taste quite as good as the bean version you can buy in stores.<br /><br />It seems that Amazon is now offering a decent price on these K-Cups, but you may be able to find them elsewhere for cheaper.

review/summary: OK, but just a "cup of coffee"
review/text: A cup of store-brewed Starbucks Breakfast Blend has always been my favorite cup of coffee. Even when I brewed (regular brewing) it at home I couldn't get the quite same taste, but I could get close enough. Now that I have a Keurig brewer, I was excited to finally see Starbucks BB k-cups.... but, ouch, the price.<br /><br />For comparison, with my Keurig brewer, right now I like Tully's Extra Bold Breakfast Blend and Tully's Extra Bold Kona Blend, both of which I brew on the 2nd cup size (~7oz).  I've liked some other k-cups in the past, but they haven't been available on Keurig's site for a while.<br /><br />Anyway, I finally gave in and bought the Starbucks Breakfast (and House) Blend k-cups (from Keurig's site). Neither is like getting the same cup at Starbucks. I realize it can't be exactly the same, k-cup vs large brew. The Breakfast Blend k-cup is ok, I guess.  But it just doesn't have any of the complexity you taste in a cup from Starbucks. It's just "a cup of coffee".  I brew it on the 2nd (~7 oz) cup size on my brewer... smaller is too strong/bitter and larger is too watery.  To me, it's definitely not worth spending more on the Starbucks branded k-cups since I don't feel like I am getting anything close to the store brewed cup. Actually, I don't even like it as much as the Tully's BB mentioned above, so wouldn't buy the Starbucks BB even if it was the same price. Bummer.<br /><br />(FYI - For me, the Starbucks House Blend is undrinkable - it's too bitter (and I've tried brewing 3 different sizes, from smallest to travel mug).  It's just bitter regardless, with no underlying complexity of flavor. )<br /><br />Hope this helps someone, since obviously taste is very subjective!<br />c-

review/text: Leave it to starbucks to enter into the "me too" market with an inflated price scheme. However, this product will flop as starbuck's consumers typically want to be seen holding a starbuck's cup so everyone will know they overspent. Since Keurig's coffee is typically consumed in the privacy of one's own home, starbuck's attempt to get in will certainly fail.

My wife really likes (she says the fries are crisp and taste good) but I wouldn't buy it again, so it is a matter of taste. The price was $17 when I got it, since then it jumped to $26.

review/summary: Consistently Good Darjeeling Tea
review/text: I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.

review/summary: Great food, price is a bit high, but noticed the difference in 2-3 days.
review/text: Now I know many people would rather spend $30 on something else rather than their cat food, but I have to say this cat food is great. Ever since I switched to this from Nutro brand cat food, my cats now have shinier and healthier coats, as well as more energy. My overweight cat has lost some weight too. Both my 2 year old and my 9 year old love this food. Though the price is a bit high, I think it's worth it for my cats. They're much more active and healthy after switching to this. They also eat less, as the food is more rich.<br /><br />This food is %45 protein, so it's a cheaper alternative to Innova EVO and Core Wellness cat foods, which have slightly higher protein content but higher price. In case you were wondering, all cheap cat foods will usually have around 10% of protein.... This is carnivore food we're talking about here! They can't even use most of the filler other foods have, it just contributes to empty calories and overweight kitties!<br /><br />Do your cats a favor and buy them this, it'll make them healthier and I promise you'll notice the difference within a couple days. Oh by the way, since this is full of protein, their poops WILL get stinkier. Now my two cats BOMB the place after buying this food, the smell is something similar to human poop after a big meaty meal! LOL. To me though, it's worth it. Just remember to keep some Febreeze handy!

review/summary: Skeptical
review/text: I'm one of those crazy cat 'mamas' and am very concerned with what I feed my three babies. My oldest two are 2.5 and 3 years old and will eat, (and have tried) everything under the sun. They where eating science diet for a while, until my vet told me that I wasn't doing them the good I thought I was. This January I took in another little stray who the vet approimated was about 4-6 weeks old. Kitten chow was out, except for small servings that I'd feed the little guy in my lap. (one of my cat has a weight problem...)  I went out and started them on  a 'all life stages' Natural Balance, found out about food recalls, and switched to Purina One. things where going fine until about a month ago when my oldest started having diarhea (Couldn't tell who it was at first, had to follow her around and check... oh the joys of pet ownership) I went back to Petco and after much debate tried Soild Gold.<br /><br />Now the bag is vaccuum sealed, which I liked. (The sound of opening it made the little guy jump) the sell by date was far off, making me think that it's newer than some bags i've bought. It wasn't invoved in the 07 petfood recall. All pros, as I was mixing the old with the new, two of my cats stuck there head in the bag and started going to town. Never had THAT reaction in a DRY food. The third one ate out of my hand, thought it was a treat! My overweight lazy kitty, wanted to play within a week! It was in love!<br /><br />Unfortunatly, I'm not sure if it's this food or the weather change (it went from 40s to 80s within a few weeks) or the food, but one of my girls (not the one who had diarhea on Natural Balance) is having some loose stools in the litter box. She seems energetic enough and happy and her coat is soft as heck, but the stool bothers me. I will finish up this bag because it's to pricey not to but, I think the search for the holy grail of cat foods may still be on. Taste of the wild is next for me.

review/summary: How much of the 45% protein is from chicken and how much from potato?
review/text: I am not sure how to rate this food. It is definitely better than any of the cheap foods I was feeding my cats before the great pet food recall scare. My cats seem healthy enough (though one of my three cats is trying very hard to be obese... just bought the Aikiou Stimulo cat feeding station to help her loose weight). I have been feeding them Solid Gold for three years now and would have gone on feeding them this forever had I not switched my cat litter from Fresh Step clumping to a non-clumping natural variety and realized my cats have very smelly runny poo. Obviously something in this food is not being digested by my cats. So I took a closer look at the ingredients and began to wonder if the "grain-free" idea Solid Gold employs is a great hoax. I mean, how much more nutritious is the potato in Solid Gold as a source of carbs than corn or rice? Also, though the analysis lists this food at 45% protein, the third ingredient that goes into it is potato protein. How much of the 45% protein is from chicken and how much from potato?<br /><br />I have decided I am going to switch my cats to Blue Bufflao when my current bag of Solid Gold is over. Because, though I have taken only one nutrition course, I instinctively know that a bowl of rice is indeed more nutritious than a bowl of potato. Hopefully Blue Buffalo will be easier on their digestive systems too. Apparently Wysong has a "starch free" formula but it is way more expensive.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list. The second and third ingredients are potato.<br /><br />Solid Gold Indigo Moon ingredients: Chicken Meal, potatoes, potato protein, Canola Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols) , Chicken, Natural Chicken Flavor, Ocean Fish Meal, Salmon Oil (source of DHA), Dried Chicory Root, Choline Chloride, Taurine, Parsley Flakes, Pumpkin Meal, Almond Oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols), Sesame Oil (preserved by mixed tocopherols), Yucca Schidigera Extract, Thyme, Blueberries, Cranberries, Carrots, Broccoli, Zinc Proteinate, Vitamin E Supplement, Niacin, Manganese Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Zinc Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin A Supplement, Biotin, Potassium Iodide, Calcium Panthothenate, Riboflavin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (vitamin B6), Vitamin B12 Supplement, Manganous Oxide, Sodium Selenite, Vitamin D Supplement, Folic Acid<br /><br />Update 10/29/2011: Just wanted to let everyone know that the Aikiou Stimulo cat feeding station is the best thing ever invented for chubby cats. My three cats are eating half what they used to! Which means they are pooping less too, which is kinda awesome. Still trying to finish my bag of Solid Gold though. I keep dry food in a big airtight pail and it stays fresh forever.<br /><br />Update 11/19/2011: Managed to find Wysong Epigen at pretty much the same price as Soild Gold and with free shipping on orders over 50 dollars. Search wag.com<br /><br />Update 12/20/2011: Wysong Epigen is amazing! My cats are shedding their excess weight and running around like little energetic crazies. They don't seem to be eating as much of it as they used to Solid Gold. To touch it doesn't seem greasy like Solid Gold did. PLUS their poo has solidified! Yay! All three of my cats are FIV+ and I am confident a good diet will help them live longer, happier lives.

review/summary: Cats gobble it up with gusto!!
review/text: Ive had my cats for about 3 yrs and the first year I tried many different kinds of wet and dry so called "premium" cat food but was not impressed by their reactions to it. After hours of online researching for brands of quality cat food I came across this brand which I ordered based on positive feedback and good ingredient list. Well Ive gone through about 4-5 15lb bags and I am very happy with it. My cats absolutley LOVE this food. They actually prefer it to any flavor of fancy feast which I end up throwing out after they just lick up the gravy and leave the remainder on the dish. the indigo moon gets gobbled up fast. No wastage. I keep their dished full of Indigo Moon they eat as much as they want, any weight they gain is lean muscle. One has actually buffed up quite a bit and looks like a gangster but not obese type of unhealthy fat that she had started to get with another brand until i switched away from it.<br />Petco carries it but I prefer to order the big bag from Amazon. It gets shipped to my door for about the same price as the store. I tried the lamb flavor form the same brand which they also eat but not as popular as the Indigo Moon which is a grand slam hit. My cats are siamese mix. 2 females are somewhat picky while the third male will eat just about anything (likes peas)<br />They all give indigo moon solid gold PAWS UP!! :-) meow

review/summary: My Cats Don't Like Changes... Except for This One
review/text: I was at the Mother Earth News Fair a few weeks back and was given a sample of this cat food.  Now, I have cough*five*cough cats.  (It's a long story, they're not really all mine, and one just showed up, and... whatever.  I like cats.  Shut up.)  My cats range from a twenty year-old (seriously) with kidney problems and a prescription diet, to a one year-old who'll try to eat anything she comes across.  I usually feed them all (except for the ill elder) a mix of Science Diet and Purina, which works well at keeping everyone's digestive systems going properly, and supplement with a once daily scoop of wet food.<br /><br />When I brought home the Solid Gold Indigo Moon, I fed them the sample like I would treats - a little sprinkle for each cat.  They all loved it, and we literally went through the sample - fed as treats - within a few days, each of them begging and doing their aren't-I-adorable act to try to get more.<br /><br />With five cats, $30/bag cat food is a pretty hefty investment to make.  Even if they really like it.  But, I was swayed by the nutritional information, and I figured I could try to incorporate Indigo Moon into their diets without committing to an all-or-nothing plan since my cats took to the food as a treat already.  As a bonus, by not switching them off their usual diet, merely "supplementing" with a spoon-sized scoop or two of Indigo Moon for their morning and nightly treats, they haven't had the digestive issues a food change can bring out in them.  The Solid Gold is a lot healthier than the old treats they were getting, and they seem to be just as, if not more, eager to eat it up.<br /><br />Ultimately, I highly recommend Solid Gold Indigo Moon Cat Food.  Even if it's too expensive to use as your cat's primary food, consider using it as a supplement or daily treat - it's both cheaper than typical treats, ounce for ounce, and far healthier - and who knows, it may go over even better than typical treats usually do.

review/text: tried another healthy choice brand before this brand & all 5 cats hated it but then was weaning them off the fast food friskies & cat chow anyway, but this bag they've all taken to eating at once. Little round pellets are easy for them to eat, especially the eldest which is 11 now & she was vomitting twice a day every day before I decided they had to have a healthier diet & this cat food fits the bill perfectly. I'm so glad I found this!!! I love my babies & they'll prob outlive me lol. Haven't noticed any improvement in their coats etc but it's just now into Fall & growing thicker. Did notice one of my males had really dry skin when I'd scratch his back & now that's mostly gone so if it's changing weather or healthier diet, who knows. Just know he's better so that's all that matters.

review/summary: Solid Gold Indigo Moon Dry cat food
review/text: After years of feeding my cats the typical, lower cost leading brand dry food from the grocery store, one of my cats was diagnosed with renal failure and another was diagnosed with food allergies.  The vet explained that the renal failure can sometimes be aggrivated by dry food with a high content of low-quality ingredients such as grains, by-products and fillers.  And the food allergy was to grains and it made her skin itchy causing her to scratch incessantly, pulling out fur and resulting in sore patches.  The vet had me try a very costly limited ingredient diet that would be beneficial for them both.  All of my cats did eat and tolerate the food well, but the cost was astronomical - over $30 for a 5 lb bag.<br /><br />I started reading the ingredients and nutritional contents of dozens of brands and varieties of dry food, online and at pet stores.  Using customer reviews, ingredient/nutritional information and cost, I decided to try Solid Gold Indigo Moon because it was holisic, grain AND gluten free, high in protein and low in carbs.  The handful of customer reviews I found among various websites were primarily positive and the cost was median among this type of food.<br /><br />I have been feeding my cats Solid Gold Indigo Moon in their "grazing" dish exclusively for over four years now (they also get one "feeding-time" meal of wet food every day).  Although my cats with the renal failure and food allergy have since died, I now have two insulin-dependent diabetic cats in my brood that benefit from the nutritional value and low-carb content of this dry food.  All my cats eat it and seem to enjoy it and, other than the diabetes, they are all healthy.  They range in age from 14 to 3 and all have solf, shiny fur, bright eyes and are (almost) all a normal weight (can't win everything).<br /><br />This is a brand that I trust and I will continue to feed my cats only Indigo Moon by Solid Gold.

review/summary: Great cat food at a reasonable price
review/text: We switched our kitties from Iams weight and hairball care, after nagging my SO for quite some time. This has much better ingredients and our kitties are transitioning well with no vomits or soft stools. The cats seem to have much more energy now and are much more playful. They still aren't even fully weaned after 3 weeks as I still want to finish up the rest of the Iams rather than waste it. The only thing I would like to request is to make the bag resealable, at least for the 15lb bag and get this into Petsmarts. It's no big deal though as our Iams bags weren't resealable either and I can get the food at Petco, which is a little bit further from me than Petsmart. I'm a very happy customer.

review/summary: My toddler loves this stuff!
review/text: We have to feed our kitty-boy gluten-free grinds after he developed a skin condition, we believe, resulting from the 2007 China pet food contamination scandal. After spending thousand$ for vet bills and meds, we tried this product, and now order it from Amazon because it is slightly cheaper for us than buying it from the vet (as long as free shipping applies). Truthbeknown, the quality of the Amazon source has been better--the texture of the product we were getting from the vet was inferior (crumbly). As for the kitty-boy, the skin condition has improved, but flares up from time to time. Also, as the title indicates, one of my daughters keeps getting into the stuff. It might even explain why she is 8 lbs. more than her twin sister at 2.5-years old.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Great Value!
review/text: I've been a Sanka fan ever since my Mother introduced me to this gourmet coffee when I was a kid. The flavor is full-bodied yet mild; smooth and uniquely satisfying. It reminds me of the excellent coffee I had while staying in Costa Rica one summer.<br /><br />A medley of the finest Arabica beans harvested from a multitude of premium world-class coffee plantations is used here and it shows! I blend in Coffee-mate Belgian Chocolate Toffee Creamer and the taste is to die for!<br /><br />Many of the finest hotels and restaurants offer their guests this same Sanka decaffeinated coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the masses, Kraft Foods doesn't promote the "Sanka" brand heavily because it competes with the sales of Maxwell House Decaffeinated Coffee. Too bad because Sanka is clearly superior to the Maxwell House labeled offering.<br /><br />As someone here mentioned, it is difficult to find Sanka in the local supermarkets - making this a great find!

review/summary: Great instant decaf...even better memories...
review/text: I grew up with my grandparents making themselves a cup of Sanka each night before they went to bed.  I remember everything about the "ritual" of them making their coffee.  As I got older and my grandparents passed away, I didn't forget about this little slice of memory, but Sanka really wasn't on my "radar."  In (relatively) recent years, I've found myself also liking a (very small) cup of coffee prior to bed and having tried many different styles of instant coffee, I have happily come to Sanka.  In my opinion, not only does Sanka taste better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M1MO30">Nescafe Clasico Decaf, 7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)</a> (my former decaf instant of choice) and is miles better than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4EZQ">Folgers Classic Roast Instant Decaffeinated Coffee, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a>, when I make my small cup each night, I can't help but smile and, admittedly, feel how much I miss my grandparents.  It's a good feeling, don't get me wrong.  In some small, perhaps crazy-sounding way, it's carrying on a bit of their memory each night as well.  And for that, in addition to the fact that it tastes great, I am proud to include myself as a "Sanka drinker."<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: If you have to drink decaf, this is the way to go for flavor.
review/text: My doctor told me I have to stop drinking regular coffee because I was having what FELT like heart attacks..little ones. I would just put my hand over my heart, check my pulse, I'm not kidding!! I even had a monitor for 24 hours, thinking at the age of early 40s this is crazy! Well, I went off of caffeine and that did the trick, instantly. No more panic attack feelings, and for me, that did the trick. I'm not saying if you have a heart issue it's probably coffee, lol! I'm just sharing my personal story.<br /><br />I tried every decaf, from the chain stores brands to the 'generic' cheap stuff provided by grocery stores. Then I tried Sanka, which by the way is HARD TO FIND. My Walmart stopped carrying it. I can only find it on Amazon.com and sometimes my Farm Fresh.<br /><br />YAY! Sanka is great! I love the flavor, the fullness of the flavor. It's wonderful with creamer, flavors and black, which I love all :)  The EZ Grip top is a cool idea, even though I'm not suffering from arthritis yet (thank God) it is easier to open than typical metal 'canning style' lids.<br /><br />If you love or just must drink decaf, give Sanka a try. I just love it and it really, really makes a difference. I don't think it's a small, "Oh, this is a bit better than my decaf" thing either, I love it a lot more than any other decaf I've tried.

review/text: I can remember when SANKA INSTANT DECAFFEINATED COFFEE first came out.  It was cold, in those far-off cave-days, and we had to be wary of the occasional roaming saber-tooth tiger.....<br /><br />OK, OK -- so I'm NOT THAT old, and neither, (despite being around for 50 years or so), is SANKA INSTANT DECAFFEINATED COFFEE.  In actual fact, though I saw (what was probably the first) ADS for Sanka Coffee, I never got to drink it, because 1)I wasn't old enough to drink coffee then, and 2) In our house, we used up one jar of instant coffee before buying another, and then, only usually when it was on sale, and we had a coupon for it.<br /><br />From what I remember, SANKA was one of the first, (if not THE first), decaffeinated coffee around.  But now -- so many years later -- I notice that there are TWO VARIETIES of SANKA instant coffee to be had:  DECAFFEINATED, and NATURALLY DECAFFEINATED.  I don't<br />THINK there were two types of INSTANT SANKA around then....but, when finally buying some for myself, I decided to opt for the NATURALLY decaffeinated instant -- both because I strongly suspect that this was the original, and because I, along with so many others, believe that "naturally" is the best way to prepare anything....<br /><br />The jar, of course, has changed.  It always featured an orangy-coloured label --but to begin with, it had<br />a picture of what looked like a middle-eastern carafe on it.  This, I suppose, put the image of good and rich Turkish coffee in the would-be buyers' minds -- though I'm not sure it ever contained any Turkish coffee....<br /><br />Well, the jar still has an orangy-label. The middle-eastern caraf, however, has long been gone from this label.  This doesn't bother me that much.  But -- IT NOW COMES IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY SHAPED JAR FROM THAT PICTURED HERE ON AMAZON, EVEN AS I WRITE MY REVIEW! Not only this.....but the jars of this coffee that I received are made of ---- P_L_A_S_T_I_C____!!!!!!<br /><br />Everyone today -- or most people, anyway, have, I think, some ideas in their mind of the things they think MIGHT herald the end of civilzation as we know it, for, after all, this IS 2011.  And next year....!....well, who knows?<br /><br />Someone wrote that the end of civilization just MIGHT be indicated by the multi-nominated Susan Lucci actually winning a Daytime Emmy Award.  (This happened --but NO-ONE, to my knowledge, ever predicted the CANCELLTION of the wonderful soap-opera, "All My Children", on which Ms. Lucci appears. (!)  For myself, I've always had this idea that as long as the instant coffees produced by Maxwell House came in GLASS jars, we were somehow safe.  But now, I find that SANKA INSTANT, NATURALLY DECAFFEINATED, in the 8 oz jars, (pack of 4), are presently actually being packed in ...(gasp!)....PLASTIC!  And not only plastic -- but in No. 1 plastic!  (Only No. 5 and No. 6 platics are reputedly safe -- to reuse that is.  Still....I feel queasy about this.  And now to my mind comes the even more horrible thought that perhaps ALL Maxswell House Instant Coffees will soon be packed in PLASTIC jars!  PLASTIC NEVER KEEPS IN FLAVOUR A WELL AS GLASS DOES!<br /><br />....................As far as the flavour of THIS coffee goes, (and I'm sorry I took so long in getting to this main point) -- it's good....but not great.  A mild flavour with just a hint of underlying deep richness is how I'd describe it.  I made it the way instant coffee should be made -- with water that has been boiled as MUCH as possible, (when making tea, let the water boil as LITTLE as possible.)  So -- this coffee is good -- but nothing really spectacular.  As always, like other instant, (and regular), coffees, it's also best kept in the refrigerator after opening, to preserve whatever flavour is there....especially now, when it is in a (gulp!) PLASTIC jar!<br /><br />The new jar is easy to hold, with a cylindrical base, then half-way up, it slopes slightly inward.  Around the upper portion are indentations, which look like drops of water, and, I suppose, are supposed to represent perked-coffee flavour.<br /><br />To me, however, they somehow look like tears...  :_(

review/summary: Fantastic all natural product
review/text: Every product from Fabrique Delices has exceeded my expectations. This all natural and preservative free product is made in America and syrpasses any expensive French import. This is my 3rd order and I'll order more soon. The seller, Le Village, is not the fastest shipper so be patient. Their packaging consists of a thermal bag and a couple of cold packs. All of my orders arrived with the cold packs melted. I wouldn't order from them if it's too warm outside. They really need to use coolers and dry ice or expedited shipping.

review/summary: Pretty good...
review/text: This product was much better than I thought it would be. I thought that any jello that didn't have to be refrigerated would be very rubbery in texture but this jello<br />isn't much different than the stuff you get in the refrigerated section of the grocery store. The lime flavor along with the pineapple chunks gives it a very nice flavor. Obviously jello from scratch is better but it doesn't do very well unrefrigerated (like in a school lunch bag).<br /><br />FYI,<br /><br />1. Amazon calls this a "24 pack" which is actually 6 packs of 4 cups each that totals 24 cups per order.<br /><br />2. I ordered this product when the temp. outside was in the low 90's and the jello didn't seem to be affected. I don't know how it would hold up in the high 90's to 100's since it has to travel around in the truck all day in the heat.

review/summary: Disgusting
review/text: This ginger is disgusting.  Since pickled ginger has almost no calories no matter how you make it, the nasty taste of Aspartame is unnecessary and highly undesirable.  I recommend The Ginger People Organic Pickled Ginger. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0071Q5FOW">The Ginger People Organic Pickled Sushi Ginger, 6.70-Ounce Glass Bottle</a>

review/summary: Sliced Pickled Ginger by Wel-pac -- Love it!
review/text: This is the best brand of pickled ginger we have ever tried, so now it's the only one we buy. Besides eating with sushi, I enjoy snacking on it as it comes from the jar. It looks and tastes just like the kind available in fine sushi restaurants -- perfect even thin slices with just the right flavor.<br /><br />I like that it has Aspartame (Equal) as a sweeter because of the need to watch my glucose levels. Unfortunately, so many people have been taken in by controversies spread through elaborate health scares and Internet smear campaigns involving hoax e-mails. Fortunately, Aspartame is approved in over ninety countries throughout the world, so I am not worried that nay-sayers will cause it to go away. Our entire family has been using it since it was first marketed. Equal and Splenda are the only sweeteners we trust.<br /><br />On the other hand, high fructose corn syrup, which has been proven a problem for many people, is in almost all processed foods, even ones that don't require sweetening. So happy it didn't find its way into Wel-pac.

review/summary: Has Aspertame
review/text: I saw this in the store and was excited. It's very hard to find locally. When I picked up the jar to see the ingredients, I saw they used Aspertame instead of sugar. I don't use anything that has that poison. So, I put it back on the shelf and learned how to make my own. It's so simple and cheaper too

review/summary: Poor quality and packing
review/text: The candy is shown in a sealed zip bag with a label sating what it is. It was shipped in a plain baggy taped shut. My order was for three different types of chocolate covered nuts, all pictured in labeled zip bags. I received three unlabeled sandwich bags without any packing labels or content information. The pecans inside the chocolate were stale. The peanuts are Spanish peanuts with the skins still on them. Who dips Spanish peanuts in chocolate? The skins make them taste bitter. I had intended to give some of them as gifts, but since I had to open each bag to figure out which was which I wasn't going to give an opened bag, especially after tasting them!  I contacted Bayside Candy and requested a refund. The response was to tell me not to rely on what the advertisment showed, but to pay better attention to what their seller page states regarding their bulk products. They also stated they would not give a refund unless I shipped the chocolates back to them.  You are not supposed to send opened food products through the mail.

review/summary: Dark Chocolate Covered Peanuts
review/text: My wife loves dark chocolate covered peanuts but when I tried to find some for her for Christmas all I could find was milk chocolate covered ones. I tried Amazon.com in a vain attempt to solve the problem and to my surprise and delight, they had them in several brands. My wife was delighted with these. I plan to buy more for Mother's Day as the original batch didn't last very long.

review/summary: Yummy AND healthy!
review/text: Our family has tried several different "healthy" and high protein pastas. Every variety we tried had an odd taste to it and our 4 kids would mostly not eat it -- until we discovered Barilla PLUS. It tastes totally "normal" and it passes the taste test of our 4 finky eaters. The "PLUS" must mean "good for you PLUS it tastes good", a rare combination. Highly rated!

review/summary: Love the product not the price
review/text: The producted passed the kid test and cooks well if you prepare al dente and finish off with the sauce.  If you over cook will taste like paste.  Be careful and watch the pasta and you will love it.  Amazon should monitor the cost and I don't mind paying for the convenance of delivery but 3 x the cost of the item sold in most stores was crazy.
