review/text: Love, love, love these crunchy little treats.  They remind me of "Munchos" but without the greasy tounge afterwards.  I don't usually like flavored snacks, but these are all great, not overwhelming and no gross aftertaste.  I subscribe to them so I will never run out:)

review/text: I really liked these chips.<br /><br />They came recommended from my friend and I really like them. The variety pack is great to try all of the flavors - although there were some I wasn't so fond of.<br /><br />The cheddar, bbq, and salt/pepper chips are great. The traditional ones are get this.... traditional. No excitement there.<br /><br />The chips are great - my brother still asks if I have any around the house but I haven't yet purchased them again.<br /><br />Hint: the have the texture of the snack Munchos.

review/summary: Healthier, better tasting option
review/text: I picked up a few bags of these at my local HEB and couldnt help but consume half of a bag in a day. The entire stock didnt last even a week for me.<br /><br />Many chips say they have a bold flavor but they never deliver. These, however, do. I tried the Garlic Parmessan chips and the first things I thought was how strong and delicious the parmessan was.. shortly followed by a garlic flavor. Combined with a sharp crunch, I cannot have enough of these chips. I'm almost afraid to buy a 24 pack because I know they won't last a month.<br /><br />It also helps that these things are pretty healthy for you. I mean, they are a potato crisp so you can't be entirely guilt-free... but I don't knock myself for going to town. I just avoid the potato chip aisle these are on when I need to lay low on the snack foods ;)

review/summary: Popchips - The perfect snack to pop in your mouth
review/text: I love Popchips!! They taste great and they do not have all of the fat that regular chips contain.  I was introduced to the wonderful world of Popchips several months ago and I have not looked at regular chips the same.  I do not consume copious amounts of potato chips, however, I do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers. My family enjoys the Popchips so much, that I purchased a variety pack of 24 (0.8oz bags) from Amazon.  They taste very good and the texture is wonderful, although I will admit they are a bit salty.  I really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best, with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second.  Make sure you have a large glass of water as you are consuming these popped treats, because as I stated before they are quite salty. I highly recommend these for individuals who eat potato chips and want a somewhat more healthy alternative.

We are partial to crunchy, salty snacks (like potato chips) but hardly ever get them because of the calorie overload.  These are a perfect substitute!  Great to tide you over between meals, or with a sandwich, or a movie-watching snack.  The small size bags are perfect for NOT getting too carried away, too!

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of "Wow!" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk "health food". "Wow!".

I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single-serve packages right around 100 calories a piece. Our favorites were the original, sea salt & vinegar, and sour cream & onion... but all of the flavors were good. These were perfect for snacks, but they also made for easy lunches. We'll definitely order again!

I almost ordered two since they were such a good price, I am so glad I didn't!  We don't care of these AT ALL!  The concept is nice, chips that are crunchy and better for you than most, BUT they taste funny!  They have a funny aftertaste and are not that enjoyable.  We have been slowly (and I mean very slowly) making our way through the 24 the box brought (we still have 19 left and we received them over two weeks ago) so they are not so horrible that you can't eat them, its just like forcing us to eat them so we don't have to throw them all away!  If you haven't had them before, I suggest trying them before committing to 24 bags of various yucky flavors!

Not just filled with air.<br />Not greasy, so makes a good on-the-go snack.<br />All natural, using no artificial flavors or colors.<br /><br />~ The Bad ~<br />Sill plenty of fat per bag (3.5 grams per bag of the sour cream flavor) so don't get them expecting them to be low fat.<br />Tastes like a low-fat chip, but with all the fat of regular chips.<br /><br />~ Conclusion ~<br />I'm 50/50 on if I'll order them again. I have a finicky stomach, and so I'm fine with things that taste low-fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so I'm undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might bring me back for more. It's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not.

review/text: I love shrimp chips and I love healthier alternatives as well so I thought these would be a match made in heaven. Not so much. The flavors were too strong most of the time (I am a huge fan of pepper but even I had a hard time enjoying the salt & pepper flavor and the salt and vinegar made me shudder with each bite because of how strong the vinegar flavor is -- and this is from someone who currently lives in the UK and enjoys all types of vinegar crisps here) and too bleh in others. The only flavors that my husband and I both liked were the bbq and sour cream and onion and we didn't enjoy them enough to want to buy these again.<br /><br />I wish these were as good as all the hoopla regarding them said but we still have 15 bags of these in our cabinet four months later uneaten so needless to say, I will be giving these away and avoiding them from now on.

review/text: I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had. If you're just looking for a great tasting brand of chips with health as a #2 on the list there are much much better brands out there. In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular; Some won't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it.

review/text: If you are trying to eat healthy (like me), but love junk food (like me), these are the chips for you.  I have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free, but a sandwich just needs something on the side. These chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich, and are a great snack for only 100 calories. They have no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, no cholesterol, 0 grams saturated fat, o grams trans fat, and are gluten free. Ingredients are potato flakes, potato starch, safflower oil and/or sunflower oil, rice flour, sea salt. They would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack. I ordered them on the subscription plan, a case a month, but might have to add an extra shipment. Everyone I have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more.

review/summary: Not as good as I was lead to believe
review/text: I really wanted to like these. All the reviews made it seem supernal, and, well as advertised, it's not fried nor baked.<br /><br />However, even though it is advertised as being "healthy" but still with plenty of flavor, that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt. I only looked at the nutrition facts after I felt they were too salty, and I discover that a 100cal bag contains 10% dv of sodium.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, nor am I trying to diet. These were my first food purchase from amazon, and I bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller. However, I just couldn't get into these chips.<br /><br />I realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals' tastebuds, and so I will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor. I personally enjoy chips where I can taste some potato as well.

review/summary: Pop Chips, yum!
review/text: I first got the variety pack to try all the different flavors, then I picked 2 and ordered them on Subscribe and Save (1 each on alternate months).  It's much cheaper than the vending machine at work and they only have chips that are bad for you.  These chips are crisp, delicious, and taste salty, mmmmmmm good! Each bag has 230 mg. of sodium. They only have 100 calories in a bag, and the amount of chips in the bag is ample for one serving, unlike other 100 calorie snacks where you get 7 almonds, or 5 crackers....  Now I can have chips every day at work for lunch, no guilt!  The Salt and Pepper variety is absolutely delicious.  The plain is great for dipping, and the barbecue is full of flavor.  The salt and vinegar is very sour, if you like that type, and the cheddar and sour cream and onion varieties are good, just not my favorites.  A very good deal on Subscribe and Save, chips delivered to your door, individually bagged and ready to take for lunch.  Convenient!  Nothing bad to say about PopChips!

review/summary: Popchips vs Baked Lays? Baked Lays taste MUCH better.
review/text: I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )

review/text: I've tried using a toaster/microwave/confection oven/stove to make these things myself, but I wasn't able to. I even tried barbecuing but was unable to get the chips to "pop". I verified my methods with a local grocery store clerk named Mat (his name has one "T", which seemed a little strange to me), but to no avail.<br /><br />I contacted customer support asking for instructions but they acted aloof and confused about their own product! I don't know why they couldn't just mail, or at least email me some popping instructions.<br /><br />Luckily I think even raw/unpopped they taste pretty good. People look at them funny at first, but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag, completely unpopped...

review/summary: Tasty, Crunchy, and Filling
review/text: I won't get into all of the specifics of these chips as they are listed here on Amazon. However, I will talk about the product overall. It is very well packaged, the PopChips bags aren't flimsy or too loud. You don't have to worry much about these getting smashed while they're in a bag with heavier items. They hold their own. When trying new foods, snacks, flavors, I tend to purchase a variety pack so that I can sample everything. Let me tell you, these chips are packed with flavor but, it's not, in my opinion, too heavy or saturated. My favorites are the Barbecue Potato and Cheddar Potato by far. Very realistic, savory flavors. Then, there a couple that are not my favorite but, tasty with time. The Sea Salt and Pepper Potato and the Sea Salt and Vinegar Potato are a bit strong at first and, if you don't like those flavors, I would say you wouldn't like those chips but, they certainly accomplish the taste of those ingredients. Original Potato and Sour Cream and Onion Potato are also tasty but, nothing to necessarily rave about, for me at least. I would not call this a "diet" chip but, a healthy alternative to over processed chips. I saw a few complaints about the PopChips being "too salty" or "high in sodium". The chips can come across salty to a person who doesn't consume much salt but, per bag, these PopChips contain about as much sodium as a cup of plain yogurt. Overall, great buy. You just have to decide if the price tag is okay for you, and for me, it is.

review/text: I had seen these advertised on the Hungry Girl website but was not big on buying an expensive potato chip.  I was given a free bag at some event & found them to be tasty.  The single serve bags in the grocery store were $1 for a 0.8 oz bag.  Buy them from here and they are $21 for 24 1 oz bags. (Same amount of Weight Watchers points.) If you get two cases, shipping is free! Get them now before the states force the sales tax thing through!<br /><br />All of the flavors are really good.  I even liked the BBQ which I normally do not like in a chip. The cheddar have a good cheese taste and the salt'n'pepper have a kick. They do not leave a funny aftertaste or strange mouth coating like some of the other lower fat/calorie chips.

The popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light. They are only 100 calories a bag, but there are lots of chips in the bag so it's a great snack.  The ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added.  Fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq.

review/summary: My new favorite chips!
review/text: I love chips and can easily go through an entire bag in one sitting. With Popchips single serve pouches, I can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only 100 calories. The single serve pouches also help in portion control. The larger bags are a slightly better value, but unless you have astounding self control, I would recommend the single serving option. They are that good! They easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips I've ever had, and at half the fat and calories, how could you ask for anything more?<br /><br />The variety pack comes in 6 flavors: Original, Sour Cream and Onion, Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, Salt and Vinegar, and BBQ. My favorite flavors are Salt and Pepper and Cheddar. My least favorite is Salt and Vinegar, but I don't like ANY salt and vinegar flavored chip. My only wish is that this variety pack contained the Parmesan Garlic flavor which is VERY good, but extremely hard to find in local stores. I have ordered the Parmesan Garlic flavor in a 24 pack here on Amazon, but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack.<br /><br />At ~$17 after the subscribe and save discount, each bag costs only 70 cents. This is a bargain for these great tasting, healthy chips and I highly recommend you try them!

review/summary: This picky eater loves them (most flavors)
review/text: I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is "sweet" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account.

review/summary: Pop Chips Rock!
review/text: These are the greatest potato snack products I've found.  Only 2 points for Weight Watchers.  Really crispy and tasty.  All of the flavors are great.  My only complaint......it's difficult to open the little bags.  I need a pair of scissors, but I guess that keeps them fresher for longer so it's a great trade off.  I would recommend these chips to everyone.

review/summary: Great guiltless snack
review/text: I really like these chips.  They have a different texture than regular potato chips but I still find it really tasty.  Even my boyfriend, who is often averse to all things "healthy" and "low fat" will gobble these up rather quickly.  The variety packs are great because they allow you to have a little bit of everything, but of course the downside is that you may not like some flavors as much.  I find the original version to be a little bland by itself, and the sea salt and vinegar flavor might be too strong for some people.

review/summary: Tasty potato chips, low in calories, great flavor
review/text: I am potato chip-addicted. I don't only enjoy potato chips, but I also enjoy any type of potato product. This product really hit the mark for me.<br /><br />I consider these a full-fledged snack. Each bag is packed with chips. They are moderately seasoned, and full of flavor. The consistency is slightly like a popcorn cake -- but they're crisp and crunchy, not puffy. They have a distinct potato taste.<br /><br />The best part? Each bag clocks in at only 100 calories! And I repeat -- these are not a simple "100 calorie" snack. What you get here is a full bag of chips. What's great about the content vs. calorie content is that these are perfect to accompany your lunch without feeling guilty about eating a 200-300 calorie bag of chips.<br /><br />My personal favorites were the Sea Salt and Vinegar and the Original. The barbecue flavor is sweet, not smoky. The Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, and Sour Cream and Onion flavors are standard fair. But the chips are adequately and evenly seasoned and I did not notice differences in seasoning from one chip to the next.<br /><br />These are a great product, well manufactured, and a treat to eat. I'll definitely buy more of these in the future.

review/text: This doesn't taste as addicting as the real fried potato chips, but it's still very good.<br />Considering it's low in calories and it's only popped..  it taste much better than the ones that are freeze dried.<br />These pops taste as light as the rice crispy treats, but with a good amount of flavor and crunch.<br />I like it, a small little pack that you can just grab when you feel like having something quick.<br />I keep then in my room in case if I ever get the cravings for chips.<br />All the flavors that come in are good too, no complains.<br /><br />The package also arrived fast and it's pretty cheap, I would recommend people who is watching calories to get this!

review/summary: Not bad, but not impressive! .8 oz equals about 15 chips.
review/text: Bought these based on the glowing reviews (4 1/2 Stars), and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price. First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated.

I gave them away to a senior center and most of the seniors didnt like them.  Sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals, they are the best.<br /><br />This snack (originals) fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specifically.<br /><br />I will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others.

review/text: These chips arrived in terrible condition. The box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual perforations on the box for display. Why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me. The box we received was heavily taped to keep it together since the box came open on the display perforations and looked like someone had driven over the box as well, which gives you an idea of the shape of the box. The chip bags inside were pretty flat, there were no chips, but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for. This is how many of the packages looked, flat. There were a few with edible chips, but not many. Not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box, common sense should have been used??

review/summary: Popchips Does It for Me
review/text: I was looking for a quality, low points (Weight Watchers (WW)), crunchy, salty snack.  I cannot stay on a diet if I feel deprived. WW's website had a coupon for these pricey chips.  Never had a "popped" chip before, so I gave it a whirl.<br /><br />Wow, the best crunch and flavor of all reduced-calorie chips I have ever tried.  Better than other brands' popped chips I have tried since.  I need portion control help and these little bags for 3 points do it for me.  The variety pack helps to break up any monotony.  My favorite flavor is the BBQ.  I am not a vinegar kinda guy.  The Salt and Vinegar flavor tastes like feet to me.  Love the rest of the flavors.  I love salt, so the saltiness is just right for me.  Thank goodness my blood pressure is not an issue.  I need these snackies.<br /><br />Lost 30 pounds so far in 3 months eating these.  Will probably buy them by the case in the Amazon auto order system to save on shipping.  I guess I plan on being a life-long fan. ...until something better comes along.

review/summary: Taste alright, but normal chips are better
review/text: These taste alright, but they are health food by no means. At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by-product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but don't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.<br />Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are.

review/summary: Like slightly charred popcorn
review/text: I purchased these because I was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips. Well, they're fairly healthy: absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy. However, I just couldn't get over the taste, which I can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn. If that undercurrent of "burnt" flavor wasn't there, these might have been more palatable, but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect. Also, the seasonings weren't consistently strong. Cheddar was o.k. Bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips...the flavor was straight from a bag of Lays. However, I was very disappointed with the Sour Cream and Onion which was just too light in flavor and the Vinegar and Salt which didn't have as strong a tang as I would have liked.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and didn't mind a watered down version of a fried chip. However, I just couldn't stomach them. I gave away the unopened bags to coworkers (none of which were impressed either but they're not on diets...lucky dogs). For now, I'll stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers.

I found amazon to have them cheaper, and ordered from them as they had more variety of flavor. All the flavors were to my liking. The only con about this is that THEY ARE ADDICTING!!!. You are warned! I purchased these through Amazon.

review/summary: overrated
review/text: These chips taste so dry and gross, I would rather eat carrots or something than these. They just didn't satisfy the salty craving and weren't worth the calories.

review/summary: Not for everyone.. but I love it!
review/text: I'm sort of a health nut who has weened myself off highly-palatable junk food. Junk food is delicious but it ain't good for you. Conversely, healthy food has a bad rep for being disgusting but I honestly think that it's just something that requires training and acclimatization.<br /><br />I really like PopChips. They don't taste absolutely amazing to be honest but if you're someone who is trying to kick junk food out of your diet, this is a good way to fulfill a craving without succumbing to unhealthier junk foods. Each bag is only 100 calories, which is very helpful for portion control.<br /><br />For me, the taste is great. It's not amazing but it isn't awful. Sure there are better tasting chips out there but how much more unhealthier are they?<br /><br />I've tried small bags of PopChips from the vending machine (which I recommend doing before you buy a case). I haven't tried all over the flavors until I bought the case and I was a little disappointed with half of the flavors in the box. Fortunately, my boyfriend and I disagree on what tastes good so he likes the flavors I don't like and vice versa. It works out great for us and probably will work out great for family situations and parties where people usually don't have the tastes. However, if you plan on consuming these bags on your own over time I can almost guarantee that there will be a couple flavors that you won't like and it might just be worth it if you just buy a couple bags of flavors you do like.<br /><br />If you're not accustomed to the taste of 'healthy' food, you might not enjoy these at first. Either way, pop chips are worth a try. Probably not by the case though. i recommend trying out a few flavors if you can find a small bag at the shop or vending machine before you buy a big box of them.

review/summary: Most flavors are very good
review/text: I bought these to try them out and for the most part it was a success. There are 6 different flavors of chips. 5 of them were really good. The last one though was not. The salt and vinegar ones were very vinegary and it was too bitter for our tastes. Maybe some people like it but not us. All in all though, they were mostly very good in both taste and caloric content.<br />I would definitely buy a box with the flavors that I wanted.

review/summary: Great idea
review/text: This practically falls under the category of healthy snack - well, almost.  Single serving bags mean you won't be overeating and the fact that these aren't in anyway greasy because of the way they are made is a huge plus.  Nice crisp crunch.  The bags are filled with air, which for the most part do a good job of keeping the chips whole.  On the case that I got, though, two bags containted nothing but broken bits.  Of the rest most only had a couple of broken chips - some no broken ones at all.  I also noticed that you don't find nearly as much coating from flavoring on your fingers as I've experienced when eating other chips.<br /><br />Purchasing it by the case to try out all of the flavors is a good idea and a decent value.  Some of the flavors are incredibly strong, to the point that I don't like them, so I won't be ordering this mixed case again.  Salt and Pepper just tasted like pepper, making this a very hot tasting chip.  The Seasalt and Vinegar is really strong on the Vinegar, which is a taste I don't enjoy.  I love BBQ flavored chips, but again, this was kind of strong.  I probably wouldn't purchase the BBQ ones in the future, but wouldn't say no if someone offered them to me.  The Original is really bland compared to these others, but not bad.<br /><br />The ones I liked the most were the Sour Cream & Onion and the Cheddar, both with milder flavors.<br /><br />I'd give this 5 stars if I liked all of the flavors.  Definitely high marks for the type of chip and the size of the serving and the fact that you can try all of the flavors in one order.

review/summary: Healthy and Good, What?!?!
review/text: Yes people, these things are healthier than the average chip and not only have flavor, but they taste good! I am not a big health food person, I'll take the grease if it makes it taste better. These are 100x better than those baked chips. My brother tried them while he was visiting and liked them so much it was one of the things he asked I mail him while deployed. Only draw back to these chips, they are definitely not for dipping.
