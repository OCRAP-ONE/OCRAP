review/summary: Would be best if Canola Oil was left out
review/text: Great ingredients although, chicken should have been 1st rather than chicken broth, the only thing I do not think belongs in it is Canola oil. Canola or rapeseed is not someting a dog would ever find in nature and if it did find rapeseed in nature and eat it, it would poison them. Today's Food industries have convinced the masses that Canola oil is a safe and even better oil than olive or virgin coconut, facts though say otherwise. Until the late 70's it was poisonous until they figured out a way to fix that. I still like it but it could be better.

review/text: I know this is expensive, but when you open the can and see how much shredded chicken is in each can, it will make it all worth it.  It is amazing.  Both my cats love it and I love the quality.  At this price, I had to stock up.  My girls even ate the little bit of kale that was mixed in with the chicken and then licked their bowls clean.  I love giving them this food!

review/summary: Everyone loves it!
review/text: Our 1yr old Savannah loves this canned food. We didn't even have to ease him into it. The first bowl was licked clean...juice and all. We alternate the Salmon with the Chicken for a little variety.<br /><br />We, as owners, also like this food in general. They offer real shredded chicken and not some mush or pre-formed mystery bits. I found an analysis online that showed this brand to be very close, nutritionally, to what a wild cat would have in nature. It has much more protein and almost half the fat and carbs than most staple brands. They also add the necessary vitamins and compounds that keep your cat feeling and looking good.<br /><br />As others have noted, this stuff looks good enough for humans to eat, so I have no problem feeding it to the cat. It is also easy on your wallet when you buy it in bulk.

review/text: Purchased through Amazon. These clams were disappointing to say the least. I suppose there's no standard definition of "chopped" but I expected small pieces. Even "minced" would have been acceptable, but these clams were "fine ground." Fine if you want calm chowder through a straw. Packed in very salty liquid. Tried to donate 3 of 4 huge cans to food pantry, but to my surprise they said the cans were out of date. Would not buy again at any price.

review/summary: Great for a  wheat-free dinner!
review/text: This versatile pasta dinner mix comes with a half box of rice noodles and a powdered mix of creamy Alfreda sauce.<br /><br />All you have to do is boil the noodles (do not overcook), add milk (even better, sour cream and/or cheese!) and stir in the mix. I add celery, bell peppers and onions also. You can be creative!<br /><br />They call it "chicken" but I have tried adding salmon and tuna for different results. I like albacore tuna best of all for the meat.<br /><br />For vegetarians, meat isn't necessary to make this a satisfying meal!<br /><br />A tip: It's less salty if you only use 3/4 to 1/2 of the packet and add cheese instead. Also, if you mix a different noodle in with it, like Vitaspelt, it tastes even better!

review/text: Due to busy schedules, sometimes we just need something quick for dinner that doesn't require much thought. This is definitely one of the better wheat free gluten free boxed dinners out there, and I actually look forward to eating it. It is a little too salty in my opinion, but I don't season the chicken or veggies I add, and that seems to cut the salt a bit. It is definitely quick and easy, and tasty, too. I will buy again!

review/summary: Delicious Gluten-Free Comfort Food
review/text: I purchased this on Amazon and it arrived in great condition with an 8-month out expiration date.  I prepared it using goatmilk and a large can of tuna packed in water and it was delicious!  Can vary the dish by adding different vegetables like peas, carrots, pearl onions, mushrooms, broccoli florets, etc and different cheeses to richen it up even more and cut on salt a little.  I definitely recommend Mrs Leepers Chicken Alfredo Dinner as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTZ96">Mrs. Leeper's Pasta Organic, Rice Vegetable Twists, 12 Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> which is my favorite other pasta that is tri-color and doesn't come with a mix.

review/summary: My Twin Babies Loved This One Right Away But Jars Kept Arriving Broken
review/text: I got the subscription and finally ended it after 7 occasions of broken jars in the delivery. I got tired of cleaning the mess and dealing with broken glass but the product is good even if watery.<br /><br />My babies love blueberries the most and over time they like pears and apples a lot too. This is a clear winner with them as it has only organic apples, organic blueberries and ascorbic acid. It's a great product.<br /><br />Be warned that your shipment could arrive sometimes with broken jars. I already said that! Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. When a case arrived with one or more broken jars, I reported and got credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken.

I CHOse macrobar because i liked the ingredients.  i wasnt interested in losing weight by eating chemistry-based non-foods.  (my other WMR is the Orgain shake in the afternoon.  those 2 WMRs plus 2 snacks and 1 meal in the middle of the day has been working great.)<br /><br />the coconut macrobar is delicious, filling and satisfying.  it crunches a little, is sweet a little, is sticky a little and it fills up a lot.<br /><br />the nutritional stats are good-- my dietitian was happy i discovered them and has added them to her list of recommended WMR bars. i'm happy to report i've lost 6 pounds *each* month these past 2 months!

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7TT4O">Kellogg's Raisin Bran, 25.5-Ounce Box (Pack of 7)</a> is good eating with plenty of good nutritional elements and plenty of raisins. There are two problems associated with this product:<br /><br />The price at this site is a little higher than the price in the supermarket.<br /><br />One cup has 190 calories.  Usually people like to select cereals with fewer calories.<br /><br />I don't suppose it is possible to cut back on the calories with all those raisins in there, but perhaps the manufacturer could cut back on the sugar and lower the calorie count.

review/summary: Great Cereal!
review/text: This is an everyday cereal. Besides tasting great it is a more tasty alternative to plain bran flakes.  What's great about this cereal is it will hold you over until lunchtime.  What's not-so-great about this cereal is the price.  It is rather expensive.  If you enjoy Raisin Bran stock up on it when it is $2/box at your local market.

review/text: I won't blame Cadbury for this since the prodcut came from a 3rd Party vendor, but be careful if buying food products off Amazon, unless it's Amazon Fresh...that's OK.  Anyway, when I got the candy I opened the bag and found that many of the eggs were crushed and had melted then re-fused together in what could only be described as Cadbury Mini-Egg baseballs...which, to be fair, were pretty interesting to look at and even sort of fun to eat.  That said, the candy definitey tasted a bit old.

review/summary: Works Well, but Doesn't Taste Great
review/text: First of all, the maca powder comes in a package that looks very different than the one pictured - I was looking forward to learning more product information by reading about maca, but the bag is a metallic pouch with a nondescript sticker label on the front, and a similar label on the back (both of which just say that it is red maca powder and don't give further details).<br />When opening the package, the smell is overwhelming (it is a loamy smell which is very pungent and unfortunately, the maca powder tastes just like it smells).  The powder is extremely chalky in texture (although this isn't necessarily to be unexpected with supplement powders), and has a taste that is truly unique (I can't quite convey what it tastes like, but even when mixed in with various foods, the potent flavor lingers and the food begins to taste like maca rather than concealing the flavor).  While I believe that the health benefits of the product are impressive, with a taste that makes it hard to consume enough to reap these benefits, it may be easier to get pills (or work really hard to find a recipe that conceals the maca flavor). The one things that seems to help diminish the flavor is putting it in the refrigerator (this is also the best way to preserve the maca as this is a large package of it and it would be a shame to see it spoil).

review/summary: Great tasting by itself!!!
review/text: I LOVE Coffee, but for health reasons,decided to kick the habit.  I stumbled upon the the Teeccino Herbal Coffee (Medium roast- Hazelnut flavor), and found that I am in heaven.  It DOES NOT taste exactly like coffee, but can easily be used as a substitute.  I added brown sugar and Bailey's brand of Irish Creamer to it, and thoroughly enjoyed every sip.  I did not mix it with any regular coffee whatsoever, but instead decided to just try a cup of the product alone.  I must say, it is very DELICIOUS.  I am looking forward to trying some of the other flavors.  What I like even more about it, is that it is made with herbs and nuts; you can hardly go wrong with that!

review/text: Served on it's own, like straight black coffee, it's great.  However, I wouldn't recommend adding creamer, milk, sugar, etc., whatever you would normally add, as it tends to take Away from the taste.  If you really have to have a sweetener of some kind, try a hazelnut creamer, as it helps make it palatable to those who need a little sweet with their coffee.

But that's not all - his mother can whip up different desserts for everybody, each in its own little bowl.<br /><br />Clever Mommy!<br /><br />This one is my son's favorite.  I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PDFTLM">Molten Caramel Cake</a>, but this one is great also.  Following the usual simple instructions, this is an even faster treat than the others.  It takes just about two tablespoons of water to get it right, then mix well and zap for 45 seconds.  Drizzle on the creamy dreamy fudge sauce topping, and after a standing time of two minutes you're ready to eat.<br /><br />Note: You may need to adjust the cooking time depending on your microwave oven.  I have a 1200 Watt microwave, and 45 seconds is a little too long for this dessert.  I use 40 seconds instead so the edges don't get crispy.  However, I should state that my microwave is working with a Third World electricity supply, which is somewhere between 50 and 60Hz, and anywhere between 106 and 125V at any given time.  You'll need to play around a little to get it just right.<br /><br />For baking without all the drudge<br />Try this brownie topped with fudge<br />Make it moist, or make it chewy<br />Then top it with the sauce so gooey<br /><br />Prove to all that you're the best<br />By passing the great dessert test<br />Whether you share or serve it whole<br />You're gonna have an empty bowl<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 26, 2008

Buying this is chaper than buying in the store as well, I think if you buy the same amount in the store you pay about 13 dollars more. Just be aware of the fact that you  need a can opener to open these cans.

review/text: I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.

review/text: The product seemed great from the human viewpoint: high protein, no grain, quality ingredients and relatively reasonably priced on Amazon. However, my cats would not touch the food. I have one, older female, slightly fussy part Maine coon and a second, very large young male, an outdoor stray who has adopted us. Neither of them would eat it, both preferred the dry food  (Wellness Salmon). I usually give them both wet and dry food. The wet food, a different brand, is always eaten first but this time, both bowls of Wellness Canned cat food were left pretty much untouched after the first taste and remained so until I tossed the food the next day! I know cats are very particular ...they often dislike something for no reason I can understand and it doesn't necessarily imply a faulty product ...  but if a young, hungry stray decides against it, in this case, I reckon something is off with the product.

Also as another reviewer said, this food doesn't have any of the crappy by-products that "Science Diet" and other highly marketed brands have. These brands even have by-products in their canned food.<br /><br />Cats are carnivores so the majority of their diet needs to be meat (aside from the small amount of veggies you might find in a mouse's or rabbit's stomach in the wild).<br /><br />Aside from that, my cat LOVES this food and it is very good for him. He eats a variety of flavors so he doesn't get sick of one.

review/summary: Thie Best Money can Buy for your Cat, Next to Homemade - Revised
review/text: I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.<br /><br />Edit: I've added to the review after it appeared Product Not Available.  If you hit create review, THEN hit Edit review, apparently it takes.

review/summary: Good Cat Food
review/text: My cats do like the food, although when I first started to feed them they kind of picked at it. Now I feed them only this food and a little bit of the dry food from this company and its no problem. My one cat was over weight and he is now more active and running around with the other cats and he looks much healthier and younger. I have one cat that vomits a lot and have had to buy special vet food, which helped him stop vomiting and he can eat this food too with no problem. I will say that the cats do like the chicken and herring recipe better, I think they like fish in general more then poultry. I do highly recommend this food, its worth the price, considering the vet food is just as expensive and there are lots of pork by-products and low quality grains in the ingredient list.

review/summary: My Cats Health Improved with This Food
review/text: I rescued three cats that were suffering from malnutrition.  I started feeding them wellness canned chicken cat food in small portions mixed with organic chicken broth.  I fed them a  few times a day, and within  a week they had more energy, and were putting on weight.  Within a month their coat was soft and shinny.  These cats did a total turn around and I believe that this fine food saved their lives.  I continued feeding the cats this food  because I am confident that the high protein and natural antioxidants will keep my cats healthy and it will also keep the cats hydrated.  I am very pleased with this food.  It is the next best thing to a raw diet.<br />Wellness Complete Health Canned Cat Food, Chicken Recipe (Pack of 12 12.5-Ounce Cans)

review/summary: Purr-fect!
review/text: I haven't bought Wellness through Amazon yet, but the prices are very competitive and will do so.  After discovering they carried Wellness, wanted to comment on the product.  When I adopted my cat, she came with unrevealed health problems.  She was on a nebulizer every day, no energy, vomiting and more.  As one reviewer stated, I did some internet research.  I tried some of the top of the line natural foods.  Once I got her on the Wellness wet food, her health was a complete turnaround.  She's twelve and acts like four or five years of age.  No more health problems.  The consistency is smooth, a potential problem for a lot of cats that won't eat chunky foods.  I absolutely can not recommend this food more highly.  The dry, is very small pieces and she's slow to eat it, but I keep it as a 'treat' food.  The wet is perfect in every way.

review/text: Both of my cats run to their bowl like it's treat time when I open a can of this flavor of Wellness cat food. They are really picky too.  This flavor is much juicer, has more 'gravy' in it than all the other flavors we've tried. I've even been able to put some liquid antibiotic in the gravy and it gets gobbled up.  That was a real treat for me-not having to bother with the syringe dosing!

review/summary: My cat Nigel does not throw up anymore !!
review/text: After my vet recommended switching from the basic Petsmart variety lo quality dry food, I tried Wellness canned cat food (even though the price was at least 3 times more expensive than the old Pro Plan).  My one cat would regularly throw up immediately following a meal of Pro Plan dry food.  The results now are that my cat has not thrown up in the 3 weeks since he has been on this food. I trust my vet and will continue to feed this food. My local Food Co-Op carries this food and it is cheaper than the vet's price.  My cat's health is important to me.<br />I switch between the chicken and the salmon varieties.  My 4 cats get 1/2 can(of a 5.5 ounce can) each - a day, plus, I also give them 3 tablespoons of the Wellness dry food a day.  Try it for a month and you will be pleased with the results!

review/summary: Terrible Delivery from Amazon
review/text: We usually order this from Petco because our cat has health problems and can only eat specific types of cat food. Ordering online at Amazon is easier and cheaper. But This time I noticed that this item, ordered FROM Amazon, was being promoted as a 2 day shipping item, despite having Prime Membership, and I needed it as soon as possible. After about a week of ordering this '2 day shipping item' i received notification that it had not yet shipped and was expected to be delivered a month later! The reasoning I was given was that if I order from Amazon.com directly I should expect a month wait time and they were out of stock. 1-I received no notification that the item was out of stock. 2-Don't promote something as a special with 2 day shipping when you don't mean it. People order things based on delivery time for a reason. I'm angry that I wasted my time and was relying for the food to get here in a timely manner. I will not order directly from Amazon again.

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Healthy Kitten Food
review/text: I purchased this food on the recommendations of cat nutrition experts in the know. I read about Wellness foods online as being an excellent food for cats.<br /><br />My kitten really enjoys this food. It is his favorite canned variety of several that I rotate feeding him. I only wish the Wellness came in larger cans and offered more varieties just for kittens.<br /><br />I sure hope it's as good as claimed...I want to give my beautiful kitten the best possible diet but it is hard to know what is really lurking in those cans.<br /><br />That is why I only buy what is considered high-quality, premium foods for him. He eats a mixture of canned and frozen raw from Nature's Variety.<br /><br />(The raw medallions are his favorite of everything I feed him! )  I will continue to feed him Wellness canned food as he matures.

review/summary: Healthy Canned Diet
review/text: Until I am able to make my own raw diet for my cat, I purchase this food for her, and I've been able to tell a noticeable difference in her health and energy levels. I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I'm slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive. Wellness uses human-grade ingredients, and while I don't care for the Guar Gum or Carageenan additives, it's still a product worth buying.<br /><br />With regards to the one star rating, shame on you for buying from a breeder, and for passing up "health food" for your pets. Just because they can survive on cheap food that doesn't use natural ingredients, doesn't mean it's good for them. Children can survive on a diet of sugar cereal and cheeseburgers, but no responsible parent would feed that to them, either. If you love your kids, you make them eat their vegetables.<br /><br />In conclusion, it may take a little while for your kitty to accept natural food that isn't filled with nasty additives and flavorings to make it stinky, but when they do you will see an improvement! I also recommend Natural Balance canned food, another good quality diet. Raw food is best, but high quality canned food is still head and shoulders above dry kibble diets.

review/summary: The best in the U.S. market today.
review/text: About the only thing wrong I can find with Wellness canned is the number of people who complain that their cats won't eat it -- even cats that were eating Wellness for awhile, suddenly they seem to lose interest.  People scramble to find why their cat suddenly won't eat it ("they've been eating Wellness for years!"), and end up blaming it on the company.<br /><br />It's not necessarily the company's fault. It's at least partially your fault for creating a routine in which you allowed your cat to become so finicky.<br /><br />As a human, there are a few brands I prefer simply because I grew up with them, and I know the taste of those brands blind-folded. I'm finicky about them.  Cats are *super*-sensitive and can taste even the smallest changes - including the plant their can of food was processed from!!!<br /><br />Don't let your cat become so finicky by feeding only one brand or flavor or variety consistently for years.  Mix it up.  Wellness may be the best, but there are several high-quality brands of canned cat food on the market in the U.S. today -- look into them.<br /><br />I highly recommend rotating a few brands of high-quality canned foods if you have any problems with feeding Wellness to your cat, and even if you're not. Wellness is still a great brand of food (the best in my opinion), still containing the same high-quality ingredients as it ever did.  My cat loves it and I feed several flavors (Chicken, Beef & Chicken, Turkey) as part of his rotation.

review/summary: Different Poduct Than What's in the Store.
review/text: We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience.

review/summary: Our cats no longer will touch any of it.
review/text: We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.  Same thing.  We wonder what's in there they no longer will eat.

After it was gone, we bought a 2nd case and all 3 of our cats became violently ill and vomited after eating it.  Thought it might have been a bad can so we tossed what was left.  Gave them another can the next day and same thing, all three cats became sick, vomited, lethargic and stopped eating for several days.  We went back to a food from our vets and now after several days they are OK again and eating normally.  I don't know if this was just a bad case of food or if Wellness has a quality control problem, but I would hesitate to purchase another product from Wellness.

review/summary: Superior nutrition at excellent savings
review/text: My 14 year old feline - Archie - was diagnosed with diabetes 2 weeks ago.  His diet for the previous 6 years consisted solely of Science Diet (adult/senior/light/age defying)kibble and a small amount of Friskie's canned at dinner time.  Per his veterinarians instructions to feed only high quality canned (wet) foods, I purchased Science Diet MD for diabetic cats.  Over the course of the following 3 days, there was no significant change in Archie's blood glucose which prompted me to start investigating cat foods a little more thoroughly.<br /><br />As stated on the Science Diet MD label, their carbohydrate content tested at 13%.  This seemed very high to me as diabetes maintenance is nearly ALL about carbohydrates.<br /><br />I discovered that Wellness brand Chicken tested at 4% carbohydrates. The fat content, at 60%, is higher than I'd like, but I'm okay with that, at least for the time being.  Archie's blood glucose plummeted 100 points within 24 hours of his first meal of Wellness Chicken.<br /><br />At less than $3.00 per 12.5 oz. (Amazon price PLUS free shipping)compared to Science Diet MD at $2.75 per 5.5 oz., Wellness also wins in the cost category. A double win X2 as I live in Alaska which is prone to unnecessary and outrageous shipping fees from unscrupulous/lazy vendors.<br /><br />Wellness Chicken is not vegetable free - it does contain peas and potato fillers (among others) but it is grain free which is also in it's favor.  Cats, after all, are carnivores.  It makes sense to me that their diet reflect this as much as possible/affordable.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

This is even better than the adult formula we were giving them in the mean time, because this satiates them by giving them more of what they need, so I actually have to feed them less.<br /><br />To those poo-pooing the fruits, veggies, seeds etc., the protein and fat content are the highest you can find outside of making it yourself, and you would still find yourself having to add these items. Even though cats are true carnivores and most wouldn't eat these other things by themselves in the wild, the fact is is that they DO eat non-meat items, when they eat their prey. They don't just eat muscle, they also eat the contents of the intestines, stomach, crops, and gizzards, and many try to get in the skull for the fats and lipids (because most wild prey will be very lean this is often the only place to get them). The trick is getting everything in the right proportions, and using actual, nutritious food.<br /><br />The price, yes, it is more. But, my family has had many, many, animals over the last 25 years, and we have seen the difference that a GOOD diet makes. And in the long run, it can help save an awful lot in vet bills.

review/summary: Cats love the food, but no pull-tab top, and dented cans.
review/text: I appreciate being able to buy this larger, more economical size from Amazon.  However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.  Inconvenient, especially since I feed my cats in the laundry room in the basement, not in our tiny kitchen.  Five or six of the cans were dented (I ordered a total of 24), a couple pretty severely.  I'm not sure what the box went through with the shippers, but even the cans need better padding!

review/summary: Healthy, and kittens dig it
review/text: I recently took home two bengal kittens, and wanted to do everything "right", learning from past mistakes, and one of the mistakes I had made in the past was not researching cat nutrition enough.  So this time I did.  There are quite a few top quality foods out there that aren't full of grain and "meat-meal", but I chose wellness because it is a bit more affordable, and is popular enough to be available at local pet stores as well as online.<br /><br />Now the big hurdle...do the kittens accept it?  Well, mine sure did.  I was a bit worried because they had been eating mostly Royal Canin dry food at the breeders house, but they took to it immediately and now are very passionate about dinner time.  Excellent!  I couldn't be happier.  Expensive?  Yes, unfortunately it is, but it is actually cheaper than Royal Canin and several of the others and in the case of Royal Canin, it has *much* better ingredients!  Do the research yourself and see, don't take my word for it!

review/summary: It's pricey, but our picky cats like it.
review/text: Our kittens will eat anything, even styrofoam & rubber bands if they can find it. but our older cats are very picky & spoiled. It used to be that we could only get them to eat Fancy Feast, then after they tried Fancy Feast Medlies, they wouldn't eat the regular Fancy Feast anymore. Now the only thing they'll eat is Natural Balance & Wellness, which are even more expencive, though they're not at all picky about cereal or treats. So we're spending about $80 a month on wet cat food, $100 if you include cereal & litter, & this is with a Petco discount.<br /><br />I'm not really pleased with the inclusion of vegetables though; our vet told us that cats cannot digest plant matter & that it only serves to make them poop more. Alos either Natural Balance or Wellness is giving our kittens random boughts of diarrhea.

review/summary: I like that it's grain-free, but it's awfully expensive
review/text: I know that grain-based foods are bad for cats. In the wild, they eat meat, not wheat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Wellness kitten food is about 1.5 times more expensive than the mainstream, grainy kitten foods, and i just can't afford to use it as my primary food.<br /><br />My cats haven't had any trouble so far with the other foods i get, so it's not that i need to buy this one to avoid investing in a carpet steamer. I'd prefer to use it more, for their long-term health, but... it's just not viable.

review/summary: Cats Love This; Doesn't Smell Like Bad Cat Food
review/text: Our cats love this.  We switched to this for half of their meals from regular dry food to help with urinary problems with one of the cats and to get them away from carb-rich food.  The cats really, really like this and have lost some weight over using Iams dry, weight-loss, hairball formula, which was one of the goals of changing their food.  Also, with it being moist food I can easily add a joint supplement to our older cat's food.  The only downside, like most moist food, is that the cats started having hairballs again.  This is why we give them this for only half of their meals and use dry food for the other half.  I switched their dry food also, but to a brand that isn't sold here, so I won't mention the brand.<br /><br />We love that this doesn't smell bad or give our cats digestive problems.  Cheaper moist cat food smells horrible and upsets our cats' digestive systems (which also smells horrible ;)).  I like that this is made with "human grade" ingredients.  I think this must account for the smell.  It smells pretty much like tinned meat a human would eat, like tinned chicken or fish.

review/summary: Best quality cat food I've seen
review/text: We moved our two Bengals from canned Fancy Feast chicken and turkey to Wellness Chicken.  It resolved a diarrhea problem quickly-- we think one of the cats became allergic to something in that Fancy Feast.  They enjoy Wellness much more; they have never attacked any food or treat more voraciously, even real chicken.  Plus, the litter box does not smell as bad, and I feel better about giving them food without nasty byproducts.  This is described as human-quality food, though I haven't been brave enough to try, I believe it.  Instead of smelling like a bag of fast food that got stuck under the seat in my car for a month, this smells like chicken soup.<br /><br />We tried getting our boys onto Avoderm, which definitely made their coats shinier and softer, and even increased their activity level (hard to believe for these Bengals).  However, once the mix got to be over 50% Avoderm, they didn't like the taste.  Can't give a low rating to any cat food because of taste.<br /><br />One note about shipping-- the packaging has not been perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers say.  The second case I received had a few cans with minor dents, but nothing was leaking.  The shipping box is larger than the case, with air-filled plastic pillows to fill the voids.<br /><br />This is not the least expensive food out there, but you are getting a better product.  We think it is worth it.

review/summary: Cat Food
review/text: My cats eat it that is all I can say.  I try and buy the best food available but we cat owners can only say our cats eat it or will not eat it.  What my cats really like is just tuna you by at the grocery store but I use this only for a treat.  They eat hard food primarily and I use the more expensive brand.

review/summary: High Quality Food
review/text: My two cats love this food!  I normally buy the chicken and the beef/chicken formulas and have been using it ~ 2 yrs now.  High quality ingredients with no corn or preservatives are a priority for me since my cats previously had issues with allergies and dander.  My cats no longer have dry skin and now only have some seasonal allergies instead of year round problems.<br /><br />The negative is that Wellness food is expensive.  I'm always on the lookout for coupons and I buy larger quantities in wet and dry food to save.  I only give my cats wet food once a day and use a feeder with a timer to ration out dry food for the rest of the day.

review/text: Our three cats don't like this variety. Probably because of the herring.<br />You would figure thyey would love the fish but I guess has too much of a fish odor.

review/summary: Most of the Cans Were Dented
review/text: I've been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter's house. This is to let people know that most of the cans in these packages are DENTED. In the beginning I had thought it was an occasional can or two but I see in the last shipment that all of the cans were dented. It was just a matter of degree. However, when I purchased these at the retail store, none were dented. I think this is a good enough reason for me to think twice about buying these via Amazon in the future. I don't believe the price difference is all that much. I would hate for my cats to get botulism from the poor quality of the cans.

review/summary: Dented Cans AGAIN!
review/text: I love the Wellness Chicken Formula.  Great ingredients, solid reputation, and my cats like it (not as much as Weruva, but they don't waste).<br /><br />Amazon used to ship these is ridiculously oversized boxes with a foot of bubble wrap on every side.  It was overkill, but the canned goods arrived without a dent every single time.<br /><br />Now, on my third shipment in a row, at least one can is dented, and we are talking massively dented to the point where on this 12oz can if you put another on top it won't stand straight because the top is now at an angle.  The problem is they use these tiny boxes barely large enough to contain the cat food cans, and the bubble wrap is just these extra large bubbles only placed on two of the four sides, leaving two sides exposed to UPS who inevitably dents most of the cans on those sides.<br /><br />I don't consider this UPS's fault, as they handle so many packages they can't afford to treat them like raw eggs, its Amazon's fault for repeat inadequate shipping.  I am definitely not renewing my prime account.
