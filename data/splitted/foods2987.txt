review/summary: Menopause Relief
review/text: I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.

review/summary: Mild sweet tea
review/text: I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

review/summary: Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!
review/text: I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas.

Also, it helped me in other way. After I started drinking the tea I stopped craving sugar. Needless to say, I lost like 15 pounds while drinking it. Is amazing and very medicinal. It also helps me with menstrual cramps. I love it! You can find it here online or in any natural health food store near you.

review/summary: IT WORKS  FOR ME
review/text: I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck

review/summary: No more breast milk!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again.

review/summary: Great for colicky acid reflux babies
review/text: We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

review/text: I got this tea because it is supposed to help with PMS and supposedly helps "prepare" the uterus for conception. I figured it can't hurt, so why not? I think this tea is very light flavored. I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.

review/summary: A great product, you must try!
review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

review/summary: Great herbal tea for cramps
review/text: My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

review/summary: Good Things Come in Stinky Packages
review/text: I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/summary: Fenugreek Seed Tea
review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

But just because a previous reviewer hated the smell and threw a tantrum, (which is ironic because Valerian is used for its relaxing properties) doesn't mean it doesn't work! Keep that in mind when making your decision to purchase a natural product! Valerian is not like raw garlic! It's simply a very safe and effective herb which, to me, has a wonderful smell!

It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/summary: The puppy loves this!
review/text: If my dog could review this product, she'd give it 5 stars. She obviously loves the bacon flavor and being a very licky puppy, this is a real treat for her. As the pet owner, I like that she seems so content with the product, but it's a non-traditional way of delivering a treat and seems a bit awkward. The treat is given through a roll-on ball, like the old deodorants. With little treat bites, you can reward a dog with one or two nibbles, but regulating the number of licks or the time they're allowed to lick doesn't work so well. For training purposes, I wouldn't recommend this product, but just for gratuitous treat giving, I think it's just fine.

review/text: I tried this product on my dogs 3 times and each time, they would not touch it!  Admittedly, my dogs are picky, but no even one of them would try it.  They would walk up and sniff it, but they would not even taste it.  My dogs (3) are all small dogs and don't eat a lot of food.  Maybe if your dog is larger or less picky, it would appeal, but I can't say I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Smells Super; Our Dogs Have no Taste Appreciation
review/text: I reluctantly give this a 3 due mainly to the smell of the Liver Flavor.  The sole purpose of the product is to offer a flavorful break from the ordinary dog food flavors they normally receive but alas both picky Yorkies refused on several occasions to even take a good whiff.  They love freeze dried livers from chickens, beef, pig and lamb but cannot stand Lickety Stik.  Just to test the situation I tried the Stik first and it was a resounding NO.  Then after they had freeze dried livers and again it was NO.  I took their favorite dry food and applied a small amount on several pieces and mixed them in with untreated food.  They literally segregated the morsels into edible and Stiks.  The Stiks did not get touched while the unflavored were eaten with vigor.  Determined to prove that the Yorkies are just picky I offered a few licks to the neighbor's Retriever and he looked at me as if I am the fool I am.  Success did not open its heart on several days ago nor did it when I tried one more time with the same negative results.  I cannot say that any of the other flavors have any similar aspects since I only received the one container.  Bottom line:  Human Rating: 3  Dog Rating: 1 too many.  Sorry but the effort was there.

review/summary: Our Six Dogs LOVE The Lickety Stik!!!
review/text: Our six dogs (four of our own, plus two foster dogs) all LOVE getting their "licks" from this Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik!!!  They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.  The key, of course, is to hold the bottle while the dogs help themselves, as opposed to giving them the bottle to do with what they please...  ;o)<br /><br />The bottom line is the Bacon Flavored Lickety Stik gets a unanimous "Four Paws Up" from my test panel!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Interesting way to "treat" your dog!
review/text: I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.  The dog's aren't talking but they definitely seem to like it...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and its made in the USA!

review/summary: Interesting Idea - Little Dogs Loved It
review/text: Well, the title says it all.  The little dogs of the household loved this interesting twist on the traditional treat.  They did not seem to understand why they were not allowed to walk off with it, but they grasped the concept eventually.  Often traveling with our two smallest poms, this "roll-on" style treat is a simple, non messy, non-poop-inducing alternative to traditional treats.  It is "just enough" when you want to reward them without having to worry about making a mess in the car.  I am not sure if this concept will catch on with the mainstream, but as long as it is competitively priced, I can see this being a useful tool for many dog-rearing activities.  While we are far past that stage, I can see this being helpful for different training activities as well.  Bring yourself and your dog "outside of the bubble" and give this new treat a try.

review/summary: One weird idea
review/text: Can you imagine how this product came to fruition?  It seems like an accident.  Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.  Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert.

We have small dogs...all less than 6lbs and I have to roll the ball for them to get more flavor so it's not so bad but I imagine that larger dogs can roll the ball themselves. If you're looking for something new and different then you may want to give this one a try!

They went at it with gusto-so much so that I had to put it away after only a few licks-afraid they might make themselves sick. Little did I know that my little monsters would find a way to knock it off the shelf & absolutely destroy the bottle while I was at the grocery store. I came home to a shredded bottle & 2 pomeranians with very guilty looks on their faces.....<br />I think this is a great product & if the reaction of my dogs is any indication-so do they.

review/text: I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog.

review/summary: Roller Jams, Wasted Product
review/text: The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.

review/summary: Lily LIKED It!!
review/text: My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours...ugh!) I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle. I think this is a great idea, but I am only giving it 4 stars because the packaging was hard to read and the ball didn't seem to turn very readily.

review/summary: Great Idea- My dog loves it.
review/text: I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)

review/summary: Great Idea for Dispensing Dog Treats
review/text: Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and "best" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  "Reilly" recommends the treat!

review/summary: Great, low-cal training treat.
review/text: I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt.

review/summary: Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie
review/text: The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're "healthier;" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.

The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)

review/summary: Whoa!  My Dog REALLY Likes this Thing!
review/text: When I received this "Lickety Stik", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it.  If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself.

review/summary: They are a hit!
review/text: My two Min Pins, who are constantly begging for treats, and then turning their noses up as most of what is offered to them, absolutely love this product.  They actually sat in front of me and took turns licking from the container.  It was hysterical; like two hamsters drinking water.  I will but this product again!

review/summary: My dogs loved it!
review/text: I wasn't sure if my dogs would be able figure out what to do with this, but they got it right away.  They loved the taste and would have kept licking it as long as I let them. The container is 5" tall and approx. 1 1/2" around and easily fit right in my jeans pocket, so this would be very easy to take on a walk. I could also see that this might be helpful if you happen to have a dog who won't eat - you could roll the liquid around the edge of his bowl and it may entice him to eat.

review/summary: I can't get my dogs to lick the container.
review/text: Maybe because we have all working dogs, it's hard to get them to take treats from the hand, and they won't lick the roller.  Then I rolled it on their muzzle like an antiperspirant they seemed to like it.<br />It's a great idea and a wonderful product to use if your pet will cooperate. It is clean, you can keep it in your pocket and not end up with little bits of kibble in the laundry.<br />Our dogs are Great Pyrenees and Border Collie.  I'd love to hear how it works with other breeds.

review/summary: An innovative invention much appreciated by canines
review/text: with the exception of my senior chihuahua that viewed the container of Lickety Stik as possibly a lethal weapon and, not wishing to take any chances, tore out of the room when she saw it for under-the-bed protection.<br /><br />"Oh well," I said, "I've got three other dogs.  Let's try them."  At first my toy bichon-poodle was also wary and stepped back.  But when she saw my shepherd and chow chow growing very excited and thrilled by this new offering, she relented and tasted some herself.  It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, "lightly" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.  Now I've only used it once, but I predict that the next time my dogs (chihuahua excepted) see me holding the by now familiar container, there'll be a stampede of sorts.  Just like in television commercials.<br /><br />Tail waggin' good!

review/summary: I think this is an unsafe product
review/text: Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package.

review/summary: Fun Idea
review/text: This is a nice idea for a low calorie dog treat.<br /><br />It looks just like a roll-on antiperspirant, and you have to roll the ball to get it going. One problem is that this is a syrup or other liquid that is pretty sticky and I usually have to get the ball rolling myself each time. Also, once I offer it to my dogs they can get one lick but cannot get the ball moving.<br /><br />The other problem I've had is my dogs want to take the whole thing, not just lick the surface of it. They seem to like the taste because they really grab the whole thing.<br /><br />I think it's a fun idea and it does seem to taste great to them, though I wouldn't really recommend it because of the ball being hard for dogs to roll. (in my experience)

review/summary: Dog was a fan, but I wasn't
review/text: I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently.

review/summary: Potentially messy but my dog loves it.
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Lickety Stik is a lickable (vs. edible) dog treat that comes in a variety of flavors, such as bacon, liver and chicken.  The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is "All-Natural with Vitamins," that there is only "1 calorie in every 10 licks" and that there are "over 500 licks per bottle."  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week.

review/summary: Interesting Dog Treat
review/text: My family has two chihuahuas. I tried the dog treat on the two of them today and got different reactions. The largest chihuahua liked it and the smallest chihuahua did not. This is par to the course and people like different things too.<br /><br />The treat is a liquid that taste like liver. It can be rolled easily anywhere you desire. All you have to do is take the top off and squeeze the sides of container. It is easy to use. It certianly is a new concept as I have always thought of dog treats as something solid.<br /><br />I would recommend it for any dog owner. If you have any questions, ask at this email!

review/text: This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.  Mine doesn't.  To be fair, he's 8 years old and set in his ways.

review/summary: Rich bacon smell
review/text: This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could "train" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.

review/summary: Our dog's opinions
review/text: We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.
