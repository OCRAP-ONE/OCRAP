review/summary: strong, burnt and bitter
review/text: I typically use my Keurig as a hot water dispenser, running it without kcups because they generally are too weak, even on the small cup setting.<br /><br />So, I'm very much in the market for stronger k cups.<br /><br />I can make medium size cups with this pod, but it's still a bit weak, and still bitter.  Makes a very strong small cup.  Perfect would be 2 pods, one cup, one brewed on short and the other on medium.<br /><br />As for the flavor of the beans, they produce a full bodied, bold and bitter cup.  Not necessarily a bad bitter, as it is pure arabica, however, I personally wouldn't recommend having more than one cup of these a day.  That bold flavor loses it's luster cup after cup, so it's not really a good all-around coffee.<br /><br />It's a good first or second cup of the morning coffee.  It's kind of like a cup of "good new york city coffee" back before the coffee renaissance of the past decade.<br /><br />Buying this in the extra large amount may not be suitable from an individuals' point of view because it's not something you'll want to drink 2+ times a day.

review/summary: I like it for my little wife
review/text: I love K-Cups coffee.  They are easy and one always has a FRESH cup of coffee in less than a minute.  However, coffee this way can be quite expensive.  I myself use those refillable cups that one can find on amazon.  I have a half dozen of them.  I fill them with grocery store cheap brand and set my Keurig for the 6oz expresso cup.  It makes great strong coffee.  My wife on the other hand is lazy and doesn't want to mess with the two seconds it takes to fill the refillable little baskets.  She loves the Green Mountain Extra bold and as I buy it for her she doesn't care how much it costs.  It's good coffee and keeps my wife of forty years off my back.  I'd pay twice as much for that feature alone.

review/text: Impressed,as always,with Amazon's expedient delivery. I perused customer reviews before ordering and felt comfortable with my choice (I was going to get the Emeril Bourbon Street blend , which I love) as reviewers gave this a great rating. I find it strong but bitter as opposed to strong and rich. Would not recommend this blend to anyone. No negatives to Amazon but wonder who could find this a pleasurable coffee.

review/summary: Feed your darkness
review/text: There's a Keurig machine at my new job, and they have a couple varieties of K cups that I haven't seen in local stores or wholesale clubs. My favorite, easily, of these is "Double Black Diamond", the darkest, boldest coffee offered by Green Mountain. So I checked for prices on-line. I was psyched to find this box of 50 for a reasonable 57 cents each or so delivered to my doorstep. I ordered on Wednesday, and the coffee showed up Saturday morning in time for brunch. Hooray to Green Mountain and Amazon. We'll be ordering more soon.

Might be overpowering for some people.<br />I recommend this to anyone who has been searching for a kcup that taste like REAL coffee. some of these kcups are so weak. i say giver it a shot or at least try the bold variety pack. their espresso blend s also very strong and Kenya-AA (all part of variety pack) but i liked this one over all.

review/summary: Almost too strong!
review/text: My biggest gripe with the Keurig pods is that the coffee is too weak so I always try the bold varieties.  I think I met my match with this one though. Its almost too strong for me.  I take my coffee black and this one has just a hint of bitterness. I have to use the tallest coffee cup setting when I use this pod.  Dont get me wrong...its a good cup of joe but for my taste I think I like the Emerill bold pods a tad better.<br /><br />On the plus side you can often reuse this pod for a second cup as its strong enough to still make a good cup second time around.

review/text: We're comfortable being honest are we not?  Cool, so I have a coffee problem, I'm OK admitting that to you.  And with that affliction comes the experience of having consumed a crap-load of coffee from all over, K-cups and otherwise.  In the end, Highlander-esque, there can be only one, and the Double Black Diamond is that coffee.  This is the untouchable, best Keurig coffee that I have ever encountered and I am relatively sure that once or twice while drinking it I experienced the mythical Quickening.<br /><br />Buy it, don't buy it, I don't care, just get out of my way so I can keep drinking it.  I just want to die with the taste of it on my lips.

review/text: This coffee is excellent if you like strong coffee.  I have tried Black Tiger, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and most of the other XB coffees, but this is the first one that is strong enough for me in an 8 Oz cup.  For reference to Tassimo owners, this is very similar in strenght to the Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona t-discs.<br /><br />I would NOT purchase from this any of the sellers selling it for twice as much as the other sellers though.  DO note that this product package cost you about $1/cup as you only get 1 box (of 24 cups) vs 2 boxes.  Otherwise, enjoy!

review/text: I've had my Kuerig for about 6 months now.  The hardest thing to do is find good, bold, strong coffee that can be used to make a 10oz mug of coffee.  Too many (most) K-Cups produce a watery-horrible 10oz mug but this cup stands up.  A mug of this coffee is still rich and bold.  I still lhave a hard time with how much K-Cups cost but when on sale this is a worthwhile coffee.

I like to mix this with other k-cups such as Jet fuel, Italian roast, etc. If you like strong, non-bitter, dark rich coffee - try this.

review/summary: Awesome brew, strong, bold!
review/text: Every time I get a new Keurig k-cup to try, it just gets better and better most of the time.  This one is no exception.  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is AWESOMELY bold, and makes a great 6oz. cup. (And it is strong, so you may like an 8oz. brew on this one!) You can tell by shaking the k-cups that these bolder flavors are ground more finely, almost like an espresso.  This really is the best k-cup coffee I've tried so far, just edging out "Dark Magic" because of it's arabica origin.

If you need some energy and a nice strong kick in the morning this is definitely the coffee for you. I know I do, I live in NYC and have an awful commute in the morning. So, I need lots of caffeine to get through my commute and the rest of the day. I wasn't really getting that from some of my other coffee choices of the k-cups. I just got my machine and I am experimenting with all the extra and extra-extra bold coffees and so far between this one and the Timothy's Parisian Nights. So, so good I love them!!

review/summary: Strong Bold Taste
review/text: I like strong coffee and this fits the bill. My favorite is Barista's Italian Roast with Starbucks Verona close behind. Green Mountain Double Black Diamond is almost as good as those 2 but less expensive. I will buy this again.<br /><br />To save money, we have been making our own Kcups by reusing the brand cups -- after use, peel the foil top off, try to get all off the edge (but not necessary). Rinse out the used coffee. There is a filter built into the cups. We bought some Kcup lids on Amazon - 100 for about $15. Fill the rinsed out cup with your own favorite coffee, snap on the replacement lid and you are good to go. When placing in cup holder, make sure the little hole on the bottom from first use puncture is at the top and fits back onto the bottom pin - that way you do not get 2 holes in bottom of Kcup. You can resuse the Kcup many times befor it wears out.<br /><br />In the morning I will start off with GM Double Black and then for 2nd or 3rd cup use one we filled. Someday's I splurge and start with Barista Italian Roast.<br /><br />If you like strong, bold coffee, try the Black Magic. It is smooth without much of a bitter after taste. Although, I kind of like that after taste. It is too bold for my wife, so I tell her to reuse the Kcup I just used and make an 8oz cup... makes a good cup of coffee, just not quite as strong... and we get 2 cups out of the one Kcup.

review/summary: Nice replacement for Green Mountain Coffee's Espresso Blend
review/text: Upon trying to replenish my supply of Green Mountain Coffee's Espresso Blend, I found they had discontinued it.  I hesitated to buy Timothy's Espresso Blend (now the only espresso k-cup on the market) due to the reviews but have since tried GMC's Dark Magic and now GMC's Double Black Diamond.  Double Black Diamond doesn't have the flavors the Espresso Blend has but it has a very good flavor on its own.  It has no bitter aftertaste as you would expect with such a strong, extra bold coffee.  Where the Dark Magic was too weak for my daily latte, the Double Black Diamond makes for a very fine latte.  This is my pick as a substitute for GMC's Espresso Blend.<br /><br />Update: I've been drinking this coffee for a few weeks now and have to say, it is great.  It is my new favorite!  Also, bought a couple of Extra Bold Roast k-cup coffee sample packs via Keurig and haven't found any better than GMC Double Black Diamond.

After reading reviews, I decided to try all the ones that were said to be good, strong coffees.  First I tried Jet Fuel.  It is strong, but no taste.  Then I tried Paul Newmans dark roast.  It was so so, but nothing special.<br />I saw the Big Easy k-cup and thought, this must be it.  It is good. Don't get me wrong.  It is my second choice.  But the winner is  Green Mountain Double Black Diamond! It is really, really good.  If you like your coffee strong and bold with great flavor, this is the one.  I don't care what it costs.  It is worth it.

TRULY A FAVORITE AMONG THOSE IN MY OFFICE WHO ENJOY A GOOD STRONG CUP OF COFFEE IN THE MORNING. I HOPE IT WILL BE AROUND A LONG TIME AS I WILL BE A LOYAL PURCHASER. TOO BAD IT'S NOT OFFERED IN THE SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE PROGRAM. TRY IT...YOU'LL LOVE IT!

review/summary: Bold, Rich, Divine!
review/text: In my search for the boldest, richest, darkest blend for Keurig, Double Black Diamond wins hands down. When compared to traditional coffees, it is comparable to Cafe Du Monde. I am actually quite surprised it doesn't have chicory in it. It is bold and rich without being at all bitter. Prior to this coffee, I thought Starbuck's Italian roast was the boldest commercial blend. But, Double Black Diamond makes it look weak in comparison. It brews to an almost jet-black and is very dark and earthy without a hint of bitterness or sweetness. It is very much like an espresso and I suspect it may contain as much caffeine. I am very surprised to find a Keurig blend that is comparable to the best French Market coffees and Italian espressos.

review/text: One of my concerns with the K-cup brewers is that I wouldn't be able to get a good, strong cup of coffe, which I love.  It has taken a few orders of different varieties to find a strong one that has the right blend of bold, flavor and bitterness.  Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond meets most of that criteria pretty well.  It is a little more on the bitter side than I normally prefer, which I why I only gave 4 stars, but overall a great bold cup of coffee.  I would order this variety again.

If you are a lover of stronger, premium coffee, this may be exactly what you are looking for when a pot of coffee is simply too much for one.

review/text: This is one of my favorite K-Cups, and over the last several months I've sampled pretty much all the "extra bold" ones I can find. This one is very dark and strong without being too bitter (although I don't mind a little bit of bitterness in mine). They are similar to the Green Mountain "Dark Magic" variety, but I find that they are stronger, and perhaps a little more bitter. For reference, my favorite K-Cup is the Starbucks French Roast variety, but I also really like this kind, Green Mountain Dark Magic, and Emeril's Big Easy Bold.

review/text: My original review was 1 star because I believe that I got a bad batch. I kept trying it and finally it started tasting good. It is the strongest K Kup on the market. With every other bold-strong coffee that I used to buy, I needed to use the 4oz setting on my Keurig or else it would be too weak. With this brand I can use the middle setting  (8oz) and it is still strong enough for me. Actually this saves money. Be warned, if you do not like strong coffee you will need to use the highest level on your Keurig or you will think it is too strong. If you want the strongest, this is the one you need to get.

review/summary: Great crackers
review/text: I am trying to follow a organic and gluten free diet. I also like to buy from reputable companies. So it is hard to find to come across products that meet my criteria. But these crackers do it. And they also taste great and are very nutritious. They are very sturdy to use for dips, spreads, etc. I have tried several of their flavors and they all taste good. The one with black pepper is one of my favorites, but it is spicy, so be aware. Nevertheless, I try to buy products that contain as little ingredients as possible, so of all the flavors they offer I prefer the Original flavor for that reason.

review/text: After I saw the long list of glowing reviews I decided to try a box of these. I miss my days of cracker eating before becoming gluten free. After I tried them I can only scratch my head in wonder. I don't get it. I didn't enjoy them at all, and I couldn't even bring myself to tolerate them with cheese on top. I'm sorry, they really do taste like dirt and they are so hard that you could probably break one in half and shave with it.

review/text: I am a holistic health and nutrition counselor who helps clients move to a more whole foods based diet.  These crackers are great because they are made from 100% whole grains and not very processed at all ... and they still taste great!  I ordered a case and have given them away to family and friends (to help them be healthier) and keep them at home and at work ... Love them - and it's much cheaper to buy by the case from Amazon than it is to buy at Whole Foods Market or a health foods store.  Enjoy!

review/text: I had to start a gluten-free diet so I purchased these crackers and liked them very much.  Last year I opened a box and noticed webbing in the cellophane package.  Upon closer examination I noticed many tiny worm-like creatures so I immediately threw the box away.  I didn't purchase them for a while after that but did recently buy them again.  I just went to pull a cracker out of the box and along with the cracker came a 3" piece of old wool yarn - I'm done!

There are much better tasting GF options that truly are crackers, like from Blue Diamond and Glutino. Mary's Gone Crackers really are "gone" from my home...because I threw them in the trash!

review/summary: Very disappointing burnt/bitter flavor
review/text: My girlfriend and I picked up a box of these from Costco, and had high hopes that they'd be delicious, natural crackers.  We are very open-minded about natural foods and most of the stuff we eat is very healthy and natural.  Well these crackers just taste burnt and bitter; they have the right ingredients, but the flavor just doesn't work.  We have previously bought, and still buy, the Crunchmaster Multigrain Crackers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YJBLMM">Crunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers Gluten Free 20 oz.</a>, and have found them to be the BEST natural, gluten-free, multigrain crackers on the market.  We're going to stick with the Crunchmaster crackers, they have a fantastic flavor, are very healthy, and go with everything great (cheese, dips, peanut butter, you name it).<br /><br />Another reviewer here noted that these taste like "burnt birdseed"; couldn't agree more, they were a huge disappointment. If you do decide to try these crackers, be sure to buy a very small box, then you won't feel as ripped off when you realize they are borderline inedible.

review/summary: These are the worse tasting product I have ever had!
review/text: I bought a case after reading such great reviews. UGH!! I spit it out. Was VERY VERY strong tasting, but not a pleasant taste at all. I thought well maybe its just me, so I have a few friends that are celiac so I shared with them. Same reaction, this 1 used it in her turkey thinking well its strong but maybe with a big turkey, oh my no 1 could eat it. I really don't know how people can say these are good, I only got the original flavor, it really was terrible, I threw them away. I know some people get paid to leave a review on here, I don't know if that is the reason for the good review or what. Usually the reviews help me decide what products to try with Celiac, but wow you guys were WAY OFF for me anyway. I threw the whole case away. IT was the only thing in the trash that the raccoons didnt get into for real. buyer beware~~!!!

review/summary: Crazy good
review/text: I started buying these at my local CostCo and when Costco stopped carrying them I started buying them in bulk on Amazon.<br /><br />I'm not gluten free so I could eat any cracker but I just love these. They ARE extremely crunchy but that's what I like. I also love all the little seeds and nuts and bits of rice and quinoa in there. They do have a strong grainy flavor, and as such they aren't good with everything (too strong for mild cheeses for example, it'll detract from the flavor of a brie). I tend to snack on them plain, too. I've served these to guests and I would say about two thirds liked them and the other third were not fans, so they aren't for everybody, that's true.<br /><br />If you aren't sure I would recommend finding them in your grocery store's gluten free section before you buy a case of 12.

review/text: I bought these accidentally, because I thought they were the crunchmaster crackers. I tried eating them multiple times, putting cheese on them, creamed cheese, jam, etc. It ruined the flavour of the things i put on it. They were so gross I couldn't believe that they would actually be for sale, so I returned them to Costco, who understood that they were inedible, and let me get the right crackers instead. Blech, I get a bad taste in my mouth just remembering them.

review/text: The flavor is OK, considering it's gluten free, but actually not that tasty.  After eating half a bag, I threw the rest away, because it has hard grain bits - really hard.  I recently broke a tooth biting down on something as hard as the grain bits in this cracker, and the dentist bill was close to $1000.  I'm not going to chance breaking another tooth with these crackers.

review/summary: Tasty and satisfying
review/text: I enjoy good, nutritious food that is interesting and flavorful. Mary's Gone Crackers - all of the flavors - meet my needs! They are crunchy, have a lot of texture, and a satisfying, nutty flavor. I find them interesting visually, too, since they are not of the cookie-cutter-every-cracker-looks-like-every-other-cracker variety. They are wonderful for dipping in hummous, baba ghanouj,or other rich sandwich spreads or dips, and are very good with strong cheeses. I think of these crackers as artisan crackers - even my wheat-eating friends think they are wonderful. (Beware, those of you who favor white bread and cheese spread. They will be a challenge to your taste buds. But persevere! You'll be doing your palette and your health a happy favor!) Their only drawback, in my opinion, is their cost.

review/text: Mary's crackers would have gotten a 5 star rating - I really like their taste, and they have lots of crunch to satisfy my crunch cravings. I'm not gluten intolerant, but was looking for a healthy, crunchy snack. I thought I had found it, however, they are a little *too* crunchy. There are pieces of rice in these crakcers that are a little bigger than I think they should be. Many times, I worried that I would break a tooth because of these pieces that felt like rocks, and I ended up having to be very careful how I chewed.  I would love to purchase more, but I fear doing some serious dental damage...

review/text: If you all want a tasty, light, crispy wheat free cracker I recommend KOYO brand organic rice crackers.  They have a few flavors like garlic and I think teriyaki (though I can't find that one lately).  These mary's things taste like card board and sand.  Who would review these so highly?  Maybe they like the flavor of cardboard and sand.  I myself like a light, crispy, more flavorful cracker.  I like teh KOYO but I am getting bored of just that one brand so I keep looking for more organic wheat free crackers but when my husband and I tried the "Mary's" we both almost threw up.  I instantly threw the whole box in the garbage.  Also the KOYO are sturdy enough for dipping too.
