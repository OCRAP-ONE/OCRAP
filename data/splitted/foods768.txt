review/summary: Best ice tea
review/text: The first time I tried this flavor, I was hooked. I have a hard time finding it locally so I subscribe here on Amazon to make sure I don't run out. It has a crisp, clean taste and I don't feel like I'm drinking a diet ice tea.

review/summary: BEST ICE TEA EVER MADE
review/text: I have a friend who came to visit me that insisted that she did not like powdered tea. Well guess what? This is all she buys and drinks. She told me she did not really know what she was expecting but she did not expect what she got and I agree with her. This tea is the only tea in my fridge all summer long. I drink at least a half a gallon a day and perhaps more. So if you are looking for a really good diet drink that does not taste like a diet drink and you do not want soda then this product is just what you are looking for. Amazon sells it at a reasonal price and it is delivered to your door at that. Try it -- You will like it.

We have found it in some supermarkets, but it is really expensive! My purchase from AMAZON was a wonderful bargain; great price! So, likely will have to re-order eventually! I must add, the purchase from AMAZON was so easy and the order was shipped promptly! Thanks for asking for my review!<br />All good!  Happy New Year!

review/summary: This jam is delectable
review/text: I have purchased this jam in the grocery store for years, and it is sooooo good.  Tons of real raspberry flavor, less sugary sweet, more like real fruit, and no artificial sweetener.  When I was pregnant my favorite snack was toasted whole wheat bread with Smuckers Reduced Sugar raspberry jam slathered on it.  Yum!  The subsequent child is now also a big lover of this jam!  This jam tastes like you went out into the raspberry patch and picked your own.  It reminds me of freezer jam, more taste and less sugar.  I love and appreciate raspberries and I love and appreciate this jam!!!

review/summary: These mini croutons stay crunchy
review/text: These canisters are about the size of a Rockstar can and contain enough mini croutons to dress several family sized salads for the dinner table, depending how heavy handed you are with the shaker.  My hubby and I use about a can a week with nightly salads.<br /><br />These canisters also contain red bell pepper flakes(sweet, not hot) and spices mixed with the croutons, it is a very tasty mix and really perks up a salad.<br /><br />You could also keep one of these in your desk at work to dress up those supermarket salads you buy for lunch.<br /><br />I even tried topping a casserole with them because they are mini sized and thought they would add great flavor and crunch to a tuna casserole, they tasted great and were better than crushed potato chips.<br /><br />12 cans may seem like a lot, but I find it is nice to have a good sized supply in the pantry.  They come in pop top cans that stay very fresh a long time.<br /><br />The price here on amazon is the best I have found!

review/text: I use to like this olive oil - I've been buying it from Costco for the last 10 years - and used to think it's great oil (I still buy it sometime, just because I cannot always find my other favorite ones) ,  until I tried another middle eastern variety(from Greece, especially Lebanon). Wow, what a difference. This Berio oil is like just a colored water, tasteless, odorless. It's basically a colored water as any italian olive oil, even the Bertolli brand which is more expensive. Italian olive oil are expensive,  but in my opinion they are much less in quality than their other middle eastern counterpart. If you like the real aroma and the strong taste of olive oil, you should try either a Greek or Lebanese. I doubt anybody will be able to try the Lebanese(the best) variety because it's so expensive and rare, and people over there keep it for themselves. But the Greek oil is much more available, affordable in price, and much better than any Italian one. Just google olive oil and you will see<br /><br />Everyone taste is different... .....

I did an online search which lead me to Amazon & the Mighty Leaf official site, which listed a variety of flavors.

The variety pack is an excellent choice for those who want a different flavor every day or for those who are undecided about the taste.  The price is quite reasonable for the tea.

review/text: I received a box of this tea as part of a Christmas gift and was excited to try it.  I really like it but find each bag is only good for one cup of fairly weak tea.  I like my tea to have a lot of flavor so this was a little disappointing for me.  I liked it enough that I bought more but find it to be fairly expensive because I often use more than one tea bag when one should be enough.

review/text: I have tried several Chai Tea mixes over the years, and even experimented with making Chai tea from scratch, so I was curious to try  Jaipur Avenue's Chai Tea. I must say that it is great, the best Chai Tea mix I have had so far! Easy to make, not too sweet and doesn't taste artificial. It comes in several interesting, rich flavors.  I initially ordered the variety pack and the vanilla flavor. I like them all, but Cardamon is my favorite. The design of the packaging is very nice, too, so it'll make a great stocking stuffer.

review/text: I typically do not find enough time to write a review about a product on Amazon but I thought Jaipur Avenue definitely deserved it. After moving to Seattle, I realized I didn't have a lot of options for instant chai powder - something I used to get fairly easily in Chicago. So I did some research online and ordered this variety option and have been loving it since.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect - products in nicely designed boxes tend to underwhelm, but this was a pleasant surprise. The saffron variety is delicious and while I haven't gone through the entire box yet, I'm looking forward to the rest. The box has become a fixture on my office desk - I drink it twice a day.<br /><br />Chai is one of the few things I will splurge on and Jaipur Avenue one of the fewer I don't feel guilty about.

review/summary: Best instant chai I've had
review/text: Making chai on the stovetop is a luxury I rarely have time for.  Sure, it's wonderful to meditatively stir the pot and smell the aroma of spices and simmering tea, but that's not going to happen when it's 2 in the afternoon and I'm stuck in front of my office computer.  Enter Jaipur Avenue.  No, it doesn't taste like chai made from scratch, but it's pretty close, and it's delicious.  The best part is that it has the flavor profile of the chai that you drink in India--the sweet, milky kind, not the super-spicy, hastily brewed "chai lattes" that you get at the local coffee shop.  Needless to say, I'm a fan!

It would be better served for the packages containing only one flavor were not individually wrapped in foiled plastic as the waste is not recyclable.

review/summary: Great, Convenient Chai
review/text: I bought the multi-pack for work since measuring and mixing Trader Joe's chai tea latte mix can be a hassle when I'm in a hurry.  These chai tea packets meet my needs perfectly.  They blend easily and quickly for a quick pick-me-up in the middle of the day.  I really enjoy the cardamom and masala flavors, but I dislike the saffron.  I think it's because I have not been able to transfer my love of savory saffron dishes to this sweet rendition.<br /><br />That said, there are one thing that would make this product even better: include all of the flavors Jaipur Avenue offers.  That way, I only have 3 packets of a flavor I dislike, and my curiosity about the vanilla and ginger flavors will be sated.  I will probably order them once I finish off this box, but I would like to have more confidence ordering them since I will have 15 packets of one flavor to contend with.

review/text: When someone first gave me one of these candies, I thought it was a joke because it tasted like soap.  But after they assured me it's real candy, I gave it a chance, and it grew on me.  The flavor is intense and complex, and it hangs around in your mouth long after you finish the candy.<br /><br />The texture is similar to Pez, that of a semi-hard compressed-powder candy.  The flavor is unlike anything and must be experienced to be understood.  I did find single packs of these candies available at a nearby World Market store.  I recommend trying one pack before buying a whole case--the flavor is really strong, so you'll either love these or hate them!

You won't be left feeling like you just swallowed toothpaste and your breath won't smell like fruit or whatever else most chewing gum companies think smells fresh and lovely.  No.  You will smell like violets and the flavor of these candies has that unique taste.  If you've ever tasted a violet (pesticide free/organic), you will adore these.  and you won't have to worry about your little ones gobbling them down.  These are not made for little children and adult taste buds will be delighted while younger children will find the taste peculiar.

review/text: Hirts ships the products fast and I received them in 3 days via usps (tiny envelope).  The product itself - theyre seeds.  Cant really say much more, only planted 3 of them in a tube that acts as a tiny terrarium, all 3 sprouted within 2 weeks and the root looks very strong.  High quality seeds I suppose.  TIP:  I am not very familiar with botany or trees for that matter, but when these seeds began germinating they gave me the notion that the seed was rotting. The Shell cracked all over (think drought stricken dirt) and had sticky hairlike strands all over one side.  This is actually normal for these seeds apparently as they are now reaching for the sky 3 weeks later. Overall - if you're looking for a new tree that's "exotic" and certainly different from the normal tree, this one takes the cake and its very easy to start from a seed. 5 stars

He is overweight and I have tried different things to knock off the weight. This is actually working. So it must be the no grain recipe. People need grain-Dogs don't. Acts like carbs in their system. I've also been feeding him the Natural Balance Alpha dry dog food.No grain in it either. He likes the taste even without mixing it with wet food. I may go straight dry food if this keeps up. So-I am happy with the dog food and with Amazon's prices. Also the shipping was free with a faster shipping time for some reason. Thanks Amazon.

review/text: Of my 3 dogs only the less finicky would eat it. The other two prefer chunks instead of ground. Smelled really good (slightly smoky). The best part of all was this was the ONLY wet food that produced PERFECTLY formed stools!

review/summary: Watch out - they offer 13 oz cans then send you 6 ounce cans!
review/text: I actually love the food.  My dog has bad allergies and this is one of the few foods she can eat.  I've ordered it before with no problem, but just received a shipment that should have contained 24 cans of 13 ounces each, but they only sent 24 cans of 6 ounces each.  That's less than half of the food I should have received.  There was no packing list in the box.  I'm now trying to get either a refund of half of my money or another shipment to make up the difference in what I've already paid for the 24 13-ounce cans.  Don't need the hassle!

review/text: This brownie mix creates dense, chewy, chocolatey, deliciously San Franciscan brownies. It is amazing. The Ghirardelli chocolate makes the difference. Also, the batter (before you bake it) is very very tasty. The best brownie batter I have ever eaten. All chocolate lovers must try these brownies once in their lives. You will never use another brownie mix again.

review/summary: Amora: ne plus ultra
review/text: Amora is to the French what Heinz ketchup is to Americans - a national institution and the preferred condiment of choice for everything from frites to you-name-it. I've enjoyed Amora mustard since I first tried it in Paris 30 years ago. I add it to everything: barbecue sauce, salad dressing (try a teaspoon of it in your Caesar dressing!), marinades, and by itself on lots of foods. Everyone I have ever shared it with raves about it, and now you can have it without having to go to France (or pay exorbitant shipping) to get it.<br /><br />Many years ago, it was available in specialty and gourmet food shops, but when the original family-owned company changed hands some years ago (they were bought out by Maille, I believe, which was then bought out by an American company), there was apparently a trademark issue that prevented them from importing it directly to the United States. Like other reviewers, I packed it home by the case when I visited France and begged friends to bring some for me when they could. A few years ago I began buying their small jars by the case (to save on shipping costs) from an outfit in NYC; recently, though, a local Northwest company began offering the larger jars, and now one can buy it on Amazon.<br /><br />Try a small jar if you're uncertain, or just plunge in and buy a big jar and enjoy it. And buy lots of little jars to give as gifts - any "foodie" you know will be grateful to have this! Yay, Amazon!

review/summary: Japan's healthier alternative to caffeinated energy drinks
review/text: This is a healthier alternative to those high-calorie, carbonated cans of caffeine that pass for energy drinks. I first tried Ukon Energy in Japan, where I spent roughly seven years living and working in both Yokohama and Tokyo. The drink is known as morning, hangover cure for Japanese businessmen. It is slightly sweet (but only 30 calories per serving) and earthy with no carbonation. This tastes better than Red Bull or the other energy drinks ubiquitous in the United States.<br /><br />The active ingredient in tumeric root is curcumin. Tumeric root is widely used in Asia, where it is prized as a detoxifier. Claims are that it provides health benefits for stomach irritation, heartburn, inhibiting the formation of gallstones (the body more easily digests fats) and ulcers. Tumeric root is also used to treat liver and skin conditions, including cirrhosis, jaundice, eczema, psoriasis and acne.<br /><br />Ukon Energy contains vitamins E and B, has only 30 calories per serving and is caffeine-free. Sold in a conveniently compact bottle, this herbal drink is especially popular among Japanese businessmen, who see it as the ideal beverage for their on-the-go lifestyle.<br /><br />BTW: House Foods previewed its turmeric-based Ukon Energy beverage at the 2010 Korean Music Festival in Hollywood last May. More than 120 million Ukon Energy bottles were sold in Japan in 2009.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003V37QHI">House Foods Ukon Energy Drink, 3.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />So taste-wise, its not amazing (I have weird tastes, though: I LOVE the taste of 5 Hour Energy), and you can definitely taste the turmeric in it. BUT, it's real use is not as an energy drink but as a hangover preventer. Take a bottle before you start drinking and your hangover will be much lessened. I've got a friend who swears by it, and it worked OK for me... but I suspect the only reason it didn't work better was because we split a bottle between like 4 people, and I drank a TON. I feel like even that small amount helped, though!

Actually, it has accustomed me to not eating rice.<br /><br />The package was intact.  The sell-by date was okay.  I had never bought this brand before and I never shall again.

review/summary: Good Pick-er-up
review/text: I have horrendous commutes (often 2 hours each way), and was finding that my energy level was dropping during the drive.  I needed something that had enough caffeine to just give me a kick, and since I don't like coffee and regular cola wasn't doing the job, I started looking for alternatives.  I ran into this as a single flavor in my local drugstore, and gave it a try.  I was reasonably impressed with it, but wanted to try other flavors if I could since I don't like to drink the same flavor all the time; a variety pack was attractive to me.  By putting a couple in an insulated bag in my car, it gave me one can for the morning (if I wanted it), and another for the drive home.  BE AWARE: because of some of the "natural" ingredients in this product, you may have some GI (stomach or intestinal) discomfort if you overdo it; I can only drink two cans a day for this reason (hence the 4 stars and not 5).  But for what I use it for, it has been very very helpful.  If you don't mind drinking the same thing/same flavor every day I'm sure you can find something local that will fit your needs (Monster, 5-hour energy, etc), but I have been very pleased with this product.

review/summary: Love Celsius. Not all Variety...
review/text: I do love this product.<br />I don't know about how much the calorie burner aspect has worked, but I do like the energy boost on a long day.<br />My issue is not with the product but the description of the variety pack. I did get 12 cans nicely packaged and arrived on time. However not all the flavors in the description are in the pack.<br /><br />Product Features<br />Two Cans Strawberry Kiwi, Iced Lemon Tea, Apple Orchard Blend and One Can Orange, Green Tea Raspberry Acai, Wild Berry, Green Tea Peach Mango, Ginger Ale, and Cola<br /><br />What I received<br />2 Iced Lemon Tea, 2 Orange, 2 Green Tea Acai, 2 Wild Berry, 2 Sparkling Orange, and 2 Cola.<br /><br />Basically to summarize I did not get; Strawberry Kiwi, Apple Orchard Blend, or Ginger Ale.<br />If the description said the flavors were random that would be fine. But with it being that specific I just expected what I paid for.<br />As I said I do like Celsius. And I'll order again. I was just hoping to try the different flavors.

review/text: I tried this product and must admit it is not for me...it does give me a surge of energy but it has a negative effect on my stomach and the crash for me is horrible after about 6 hours...I run and eat a low carb diet right now so maybe the combination is not right.  I purchased 12 cans and tried 4 of them...the remaining cans are still in the fridge as I can not take the feeling this product gives me...I hate to write negative reviews but felt compelled to share my experience

review/summary: Dear Hubby Loves These
review/text: Last week at my request he tried out Celsius in replace of his sugar filled energy drinks.  And to also see if he was able to drop a lil more weight while doing so.  His tummy filled out a bit this last year and he has fussed that he is not too comfortable about it.  I don't mind.  But he does and he is working his tush off.  Why not see if I can give him a lil help.<br /><br />You see Celsius is different.  Now with Celsius, you can burn double the calories and be energized. Celsius is the world's first and only negative calorie drink. Studies show that drinking a great tasting Celsius before exercise helps you burn up to 100 calories and more per serving, boosts metabolism, reduces body fat, increases endurance and provides lasting energy.<br /><br />So he agreed.  He had been weighing in regular already without any weight loss.  Day one he worked as usual with a weigh in before work and after work too.  He did drink his usual 2 energy drinks too.  Then for days 2, 3 and 4 he did the same weigh in and had 3 of the Celsius drinks.  They come in seven delicious flavors, carbonated and non-carbonated, and also in powder stick packets that can be mixed with water. Celsius contains no sugar, no high fructose corn syrup, no aspartame, no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors, and is low in sodium.  He said that he did not care for the Strawberry Kiwi too much.  But that the Sparkling Cola was close to Coke flavor than off brand sodas are.<br /><br />Also he said he could really feel the energy kick in that he was NOT getting from his previous energy drinks.  That even though he was sweating at work it seemed that it also increased.  He did make sure he had plenty of water to drink too!  At the end of the week he had lost 1.5 lbs.  Now I know that is not a lot.  But he had not lost any before with his heavy work load.  So that is a bit.  He he keeps it up he can easy drop 6 lbs in a month and that is a healthy weight loss.

review/summary: Garlic as a garnish, snack or for a cocktail accent
review/text: I used to have access to 'armstrong garlic' in a tangy pickling solution, but that company seems to have stopped making pickled garlic cloves.  In my search to replace the armstrong product I have found these little gems.  The brine mellows the garlic to a very pleasant taste, but they are not truly 'pickled'. Be warned: they are extremely salty.  Eating 6 or 7 of these will give you half your recommended sodium intake for a full day.  They are firm and crunchy out of the jar, and can add some zip to a condiment tray, or make a unique contribution to a dirty martini.

review/text: The unstoppable force of my animal magnetism has been unaffected by these Garlic Cloves. They taste fantastic, and are really easy to prepare in various dishes, but they utterly fail at curbing the ethereal magnetic force that emanates from my body. Drawing both bird and beast (and a fair number of women) this powerful and not fully explained force still prevails. I guess I may have to resort to wearing ropes of garlic cloves around my neck. At least they will also keep the vampires at bay...

review/summary: Great! My favorite flavor!
review/text: These are my favorite type of Jelly Bellies. I had been eyeing this product for some time. After a few glasses of wine, I decided that this was a must buy because its price per pound was much lower than a single pound of this flavor. The price is still pretty high, but it is about the same price as buying 5 single pounds. I have been snacking on these for a few months. They are still around, and I still love them.<br /><br />The product arrived in a cardboard box with the jelly beans directly in the box. No plastic bag or anything, just the shipping box filled with jelly beans. I am not a huge germaphobe, but would have preferred a better container than the shipping box. This was the only reason why I docked it a star.

review/summary: Look better than they taste
review/text: I bought these cookies at Cost Plus World Market when they were running a promotion.  The picture on the box is larger than life: these treats are only about an inch tall.  The stem is a light and crispy little biscuit barbell that reminds me of classic Pocky.  The cap is made of some cheap waxy chocolate, on par with a Hershey's kiss -- note that the packaging never claims this is actual chocolate, just "chocolaty," so it probably doesn't have the requisite amount of cocoa butter to call itself real chocolate.  The flavor doesn't have much depth or complexity, it's just sweet.  All the appeal is in the shape.  They're just so darn cute!  They make me want to decorate a cake to look like a forest glade and stick these mushrooms in it, and I'm not even into cake decorating.

review/summary: Delicious, beautiful, and more economic than it sounds.
review/text: I tried this tea in a Teavana store where samples were available.  Not only is the blossom beautiful and exotic, but the tea is delicious.  It's smooth, uniform, and though delicate the peach flavor was definitely at the forefront.  I don't know if the pot I tried had been sweetened or not, but I was floored.  It's easily the best tasting tea I've ever tried (though admittedly that isn't saying much; I'm not a frequent tea drinker).<br /><br />The economic part comes in with the multiple infusions.  This isn't a makes-one-pot product; you can refill the pot and brew again with the same blossom and get multiple pots out of each 'ball.'

review/text: I originally tried this tea in the Teavana store, and was surprised at the wonderful scent. I'm not usually one for peach teas, but this was so mellow and fragrant, I couldn't pass it up. I didn't even realize it was a blooming tea until the gal at Teavana explained it to me.<br /><br />Not only does this tea taste good and is good for you, but it's beautiful, and more affordable than you'd think. The blossom it creates when you brew it is very pretty, it's half of why I drink it. And, each blossom is good for 5-6 brews, which means the 2 ounces in a pack (about 8 blossoms) is about 50 cups of tea. I use 1 blossom in Teavana's Perfect Tea Maker (the 16 ounce size) and I can fill the tea maker full 5-7 times before I consider the flavor and scent to be pretty diminished. For an artisan tea, that's an excellent value.

review/summary: An amazing tea
review/text: This was my first experience with blooming tea, and it made me into an enthusiastic believer!  My boyfriend had wanted me to look for chrysanthemum tea, without caffeine, at the new Teavana store at one of the local malls, and this was the tea I was told had the most chrysanthemum in it.  It looks absolutely beautiful when it blooms underwater, it smells wonderful, and it has a wonderful peach and jasmine flavor.  Unlike traditional teabags, teaballs can be used for at least three brewings, and one ball is even enough to brew an entire pot of tea.  This particular blooming tea might be on the pricy side for just two ounces, but in the long run it saves more money than getting a lot of teabags that might be cheaper but which can only be used for one cup of tea and still retain much flavor.  This tea still packs its full flavor after the first use and after the first day!  This was also my first time experiencing white tea, which, as it turns out, is lowest in caffeine of any of the other types of tea and is the highest in antioxidants.  And the fancy teaballs just make one want to brew this tea, since the presentation is so much prettier and more elegant-looking than a regular teabag, which one just throws in a cup of hot water.  It also helps that in Chinese culture, the chrysanthemum is believed to have the power to help a drinker to live to one hundred!

We don't have a glass tea kettle, but they had some blooming teas in one at a Teavana store, we visited and it is pretty! The other poster is correct about multiple uses too. We use each ball about 6 times (in a cup of tea, not a whole pot). I've found all of the Teavana tea yield multiple uses (generally at least 5 or 6).<br /><br />These teas are so yummy. We don't add any sweetener. They are just perfect as they are!

review/summary: The best spice mix available
review/text: As I said in one of my previous reviews, my local Kroger store frequently stops selling certain products. This is a distribution problem -- or rather, the problem is with their Roanoke distribution center that frequently pisses off customers by discontinuing products based on "shelf space needs." In the past, I used to complain and fight (I still do about things that are not mailable), but now I just go to amazon.com and order my products online. This is exactly what happened with my Drogheria & Alimentari Tuscan Herb spice grinder. This is my FAVORITE spice -- or spice bouquet -- and the best I've used in many, many years. I recommend it highly. I am NOT a good cook, and the Tuscan Herbs makes what I cook taste 100% better. I highly recommend this product. Thank goodness amazon.com sells this, and I don't have to fight with Kroger about it, or worse, do without it.

review/summary: I use this on virtually everything I cook
review/text: Ok, so I first bought this to use as a bread dipper but quickly discovered it was way better as a cooking spice. Simply put, this spice is good on EVERYTHING. I've recently been cooking a citrus herb trout:<br /><br />- start with a dressed trout, or two trout filets. Spray or coat each side with olive oil and liberally coat with salt, pepper, and Tuscan spice mix. Stick a sprig of thyme and rosemary on the fleshy side of one filet along with several lemon slices. Either fold the other filet on top (if a dressed trout) or place the other filet on top. I usually coat the top at this point separately and add thyme leaves as well. Bake at 350F for 15 mins or until skin starts to brown.<br /><br />I also use this on steak:<br />-season one side liberally with garlic salt, ground pepper, and Tuscan herb mix. Place this side against a hot grill. Season the other side in a similar fashion, then wait 4 mins (grill time will vary with grill). After 4 mins, give the steak a quarter turn for good grill marks. Wait 3 mins then flip. Once flipped, paint Dijon mustard on the upside (use the backside of a spoon to spread it if you don't have a brush, I like to use a horseradish mustard). Sprinkle more ground pepper and liberally add Tuscan mix.  Wait 3 mins, then give a quarter turn. Wait another 3 minutes then pull off the grill.<br /><br />There you have it- my two best recipes with this spice. But again, I use this on everything: Parmesan Brussels sprouts, goat cheese saut&eacute;ed mushrooms...

And they are all organic and all made in Italy where blending herbs is a true, true art form. I've traveled to Italy on several lengthy occasions and often remarked, "You just can't get bad food in Italy!"<br /><br />I have used this blend in a white clam sauce mixed with pasta shells and used it in the best spaghetti sauce I've ever  made! I even ran the grinder over a take-out pizza from our local pizza place with very tasty results! The pizza came alive with flavor!<br /><br />Pick a couple other of the D & A selections (PROVENCE and FOUR SEASONS PEPPER CORNS are recomended!) and get free shipping. The expiration dates are over two years away on everything I ordered and I couldn't be more pleased with the quality! EXCELLENT organic herbs that will add that extra something to your cooking. Everyone will notice.....you are a gourmet cook! And you will be hooked to the ease of use and the perfect, perfect blends! AWESOME purchase and cannot do without now!

review/summary: mailing disaster
review/text: Disappointed in the receipt of this product. This box was damaged and was leaking from several cans of the product. This was the worst I have ever received a product over the 10 plus years I have been ordering on line. I lost 3 cans of monster because of the damage and will never order this product through the mail again. The product is heavy so sending it back was more expensive then just keeping the damaged product.Only had a picture (no video) of damaged product or I would have sent a picture of damaged product.

review/summary: Great Drink, Price, and Free Shippping!
review/text: This was a win win win combo.  I don't like many of the Monster flavors because too many have an aftertaste.  This is the best one on the market and Amazon did an awesome job and I liked the fact it was free shipping which made the product rock.  Too many others charge about the same price for the product as the shipping, that is far from a deal.  Thanks again for the awesome deal!

review/summary: Great purchase
review/text: So I found one can of this at Target a couple of months ago and never saw it since. They cherry flavouring makes a change from the usual Monster taste you get in Monster Green and Monster Blue. Initially the taste can be a little odd as you expect one thing but get another but if you mixed Cherry Coke and Monster together, you'd have an idea of what Monster Assualt tastes like.<br /><br />Having the 24 cans delivered made things a lot easier that getting them from the supermarket too due to the weight associated with that many.

review/summary: Good mix of Flavors!
review/text: I like this product better than the Nature's Path instant oatmeal.  The apples and Cinn. have more apples and bigger chunks of them than Nature's Path.  Also includes Maple and Brn Sugar which I love.  I think you will love it too!

review/summary: We mix it withKibble
review/text: Our little chihuahuas are picky eaters. I really don't find canned foods helpful, since they won't eat any that has been put in the refrigerator overnight. These are perfect because we can split a single package and mix it in with the kibble. Even better, when we travel, these are easy to open and carry.<br /><br />They do like some of the other pouches better than this one, so I have only given it four stars.

review/summary: My dogs love Pedigree ground dog food in pouches.
review/text: They don't care for canned food, even the same kind as in the pouch.  How can they tell the difference.  Anyhow we were happy to find this offer because it seems that the pouches are harder to find.  Please keep these in stock!!!
