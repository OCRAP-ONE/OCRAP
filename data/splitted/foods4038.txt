review/summary: Hooked on honey nut
review/text: I absolutely love this peanut butter.  Could not find it in stores close to me, so my daughter, who lives in Kenosha, WI would ship it to me (4 jars at a time).  Then I found it through the internet so she doesn't have to run all over.  I honestly think I could almost live on it (I eat it right out of the jar with a spoon).  Don't stop making it, please.

The only thing I didn't care for was that the end date on a whole case of peanut butter was August 5, 2009.  I don't have much time to use a LOT of peanut butter.

review/text: This has a taste that is similar to green tea, but is a bit less bitter.  Caffeine content seems comparable to a green tea for me, but because it is less bitter than some other teas I often use two teabags at a time.  This has become a favorite for me in the morning because the bite isn't too jarring.  Goes well with honey, milk or cream seems less important than with a more bitter black or green tea.

review/text: Our lab was going through rawhids way too fast (and we knew they weren't the best thing for him either).  A small store recommended elk or moose antlers (said dogs didn't like the deer antlers as much).  They said the antlers were healthier and would last longer.  I accidently bought deer antlers and our dog loved them!  They lasted weeks vs. minutes so it was well worth the price difference.  Just something to note if you have carpets, we noticed something inside the bone kinda smells like fish. The smell in the elk antlers seems to be much less.  We haven't tried the moose yet.

review/text: This product is basically real Larvets (bug like things) with a BBQ season baked into them. Each box comes with about 30 of the Larvets and to be completely honest, they arent that bad tasting! When tasting the Larvets you automatically try to savor the BBQ flavor mixed into the semi hollow and slightly chewy body to find that there isn't any BBQ taste, just bland chewiness. They're not horrible but they aren't amazing.

review/summary: Tasty Critters
review/text: A lot like BBQ flavoured puffed rice.  In the wake of the toxic U.S. food supply, several of my coworkers and I have been trying out alternative food sources from outside of the corporate-industrial-agribusiness complex.  Insects provide lean calories packed with protein.  While these particular critters are more of a snack than a meal, they have that satisfying crunch that many of us turn to potato/corn chips for, while at the same time are light and airy. A viable, healthier, alternative to conventional munchies!  However, don't expect to get that "full" feeling.  If you can get past the "thought" of eating insects these are very good.

At first, I was doubtful a little bar could do that, but these bars succeed.  Every time I unwrap a bar and take that first bite, my thought is, "These are GOOD FOR ME???".<br /><br />I recommend trying these if you are diabetic, borderline diabetic, or just want something healthy and tasty to snack on.

review/text: I hadn't used a balsamic glaze before, so I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. I tried this on some pork chops and it was very nice. I think the key is to not put too much on, or it could overwhelm the meat. WHen I get daring, I'm going to try some on some vanilla ice cream - I'm told it tastes good. I need to find some other types of meat to try it on - maybe chicken.<br /><br />10/8/2012 update - I have since used the glaze on chicken, and it was very good. My wife wasn't as much of a fan as I was, but she did say it was OK. Balsamic vinegar has a very strong taste, so even with a glaze, I think the key is that less is better. It is easy to overwhelm the item you are putting the glaze on.

One local grocery store has the smaller bags, one.  And if they sell out, I am left scrounging for knockoffs which are nothing like the Brach's brand.<br /><br />Please, Brach's, do not discontinue.

review/text: These are wonderful "desk" candies...everyone who stops by takes at least one. Spicy but not too hot. The problem is finding them. As another reviewer stated, I used to find them at Wal Mart but haven't in a while. I just WILL NOT pay $16.50 plus shipping for 2# of candy as listed by one seller here on Amazon. Yes, they are good, but whoa...I MIGHT pay $8/pound for some good fudge or really fine chocolates, but not for a plain hard candy like this.

review/summary: Best decaf hot tea I have tasted!
review/text: I buy this in the UK but it is wonderful to know I can get it here if supplies run low between trips! I recommend steeping the bag for several minutes, then adding milk and sugar to taste. It has been a lifesaver during cold and flu season. I prefer it to PG Tips, which I find to be quite bitter. Typhoo has a much smoother taste.

So either this was a bad "batch" or the quality control is slipping.<br /><br />Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: I've tried them all, this is the best
review/text: I gave up caffeine ten years ago. I spent months and months trying to find a decaf black tea that actually had flavor or didn't taste like seaweed. (Seriously. Lipton decaf tastes fishy.) I finally found a few brands that were fantastic. Decaf PG Tips is solid. But decaf Typhoo is, by far, the best decaf tea I'ver ever tasted. In fact, it's the only decaf brand I will purchase.<br /><br />If you've been disappointed with decaf teas, give Typhoo a try. You'll be shocked at its strong, full-bodied flavor.<br /><br />Having said that, these days, to save cash, I usually make my own decaf tea. Turns out something like 90% of the caffeine in a regular tea bag is released in the first 30 seconds of brewing time. So, if I want a cup of tea late at night I heat enough water for two cups, brew the bag for 30 seconds in the first cup then toss that stuff and drop the now-decaffeinated bag in the fresh hot water.<br /><br />But I always keep some decaf Typhoo on hand when I don't have the patience to make my own decaf tea.

review/summary: An outstanding decaf tea
review/text: I have to drink decaf tea in the evenings and before I found this Typhoo I always had to trade off decent tasting tea for being able to sleep at night. But Typhoo decaf makes a very robust and flavorful pot of tea. On more than one occasion, somebody in the family has grabbed this decaf by mistake and nobody even realized it was decaf until we noticed the distinctive round bag in the bottom of the pot. This tea is best brewed by the pot using fully boiling water. If you try to make it by the individual cup using 190 degree water or water heated in a microwave, you'll probably be disappointed. Besides compromising the flavor, brewing by the cup would be wasteful since a single bag makes a good three cups of tea. The only compromise needed when brewing this decaf over regular black tea is the decaf needs to steep a bit longer (I'd say ten minutes) for maximum flavor. Alternatively, you can limit the water to two cups and then it's ready in about six minutes. Typhoo also makes regular caffeinated black tea which I consider to be just average.

review/text: In my hunt for good strong decaf, I've tried many. This is the best, alongside Tetley. I actually drink a 14 ounce cup in the morning using one bag of Tetley decaf and one bag of Ty-phoo. One would be hard pressed to guess it was full decaf. I'm throwing out my PG Tips. After forty-or-so cups, I've given it a good trial, but it's just too "green" for me. Sticking with this one...just placed another order. Ty-phoo is strong, with no weird designer tea flavors added, and no off-tastes. As close to the caffeinated tea you really want to drink as you will get.

review/summary: Good body, Made for Milk
review/text: (I'm in Arkansas, not Argentina)<br />Typhoo tea is a traditionally British blend and the Decaf version won't dissapoint you. Assam tea is a large part of the blend which adds the "maltiness" and mouth feel that drinkers of Irish and Scottish Breakfast teas enjoy. I never drink this type of tea without milk and it was blended to be enjoyed that way. These are larger teabags than you'll find with Twinings or Bigalow brands of "breakfast" tea. I've been a tea lover for 35 years and spent many years in the UK drinking all kinds of teas, my daily black tea is Typhoo Decaf because :<br />- a water based meathod decaffeinates the tea, no chemicals are ever used<br />- Typhoo has a full flavor of malty Assam lightened with Ceylon (compared to PG Tips which is lighter on Assam, less malty)<br />- the round teabags are designed to filter the maximume flavor from the tea<br />- 1 teabag makes a heafty 12oz mug or slightly lighter 14oz pot of tea<br />- it's a great cuppa any time of day because there's minimal caffeine (average caffeine in Decaf teas is barely 5mg)<br />- if I over-steep this tea it doesn't get bitter<br /><br />Check prices around the web and you'll find that Amazon offers the best deal, especially when there's Free Shipping !<br /><br />Typhoo Decaf gets you through the day and makes a relaxing cup before bed. It's the kind of tea you'd be served with rich biscuits and teacakes throughout the UK. if you like a heafty cup of tea with milk this Decaf will take care of you.<br /><br />NOTE : I always check the expiration dates on the boxes when they arrive to be sure a seller hasn't sold me outdated tea. This has only happened once and the seller is no longer on Amazon.

review/summary: Everyday caffeine addict
review/text: So, basically my morning routine is, wake up, go to work, buy an orange flavor Rockstar, and work; 5 times per week.<br /><br />I spend exactly 2.50 per can of Rockstar. The caffeine i get from it is mentally required for me, i can't function as well without having one.<br /><br />I saw these bottles at Ralphs for about $3.something. I bought this black cherry flavor, which packs 60mg of caffeine per 1/2 tbsp. Yikes! :)<br /><br />So, my routine now is, wake up, go to work, add some flavor to my water, and get to work.<br /><br />Assuming i drink 5 Rockstar's per week: $12.50<br /><br />The MIO black cherry container says it makes 18 8fl oz mixes but it depends on how many squirts you put. The regular water bottles are 16.9 fl oz. I think i can get at least 10 water bottles out of each little MIO.<br /><br />So, (10 approx. bottles * $0.25 approx cost of bottled water) + ($4 MIO) / (5 work days) =  around $6 dollars.<br /><br />If i want to save money, and reduce my overall costs of $13+ per week for energy drinks, I have to count on something with the same amount of kick (caffeine).<br /><br />This stuff has to work for me, and it has, so i recommend it.<br /><br />At least now i will be drinking water + enhancer.

For some reason, I like them better over crushed ice rather than straight out of the can... Seems that these sodas taste even better if they can breathe a bit (or maybe I'm just crazy!).

review/summary: This flavor was not for me...
review/text: Sprout's was having a sale on Zevia 6 packs (I got them for $4.50 a six pack, but they were usually $5.59), so i bought cola, rootbeer, orange, twist, Dr. Zevia, and black cherry flavors. I did not buy the ginger ale as i was never really a fan of any ginger ale.<br /><br />As far as Dr. zevia goes, I is by far the most intense flavor, in my opinion. Too strong for me. Very very cherry...it almost tasted like cough syrup without the consistency. I ignored someone's warnings on this flavor, and now i regret wasting 5 bucks on the six pack. Im a really big diet dr. pepper fan, and Dr. zevia just didnt cut it for me. :/<br /><br />As far as the other flavors go:<br />The orange one seemed a little too light in flavor. (I rate it 4/5)<br />Black cherry was perfect for me! (5/5) Nice flavor and carbonation.<br />Cola (5/5) and rootbeer (5/5)were good too. Cola almost tasted like Diet Rite with slightly less carbonation. Rootbeer is hard to compare to anything.<br />The lemon lime twist one was interesting. As a sierra mist gal, i had high hopes. Unfortunately, i would give it a 3/5. It just had a funny taste to it. Hard to compare it to anything really.<br /><br />This is just my two cents on the flavors.<br />I refridgerated them, so i drank them ice cold. I can't comment on the flavors when they are luke-warm.

review/summary: YES
review/text: A long time ago I tried Zevia's Orange soda and was really disappointed.  Eventually I tried the lemon/lime flavor, which I found similarly underwhelming, but the Cola flavor was actually not bad, although not great.  I do actually quite like their Root Beer flavor though, and have been buying it for awhile now.  So just recently I finally decided to give Dr Zevia a try, after seeing it on the shelves and not expecting it to be that good (I think maybe because I associated the red packaging with the color of Jones Soda's diet cherry flavor, which I tried once and did not like at all, and which usually sits nearby at the store).  So anyway, WOW.  Root Beer is now my second favorite Zevia flavor.  When I indulge in regular sugar-sweetened soft drinks, I prefer Root Beer over Dr. Pepper.  But I now feel that Dr. Zevia is their best offering, and tastes more like the real thing and less like a "diet drink" than any of their other sodas.  I've been getting two six packs of their Root Beer at a time, but from now on I think I'll be buying at least one of Dr. Zevia instead.  I'm very impressed with this drink!

We probably would have had the sweetener Stevia years ago if our domestic producers of artificial sweeteners hadn't interfered. It has been used in Japan for over thirty years.

The tea is lightly spicy and a bit sweet (no added sweetener needed, like other teas I also enjoy).  I also like that I can get about a cup & a half of tea out of one tea-bag (re-filling my cup after drinking the first half cup).  Tea bags are individually bagged so they are easy to take-along, too.

It was so good, when my husband deployed, he asked me to send him some.  I went back to Whole Foods and could not find it.  I explained to them that it was not even in the system when I got it the first time and they said that it meant that they must have received it by accident then and that it is not a normal product for them to receive.  I started the hunt all over the city of Colorado Springs and it can not be found anywhere.  I was so happy to find it online and stocked up.  I received it in a timely manner and bubble wrapped individually so I was able to move it from one box to another.

If they like it, I'm happy too. My only complaint is that the price has roughly doubled from the time of my first order. Other items fluctuate somewhat, but an almost 100% increase makes this stuff no deal anymore. If you can find it elsewhere, or if the price goes back down, jump on it. Your dogs will, too.

NOW, this is her choice for a quick breakfast.<br /><br />Now that I know the family likes this, I won't hesitate buying it by the case from Amazon rather than paying the higher prices for an individual box at the grocery store.

review/text: I generally like cereal with a little less sugar.  I can add my own sweetener if I want it.  Otherwise, it is a good flake type cereal with a good quantity of fiber.  It is a little low on protein compared to some cereal, but people generally add some protein by using milk.  You can add your choice of fruit (I usually like a combination of sliced banana and strawberries, and sometimes add blueberries).

review/summary: It ain't your old-fashioned cardboard!
review/text: Fiber One Honey Clusters accomplishes something most other fiber-laden foods don't: It has flavour!<br /><br />I was originally turned on to this cereal by a nutritional website's ranking of top cereals.  Compared to other "ultra-healthy" cereals like the original Fiber One it may not be the healthiest but it's a nice compromise to get a little sweetness out of your "grown-up" food while still providing some very worthwhile health & nutritional benefits.<br /><br />I don't know that any kids are going to be begging their parents for this because it obviously doesn't have all the sweetness of super-sugary cereals, but it also doesn't taste like cardboard and for those of us grown-ups who still have a bit of a sweet tooth, it fills the bill.  (If you want to add a bit of extra flavour, try it with Vanilla Silk soy milk.)<br /><br />Also, if you're the type of person for whom a single bowl of cereal doesn't cut it hunger-wise, this may have you singing a different tune in your morning shower.  Foods high in fiber give you a greater sense of being full so naturally this cereal should be able to keep you satisfied until your next meal.<br /><br />One word of caution though: For those of you who have not consumed high-fiber foods or taken Metamucil as a supplement before, start small and work your way up.  It's not uncommon to experience some uncomfortable digestive consequences if you try to take in too much fiber all at once without giving your body time to adjust.  In the long-term, though, fiber is obvisouly a fantastic way to keep your digestion in tip-top shape.<br /><br />Since Amazon only sells cereal in bulk, I always recommend taste-testing a single box at your local grocery.  But once you know you like it, the Subscribe & Save program may just save you money AND deliver your groceries to your door!

review/summary: Too much sugar, not enough fiber
review/text: To be fair to those who must have pre-packaged sweetness in their breakfast cereal I've given this three stars. For readers like myself I'd give only one star. Reviewing this cereal on its own merits, it's OK: it tastes good and contains moderate amounts of fiber and sugar.<br /><br />The problem that I have with this particular Fiber One product (and to an even greater degree with the caramel and raisin-cluster versions) is that it scarcely resembles in any way its namesake, original Fiber One. When my local grocery ran out of the original Fiber One, I picked up this Honey Clusters version, thinking that with 51% of one's daily fiber requirement, it would be a decent substitute for the original, which provides 57% of the daily requirement. I should have read the label more closely: the serving size on which the 51% is based is twice that for the 57% provided by the original Fiber One; in other words, one has to consume more than twice as much in volume to get the same amount of fiber. In so doing, one will also consume almost three times as many calories due to the fact that sugar is present in several forms, including honey and high-fructose corn syrup. Original Fiber One uses aspartame rather than sugar. I really don't think that General Mills should squander the good name of Fiber One on this product.<br /><br />It is also most disingenuous to plaster "low fat" across the front of the package. Of course it is low-fat! Why would a product consisting of mostly grain and sugar contain much fat (other than a small amount for leavening and to help it hold together)?!! What General Mills is trying to imply is that this cereal is not fattening, hardly the case since it contains so many calories. The calories come mostly from sugar, and it could have been worse, though; some of the sweetness is from sucralose, which, contrary to the assertion of one reviewer, has not been proved to be "poison" by any reputable scientific study.<br /><br />Amazon considers all Fiber One cereals to be part of a "product set" and does not allow separate reviews; this is particularly unfortunate in that almost the only thing this product has in common with original Fiber One is the name and its ownership by General Mills. So I will elaborate a little on the original product, which is what any health-conscious person should buy instead. The original Fiber One is tasty, low-calorie, and the most pleasant way I know of to get more than half one's daily requirement of fiber. Some people won't like the form and texture of original Fiber One, however; if General Mills made a Fiber One in flake format that had the same taste and nutritional value of original Fiber One, they would have a virtually perfect product.
