review/summary: Great artisan bread
review/text: I have a bread maker, but I only used it to proof the bread.  I baked the loaf in a hot oven (425) after I had turned the dough out on foil covering a cookie sheet.  The crust was outstanding.  The bread was gone in under 3 hours.  I guess that makes it a dangerous product- since it's so good you might eat more bread than you meant to.  I'll be serving this to my guests next time we have friends over for dinner.  The herbs taste really fresh for a box mixed- and of course it's so easy.  All you have to do is add water.

review/summary: Makes Great Rolls
review/text: I can not say enough about Kruteaz Italian Herb Bread Mix. I have yet to actually make bread out of it yet though. I<br />always throw it into the bread machine with the dough only cycle. Once done I take it out and make rolls out of it and<br />bake them in the oven. You will not believe the taste !! Definitely the best rolls I have ever tasted. They don't list<br />what herbs that are in the mix, but I can taste a hint of basil in there. Try it, you'll love it. and yes, one day I'll<br />get around to actually making bread with it !

review/summary: Super easy bread machine mix - beginner friendly
review/text: Krusteaz is my new bff.  This mix couldn't be easier to make unless I had someone else to throw the stuff into the bread machine for me.  Oh wait - I do have someone!  I love having kids.<br /><br />What I meant to say is that it was too much trouble to find the book for my bread machine, which I hadn't used in over 3 years, so I had to actually help my son with his first time on the bread machine.  Since I couldn't remember the actual instructions I figured we'd just push whatever buttons looked obvious and hope for the best.  I seem to remember something about making a well in the flour for the yeast & water, but that might be for making noodles or pie crust, or something that I watched Rachel Ray make but I never got around to trying.<br /><br />So, I just dumped the mix into the machine followed by the yeast while my son waited at the faucet for warm water and then added the appropriate amount.  Then we just pushed the start button hoped that the defaults on the machine would work for this type of bread, and that the mix wasn't too picky about the order that the ingredients were added.<br /><br />As the machine began its task my son asked how the dough gets mixed.  I was telling him about the paddle at the bottom when he says, "What paddle?  There's no paddle in there."  So I stopped the machine while he finds the paddle, then I squish around the now gooey ingredients until I get the paddle attached, hopefully without too much bread goo in the connection, scrape scum off my fingers and wipe it on the side of the bread cooking pan, then hit the default bread cycle button again.<br /><br />Naturally all of the yeast was right in the middle where I was working, so I know that we have less than the full amount of that.  Now I'm hoping that the mix isn't picky about getting the measurements exactly right either, because everything is now shoved in various directions and I was lucky just to get most of the goo off my fingers and back into the mix.  I'm starting to think it might have been worthwhile to have found the book for the machine so that at least some of this might be done correctly.  Nah, I would never have gotten around to making anything if I'd spent the time needed to find the book and then read it.  Not to mention that if it's edible after all of this I'll actually do it again.<br /><br />Three hours later we had a slightly misshapen, but yummy loaf of bread.  It was crusty on the outside, soft and with good texture on the inside.  It made the whole house smell good while it was baking, and the taste was as good as the smell promised.  The herbs were mild and they didn't create any little lumps in the bread, which is great if you've got picky eaters.  If you want something stronger, McCormick or Spice Islands Italian Herb Seasoning would be a compatible flavor to add, although I suspect you'd need to add a smidgen of extra water when you add dried herbs.  It's probably one of those things they tell you about in the book that came with the bread machine.  I really should look for that.<br /><br />Finally, you can't beat a mix that only requires water - you never have to worry about whether or not you have any other ingredients on hand because it's all in the mix.  A couple of boxes of bread mix in the pantry and I no longer have to make an extra run to the store for bread.  When I grab the last box I just hit the button on Amazon and more shows up at my door in two days.  (I love Amazon Prime!)<br /><br />If you have small children, work long hours, live out in the sticks, or you've just got better things to do, having yummy bread available without yet another trip to the store will make you happy.  It does take time to bake, so you can't just want bread and eat bread in less than an hour, but since I live nowhere near a store we're kinda out of luck if I don't notice we need bread until the last minute anyway.  And did I mention how good this stuff tastes?!<br /><br />Based on my experience, I would highly recommend this bread for first timers as well as all you competent people.  It obviously can handle minor mistakes in measurements and didn't seem to mind that the order of ingredients was haphazard and partially missing.  I can make this even while I'm sleep deprived, chaos surrounds me, and children compete for my attention. Woo-hoo!  I love when I can look competent with less effort, it totally fakes the neighbors out.

review/text: We grew up eating these wonderful noodles (with just chicken broth and soysauce) as a quick meal, all during my childhood here in the Midwest.  But then they became very hard to find.  Then impossible to find.  I was thrilled to see them available on Amazon and I order regularly.<br /><br />Cook noodles in plenty of water until just tender.  Do not over cook.  Rinse well. Heat chicken broth - add noodles and serve with chopped scallions and soy sauce.  YUM.

review/summary: This stuff stinks!
review/text: This stuff stinks but your dog will love it!  If your dog is a fussy eater (mine are not), or if they're feeling under the weather, supplement this or any of the tripett blends, and you will be surprised how well your dog responds. I read about the benefits of green tripe when one of my dogs became very ill and could not handle dry dog food anymore.  I switched both dogs to a raw diet and tripett, and presto, a remarkable rebound in their health and appearance.  I was feeding a very high grade dry food at the time, so I did not go from junk food to high quality. It is just that dogs need to eat whole, raw foods not cooked processed meal. It's the carbs in dog food that create most of the skin and health issues not grains.  Carbs turn to sugar and then to yeast.  It is the yeast that causes ear infections and bad skin and coat. I don't work for Tripett, just a good customer.

review/summary: Tasty dashi
review/text: I used this product, along with kelp, to make dashi. Basically, the recipe is to bring water to a boil with the kelp ( a 4 or 5 inch long piece), then add the bonito flakes (sprinkle the surface of the water, as if you were feeding fish), stir, and let the water cool down. Strain and you have dashi!<br /> A lot of people use instant dashi but I think the taste of freshly made dashi is incomparable. Good for making miso soup (add in some miso and maybe a little bit of tofu).<br /> Dashi is a basic ingredient in Japanese cooking. It's as common as chicken broth in recipes!<br /> This product (Nishimoto brand) was flavorful. I would buy it again and probably will.

The trick is that it's a dip, so you have to dip something into it. You won't enjoy it if you stick a spoonful of it in your mouth, but mixed with fruit or other flavors, it adds a pleasant chocolatey taste. Most people I've given it to have enjoyed it and a few have hated it; it may be one of those things like grapefruit that you're either genetically able to tolerate or not.

review/text: I've tried several Walden Farm items and found all to be fairly pleasant, even my husband who tends to be more finicky about food likes most of it.  I must say though that the pricing here is a little high.  I buy it in stores for usually around $3.49 to $3.89 a bottle/jar so this is way too high.  Using any of these items for helping control your calories, fat and carbs is a good alternative and most are fairly tasty.  Once you get use to the taste it's really pretty good.

review/summary: Good Tasting Dip - Recommended
review/text: The Walden Farms Chocolate Dip was a good find for me, but perhaps calling this "Chocolate" was a mistake since it only slightly resembles chocolate by looks and taste. It should be treated as a dessert dip/topping for dieters or diabetics. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking for low carb sweets that will not impact my blood sugar levels and this Dip/Topping has no impact at all.<br /><br />I like the flavor and use it to augment fruits and other sugar free foods to round out the dish. This works well with strawberries and with peanut butter.<br /><br />Recommended, if you set your expectations to match the reality that this is not really chocolate.

review/text: I must be dreaming!!  This dip, along with the Chocolate Syrup, is saving me from wanting to cheat on a weight loss program I started a month ago!  A few tablespoons a day of this stuff (or swigs of the syrup), and I'm good to go.  I admit, it has a bit of an after taste, but it doesn't take away from the initial chocolate burst at all.  The dip is a lot like pudding, especially after being in the fridge for a while--it gets really thick and cold.  I absolutely LOVE this stuff!  HIGHLY recommended (but don't bother with the salad dressings--uh uh...)...

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I really wanted to like this stuff but it tastes really bad. When I opened the jar and smelled it I thought I'd hit the low cal jackpot, it smells very chocolatey. However it tastes strange, king of like sour cocoa with a horrid chemical aftertaste. Ever use hairspray and get a mouthful of the residual fog by accident or get shampoo in your mouth? Imagine that that happened right after you took a swig of rancid cocoa and that's what this stuff tastes like. Sad thing is I bought this and several other WF products after reading a bunch of feel good reviews on the net. Seriously it tastes bad and I'm an avid consumer of low cal foods most people abhor, like Promise. Sheesh I ate it twenty minutes ago and my mouth still tastes like a mini Exon Valdez spilled in my mouth. Blech.

review/text: I love the WF products. I started my weight loss program mid January & 4 months later I am down 34 pounds with the help of these great products. One trick I have learned because I missed my daily lattes is to put a spoon full of chocolate or caramel (hmmm maybe both) in my coffee & I have a delicious latte with no additional calories! I also make a fantastic carb free lasagna with the alfredo sauce. Gotta get creative! Enjoy!

review/text: My wife has been doing great on her diet (sorry, "new lifestyle"), but after 4 months of no chocolate, she started missing it. This was on her list of approved foods, so I got this for her. She said "it's OK", but she hasn't really been eating it. So I asked her why, and she said "It doesn't taste great. Not really chocolate at all."<br /><br />So there you have it. It does no damage to her diet, but it also doesn't satisfy the chocolate urge. Too bad.

review/text: This tastes kind of like chocolate... except for the aftertaste. I've never tasted hairspray, but I suspect that's what the aftertaste of this tastes like. In all seriousness, this is not very good. I finally pitched it the other day after it sat in my fridge uneaten for an unreasonable amount of time. The aftertaste was unbearable for me. But if you're on an extreme diet, it's probably better than complete chocolate deprivation.

review/summary: Won't Fool Someone Looking For Real Chocolate, But Definitely Kills A Craving
review/text: I had been very hesitant to try this product because of the "no calorie" claim, and some bad reviews that I've read but, I decided to give it a chance. I tried it with strawberries and lo and behold it is pretty darn good. I definitely wouldn't advise eating it on it's own, it's not like chocolate in the sense that it can hold it's own but it gives a nice illusion of chocolate when paired with other things. I look forward to seeing what else it is good with, but for anyone on a diet I would highly recommend it. This has become one of my diet food staples.

review/summary: Disgusting!
review/text: I don't know how anyone can like ANY of the Walden Farms products.  Last year when I was doing Atkins for the first and last time, I found some Walden Farms products at my local grocer.  I bought the chocolate dip, honey mustard dressing, pancake syrup and barbecue sauce. All of them were so gross! On the label of all of their products it says, zero carbs zero calories, zero fat. How is that possible? These items are no more than LOTS of thickening agents like, xanthan gum, guar gum, and acacia gum and flavorings. The thing I didn't like about them was that they tasted fake, and they had the consistency of snot. Seriously. I was not that desperate so I threw them all away. If you are looking for a low carb version of jams and syrups, try Nature's Hollow. They make the same thing with Xylitol and it tastes a LOT better than that nasty Splenda.

review/text: I discovered this product over the summer at my favorite whole food store. I cannot get enough of it! Having particular dietary tastes and needs, to find a product this rich and tasty is incredible! That it has no discernible fat or sugar is even more wonderful! For those who don't care for it straight up--to each his/her own! It's the only way I eat it (since I can't consume ice creams, etc.). I put it in the 'fridge, let it get ICY cold and then eat it from the jar. For me, it is delicious! I also love the Marshmellow Dip. The Caramel Dip is OK, but only in a pinch (like when the whole foods store runs out of Chocolate Dip or Marshmellow Dip). I've not tried the various fruit dips. The problem I am having now is that the supplier has not been able to supply the store. I hope this isn't indicative that Walden Farms is going to stop making this EXCELLENT product!

It caused serious illness when prepared and eaten, and it tested unequivocally positive for gluten when tested on an ELISA gluten test kit.  If you have celiac disease or are gluten intolerant, don't buy it.  Really too bad since buckwheat is a naturally gluten free product, but this company contaminated it during it processing.  The company has been informed of the problem, but has taken no action.

review/summary: RECIPE!! This stuff is awesome!
review/text: I don't make regular pancakes anymore since my family likes these much more than plain pancakes. Buckwheat is very alkaline in comparasion to wheat. It's also a great source of fiber & protein.<br /><br />Buckwheat pancakes:<br /><br />2 cups buckwheat flour<br />4 tsp. baking powder<br />1 tsp. salt<br />1 tsp cinnamon<br />1/2 cup organic honey or brown sugar<br />3 eggs<br />2 cups water<br />4 tbsp. olive oil<br /><br />This makes 12 moderate sized pancakes (5 - 6 inches diameter). Whisk all the ingredients well. You may need to adjust the amount of water for the thickness of batter you desire. Oil your pan or griddle and pour batter to 3 inch in diameter. Flip when the bubbles start to appear & pop (as you would usually with pancakes). I wrap up the extras individually for the freezer for my kids to grab in the morning and they still taste great.<br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Artificial taste and smell
review/text: This product contains artificial sweeteners.  The smell when it is being cooked or even when it is still dry is overwhelmingly unpleasant and chemical-ish. The artificial sweeteners are VERY obvious in the taste. I bought to keep at work for when I forget a meal but it took me a long time to finish and I wont buy it again because of the chemical smell and taste.  Right now the empty bowl smells strongly of syrupy sweetener and that was after I dumped a tablespoon of peanut butter in it to cover it up.  I like to keep Quaker instants for hurried days but I will not buy this line again.  It just tastes and smells... odd.

review/summary: Weird Smell
review/text: The original Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal is great.  The variants such as the Weight Control and High Fiber versions leave much to be desired.  They both have a pungent smell that emits from one of the powders in the bag. It lingers on everything it touches and gets everywhere.  The smell can be best described as a sweet/meaty soup stock.  It's not pleasant, and if you breath it in, you will be smelling it all day into the night.  This is a common problem apparently, as it is extensively commented on in the Weight Control product page.<br /><br />Another issue you may have is this product uses sucralose in addition to sugar as a sweetener. I really wish they didn't as it gives off a weird aftertaste some may be adverse to.  Also, it creates some digestive issues for those sensitive to artificial sweeteners which are only exacerbated by the high fiber content.  Maybe that was the plan, but now I get nightmares of WOW chips each time I have this oatmeal...which thanks to Amazon's bulk packaging, I have plenty of.<br /><br />The cinnamon flavor is actually quite better, as it has no weird smells.  I would try that if you really want the high fiber version.

Perhaps if that store carried this type they'd be okay to purchase from there, but when we opened the case of these that arrived on our doorstep from Amazon, about half the crackers in each box had been reduced to fine crumbs during shipping.

review/summary: Great crackers, but can get broken in shipping
review/text: These crackers are very much like Ritz crackers, and my whole family likes them. It's nice to have a tasty, buttery, crispy cracker that my chemically sensitive kids can eat. These were a great find for us. The saltiness does vary from cracker to cracker (it seems to be a matter of how many salt crystals stick to the surface of each cracker), but that's fine with us. They are all good.<br /><br />My only concern is that they can get broken in shipping. I've only gotten one shipment so far, but about a quarter of the crackers in the boxes were broken. That's a lot more broken crackers than if I buy them locally. This isn't really a problem for just snacking, since my kids don't seem to mind some broken crackers. However, if I need to make a tray for a party, I have to pick through the boxes to find all the unbroken crackers. If your family is particular about broken crackers, it could be a bigger concern for you. Still, since the kids don't complain about some broken crackers and these are a lot cheaper on Amazon, I'll keep buying them here. (I didn't down-rate the crackers for this, since it is a shipping problem and not a problem with the product.)<br /><br />These are definitely more expensive than Ritz crackers, even with the "subscribe & save" discount. However, the price difference is about what I expect for organic products.

review/summary: Awsome Peanutbutter ...
review/text: First of all, I do buy this at my local supermarket because it is a little cheaper (even with tax). I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier. If you do the flipping trick, I find that is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyway, while I did not find this cheaper here on Amazon, I'm still glad I got to tell you how much I love this stuff!

review/summary: Flavor, not just hot!
review/text: I want to pass on the direct quote from my husband, Clyde (who puts the Marie Sharps "mild" Habanaero Sauce on just about all his food): "It has such a good flavor---not merely hot, but with a good flavor, as well.  The carrot base adds something the other hot sauces don't have."  We are unable to find it in stores so we were glad to find it online.

review/summary: Flavorful
review/text: Though I prefer her hotter sauces, I think that this sauce is a five-star sauce as far as "mild" ones go. Marie's medley of vegetables and other flavors, with a prominent carrot note (hence much of the orange color), make this a sauce that is memorable for its flavor and not simply its mild heat. Though I have used it on all sorts of foods, I find that it works best on things like rice and beans, or a mild soup with lentils and potatoes, since a less-flavorful food lets the flavors of the hot sauce stand out better than do more extravagantly flavored foods, in which I find the taste of the sauce tends to get a little lost.

review/text: Marie Sharps mild is simply one of the best Hot Sauces on the planet. In a world of "I'm hotter than you are" products that completely overwhelm whatever food you're accenting, leave your tongue and mouth scorched into uselessness, Marie Sharps is near perfect. Blended with carrots, which contributes to it's wonderful color and essence, this wonderful mild sauce adds to eggs, hash browns, home made chili, Mexican dishes, Asian dishes, whatever you want a little bit of heat for. Simply the best. Miles ahead of Tapatio or the usual/staple Tabasco, Marie Sharps Mild just hits the spot.<br /><br />But, I'll not be buying from this vendor again. Two bottles and regular shipping came to nearly $26, off the chart for cost, the worst I've ever paid. Love the sauce, but sorry, won't be shopping through this channel again. There are other websites vendors out there.

It's a waste of money -- if you want something with great taste and a milder form, try Tobasco's brand of 'Green Pepper Sauce' (in green bottle).  It doesn't have the bitterness of this product and it is readily available in supermarkets.  The shipping cost on this product is tantamount to highway robbery!

review/summary: 101 uses for this stuff...
review/text: First of all, I do agree with the above reviewers who thought this wasn't a great fruit dip. Second, there's very little marshmallow flavor-this stuff is NOTHING like regular marshmallow fluff.<br /><br />However, I still give this 5 stars, because it's got features you can't get anywhere else. The texture is smooth pudding (Grainy reviewer perhaps ate his past the expiration date?) and that's mainly how I use this. Because of the slightly sharp taste of the cellulose, this dip lends itself very well to making citrus puddings (just add about 1/4 cup lemon concentrate and stir, doesn't get any easier than that). I also use it to make cheesecake and other dessert recipes.<br /><br />To actually make a good fruit dip out of this, try mixing it with yogurt or cream cheese.

review/text: I like some of the other Walden Farms products -- I gave their chocolate dip 4 stars -- but this one is not very good. I tried dipping different kinds of fruit into it, tried it in combination with the chocolate dip, and finally gave up and threw the rest of it away. The cellulose gel Walden Farms uses to give its sauces body seems to have a slight spicy/sour "bite" to it; it doesn't bother me in the chocolate dip or in most of their dressings, but here it ruins the flavor.

review/summary: YUCK YUCK YUCK TOOOOO SWEET!
review/text: Firstly I would like to mention that I like the idea of Walden Farms trying to do calorie free stuff... I do wish they would switch from SPLENDA to STEVIA since splenda is TOXIC to people (and babies)  but about this product... the consistency was OK, texture etc.  However.... the taste, omg the taste... it WOULD have been good had they maybe layed off soo much splenda, this is so sweet to the point it is absolutely disgusting and bitter.  There IS such a thing as too much sweet and this was just awful!  I am thinking maybe if I whip up some plain heavy whipping cream and maybe fold in 1/2 this jar into it maybe it will taste better but then that negates the whole calorie free stuff.... why did they make it so sweet??  Sure Americans are used to flavoring their sugar with coffee and or fruit but this is just ridiculous and gross.  Do they even do taste testings on their own products?  If they do then perhaps it's about time they switch out their taste testers since my feeling is that they have since lost the sensation of sweet on their tongues.

review/summary: Good Tasting Sugar Free Dip/Topping - Recommended
review/text: The Walden Farms Marshmallow Dip was a good find for me, but perhaps calling this "Marshmallow" was a mistake since it only slightly resembles marshmallow by looks and taste. It should be treated as a dessert dip/topping for dieters or diabetics. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking for low carb sweets that will not impact my blood sugar levels and this Dip/Topping has no impact at all.<br /><br />I like the flavor and use it on other sugar free foods to round out the dish. This works well with sugar free chocolate ice cream and with peanut butter sandwiches.<br /><br />Recommended, if you set your expectations to match the reality that this is not really marshmallow.

review/summary: Not A Marshmallow Dip Substitute
review/text: Despite my concerns over the taste of calorie free food, I tried the chocolate dip and was amazed. Can't be eaten plain but was very good paired with other things (strawberries are great!) So, I decided to give the rest of the line a try. This one was a flop and a waste of four dollars I'm afraid. It has a very strong chemical taste to it, one that stays in your mouth for a while which is a shame because they've gotten the texture down. I don't know  that I would ever buy it again (depends on whether or not I can make something with it, the cheesecake that someone suggested sounds promising) but I will never try to eat it as I would marshmallow fluff. Even on bread with peanut butter it is pretty awful tasting. Unless you're a daring low cal baker and think you can make something of it, steer clear.

review/summary: It's not the real thing -- of course! -- but extremely good for what it is
review/text: If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. And cream cheese-ey fruit dips, or marshmallow "fluff" spread, cannot possibly be duplicated without calories.  That is a fact of life.<br /><br />This marshmallow dip should not be compared to either of those foods, both of which are high in calories, sugar, and taste.  This dip should be compared to all the other low-calorie sweets out there that don't have potential to derail a diet.  And in that field, this dip definitely stands out, both in its taste and in the fact that it packs NO nutritional punch.  For me, it's good for a sweet tooth kick during the dog days of a diet.  It leaves a major aspartame after-taste, so if that's something you really hate, then don't get this.  I personally don't mind.<br /><br />I think the seriousness of your diet -- and your sensitivity/repulsion to after-tastes from artificial sweeteners -- will determine whether this is a winner for you or not.  It is obviously a big jar of chemicals.  (Though I'm sure there are plenty of chemicals in other marshmallow dips, too.)  For that reason, I wouldn't make this a daily part of my diet any more than I would any other purely artificial food.  But it sure is great, again, for the dog days of a diet.<br /><br />I got my jar at Kroger, here in Tennessee.  There were several Walden Farms items in the diet/health food area there.

review/summary: Fantastic, rich, sweet and sour heaven
review/text: I love this tea and still think it's the perfect epitome of that rich red fruit tea. The hibiscus leaves dominate to give it a sour, anti-oxidant packed flavor. It's kind of like a zinger, except it's the best zinger I've ever tasted. I'm a pretty regular tea drinker and agree that loose leaf is the way to go, but sometimes I'll drink a tea that had to be brewed loose leaf and think, why bother? Too much time and effort for a tea that would taste similar brewed in a tea bag. But with a choice few- genmaicha, a delicate white tea, and this one- it's totally worth the effort and I wouldn't do it any other way.<br /><br />  This tea makes the water into a red, juicy but not overly powerful elixir. It wakes up your taste bugs with it's tartness, gives you just enough sweet to satisfy your craving but not give you a sugar spike to make you crave more. Rich, beautiful, fragrant, delicious. The ingredients are fresh, top notch, it's perfectly blended, and quite simply, it's one of my must-have teas.

I don't know as it would stave off a full-blown chocolate craving, but it certainly will quiet down a run-of-the-mill sweet-tooth.<br /><br />I wonder how the mix might be in a sweet bread -- soaked in a little water and added to the dough. It would probably make the bread pink, but that's not a bad thing for a romantic-smelling tea.

review/summary: Decent instant coffee
review/text: I like Bru instant coffee. I am not sure what the effect of the chicory is, but it tastes different from Nescafe, more like South Indian-style filter coffee. There are cheaper places than Amazon to get it though. Be sure to check out a local ethnic Indian grocery store.

review/summary: Not Fair Trade- NOT organic!
review/text: For the sake of the coffee bean farmers around the world, try to support those companies who pay a fair wage to the farmer.  Fair trade coffees are usually grown in "bird-friendly", "tree-friendly" and pesticide, chemical-free plantations too.  Check out Higher Grounds for instance...

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised ^^
review/text: This is my first time ordering a food item from an online site, and it was great! :D<br />A lot of the other review for this product said they only had a few of the mango flavors but mine had about half and half of mango and strawberry.<br /><br />Also, the shipping was awesome.  Shipped next day and got it the day after. (Compared to August 6-9 that tracking said it'd take vs. arriving on August 3)<br /><br />&lt;3

review/text: i love chupa chups, my favorite is the mango yogurt ones and there was only 4 in the entire package so that was disappointing, but just about every flavor is good so its still a good buy.

review/summary: Is this really decaf?
review/text: Newman's Own Organics special blend decaf is so good no one would suspect it could be a decaf.  I am thinking of switching to this blend totally.

review/summary: Classic comfort food!
review/text: Been eating these since I was a child when mom would buy a couple of cans every other month or so.  They were a real treat back then and they're just as good now.  Only diff is I can get them by the case from Amazon and have them delivered to my door.  What else needs to be said?  They're exactly the same as they were thirty years ago and in this day and age, being able to count on something, even something this small, is a good thing to hold onto.  Thanks Armour and thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Tastes Like Salty Tofu, Basically
review/text: I haven't had vienna sausage since childhood, and even then I only had them occasionally, at other people's houses.  These were much less flavorful and much saltier than I remembered.  They aren't bad; they are basically tasteless, much like tofu.  I would suggest to anyone thinking about buying these to see if the company markets a low sodium version.<br /><br />The "pink slime" scare is a bit exaggerated in its details.  Still it's unnerving.  However, I had heard so many times from family friends and associates who are Native American and Chinese doctors etc. about how healthful it is to consume more than just the muscle tissue of animals, that I gave it some thought.  "Pink slime" does not contain every type of animal part.  Notably it will contain some highly beneficial parts we don't normally eat in the U.S., such as tendons and ligaments.  These actually are very healthy items featured in the cuisines of a number of cultures.  Not only am I unlikely to sit down to a nice bowl of Chinese beef tendons (which I don't think I could even chew up), but have you priced these products in the ethnic markets?  Very expensive.  So, if that's the case, and these cheapo little hotdogs offer the same thing, then maybe they warranted my reconsideration.  That was my line of thought, anyway.<br /><br />So - something to consider for those who are suffering from ailments such as arthritis or other bone and joint issues.  Again though - seriously - look for low salt ones if you want to try them.  These are too salty.  For me, since I got a lot of them with the order, I will be able to use them rather like a salty condiment added to dishes such as beans.
