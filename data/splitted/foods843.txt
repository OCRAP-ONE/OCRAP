review/text: The stuff is good, but don't think it's the best.  The taste is a little bland compared to other sauces and doesn't really pack any heat to it at all.  You would think "hot" meant hot, but this is more like mild to me.  Try again taco bell.

review/summary: A dissatisfying product
review/text: Taco Bell Home Originals Hot Restaurant Sauce shows promise but does not deliver.  The flavor is distinctive yet bland--it is in the background and needs to be brought forward.  It is not that hot, either, and this should not be the case.  This sauce is not bad, but it could have been better.  Actually, I rate this product 2.5 stars.

review/text: Bought a box of these to try this summer.  Made s'mores in the microwave and they were very good, but then the rest of the cookies 'disappeared' before we got a chance to make more...  These are very similar to the graham crackers I remember, but maybe a little thicker. Still taste very much like them though.  I wish they'd make a cinnamon version...  The price isn't too bad.  I paid over $4.50 for the ones I bought, and these will come to $4.43/box.  Kinnikinnick gf foods are usually good but expensive.

The description states "Save On Kinnikinnick 6X 8 Oz S'Moreable Graham Cracker They'Re Back And Ready For S'Mores!", which makes it sound like you are getting SIX boxes.  When you add in shipping they are pretty pricey for just one box, but they are delicious.  My 1.5 year old son has multiple food allergies and a very limited diet, and loves these.  Just wish we could find a good deal on buying them in bulk.

They are small and rectangular, so they are hard to use for smores, but I always figure something out.<br /><br />On the negative side - there must be somewhere else to get these.  Amazon is charging $8.99 for ONE little box of crackers.  I ordered them thinking that I was getting multiple boxes.  This is a ridiculous price.  I'll ask the health food store to order them for me next time.

review/summary: Kinnikinnick S'moreables are great!
review/text: Kinnikinnick has always been one of my preferred brands of gluten free products and their S'moreables are one more to add to my list of great gluten free products. The crackers are crunchy and just a touch sweet, used as graham cracker crust and for use with s'mores, its pretty hard to tell they are gluten free. They do break a little to easily and dry out really fast, so if you don't use them all, be sure to keep them tightly sealed. Overall I'm very happy with these gluten free graham crackers.

It might interest you to know that my toughest critics-two teenaged boys-really love it served over jasmine rice.  And if they like it, then you know it's not too spicey or too different for your family.

review/summary: Naturally Great Cat Food!
review/text: My big kitty loves mackrel and sardines, but they are hard to find.  I got a can of this to try because he loved salmon, as well--and he got one sniff of it and started howling for it! I could hardly get it from the can onto his plate fast enough!  These are very large cans and too much for one cat or one meal, but I just use a couple tablespoons at a time, and then slip the unused portion into a ziplock baggie and pop it in the fridge.  I take it out about one hour before serving again--still get the same response--the big guy LOVES it!  I always leave extra on his plate so that he can go back to it if he likes, and so far, he has not eaten more of it than his other varieties, just seems to enjoy it the most.  It is healthy and low calorie due to its purer contents, and so I am hoping it will help him to lose a pound or two.  He still eats just a bit at a time, but with so much more gusto--and from the amount of washing up after his meal of this, I can tell that he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Happy cat, happy human!  I am now buying it by the case!

review/text: We got a couple packs of this gravy in a gift basket one christmas and made it over biscuits for breakfast one day. it was DELICIOUS!!! I looked for it in stores and couldn't find it. That's when i turned to the internet and ordered a case. It is so simple to make and tastes delicious--even better than the canned gravies. Brown some ground sausage and mix it in or leave it plain-either way a real treat.

review/text: The Southeastern Mills Country Gravy Mix has the down home country gravy flavor that I use over fresh baked biscuits that we love having for Sunday morning breakfasts.<br /><br />It is a great buy in the 24 count carton. I've priced both chicken gravy and country gravy  mix in the store and it costs over a dollar a packet. The thing is, the store bought packet makes one cup of gravy. However, Southeastern Mills Country Gravy mixes up three full cups of gravy. That's plenty for a domestic partnered couple not to run short while pouring gravy over biscuits. It tastes great, too. I've mixed a store bought package of the Chicken Gravy mix with this, too. this makes undeniably the best gravy I've ever, ever tasted! Buy this product!

review/summary: Not a single lump and great flavor!
review/text: Southeastern Mills Gravy Mix -- whichever flavor you use -- is great gravy! Unlike most packets you get at the grocery that make one cup of gravy, this makes 3 1/2 cups. (So do their brown and peppered gravies.) What family only uses one cup of gravy? Not any family with southern or midwestern roots, I can tell you that. With Southeastern Mills, there is enough for the whole family and maybe a little left over for the cat or dog. (Maybe not.) Follow the directions on the packet and you will have smooth and tasty gravy every time. This is good gravy for chicken fried steak or breaded, boneless chicken breasts or, if you toss some browned and crumbled country sausage and a little pepper in it and cook the whole thing in the skillet you browned the sausage in, it is lip smackin' good on biscuits fresh out of the oven.

review/text: Went back to order this again and realized that it has been almost a year ago that I placed my last order. I love the 24 pack and you can't beat the price! We eat country fried chicken/steak a couple of times a month. We had been looking for another white gravy since being a southern girl living up north that is the only way to eat it. Unfortunatley it is harder than heck to find white gravy in the stores here. We gave this product a try after seeing the others reviews and have to say we all were happy with it! That is quite an accomplishment with 3 picky kids. We usually use a couple of packs each time when our whole family of 5 is eating. I joke with my kids when they "drown" their food in this stuff that they might as well take the whole bowl and eat it with a spoon! ;) Anyway we love this stuff and hope that amazon keeps selling it!

review/summary: Wow!  Exceeded my expectations
review/text: The reviews helped convince me to try this product, as I was looking for a really good quality packaged country gravy.  I like country gravy from time to time, but seldom want to go through the trouble of making it myself.  This is definitely the best one I have tried by a large margin.  I don't think I could make it better and I cook very well.<br /><br />The flavor is very rich.  The consistency is smooth and velvety.  I didn't even add one spot of salt...that was amazing in itself as I was sure that I would need to add salt!  What I did, that was ever so slightly different from the instructions, was to go ahead and get the 2c of water boiling.  Meanwhile, I have one of those Tupperware shakey things and put the other cup of water & the mix in that and shook it up.  It blended up super well.  Then, when the water boiled, I got a whisk and slowly poured the mix into the boiling water while whisking.  It only took a minute to return to a boil and come up to the proper consistency.<br /><br />The thought of buying 24 of these super-sized packages was a bit daunting, but I put them in airtight containers in the freezer and I think that should keep them even past the expiration date on the packages.<br /><br />What I do, since each package makes so much and I am usually just making a little something for me only, is to freeze the remainder of it in single portion sizes then I can vacuum seal each one separately with my Foodsaver and take out one portion at a time.  That works best for me, as I have found that if I just put country gravy in the refrigerator to use over a several day period it gets kind of gross and separatey, even in airtight containers.  It freezes and reconstitutes VERY well if stored properly.

Makes a wonderful cake along with the sweet 'n low yellow cake mix. YUMMY!! My only problem is trying to find it in stores. So now I just get it off the internet.

review/summary: Sweet 'N Low Chocolate Frosting Mix
review/text: Yummy my boyfriend is a diabetic and since he was diagnosed 5 years ago I have been searching for frosting to make a cake and this was perfect. He loved it and low and behold I did also. Our son did to he is 9 and couldn't tell the difference. He had no clue it wasn't real cake icing.

review/summary: Great for Diabetics Who Love Chocolate
review/text: My wife had seen this at Walgreens but a week later they'd apparently dropped the product line.  After searching at all the usual suspects we were unable to locate it anywhere.  Then we found it here and grabbed a couple of boxes to try out on a birthday cake.  It really does taste great and my wife and young daughter both loved it.  It was quick and easy to make, and just as easy to frost a sugar free birthday cake.

review/summary: 4 Well Deserved Stars
review/text: I think this product deserves 4 well deserved stars for several reasons. I bought this and the chocolate cake mix, which you should read my review to, and I believe that this was pretty good quality. For sugar free products, it's very hard to find something that's tasty and to my liking. I am very picky. This product was for my father who is a diabetic, but I wouldn't give my father anything that I wouldn't eat myself.<br /><br />The frosting was very easy to make, just add some water and swirl in a circle and BOOM you have frosting. What I loved about this product was, just like the cake mix it was a bit of a surprise. When I opened the package, the box was very light and both the cake mix and this frosting were very powdery almost too powdery to my liking. They were both "Just Add Water" products, and with both of them I found myself very hesitant to add water to them because I thought I might dissolve this powder, however after just a half of cup of water and a few swirls, I got some good tasting frosting!<br /><br />Now, To be 100% honest, the frosting has a little funny taste, but it's not a terrible taste. But being that the product is a sugar free product, you do have to take into consideration the fact that that's what's going to be expected from the product. However, the after taste wasn't so bad that it over powered the frosting, it was like a light minty feeling to a chocolatey frosting. It's not completely to my liking, not something that I would eat regularly I prefer the real chocolate frosting over this one, however, when you eat it with the chocolate cake, it's almost like you're not missing anything. My suggestion to you, is if you MUST get the icing then YOU MUST get the sugar free chocolate cake with it as well because it's soo much of a treat. I think it was worth it. Fast shipping, I made the frosting in under 5 minutes, the cake baked in about 15. You can have a sugar free cake in 20 minutes! I would buy again.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: We tried this sauce because we love the raspberry sauce served on so many desserts in restaurants these days. We had used another brand before but could no longer find it, so we searched the Internet and found this one. Unfortunately, it was more of an excessively sweet jam/jelly than a smooth sauce. One taste and no one would eat it. I tried using it in smoothies and it made the whole thing too sweet, even though I didn't add any other sweetener.<br /><br />If anyone knows a good raspberry sauce, please let me know!

review/summary: Taste like chocolates but why labeled as Weight Watchers???
review/text: I bought these thinking they would actually be less fat being labeled after a big-name weight reduction group.  13 grams of fat a serving?  Really?  Is that what is considered "weight watching"?  It was a bag of Whitman's chocolates pre-packaged under the WW brand and sold as something much more expensive but basically about the same fat content as just buying Whitman's chocolates and eating 3. (3 is a serving)  Sure they tasted good but so do regular chocolates.  Silly.  Not worth the money.  Just go buy a box of Whitman's and eat 3. lol

review/text: I bought these thinking "how great chocolate for one point!"  Well that is not actually the case.  If you scan the bar code or put the nutritional content into the calculator they are two points each.  And instead of a serving (three chocolates) being 4 points, its 5 points.  I know this may seem like a small issue but a point means alot when your dieting.  I emailed the company as well, but I have had no response.

review/summary: Goldbaum's Pastas
review/text: With having limited pasta choices due to corn, egg and gluten intolerances, I have found Goldbaums pasta to be a very easy to work with rice pasta that maintains texture well. As with all gluten free pastas, I find that they are more easily overcooked, but by using resting methods (8 minutes on boil, resting in the hot water off the burner to texture) and using a hot water rinse, people are unable to tell the difference.

review/summary: Decent Alternative to Fancy Feast Appetizers (chicken and tuna)
review/text: I have one cat that absolutely adores Fancy Feast's Appetizers -- the chicken and tuna combination. The only problem is that Appetizers are small portions (2 ounces instead of 3.3 ounces), expensive (retailing at $1.49 per portion), and not a complete source of nutrition. Fancy Feast says the Appetizers should supplement regular cat food rather than replace it. But it's the one meal that gets my cat to clean his bowl.<br /><br />So when I discovered Soulistic cat foods being offered at Petco, I gave the Sweet Salutations Chicken and Tuna Dinner a try. More standard 3-oz can priced at 89 cents apiece, with complete feline nutrition. My incredibly picky cat will eat 90% of this. So it's a decent alternative to the Fancy Feast Appetizers that he craves.<br /><br />This particular canned meal has a lot of gravy, which pleases my cat but may not satisfy others who prefer more meat.<br /><br />Given Petco's shipping charges, I probably will continue to buy this at my local Petco rather than ship via Amazon.<br /><br />NOTE: The price shown here is for a tray of 12 cans.

review/summary: Not as good as the Soulistic in Gelee
review/text: Having purchased the Soulistic "Gelee" and BFF (made by the same company) I wanted to try the "Gravy" flavors to add some more variety.  Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans.  I do not want to be paying the same price for cans that contain this much liquid and less food.  I will purchase the "Gelee" foods and BFF again, but it isn't likely that I will purchase the "Gravy" flavors.

With this stuff I am now a believer, there is no crash, I am not jittery, and I really do feel the effect.  It starts strong, then fades gradually after about 4-5 hours.  It tastes OK too (way better than cough syrup), and I just drink the whole bottle in 1 big gulp. Sometimes I do feel flushed/warm for about 30 minutes, but it isn't uncomfortable, just noticeable.

review/summary: Best PMS remedy when combined with the great tasting Detox!!
review/text: If you're looking for help with the PMS - do give the PMS tea try. It works wonders.<br /><br />For the first month, I had only the detox tea. One bag, several times a day. I had also ramped up to running 2-3 miles three times a week (from 1.5 to 2/ 2 times a week). When my cycle came and went with heavily reduced symptoms, I was in disbelief!! Next month, I switched to the PMS tea after day 20. The month after I had the PMS tea for the whole month. There is no looking back for me.<br /><br />Here are all the areas where I saw a SIGNIFICANT difference: Oily skin/hair, energy levels, I-AM-GOING-TO-CHEW-MY-NAILS-OFF cramps, bloating, body aches and the MOOD!<br /><br />Relevant asides:<br /><br />The PMS tea: doubled amount of Dandelion root (500mg compared to the Detox).  Caffeine free with 89% certified organic ingredients. Taste - meh...but tolerable<br /><br />The Detox tea: 250 mg of Dandelion extract. Apparently they revamped this product owing to concerns of sustainable access to ingredients. That is pretty commendable I think! Plus whatever they did, rocks! Taste gets a 10/10. Has a small amount of Kukicha caffeine. And again, the formula is 85% organic.<br /><br />Both products contraindicated for pregnant (detox only of course) or breastfeeding sisters.<br /><br />If you do review the product, please add tags, to help resolve some of the confusion here :)<br /><br />Last but not least the six pack price is a steal. But get one at a local dealer first and read the fine print!!<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: I can eat it with a spoon
review/text: This is fantastic. If it's really 85% less calorie and fat, I will eat it with a spoon with no reservations. Being constantly on some type of diet, it is a real find. It tastes a lot like peanut butter with chocolate mixed together. I used it first with Yonanas mixer and it worked out rather well with bananas and berries (very little berries, or otherwise the taste clashes)I've bought Peanut butter powder too so I can't figure out which one I like better, they are kind of similar, but both yummy. One little critics I have is the packaging. I had trouble opening it, so in the end I had to cut it. Now it sits open and I would rather have it tight closed. Any ideas? (except zip lock bag)? Next time I think I will buy it in a jar. And I will buy it again.

review/text: If youre on a low cal diet (or any diet!) and you crave chocolate, GET THIS!! You mix 2 tbsp of the powder with 1 tbsp of water.. You can add a little more water if you want a drizzle like consistency for drizzling on desserts or waffles. But otherwise, its super creamy and absolutely delicious! If it isn't sweet enough for you, try to add one packet of splenda or sweet n low! Will buy again and again! Absolutely LOVED it!

review/summary: Reasonably Delicious
review/text: This is a pretty solid alternative to peanut butter. If the instructions on the label are followed, the peanut butter ends up a little more liquid-y than one might expect, but that is easily remedied by adjusting the amount of water. This works well for sandwiches, and is an awful lot less messy than trying to add proper peanut butter to a smoothie. I've not yet tried using it in baking, but it seems like it would be satisfactory, so long as the amount of water is reduced when making the paste.

review/summary: A tasty alternative.
review/text: I really love peanut butter, but one sandwich worth of peanut butter uses up most of your daily intake of saturated fats generally. This powdered stuff doesnt come close. It is as easy to use as simply stirring with a spoon and comes out just fine by my estimation. There isnt really a noticeable drop off for me personally, but i dont really eat really sugary peanut butter anyway (i would normally buy Justin's or somesuch). The chocolate is just right in this as well. Although i wanted to be able to eat PB&J's without taking up all of my fat intake, i also wanted to have something for my daily smoothies. I play around with variations, but my go to drink is kale, banana, apple, mango, and mint with flaxseed meal. This makes a great addition to that blend.<br />Anyway, i have seen mention of cheaper prices elsewhere, but for me, with Prime membership and a $5.50 price point currently, i feel the price is more than adequate, especially when factoring in no shipping and two day delivery.<br />I recommend trying this product. No transfats, high fructose corn syrup, or any added carp. Just a good, simple product.<br />Enjoy!

review/summary: YUMMY "diet" food!
review/text: I just received my order of this and the regular PB2 today.  I've lost 53 pounds on my current weight loss and exercise program, but have been wandering off down the road to fat land again, with peanut butter and chocolate chips.  I had this for dinner tonight on a multigrain bread, with a banana sliced in.  Can't even imagine the calories I saved and I have no desire to dig into the regular peanut butter jar.<br /><br />The taste isn't quite like real peanut butter, more like roasted peanuts to me, with just a hint of chocolate flavor.  Doesn't matter whether it has the exact taste or not as long as the fat is gone and the taste is good.  This passes the test with flying colors.<br /><br />The texture is not quite like the creamy fat of real peanut butter either, but I'm not bothered by it at all.<br /><br />I will buy this again and hope that my review helps others to at least give it a try.  It might just be my new BFF for the next 40 lbs.<br /><br />Glad I heard about this and decided to take it for a test drive.

review/text: After reading some mixed reviews, I decided not to get my hopes up too high for the chocolate pb2, so I didn't go into trying it expecting nutella or anything.  The consistency was a lot smoother than I expected, not as grainy as regular peanut butter, which I didn't mind.  It was nice and creamy and though it may not be as sweet as regular peanut butter, it was sweet enough for me to be happy to eat it alone with a spoon! haha.  I thought it was actually really good and can see myself keeping with this stuff for a long time.

I won't say I was disappointed, because it's still fine to use instead of peanut butter, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  You can't go into it thinking that the texture and taste will be too similar to real peanut butter.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3 because it's only 45 calories for 2 TBSP!

review/summary: Peanut butter minus the guilt!
review/text: I LOVE peanut butter.  I am the kind of person who will eat it out of the jar with a spoon, all by itself!  I like it that much.  Needless to say, this love affair is dangerous for the waistline.  Enter PB2, with 45 calories per 2-tbsp serving--an absolute godsend!  I tried and liked the plain version but this chocolate one is even BETTER!  It's not just chocolate flavored, there are actually tiny little granules of chocolate goodness in it, like micro-mini chocolate chips.  Yum!  Sure, it takes a bit of mixing and experimentation to get the consistency just right, but in the end it's great as a peanut butter stand in, either in recipes, as a dessert topping, or yes, even all on its own.  I love this and love that I can indulge my inner peanut butter fiend without too much fear of having to buy new pants.
