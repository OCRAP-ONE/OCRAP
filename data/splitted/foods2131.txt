review/summary: NOT tender.
review/text: I hate "chewy" jerky so the description and reviews for this product appealed to me. Now maybe I just got a bag that has been sitting the warehouse for years, although there is no "best by" date on the packaging so I have no idea. But anyways, this jerky is NOT tender. It is extremely chewy and after less than 1/2 a serving (a serving is one ounce), my jaw is sore. One piece I couldn't even finish because it was so hard, and I had to spit it out. Ugh.<br /><br />The flavor is good but I was really looking for tender jerky and this is not the answer. I will begrudgingly eat it since I paid for it and I don't think you can return food items, but I am very disappointed.

review/summary: Truly the BEST
review/text: My whole family loves noodles, due to my daughter being celiac we had to switch to cooking gluten-free. Much to my dismay and my families, gluten-free noodles overall taste like crap! They don"t hold up well, either no matter how long you cook them they are still hard and then mushy, or you cook them right, but when you wanna eat them or mix them with gravy they fall apart. I am a spoiled german, it is said about us that we are extremely picky about food- a brand like "Bionaturae" (suppposedly also from Italy is litterally a insult to my toung feelwise and tastewise. Tinkyada is close, but still comparably FAR away from Le VEneziane. The taste and texture is like real noodles, cook the same too and hold up thje same. My best friend tried the LaVeneziane (which I actually brought from a germany vacation), when I had to spend a week in the hospital with my boy, and she had to take care of my daughter. She called me in the hospital even to tell me how awesome those noodles are and that they taste just like regular noodles. The other day she even asked me if she would make spaghettiesauce, if I could bring those delicious noodles- so we all can have the same as my daughter. That was a first- usually everybody is glad to not have to eat glutenfree, with this it didn't matter any more. The WANTED glutenfree noodles! While in germany we cooked those for my daughter, my dad a trained chef even commented that there is no difference to reall noodles.<br />Try them, in any shape- you will not be dissapointed!<br />PS: Just so you know- in Italy Celiac-desease is a by LAW acknowledged desease (like peanut-allergy)- it has to be declared of everything, schools have to offer glutenfree meals as an alternative- and a standard schoolscreening at the age of 7 IS Celiacs. Italinas have a fine toung too and crappy food would not last.

review/text: Our family had dinner at a nice Italian restaurant in Houston Texas that had GF pasta on the menu.  My son has been on a gluten free diet for 9 years and I have never seen him eat pasta like he did there.  I was certain it was not GF until the owner brought out the box to show me.  The texture, color, and taste are perfect. I have had other Italian pastas shipped to me for years, but nothing compares to this pasta.  I still can't believe it is wheat free.  You can serve this pasta to people not on the GF diet and they would never know it was GF.  I am still amazed and thrilled!<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Jodi McMahon<br />Houston, TX

review/text: I just about couldn't believe all the reviews for this product, but being about three months into a GF diet, I was starving for some good pasta. All the rice products we get in the US just fall apart, even when properly cooked. I've even had some corn pasta here, and it didn't hold together very well, either.<br /><br />This stuff was absolutely incredible. Even if I didn't have to eat gluten free, I would prefer this to regular wheat pasta. It has a firm texture and rich flavor, not to mention the lovely golden color provided by the corn.<br /><br />I am a culinary student, blogger, caterer and instructor. I hope to be able to use this product when cooking for others. Looking for restaurant quantities!

review/text: Our whole family eats gluten free since my daughter was diagnosed with Celiac Disease.  We have tried many gluten free pastas.  I bought this at a gluten-free food expo and our family was blown away.  The noodles are smooth and sort of slippery and reminded me of an egg-noodle.  The taste and texture are great.  You would never know it was gluten-free.  I can't wait to make beef stroganoff again.  So excited to see this product offered at Amazon because it can be difficult to find.  (Would love to see free super saver shipping and subscription.)  Try it and you'll be amazed!

review/text: bought these blindly via the military commissary system while living overseas and seeking out gluten free pasta.  These are corn based, not rice based.  Had never heard of the brand before trying them.  What a find.  These noodles are wonderful.  So flavorful its hard to believe they are gluten free.  Sent some via Amazon online to my dad who also must eat gluten free and he loved them.  My niece ate over at his house one night and still raves about the meal Grandpa made with these fettucine noodles.  She asked where she could buy them and she is a wheat eater--that tells you something about the quality and taste of this product.  A year later she still talks about that meal and these fettucine noodles...

review/summary: Awesome for Fettuccine Alfredo - Gluten Free
review/text: Le Veneziane is the best Gluten Free pasta I have had, hands down. I used the fettuccine to make fettuccine alfredo. It was very easy. I boiled the noodles according to the package directions. Put a couple of chicken breasts in a fry pan and in a sauce pan combined, a small pacakge (8 oz) of cream cheese, a cube of butter, some freshly grated parmesan about 3/4 of a cup, some Italian seasoning (about a teaspoon and a half) and some garlic. I melted all of that together on medium heat. I took the pasta off and drained it, sliced up my chicken into bite size pieces and then mixed in all together in my serving dish. My family gobbled it up and requested it for dinner again soon. I making it again tonight but don't have any Le Veneziane Fettuccine left and so I am going to try it with Le Veneziane Eliche pasta. This pasta is a spiral type of pasta that my daughter requested.

review/text: My daughter loooooves pasta so when we started a gluten free casein free diet for her she was NOT happy about giving it up. She was picky even with wheat pasta, she would ask for some brands over others. She often likes it plain, so there's no hiding under sauce, either. We tried two other gluten free pastas and she wouldn't eat them (schar's and tinkyada). When she tasted this one she was absolutely thrilled. She said "It's exactly like regular except it's on the diet!" My husband said he would never have known that it was gluten free if he hadn't seen the package. It really tastes great, for any pasta, not just among the gluten free ones.

review/summary: Gluten free pasta alternative
review/text: I'm so excited to have more Gluten Free options available.  I purchased the Ditalini pasta for my Pasta E. Fagoili soup.  I used Ditalini all the time back in my wheat days and was so disappointed in my Wheat Free options for this recipe.  I'm so excited that this worked out so nicely.  I feel like one more piece of the puzzle has fallen back into place.  I love all the options this brand offers.  Make the switch, your non gluten family members will not be disappointed.<br /><br />* Holds its shape nicely.<br />* Taste is appealing.<br />* Held up well in my soup recipe.<br />* I did not find it to be gummy like "some" rice pastas.<br /><br />The instructions are not english though.  It does cook a bit longer than regular pasta, similar to rice pasta.  Keep your eye on it.

review/summary: Very Good Pasta
review/text: Having tried many gluten free pastas we tried this one.  It is by far the one that tastes most like pasta made with semolina wheat.  If you serve this to company they would not know the difference, except for the slightly more yellow color.  It also seems less "starchy" while cooking.  Some brands you can't even see through the cloudy water.  This one is not as bad, and takes only 9-10 minutes to cook.

review/summary: The Best Gluten-Free Pasta
review/text: A friend who lives in Italy brought me a box of this pasta as a gift, and what a gift it was. This is the best gluten free pasta out there. The taste is rich and the texture is just like wheat pasta. My husband, who does not have celiac disease, prefers this to any wheat pasta he has ever had. I was delighted to find this product offered on Amazon, though I am sorry that now I won't have to travel to Rome to go grocery shopping, which I would have done, just to get my hands on this pasta again.  Bon appetit.

review/text: Our company decided that all our staff kitchen must have PB&J for staff. Skippy chunk PB is always the first one to be used up. I did get different brands before, but people really like Skippy the most. Personally, I agree. It's not so chunky that's hard to spread, and not so salty that's hard to swallow. It's just the perfect mix of chunky and creamy peanuts. Plus, Amazon has the best price after you use the subscribe & save. Got them shipped directly to the office, I didn't even have to carry them in. It's awesome!

review/text: I love this peanut butter. I don't personally buy it but I have it in my protein shake at my local Gym. It makes a world of a difference. Awesome taste but after reading the nutritional facts ingredients I realized it has HYDROGENATED OILS which is NO BUENO. I wish this ingredient would be banned like in other places. I considered ordering but went with another peanut butter company (Peanut Butter & Co. Peanut Butter) that used Palm fruit oil instead. Palm fruit oil does not require hydrogenation.

review/summary: Best cat food out there, period.
review/text: My cat LOVES this food. I did a lot of research before choosing my cat's food for obvious reasons--he's my pet, I'm responsible for what he eats, and I want him to be as healthy as he can possibly be. My cat is on the following eating program, and I swear he looks like he's on steroids--except in a very lean and healthy way. He doesn't overeat, so I always keep Wellness Complete Health dry food in his bowl, and he just snacks on it from time-to-time throughout the day. Every morning, he gets a small can of the Wellness canned food, I switch up the flavors, but his favorite is the Salmon/Beef. Sometimes he eats most of it in one sitting, sometimes he eats it throughout the day. For snacks, he gets Whole Life brand freeze-dried chicken or salmon, sometimes dry, sometimes I run hot water over the chunks. I recommend this program to anyone who loves their cat. My cat is an indoor/outdoor cat and he's in extremely good shape. He seems sharp and alert, his coat is incredibly shiny and silky, and he just looks very, very healthy and happy. I attribute most of this to his diet. The best cat food on the market.

review/summary: Good quality but expensive!
review/text: I've been feeding my 2 year old cat Purina One, which he loves, but despite lots of exercise he still managed to pack on a couple of extra pounds.  I figured I would try a premium brand which cuts out all the extra fillers and see if his weight would reduce.  I did a little research and decided to try the Wellness brand of dry food since they got good reviews and seem to use very high quality products without fillers.  I started with the smallest bag they have but it cost nearly $4/pound which is just too expensive for long term use but worth a short term experiment.<br /><br />I opened the bag and it smelled like cranberries which was a nice change from most cat foods.  As per the instructions I mixed the new food with some of his old brand of food to slowly adjust his system to the change and offered it to him.  He LOVED it!!  He was picking the new food out of his bowl and leaving most of the old brand which was great until later when I learned why they recommend mixing the new and old food.  He was curled up in my lap and suddenly I was hit by the smell of kitty gas.  Whew!!  It has been a couple of days and he's been getting some minor tummy issues including loose stool but his system is still adjusting.  I also tried the wet food but he was just not as interested in it eating only half of what he was offered (about a third of the can) before moving to the dry food.<br /><br />When this bag runs out I'm going to try Natural Balance which was recommended by my brother's cats.  It is a another high quality cat food but is not as expensive.

review/summary: This same box is $10.99 at Costco
review/text: As much as I find Amazon.com convenient, this is no deal at all.  I was just at Costco yesterday and bought two boxes of 38 Fiber One Brownies and each box was only $10.99.  For the price they are charging here, Amazon.com should be sending you three boxes.  As for the bars, I am newly diabetic and the Brownie bars make for a nice "dessert" item after an otherwise low carb meal.  They have 13 grams of net carb after subtracting out the 5 grams of dietary fiber.  The item offers a chance for a smaller treat than the Oatmeal and Chocolate Fiber One bar, which I also enjoy to get my chocolate fix in a healthier way.

So, I told her I found them on Amazon for $20+ per box, and she told me not to buy them. She went to Costco and got the same 38 count box for me for $10.99. I love Amazon, and usually I get great deals here. However, this time around I have to say that this is not a deal!!!

review/text: I am always on the lookout for good ~100-calorie snacks. Clocking in at 90 calories, they definitely have the right count. Sadly, the brownies themselves are not very good to eat. They are not at all filling (a common thing with snacks with this low of a calorie count), which means they after eating one, you will still want something else to eat. The texture of the brownies is not good, plus they have a very unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />And the worst thing is that something in the brownie, perhaps the chicory root extract, gave me gastrointestinal distress - something I definitely don't want at work.<br /><br />I was not pleased with these brownies, and I definitely do not recommend them.

They are tasty, filling and totally curb your sweet tooth with a healthier treat then a candy bar or over indulgent dessert. My boyfriend tried them and he's hooked. They are hard to find on grocery store (usually all purchased) and you only get 4-6 bars for $5.99. So getting 38 for approx $22 with prime shipping and subscribe and save, you are getting  steal!

review/text: I buy them from Walmart. Extremely small, nothing like the commercial, but what can you expect for 90 calories and a 20% dv of fiber. I ate one as soon as I got them to my car and was disappointed. It tasted artificial, like hersheys syrup and had a weird texture. The next time I tried it I removed it from wrapper and I heated it up about 20 seconds in the microwave. Complete difference! Moist chewy, the chocolate ribbons were melted and it actually tasted like a delicious brownie. I'll definitely repurchase. Took off one star for the inconvenience of it not being an on the go snack for me like I thought (since I will ONLY eat them heated) I would still recommend.

review/summary: Brownies aren't too bad, price on Amazon is horrid
review/text: First and foremost, you should really try buying these in stores because they're over-priced on Amazon.<br /><br />The brownies themselves are...decent. They're not going to taste like an actual brownie, of course, they're chocolate-y and kind of chalky. They're a decent snack, though, for the 90 calories I suppose. They're kind of small and light and not very moist like real brownies. Not my favourite treat, but I still enjoy them.<br /><br />For dieting? I would try looking for other snacks, I wouldn't recommend these for diet snacks since they're small and not "worth" the 90 calories for a couple of bites of a sub par brownie. They aren't terribly filling either..

review/summary: Very good low cal brownie but shop for price
review/text: My wife and I as well as other family members really like this brownie as a low calorie snack. No, it does not taste the same as the mouth watering chocolate brownies with hundreds of calories that my local bakery sells. But for a low calorie brownie it tastes pretty good. Here is why we like it.<br /><br />1. This has a soft texture, but it's not too crumbly.<br /><br />2. This has a good chocolate taste unlike some of the other low calorie chocolate items that I have tried.<br /><br />3. I disagree with the negative reviews complaining that this is too dry; for me it is moist enough.<br /><br />4. Although this is not a health food bar, it does have 5g fiber, only 8g sugar, 100mg sodium and 1.5g saturated fat. So beside being low in calories, it is not junk food.<br /><br />A number of reviews have lowered the rating on this product based only on price and not quality. However I do agree that you should shop for price. I currently buy this at my local Costco for just under twelve dollars.

review/summary: Not as fudgey as I had thought but it definitely hits the spot!
review/text: I just got them today and these are deliiiicious! Fiber One always comes up with great healthy snacks and these brownies will be gone pretty soon! When I opened one it looked very chewy and fudgey but they are on the softer side. There are some chocolate chips in the middle and an irresistible chocolate drizzle on top of the brownie! *yum* Yeah, I wish they were bigger too because they're just a little piece of Heaven!

review/summary: ok taste but very dry
review/text: First of all these brownies are very small. Much smaller than they appear on the package or on TV. They are pretty filling I suppose and the taste is ok although not spectacular but they are very dry to me. I ended up eating a couple of them and taking the rest to work and giving them away.

review/summary: Too sweet!
review/text: As a chocolate lover, I enthusiastically looked forward to trying the new Fiber One brownies. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed.  The texture is not quite up to that of a real brownie, lacking that treat's trademark chewiness and moisture. The taste was far too sweet, and lacked in chocolate flavor. I don't know why many manufacturers, and even some private bakeries, insist that sweet is interchangeable with chocolate. It isn't. The low calorie count and high fiber are the best things about these bars, but personally, I would rather do without than accept this as a brownie substitute. If you like sweet treats, however, this might be a good alternate snack for you.

review/summary: Much better things out there.
review/text: Fiber One bars are one of my favorite go-to snacks, so my mother saw these brownies while grocery shopping and bought a box of six for me to try out. They look fantastic on the box cover, but the first thing I noticed was that the box says "chocolate flavored chips", rather than actual chocolate chips. Each brownie is very small, but even worse, they're about as light as a feather, and the texture of the brownie is chalky. The taste is extremely artificial.<br /><br />For what you get, I don't think these are worth 90 calories and 8 grams of sugar added to your daily diet. There are much better quality *real* chocolate treats out there that you can enjoy while sticking to your diet. I gave them two stars because of the fiber and possible kosher benefits (although that doesn't matter to me personally), but these are too low-quality for me to recommend to anyone.

review/summary: These Brownies are..OK.
review/text: I thought the calorie count was good (90 cal) and the fiber count great as well, but I felt the taste was barely above average.  As a few others have pointed out, the chocolate flavor is rather artificial and the texture seemed somewhat gummy to me.  It did satisfy my hunger, though  (perhaps because they aren't overly sweet?).  Much more than other fiber/granola snacks I've purchased.  until something better comes along I will probably buy them again to keep in my desk for a guilt-free 'chocolate emergency' fix even though I'm not crazy about them. (Note: I too bought this box of 38 at Costco for approx $11.  The price shown here is no bargain, and I would definitely lower my rating to 2 or maybe even 1 star if I was paying close to 70 cents for each one!  They are tiny!)

review/text: I found these at my local Costco, so check there if you have trouble finding them.  They are sweet, chocolatey, chewy, but a tad dry.  However, my stomach did not agree with them.  I'm not even lactose intolerant. I thought it could've been something else I ate so I tried them for several days.  It was definitely them.  So I tossed the box.

review/summary: Good enough
review/text: This is a low calorie brownie.  It's not going to taste as good as Ina Garten's brownies that are made with a pound of butter.  However, it is quite good for what it is.  It is a slightly dry, cakey brownie with a stripe of fudge on top and chocolaty chips.  It has a nice but not overpowering sweetness and enjoyable texture.  I think the people who describe this as "soooo good" are exaggerating a bit, but it definitely tastes pretty good for the calorie count.  These are better and easier than the whole wheat "healthy" brownies I've tried to bake when I'm on a sugar rampage, so it's worth the money for me.  It goes well with milk and coffee.

It is lightly salted which allows more the the grain flavors to come through.

review/summary: Wonderful for Acne! (shocking I know)
review/text: I am plagued with adult acne and I have tried most of the stuff out there with little luck so decided to start from the inside out! I took some info various books along with a few other sources and have had success. I began ingesting the following(see below) and by week 3 of this new intake my skin looked amazing! really amazing, glowing I would dare say! Acne is a bummer and is emotional and as a woman I know how awful it really can be! I slowly built up my intake of the following and now consume each thing on this list each day and I swear to you my skin is 95% clear!!<br />1) vitamins: Pantothenic acid, alpha liopic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, acidophilus.<br />2) I ingest tablespoon of organic fish oil (liquid) and flaxseed oil<br />3) I ingest 1 tablespoon of pure organic cocao powder(not coco powder w/ sugar..the real deal like this BRAND)I use in a shake w/ a banana since this stuff can be very bitter.<br />4) 4 cups of organic green tea<br />5) 1 glass of blueberry juice<br />6) topically I use BP each night on my skin and use not a moisturizer but a hydration cream and I cleanse with an over the counter sensitive cleansing liquid.<br />7) for scaring I use topical vitamin c serum each morning<br /><br />I decided on this mix based on several different resources and this combo works wonders for me. I am not sure if one thing is more powerful than another to be honest but I can say that 3 months into this "test" my skin is still looking amazing. I had to share because I know that so many suffer with this horrible condition.

review/text: I ordered this raw cacao powder on the recommendation of a friend.  It is an amazing product, from the health benefits to the awesome chocolatey taste.  I love that it is a raw product with an incredibly high antioxidant content and a large dose of magnesium.  It comes in a resealable package, which is quite handy, and the packing date is always quite recent, so I know I'm getting a fresh food.  Even my local food co-op doesn't carry it, but I know I can always find it on Amazon.
