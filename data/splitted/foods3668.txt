review/summary: Great Product!!!!!
review/text: My animals truly love this stuff. With their old food I was, as often as not, throwing uneaten portions away. This does not happen with this food as my animals are actually wanting to be fed more often. It really is amazing, my male cat will run over to the food bag and meow until I get the animals all fed. You have got to try this stuff for your cats, my small dogs love the stuff also. I am constantly having to keep them from taking over the cat food bowl.

review/summary: Whiskas Indoor cat food
review/text: I previously bought this product at my local grocery store. My cats loved it!! I have always bought Whiskas brand dry cat food, (chicken and turkey flavor). The first time I bought this item I bought 1 bag, the following week I went back and they had 3 bags on the shelve, I purchased 2 bags. I went back the next week and they had none left. I had inquired about when they would be getting more in, and I was told they were not getting any more. I have been searching to find more of the Whiskas indoor dry cat food and had no luck. Until I finally found it on Amazon. I was so happy!!! and so were my 5 cats. I even went as far as calling the Mars company who makes the Whiskas cat dry cat food and they couldn't help me.<br />I sure hope Amazon gets more of this in stock, because I know I will be sure to buy more. When my cats are happy, so am I.  :-)

review/summary: puzzled
review/text: My three young cats are only happy with Whiskas Indoor cat food, so I felt safe ordering the 6 pound bag on line.  Sadly they will not eat the food that was shipped. They cry and looked up at me with hungry eyes. So I have purchased a new bag locally and they are happy cats again. I have no clue why they will not eat it other than it 'MAY' be stale.  It did not sit on my doorstep, I accepted the package immediately on delivery  The only difference I can see is that the local bag is a 3 pound bag, and the 'best by date' is three months later.  I am considering mixing small amounts of the 6lb bag slowly with the 3 pound bag. If that doesn't work I will give it to the local cat shelter.<br /><br />Had they liked it, I would have continued ordering it on line because of the convenience of having it delivered to my door.  It was delivered a day earlier than promised and it was packaged very well. There was no cost savings.

review/text: My cats love this dry food more than others that I have tried. It's like kitty crack to them. I wish it came in bigger bags which would make life easier, less shopping. Also, I find that it is sometimes hard to find this at the grocery or pet store. I'm happy that I found an online source.<br /><br />Also, I have a cat that has a sensitive stomach and pukes up a lot of food but he seems to do well with the Whiskas. Again, Whiskas, bigger bags! That would help us multiple cat owners.

review/summary: Convenience and a competitive price
review/text: I get tire of running to the store to get supplies for my cats, especially since I live 20 miles away from the nearest Walmart and sometimes the winters are not the best. I did a lot of looking around for cat food that I could have delivered that would be appropriate for my cats, and either the same price as it would be at the store (or hopefully cheaper). I am spending the same amount of money that I was before, only I don't have to worry about running out and having to buy an overpriced bag of cat food (often not the brand we normally use) at the grocery store in my small town due to bad roads keeping me from running to Walmart. Both cats love the food, and beg for it when their bowl is empty.  I like knowing that I won't run out so easily , and have the convenience of having it delivered to me.  I did the same with cat treats (subscribe and save), now if only I could find kitty litter that I prefer to use that was affordable to have shipped, but no luck there so far. I keep hoping that Amazon will get more subscribe and save products. I check often (crossing my fingers for the kitty litter that I normally use to show up at a good subscribe and save price)

review/summary: Nasty artificial taste
review/text: Let me start by saying that normally I'm fine with artificial flavor.  And I love all sorts of sugary bad-for-you candies: gummy worms, jelly beans, gumdrops, Boston-style fruit slices, those "orange slices" gumdrop-ish candies, etc.  But these "fruit slices" are vile.  Nothing like Boston-style fruit slices, and not even as good as the gumdrop-based "orange slices" or regular gumdrops.  The best that I can describe them is that they're wedge-shaped oddly textured gumdrops that taste like different flavors of cough syrup -- the red ones taste like cherry cough syrup, the purple ones like grape cough syrup.  The lemon ones aren't as bad, perhaps because they're flavored less strongly, or perhaps because I've never had lemon cough syrup, but they still aren't good, they just might rise as far as "okay".

review/summary: Horrible mixture of flavors, bad texture
review/text: I normally like jellied fruit slices like these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003679TRO">Snak Club Fruit Slices, 7-Ounce Bags,  (Pack of 6)</a>, but the mixture of lemon, lime, orange, cherry and grape is wildly different between bags. In one bag I just got 1 lemon slice, but 8 (!) cherry slices. In another bag, there were 10 (!!!) grape and one of each of the other fruits. The wildly varying flavor assortment is terrible for me, who like all the flavors, but have a couple of favorites (lemon, orange). With some of the bags, after eating my favorites out (1 lemon, 1 orange), I just threw the rest out. Very disappointing!<br /><br />Additionally, these jellied fruits are harder than the ones you're used too, reminding you of chewing waxed lips or candles. Not a very pleasant experience.<br /><br />If you are like me, and love orange the best, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UAD7S">Brach's Orange Slices, 10.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>. They are by far the best orange slices I've eaten - made with real fruit juice and have a soft, easily chewable texture.

review/summary: Better than the competitors
review/text: I love Earth Mama products so I decided to give their Third Trimester Tea a try.  I ordered both Earth Mama and Traditional Medicinals.  There is a big difference between the taste of these two.  While they're both grassy and herby as you would expect, Earth Mama tea has a more pleasant kick to it.  It does not have the bitter aftertaste that Traditional Medicinals has.  I was able to drink Earth Mama without any brown sugar or honey but I had to have something to sweeten Traditional Medicinals.<br /><br />Earth Mama is more expensive but I think it's worth it.  I did not return Traditional Medicinals, I do not hate it, but Earth Mama Third Trimester Tea is definitely better.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they do not list the amounts of each ingredient.  That makes it impossible to make a comparison based on potency of ingredients.  Still, I would recommend this product, and would use it exclusively if I hadn't ordered the other brand already.

review/summary: Tastes Great and I feel better already
review/text: I've done yoga, swam, and eating well to make me feel better for much of the second and early third trimester.  But the third trimester (especially later closer to delivery) has brought on a host of other side effects despite being in good physical health. that's when specialty herbs to deal with pregnancy-specific symptoms such as leg-cramping due to nerves and vessels being under pressure from a large uterus help..and are like night and day for those of us suffering the symptoms.  I switched to a different brand of prenatal vitamins (organic and food-based) that helped reduce many but there were still aches, pains, and bone-crackling... So last night at 38 weeks (after being reluctant to use this tea as one reviewer claims it induced her labor), I tried this tea hot with a half-tablespoon of organic, raw honey (oh, the flavor is heaven with this combination!).  Wow, this tea not only tastes real good, but has further alleviated almost all the remaining symptoms (except pressure on my pelvis due to carrying a large baby). My head was cleared, I became calm and relaxed, all those aches around the uterus were minimized, and my uterus feels more stiff and able to hold its own, rather than a very soft sack that was jostling around my bones and other organs.  I'm typically not into herbs too much, but was desperate to relieve my discomfort and pains with natural things that have been used for a while and don't seem to harm the baby from word-of-mouth from midwives, and this seems to do the trick.  I'll be taking this everyday until I deliver (maximum in one and a half weeks).

review/summary: Fresh Ingredients and No Fillers!
review/text: They have been a wonderful company to work with and I can tell that their customer service is excellent. They truly care about the quality of their product and the satisfaction of customers (and bloggers like myself!)<br /><br />Freshness<br /><br />Shipping for the product was fast. The first thing that struck me was the aroma as I was opening the shipping package. I could immediately sort out the mint and raspberry tea blend. It was a clear sign to me that their teas are fresh.<br /><br />Inside the product box, the 16 tea bags were sealed in two small plastic bags (each containing 8 bags), preserving the freshness of half of your stash until it's time to open the second set.<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />Reading through the ingredients, this tea contains no flavorings, just pure natural herbs. All of the herbs contained in Earth Mama Third Trimester Tea are beneficial for pregnancy - red raspberry, spearmint, stinging nettle, oatstraw, chamomile, rosehips, and alfalfa - all 100% certified organic by the FDA. Red Raspberry Leaf is the first ingredient and there are no fillers!<br /><br />The hint of mint is a nice thouch for those who do not like drinking straight Red Raspberry Leaf Tea. It also opens the sinuses - an added benefit if you struggle with stuffiness or other sinus problems during pregnancy.<br /><br />Benefits<br /><br />As if I wasn't already thrilled with my box of Third Trimester Tea, it also came with a coupon on the inside of the box for 50 cents off my next box.<br /><br />I find this tea calming and relaxing. Anytime I am feeling stressed, I know that a cup will put me at ease.<br /><br />I have very little criticisms of Earth Mama Angel Baby Third Trimester Tea (and I always look for something!) There are no tags on the tea bags (for hanging over the side of your cup), which is not a big deal in my opinion.<br /><br />Review originally published at:  NaturalFamilyToday.com<br /><br />Disclaimer: Earth Mama Angel Baby provided this product for my review at no cost.

review/text: I've been drinking red raspberry leaf tea throughout my pregnancy after my midwife recommended it for cramping and it really helped.  I got sooooo tired of straight red raspberry leaf though so I decided to try this one instead.  I'm not a huge mint fan, so I was a little worried since this has spearmint that I wouldn't like it,  but it's only a hint of mint, so I don't mind it.  I'm especially happy that it has stinging nettles in it since I worry about my iron levels and have heard nettles help.

review/summary: Induced my labor.
review/text: I drank this tea at the end of my 3rd trimester (9th month). This tea has a high concentration of Red Rasberry tea leaves. It is known to induce labor during the third trimester and it did. I was three days past my babies due date when I drank a cup of this tea at midnight. I went into labor 4 hours later.<br /><br />My doula didn't think this tea induced labor but I believe it did because I started having slight cramping after I finished one cup of this tea. I went to sleep and woke up 4 hours later with mild cramping which quickly turned into contractions. My baby was born at 11 AM ...natural childbirth.<br /><br />Good stuff to have around if you are past your due date. Doesn't taste as good as the Peaceful Mama tea though.

review/text: I have been drinking this tea every night just for the benefits it claims to produce. However it is a little bland tasting. I usually don't add sugar and just drink it quickly but I was a little disappointed that it isn't more flavorful considering all of the natural herbs it contains. This is just one of those things where you won't really know if it worked or not, but the price was good and I'll continue drinking it every night. By the way I thought the price was for one box, but you get three boxes which will cover you for the entire third trimester. It also says to drink several times a day, but I've only been drinking it once every night.

review/summary: Amazing Bundt Cakes!
review/text: I received a Red Velvet Bundt Cake from FantasiCakes!  It was delivered by UPS and showed up in perfect condition.  It was packed really well to assure that it came that way.  I opened the box and my son insisted that we sample it right away.  I honestly wasn't going to argue and didn't need any convincing because it looked so good!  The Red Velvet Bundt Cake comes with a container of cream cheese icing that you can put on the top of the cake too!  I like that you have control of putting that on.  I sliced some cake up and it was so good!  It has a really good flavor.  This is some of the best red velvet cake I have ever had.  The cake itself is very moist.  The cake was not too sweet and I love the icing.  The icing wasn't too sweet either.  My son inhaled his slice in seconds.  I also gave my husband a slice yesterday.  I want to start out by saying that my husband rarely eats sweets.  He is one of the pickiest eaters that I know.  He loved the cake.  He even said it had such a good flavor.  He said he liked that it didn't have an artificial flavor.  He loved this cake so much that he ate 2 slices in a day.  Have you ever had red velvet cake?  Red Velvet cake is actually a chocolate flavored cake, but it's very mild tasting.<br /><br />I received a sample product to review for my blog.  All opinions are completely my own.

Number 7 labeled plastic is the worst plastic you can possibly use.  It is being recommended by health officials to avoid products packaged with these containers.  This story was aired on Good Morning America.  I had just purchased about 20 packages of this baby food for my daughter and immediately threw every one away.  This makes me very concerned that Gerber is not fixing this problem.

review/summary: Cat Scanned - Lab Tested - REJECTED
review/text: I got this for my older cats based on vets recommendation (type of food, not necessarily this brand/flavor).  My cats love tuna, salmon and mackeral (people food---fresh and/or canned) so I got the salmon flavor to try first.<br />I put it out in the morning expecting howls of delight.  What I got was two cats who sniffed and refused to even taste this stuff.<br /><br />I left it out all day in hopes that hunger would drive them to at least try it.  They went all day without a taste.<br /><br />I gave up and put it in my labrador's bowl (in other words into the garbage disposal...LOL!). He sniffed it and turned away from it.  Left it there for two more hours and he would not touch it. In nine years I have never had my lab refuse to eat something, and have been grossed out by some things he has chosen to eat.<br />Went to pet store after this experiment and got five other brands of fish based food.  Both cats ate all other brands even though they would much prefer real fish (based on how slowly they ate the canned vs how fast they scarf the real deal).<br /><br />Wish I knew what was in this that grossed out my pets!

We get the special diet stuff to help him avoid urinary crystals, and he hasn't had any urinary issues since he's been eating this. I love the Subscribe & Save option for this! We just have a few different flavors on staggered shipping schedules to mix things up a bit, and it's the cheapest price around.

review/summary: Best non-sugar sweetener I've tried
review/text: First of all, nothing tastes exactly like sugar. Having said that, however, I give this product high marks because it tastes good and I don't detect any aftertaste or bitterness when I use it. I made peach cobbler and it was excellent. A simple blueberry conserve made with fresh berries, Ideal and maybe a little cinnamon and/or amaretto liqueur is just marvelous with toast at breakfast or a pancake and is actually way better than sugary jam in my opinion. It doesn't sweeten tea as well as it works in baked goods (not sure why), and if I put it in yoghurt, it takes a couple of minutes to dissolve properly. Ideal does have a small amount of maltodextrin and sucralose. Maybe that is why it tastes just a little better and I prefer it overall to straight xylitol products. Not many stores carry it in my area but it is worth ordering online. I am diabetic so this has worked very well for me. This type of "alcohol sugar" product (xylitol) was approved by my diet counsellors at our local hospital educational unit.

review/text: Was looking for a bouillon that was not full of MSG etc and this had a great review.  But I wasn't expecting it all to be in one pot; I assumed it would be packaged differently.  As it is, it has to be stored in the 'fridge and I'm wondering if I'll get through it all before it goes bad.<br /><br />I also had some arithmetic to do figuring out how much to use to 2.25 cups of liquid to make a risotto...would have been convenient if it had given that info more readily, and be aware it has a strong brown color.  That doesn't bother me, I still put it in my chicken noodle soup, but it might annoy some.

review/summary: Light and Tasty "Healthy" Cereal
review/text: Honey Nut Cheerios are perhaps my all-time favorite cereal.  There's just something about them that reminds me of being a "kid" (hey, I'm still a kid!) and they just fill me with comfort!  Unfortunately for me, I'm also a very disciplined eater -- what my mom likes to call "a health nut" -- and there's usually not much room in my diet for a heaping big bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios.  Darn it!<br /><br />After doing some research on "healthy cereals" I decided to give the Cascadian Farms Honey Nut O's a try.  I didn't have particularly high hopes for the taste before I cracked open the box.  After all, how can you expect a healthy alternative to compete with your all-time favorite cereal? But, surprisingly the Honey Nut O's are a very light and delightful snack.  I ate them dry and with a bit of skim milk and I must say I prefer them dry.  They are a bit smaller than Honey Nut Cheerios and not nearly as resilient when it comes to soaking up the milk (i.e. they go soggy really fast!).  As other reviewers have mentioned, they are not nearly as sweet as Honey Nut Cheerios, however, they have a very authentic and light honey flavor.  In other words, they taste more "real".  The grain texture is also very nice and has a satisfying crunch while still being soft. (I hate cereals that rough up the inside of your mouth).<br /><br />All things considered, I definitely recommend the Cascadian version of my all-time favorite.  While I don't get the same warm cozy comfort as the Honey Nut Cheerios, I do enjoy them as healthy small-portion snack.  A small container of this cereal definitely beats eating pre-processed cereal bars or something similar which is filled with fat and soy ingredients.<br /><br />For those of you who are looking for something to sate your Honey Nut Cheerio craving, you'll probably want to pass on these and just go for the real deal :)

review/summary: Give me an O...
review/text: ...for Oustanding!  Amazon has outdone themselves on this one!<br /><br />I tried this cereal some time ago and loved it. I much prefer it to Cheerios and could never go back now. It was the fist truly healthy cereal I've ever really liked.  I looked for it on and off at my local grocery stores and while I could find some other varieties of CF cereal, I could never find the O's.<br /><br />When I got the "cholesterol talk" from my doctor recently, I sent my search into high gear and finally found one  box at a small natural-foods type store that had recently opened and I plunked down nearly five bucks for it.  (Despite being on a tight budget, I figured lowering my cholesterol was worth it.)<br /><br />But then it dawned on me to search here and voila, Amazon not only had the cereal in stock, but at a much better price!  Naturally, I did the "subscribe and save" option, which brought my cost down to just $3 a box.  That's a bargain for any full-size box of cereal, but that it is organic and healthful whole grain (for the good ol' cholesterol-lowering) makes it that much more of a bargain!<br /><br />So, I ran out of O's Wednesday,  ordered after 8 p.m. that night, and the order was here Friday morning!  In time for breakfast! I probably wouldn't have even added them to my grocery list this quickly, much less gone out and bought them already. That's an awesome turn-around time for a subscription order (So far most of my S&S orders have been noticeably slower to arrive than the regular 2-day shipping.).<br /><br />Lastly, some of my inital grocery orders had disappointingly-close expiration dates, but each box is a good eight months away, so that's reasonable ... and they will be long gone by then!

review/summary: Great balsamic for the price
review/text: There are different levels of balsamic vinegar.  The "tradizionale" is consortium-approved and is generally over $100 for a four to five ounces and could be over $500 for a tiny amount.  The next level is the "condimento balsamico" which is not consortium approved, but is about half the price or less than the previous type.  The last level is "Aceto Balsamico di Modena", which can be really bad and there are no controls over what goes into it (artificial coloring, etc.).<br /><br />That being said, Fondo Carrate vinegar is producted from grapes grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides of any kind. Organically grown and produced exclusively from ancient D.O.C. Lambrusco varieties of the Mastri, Salamino and Sorbara grapes.  It is 12 years old and aged in oak.  Very smooth, sweet, but tangy.  It really is a fine vinegar, especially for the price.  You can get it for a bit less than $32 from other distributors, but I'm not sure how the shipping compares.  Check around -- it's definitely worth finding a supplier for this stuff.

review/summary: The jury is still out....
review/text: Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me.

review/summary: No more cramps!
review/text: I had been waking up with cramps in my feet and calves.  I only used one scoop in my juice once a day and this product stopped the cramps within a couple days.<br /><br />I recently ran out of the Natural Calm and started using Source Naturals Magnesium Malate (I had bought both products so I could compare the two).  Within a week the cramps are back.  I also have been getting restless legs at night, which I had forgotten about when I was taking the Natural Calm.  I'm ordering more Natural Calm now.

Got pills and was not taking them regularly because i generally don't like taking pills.  A friend had this product, and after i tried it,was hooked.  Just add to water and it is delicious!

review/summary: Fibromyalgia
review/text: I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word "magnesium" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.

review/summary: Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon magnesium is good for regularity
review/text: I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon 16 oz</a> as a magnesium supplement to help me absorb calcium better because I was diagnosed with osteopenia--precursor to osteoporosis.  I will have to wait until my next bone density test in about a year and a half to find out if adding this readily absorbed magnesium product has helped my bones.  In the mean time, however, it has helped with my chronic constipation.  I had been using stool softeners for the past couple of years and this works much better.  It is a powder which you mix in a cup of hot water and stir.  I usually take 5 grams (a heaping teaspoon) once a day.  After it is dissolved, I add a little cold water so I can drink it quickly, although it does taste good.

I have taken magnesium supplements in various forms in hopes that they would help me get to sleep and stay asleep.  Natural Calm is the only supplement that has helped with my insomnia.  Every evening, I have a mug with a heaping teaspoon of Natural Calm in some water.  It really does help with my ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep all night.  I used to lie in bed and wait to fall asleep, sometimes for hours.  Now I can't even remember trying to get to sleep.  This product is wonderful!

review/summary: Good, but FAR TOO SWEET!!
review/text: I use this to calm my generally overactive system, deal with stress and sleep better, and it's not unpleasant. It's sweetened with Stevia, which I prefer to any other sweetener. One star off: it's horribly SWEET!! Most American-made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste, but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened. I'll use it, but I wish there were another, less sweet and more natural flavor available. How about, say, mango or grape...?

review/text: I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money.

review/text: This stuff is truly amazing. Previously I had chemotherapy and the drugs took just about all the hormones away, hence giving me hot flashes. Calm helped to restore the balance and get me back on track, since I was kind of young for menopause. It has also taken my monthly cycle from 30-45 days right down to 28 days. It really is a great product. Magnesium is also wonderful for helping the body absorb calcium. I have been taking it for almost 8 months and I wouldn't think of stopping.

Not the kind of thing that knocks you out when you take it, but if you pay attention you can feel it.<br /><br />The great thing about the calcium is it is a great way to help sustain and maintain weight loss. This is the best flavor they offer no doubt about it.

It is really tart, slightly orange tasting, and I have a hard time getting it down. I have to chug it quickly. I'd rather take a pill and get it over with quickly. Just blech. I'd rather take Bluebonnet Calcium/Mag Vit D liquid, and that is a thick goopy liquid but I only need 2 TB of it. This is just hard drinking a whole glass. Aside from the texture/sense issue, the product works well, and I don't get restless legs at night. It does help me sleep and I am in a better mood since taking it.

review/summary: GREAT STOOL SOFTENER!
review/text: I do not get the calm relaxing better sleeping side effects from this. What I do get though is something that keeps my bowels regular. I take a medicine that causes heavy constipation, some users resort to taking laxatives every day which is addictive and dangerous. This is the best thing to clear you out and move things along. I've had two children and they send you home with a stool softener (Collace for me) and this works far better than collace. I started out about a week on just one large teaspoon. I was very bloated and backed up the entire time, it wasn't really doing much, then I upped to two large teaspons, without being graphic, it completely fixed my problem, although there were a few times if I hadn't been very close to a bathroom it could have resulted in a very traumatizing event. I don't think it tastes bad at all, I enjoy the warm drink in the evening, I put honey in mine, and use the natural one.

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: Our chiropractor recommended Natural Calm for more muscle relaxation and deeper sleep - and my entire family takes it.  We've adjusted the dose for our 10 y/o downward (1/4 t. per day) and that's been better for him, but for my husband and me, the 1/2 t. dose is just right.  :)<br /><br />Our child has benefitted from it in that when he sleeps more deeply and doesn't wake easily, he has better days in lessons and is better able to focus.  That alone would make me re-purchase this product!  :)<br /><br />When we take it, we sleep better, more deeply, and if(when) we get up in the night to use the restroom, we don't struggle to fall back asleep - sleep is just *there*.  :)  I've also found that my "side stitches" - where the muscles at my ribcage contract and pull (it's uncomfortable) - go away when I take NC.  That's a beautiful side effect from taking it - and one I didn't expect.  My husband's infamous "Charley Horses" that wrack his legs with pain are virtually gone, too - and adding the NC has been the only change in his habits, so it's not like he's attributing the lack of cramps to anything else he's doing.<br /><br />I'm also a PCOS patient, which means I trend towards overproducing insulin.  With that, comes rough elbows and ridiculously dry skin - the NC has helped in that area as well.  My normal moisturizer doesn't touch my elbow-roughness, but the NC takes care of it on its own.  w00t!<br /><br />We like the lemon-raspberry flavour as well - it's like a hot lemonade in a mug.  :)<br /><br />All in all, we'll definitely be ordering more - I don't ever want to be without this supplement!

review/text: Before I  bought this I read all the reviews and they are all pretty accurate. It's a great product. I take 1.5 tsp twice a day once in the morning and once at night. It helped me sleep better, it made going to the bathroom easier, I wasn't craving junk food as much as usual (I'm usually pretty healthy about what I eat), and I just felt better in general. Great product I would give it 10 stars if I could!

review/summary: The cure for charlie horses!
review/text: I was looking for Mag Citrate in a fast-acting form that didn't taste terrible, and I found it in this product. I have a history of HypoMag including severe muscle spasms and prolonged charlie horses. I haven't had one charlie horse since starting on the mag...I am so thankful! Magnesium is a natural muscle relaxer and a vital mineral for bone and muscle health. I wish it was a little more affordable (because I have to use more of it than the average person) but I do plan to buy it again whenever possible.
