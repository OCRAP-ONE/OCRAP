review/summary: Dogs Luv 'em
review/text: I ordered two boxes of these bones for my commercial kennel.  I chose the Sportmix products because I was assured by their customer service rep (who responded to my inquiry within the hour) that the ingredients and manufacturing are US-based.  I do not purchase foreign pet food ingredients - particularly China-made pet products.  I am thoroughly happy with the apparent palatability of the bones.  The dogs fall over each other to get one.  I am a little dissatisfied with the condition of many of the bones - about 20% of them are broken due to packaging.  They are not stacked - just loosely placed in the box to be knocked around during delivery.  This is the only thing I can fault, though.  Otherwise, a fair priced, quality, USA MADE product.

review/summary: medium-grade tea with no distinctive apricot taste
review/text: [Edit to add: A friend stayed at my house for a week recently and said "This is the most delicious tea I've ever had in my life."  She's a huge tea fan, so that is definitely saying something.  So, I've upped my star rating to a 4 (that's the average of my opinion (3) and her opinion (5)).  In light of her reaction, this tea may well be worth a try.]<br /><br />Original review:<br />I live in Japan where we drink oolong tea daily.  I usually buy my flavored teas in the US, because here in Japan they emphasize the aroma of the tea as it is brews rather than the taste, whereas in the US they emphasize the quality of the taste over the quality of the aroma.  This offers nothing outstanding in either area.  The aroma is present but nothing fantastic, and I can't taste the apricot in this at all.<br /><br />This is an upper medium-grade oolong tea, not the delicate high-grade Chinese oolong I was expecting at this price.  This is important because oolong tea is stunning when high-grade, perfectly nasty when low-grade, and merely OK when medium-grade.  It's upper medium-grade, so still very good, but not the stunning flavor I was expecting at this price.  (On reflection, perhaps the high price comes from the fact that it is organic, rather than from using only the highest-grade tea leaves.)<br /><br />Visually all the teas from this series are very appealing and they are ready to give "as is" if you need a housewarming gift, gift for your child's teacher, etc.  The package closes securely so you don't need to worry about the tea leaves not keeping well.

review/summary: My family loves this.
review/text: We purchased this from Amazon as our local store was only carrying this occasionally. It is the exact same product. It is a fast dinner that you can throw in a crock pot and do the rest when you get home. My family loves this. We have a problem, half the family cannot have dairy products, so we make the first part which is dairy free. Then we split it in two and add the sour cream to the one half. Both ways are very good. I chop the mushrooms finely and our picky eaters never know they are in there. I put the entire thing over egg noodles to complete the meal. We usually use two packets to make a double recipe because it gets eaten so fast. We never have any left overs. I highly recommend this product. McCormick has a real winner here.

review/text: This green tea has a nice robust but complex flavor that can be enjoyed hot or cold. Some green teas have a good flavor, like Stash green tea, but the flavor is very subtle and simple so you don't get the full green tea experience. This tea is very refreshing, and calming even. Green tea has one of the most potent antioxidants known to man, EGCG, it also has L-Theanine which is a unique, calming amino acid found almost exclusively in green tea. As is mentioned in the detailed info, the teabags are entirely compostable.

review/summary: Black Tea is Beautiful!  The Jewel in Lipton's Crown
review/text: I love tea and have been a tea drinker since childhood. When I had my first sip of tea, I knew tea was for me!<br /><br />Lipton was the tea I was introduced to many years ago.  As one of the few tea drinkers in a family of coffee drinkers, Lipton and I go back a long ways.  Over the years, I have gotten to know and love many other brands and flavors of tea.  If you want a good, healthy staple, then you want to drink this tea.<br /><br />I love oolang; white, black, green, and herbal tea.  I found that this tea is quite good, iced or piping hot and fresh in your tea pot.  I love it!  Black tea also has many health properties and I highly recommend black tea.  It is very soothing and if you are drinking your black tea while listening to some soothing George Harrison, it doesn't get any better than that!  It is an ideal stress buster and a nice part of your day.<br /><br />Excellent tea.  I highly recommend it!

review/text: I am a big drinker of tea but even for a quick brew, Lipton is made from substandard parts of the Tea plant also including the leaves. As a red rose tea the richness of color and flavor can be compared by buying other loose Tea brands and brewing the exact weight vs. Lipton. Cut the bag open and compare it with a bag of Tetley or Brooke Bond or Taj Mahal for that matter to confirm. No offense to Lipton lovers; I prefer Quality over Quantity. Enjoy your Tea otherwise :)

review/text: I must admit I love my Jasmine Tea (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RTNBSA">Ito En Jasmine Japanese Green Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> but I can't down more than a bottle of it a day, it gets a bit cloying if I do.<br />So I switch over to this old standby and I can drink a gallon of it a day.  One tea bag will honestly make an entire gallon if you have a jar that big and let it steep for a few minutes.<br /><br />I live in a very hot humid subtropical environment and we all love our iced tea here.  I don't use sugar but I mix in so much lemon juice it's almost half lemonaid.  And it must be ice cold.  This can be watered down or made very strong depending on your taste.  I like mine on the watery side.  This can be a bit acidic if you make it strong.  It is a very strong tea with a strong flavor so making it weak works well with this.<br /><br />I probably have a dozen types of teas on my shelf but along with my daily bottle of jasmine tea I drink this the most.<br />It has a distinctive flavor I never get tired of.  It's almost like a comfort food to me, as I grew up drinking<br />Lipton Tea.  It's  been around forever.  Constant Comment <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRHG">Bigelow Constant Comment Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>is another old standby tea worth trying.

review/text: I don't know why anyone would buy the American version of Lipton tea when there are so many good black teas available. If you want to experience a good tea that creates a good strong flavor and aroma without any bitterness try PG Tips. In only 2 minutes a single bag of PG Tips in 8 to 10 oz of water will create a brew that will make you forget about any American tea brand.

review/text: Though I like various types of tea, Lipton fills a niche at certain times. The case of tea bags will last me forever and the price was so good that I had to take advantage of it.<br /><br />For breakfast, I usually drink my Lipton hot with a touch of lemon. I enjoy ice tea and Lipton has always been my favorite. Other times, I drink Earl Grey, Chinese black tea, or Japanese green when the moment arises.<br /><br />At best, I will have a long time to drink Lipton black tea thanks to this deal,

I decided to go for some black tea bags this time. It was now what I had hoped and dreamed about at all. These tea bag were weak. They were small and didn't satisfy my longing for a moist, sensational, musty, and delicious tea bag.

review/summary: Crunchy. Tasty. Good Nutrients. Nice Snack.
review/text: I'm always looking for snacks that might be tasty and nutritionally good at the same time. A month or so ago I found "Majans Bhuja Cracker Mix" and liked it very much. As such I continued looking and found "Majans Buja Original Mix. It's a rather similar assortment of rice crackers, crisp noodles, green peas, peanuts, and sultanas. Plus, there's an assortment of flavors and other minor ingredients. It's crunchy and  chewy and tastes good. The calories are not particularly high and the snack has a good protein and fiber content. It's low fat with no cholesterol. The sodium content is fairly low. Nice mixture of characteristics. One thing I might add that this snack is fairly filling. I've had little tendency to eat the whole bag at one sitting such as I can often do with potato chips and things of that sort. It's a product of Australia. I discovered it in a nearby Fresh and Easy Store, which happens to be and English company. It's good to find a few snacks like this and Bhuja come in several varieties, juist in case you like to switch around a bit. I find these a bit spicy and prefer the other variety I had.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: This Ghirardelli Mint Chocolate tastes really good.  The chocolate isn't too sweet nor too bitter. It is also not too creamy or milky. As far as the mint filling, it adds some more sweetness to the Chocolate, but at the same time the mint is very refreshing. Perfect to have after dinner or as dessert.<br /><br />If you like Mint Chocolate, you might also want to try the After Eight Mint Chocolate. they are very good too.  Also try the Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark Chocolate which is kind of interesting taste (a combination of chocolate/dark chocolate with white chocolate and peppermint crust).

review/summary: Smells Good
review/text: The conditioner smells good.  I know because when I opened the box, the product was all over the contents.  Even though the bottle was in a plastic bag, it had leaked through the bag.  It took a while before I discovered why it leaked.  The bottle had a large crack in it.  About 1/8 of the contents of the bottle filled the bag and leaked into the box.  It appears the bottle had the crack before it was shipped because the box did not show any signs of having been crushed or anything.  I haven't used it yet, since it just arrived.  I would send it back but with the damaged bottle, there would just be more leaking and it might damage something else.  Fortunately, I was able to rinse the rest of the contents off and there was no damage.  The crack is not very noticeable with the bottle being in the bag. I can see why it was missed. I am just glad I did not have anything that would have been ruined.  I hate returning products.

review/summary: 13 flavors, nice sampler, long use by dates, great for K-cup starter
review/text: I received this as a gift for xmas 2011. I also posted a picture of the sampler. There are 13 flavors included in this 20 tea sampler:<br /><br />2 - Celestial Seasonings lemon zinger<br />2 - Celestial Seasonings Green tea with white tea for smooth taste<br />2 - Gloria Jean's Peppermint Herbal*<br />2 - Twinings Pure Peppermint<br />2 - Timothy's English Breakfast*<br />2 - Bigelow Mint Medley*<br />2 - Green Mountain Naturals Hot Apple Cider<br />1 - Twinings English Breakfast<br />1 - Twinings African Rooibos Red<br />1 - Twinings Pure Camomile<br />1 - Twinings Earl Grey<br />1 - Bigelow Orange & Spice Herb*<br />1 - Timothy's Lemon Blueberry Passion*<br /><br />* does not specifically indicate decaf on the package -- this is a little concerning to me. The others indicate that they are caffeine free or decaf. So, I am not sure that I'd safely claim that those 5 are truly decaf.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a decent sampler. The packaging was nice for a gift...with 4 recipes printed inside the box (although they didn't correlate with the teas in the box). I would have preferred a little less duplication...how about 20 different teas!? We are just starting out with a Keurig, so wanted to try samplers first. I bet that almost every box that goes out is different. So, I'd likely buy again (and hope that there is less peppermint options if it's not holiday time, but that's just personal preference!). Not sure if Tazo or Traditional Medicinals makes K-cups, but would love to see some of those in the box! Was also happy to see apple cider in the box.<br /><br />Also important to note, the use by dates on the teas range from 4/12 to 2/13!<br /><br />4 stars for nice packaging, decent variety, and long use by dates. Would give 5 stars for 20 different teas!!

I was quite embarrassed when my wife opened the box and the K-cups were just thrown in the cardboard box.  An earlier reviwer's comments regarding the deceptive wording about the packaging apply here.  At least our adult children that were over for the holidays got quite a laugh out of it.  Upon inspection, it was noticed that not all of the K-cups contained decaf tea.  I will not be purchasing from this vendor again.  The reader of this review would be better served going elsewhere.

Not that big a deal though, really.<br />This would be a good "coffee mess" purchase for a work environment.<br />Same applies to coffee sampler which I also purchased.

review/text: I've read only raving reviews about this matcha and the order couldn't come any sooner! The second you open the bag, the cheesecake-y goodness fills your nose. I decided to make it into a latte with soy milk and opted to not add sugar so I could get the full taste of the matcha. After less than a minute of whisking, the matcha created a nice blanket of foam. The first sip was heavenly and after adding some agave, the cheesecake flavor popped even more. This has become one of my favorite matchas and I'm excited to mix it with other flavors and make signature flavored cheesecakes.

review/text: I've heard great, great things about this matcha and I couldn't wait to try it. But real life stepped in and I didn't have the time to give it the attention it deserved, so, well, I had to wait to try. But I wait no more! Today I got to mix up my first frothy cup of cheesecake matcha goodness. I was stuck at the location I hate at work, so I desperately needed a thermos of matcha comfort and boy oh boy was I not let down! This is amazing stuff. Creamy and just that touch of tang found in a good cheesecake....yum. One of my specialities around this time of year is a pumpkin cheesecake....nom. I can't wait to mix this with a touch of Pumpkin Pie matcha and see how they go together.<br /><br />Oh cheesecake, I have missed you desperately. Cream cheese is one of those things I absolutely cannot have or I'll be ill for days, so cheesecake is, unfortunately permanently off my menu. But with a little beauty like this in my tea cupboard, I find I don't mind nearly as much! I want to try mixing this with all of the flavors in the Red Leaf Tea catalogue, and I'm sure every one of them would be delicious!

review/summary: Can't go wrong with cheesecake.
review/text: Cheesecake matcha basically sounds like a dream come true. I'm not sure why I didn't order this with my first order. If I can get matcha that will satisfy my cheesecake craving without all the calories, I am definitely going to try it!<br /><br />I received this with my order of tiramisu and caramel, and although it had the least distinctive smell and flavour, it definitely still had an authentic cheesecakey-ness that was so worth it. I think the best part of this was that it wasn't just matcha that tasted like cheesecake - it tastes like what I imagine matcha-flavoured cheesecake would taste like (I haven't ventured into the world of baking with matcha because I am the only one who would eat it and I really don't need to eat an entire batch of cookies, cheesecake, etc. By myself!).<br /><br />Sweet, but not too sweet, with that little hint of tanginess that you get from cream cheese, this is a perfect after-dinner tea. I am going to make it again and do a better job - I had it iced the first time, and I think that is how I will prefer it, but it wasn't quite cold enough. I took it to work in my timolino and forgot to put ice cubes in!  That will be a necessity next time. I can't wait to mix this with a few other flavours!

review/text: Okay so let's break this down to if you like cheesecake but don't want the extra pounds then this is perfect for you! I wasn't quite sure about ordering this one as I wasn't sure if I would like the cheesecake flavour... well I'm glad I did add this one to my cart as it was worth every cent. I make this one half matcha half milk and I've been adding marshmallows it makes it a bit more fun (and fancy!) The cost is reasonable the company's customer service is fantastic. There is no reason you can't order this tasty treat right now :D Just writing about it makes me want another cup :D

review/text: I love this matcha every bit as much as I thought I would. I have tried three flavoured matchas from Red Leaf, and they are quickly becoming my favourite beverages.<br /><br />This particular matcha has a full, creamy flavour and texture. You can almost even taste the cream cheese tang. There's also a bit of cookie-crust going on here, which I love!<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I was delighted with the aroma. It smells sweet and decadent, almost reminded me of matcha ice cream! Must be the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake flavour combined with that familiar, distinctive matcha scent I know and love.<br /><br />This one has become a staple for me, and although there are lots of different flavours I'd love to try, I know I'll always make sure to have some of this on hand. It is so delicious and versatile.

review/summary: Perfection in a cup!
review/text: It has been far too long since I've had some matcha so I decided that tonight would be as good as any to remedy that situation. This cheesecake matcha is seriously smooth and has a very strong aroma that makes me want to double check and make sure there isn't any actual cheesecake somewhere in my kitchen. I've had this matcha several times now and each time this flavor is spot on to a real, creamy cheesecake. You can find out more about this matcha here (and pick up some for yourself!):[...]<br /> Initially, I tried this matcha traditionally in my chawan and it was creamy and rich. I was pleasantly surprised that the color was a vibrant green instead of being muddled by the flavoring. Even though the cheesecake flavor is front and center, it is tempered nicely with a smooth, fresh matcha aftertaste that prevents the flavor from being cloying. The matcha also whisked up quite well with no noticeable clumps and I didn't even sift it!<br /><br /> After the initial success with this matcha, I couldn't wait to try it as a hot cheesecake latte. Although the thought of hot liquid cheesecake is not necessarily my idea of a great treat, I was confident that the quality of Red Leaf Tea's product would not let me down. With a bit of sugar and the addition of warm milk, this latte was so great! I downed it in no time flat and had to make another immediately.<br /><br /> Tonight, I'm having this as a cold iced matcha with a teensy bit of sugar and enough milk to complete the cup. The flavor seems to really pop when prepared this way and I'm certainly wondering how I made it for so many days without drinking this or any other of the great flavors from Red Leaf Tea. A couple of weeks ago I made a delicious matcha cake and I think it would be amazing with this cheesecake flavor as the base! Now to figure out what the next flavor I'll try will be...

review/summary: Dreams really do come true!
review/text: Okay, I was wracking my brain to think of which matcha I had left to review. I actually had to go into my cupboard and sort my Recently Added to figure it out... it was CHEESECAKE! How could I forget?! I've been drinking this glorious Matcha almost every day, not even kidding. I know it'll be the first I run out of and the first I run back to order more of! I might get a tin just for this one, because I know it will be in my cupboard forever. Dear Red Leaf Tea, never stop making matcha!!!! Love, your adoring fans!<br /><br />I have had 2 amazing cheesecakes in my life. One was purchased on a trip to Vancouver from the market on Granville Island. It was tiny. It was expensive. It was amazing! The second was this week from a place called Broadway Cheesecake (something like that) here in Halifax. They have so freaking many kinds of cheesecake, it is crazy! 8 bucks a piece, but the pieces are HUGE. Why am I telling you this? Because this matcha trumps them. It puts the power of cheesecake into my little hands, adds green tea powder to make it amazing, and tastes like heaven on earth!<br /><br />That may seem a little dramatic, but it's the only way I know how to truly show how much I appreciate this matcha in my cupboard. The taste is tangy, thick and a bit sweet. If you add sugar it has the decadence of a perfect cream cheese icing. If you add milk (I tried 2%, almond and vanilla soy) it's a slice from a fine bakery (or cheesecake from home, arguably the best kind!). If you drink it hot - it's fresh from the oven! Iced? It's a perfectly chilled and dense New York piece from the fridge. I could go on, but I guess what I'm trying to say is: Any way you slice it, this Cheesecake Matcha is the best of the best - it has the power to turn my crappy tired morning into an awesome day. Just sayin'.<br /><br />One of the best features of this flavour (and many of the other dessert matchas) is that you get the delicious taste of a rich cheesecake without the tummy-ache and super full and heavy feeling. I won't say without the "guilt" because I am highly against self shaming, especially in the food department. With that in mind - this tea doesn't completely replace a cheesecake. I'll still eat my fair share of cheesecake! What this tea DOES do is let you have cheesecake every day - even if your tummy is full or your wallet is empty! THAT my friends, is the magic of matcha :D<br /><br />Thanks for reading this ramble. I'm kind of passionate, can you tell? ;)

review/text: WOW is this stuff good! The cheesecake flavor really comes through, adding a creamy decadence to the cup along with cheesecake's signature tang and even a little bit of crusty goodness. It doesn't overwhelm the matcha flavor but balances with it, making this sweet treat not overly dessert-y but great for drinking any time of day. It's great straight or as an iced latte, perfect for a mid-afternoon pick me up! All the taste, none of the calories--what more could you want?

review/text: Another winner from Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />The smell of the this particular matcha is tangy and slightly sweet, even though there's no sugar added to the flavoring.  I prepared this my usual way - cold latte style.  Two ounces of warmed water with a teaspoon of matcha and a half teaspoon of super-fine sugar - wisk until blended.  I didn't try sifting the matcha this time, and it frothed up very nicely without any clumping.  Six ounces of cold, creamy whole milk and the taste was so smooth and creamy with a bit of tang - just how I like my cheesecake to be!<br /><br />After my first cup as a cold latte, I went for a second cup  - this time as a warmed, straight matcha.  The tang and creaminess are much less noticable the second time around, but the matcha base is much more prevalent.  As the cup cools, the tangy taste comes to the forefront with the matcha and the creaminess lags behind.  It's kind of like having two very different teas, which is pretty awesome for just buying the one!  A creamy, dessert-like cup of tangy cheesecake with milk/dairy alternative or a green tea with a little tang - it's up to whatever kind of mood you're in!

review/summary: Cheesecake, anyone?  Why, YES please!!!
review/text: I've tried this prepared a couple of different ways now.  The first time I prepared it, I prepared it the way I would most Matcha - in the traditional way in my chawan (tea bowl) and whisking it until smooth and frothy.  It is good that way.  It has a delicious, creamy taste.  Sweet.  Really good, and tasting very much like cheesecake.<br /><br />However, if you really want the FULL cheesecake experience, I recommend drinking this one as a latte, using warmed milk instead of water and whisking with a frothing tool instead of the bamboo whisk.  YUM!  The creamier texture and flavor that comes from using milk instead of water is really beneficial to this cheesecake flavored Matcha.  All the flavor remains intact - it is not masked by the milk - and it tastes creamier and richer ... and let's face it, when you want cheesecake, you want that rich, creamy flavor and texture.<br /><br />This cheesecake flavored Matcha is rich, smooth, and sweet, with the distinctive tangy taste of cream cheese and even a hint of buttery pastry.  It makes a delightful pick-me-up for the afternoon, especially if you're craving something a little sweet.  This will help curb those cravings for a fraction of the calories and fat!

review/summary: Like Home made quality cheesecake!!
review/text: This particular matcha tastes EXACTLY like cheesecake and not that fake cheesecake made with inferior "cheesecake" stuffing stuff you can buy pre made in the store but real cheesecake made at home from scratch or from a fine restaurant or bakery!<br /><br />It is not overly sweet either which I was surprised at because I honestly was expecting something more fake tasting and overly sugary.<br /><br />I was both surprised and pleased when I took my first sip and realized this was the real deal! I still am amazed that Red Leaf Tea can get such excellent flavor from all natural sources into a matcha!<br /><br />This flavor melded perfectly with the green tea base giving it a beautiful slightly sweet and creamy earthy flavor! I imagine it would be insanely good in a white base as well!<br /><br />You can almost taste the crumbly cheesecake crust in this as well as the taste of the filling so you do get that whole cheesecake experience.

review/summary: Good (for the most part)
review/text: I try to drink 1-3 cups of green tea everyday and this was a great way to try out so many different Stash green teas at once.<br /><br />The varieties included were (ordered May 2010):<br /><br />Chai Green - Very good chai, one of my favorites. Better than Celestial<br />Fusion Breakfast - Too much going on- mix of Indian Assam, Indonesian Black, Chinese Green, Japanese Green, African Black, and Japanese Matcha<br />Fusion Green & White - Good if you can't decide to have white tea or green tea, which happens every so often to me<br />Ginger Peach - not my cuppa, too much ginger and difficult to find the peach flavor<br />Organic Premium Green - very good<br />Moroccan Mint - Excellent, not quite as minty as peppermint herbal tea, but a nice balance of mint and green flavors<br />Pomegranate Raspberry - meh, okay when you're craving fruity but I wouldn't invest in a case of this<br />Premium Green - very good<br />Decaf Premium Green - Excellent, my kids drink this often<br /><br />After drinking tea for years with or without sweetener (no milk) I made a mistake one morning and put <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC">Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla Syrup</a> into my tea with some cream (thinking it was coffee!) and I was blown away with the smooth, mellow taste. I now drink my tea with a little vanilla syrup and cream (less than I would use in coffee) and it's such an amazing flavor - like dessert. My daughter thinks it tastes like Yoplait vanilla yogurt. I highly recommend this!!!

review/text: This sampler is good, but all potential buyers should know in advance that the description of the assortment is totally wrong. You won't get any jasmine tea, lemon spice, sushi bar mild green, or some of the other flavors mentioned in the ad. What you will get is several varieties of green tea (including organic, decaf, and a green/white and green/black blend) plus Moroccan mint, a green chai, and ginger peach. When I contacted Amazon to tell them that their description was wrong, they just said that they get their descriptions from several different vendors and don't have a way to confirm if they're right or wrong.

review/summary: Great Green Tea Sampler!
review/text: I've just recently started to drink tea daily due to its health benefits. This Green Tea Sampler by Stash was a great way to try out various green tea flavors from a tea company that was previously unknown to me. The flavors I received were: Chai Green, Fusion Breakfast, Fusion Green & White, Ginger Peach, Moroccan Mint, Organic Premium Green, Pomegranate Raspberry, Premium Green, and Decaf Premium Green. It does NOT include Jasmine Blossom and Lemon Spice, as per the product description. I was disappointed when I realized that Jasmine Blossom and Lemon Spice were not included in the sampler, especially since I would rather have had these flavors in lieu of some of the others. But, that's what a sampler is for after all -- picking and choosing your favorites. I now know which flavors to purchase in bulk and which ones to stay away from.

review/summary: Tea Tasting
review/text: NOTE: When I purchased this sampler, in November '10, there were different flavors. I intend to try out the new packaging of flavors and I will update my review accordingly.<br /><br />Green Tea Sampler, 9 flavors, 2 colored bags of each. I tried each flavor at least twice for an unbiased sampling. Mostly I don't put any sweetener in my green tea. I purchased my pack in 2010, the Best By date on the packages is 2013.<br /><br />The brew time varied with the tea, about 3-5 minutes. Most lasted for 2 cups. The 18 tea bags didn't fill the dispenser full enough, so they were all sideways, I had to open them up and put the bags back in right. Could we get 10 flavors?<br /><br />Fusion Breakfast Green & Black Tea (Indian Assam black tea, Indonesia black tea, Chinese green tea, Japanese green tea, African black tea, Japanese Matcha) - yum! I do not normally like black teas but this tea was so delicious it has become a new favorite! Great with bagels anyway. A nice strong flavor that's not overwhelming like black teas and often green teas are. Very nice aroma (steam). Though it says brew 3-5 minutes I always just leave the teabag in. Sometimes that makes very strong tea (not always preferred), in this case the tea was still really good that strong.<br />Ginger Peach Green Tea (green tea, ginger root, peach flavor, Japanese Matcha) - really nice smell, the sweet peach ginger... I haven't cared for the plain ginger tea I've tried before, the ginger is way too strong. In this tea, the ginger was strong, I could not taste the peach as much as I would like, but after a cup it grew on me a little, after another try I found it quite pleasing.<br />Premium Green Tea - Organic (blend of organic green tea) -  kind of flavorless. if you like mild green tea this is good. I let it steep far more than 5 min and it's still rather bland.<br />Premium Green Tea (non organic)  - (select blended green teas) - good strong green tea, lasted a few cups .<br />Premium Green Decaf Tea (select blended naturally decaffeinated green teas) - seemed stronger than the regular, but not as green...<br />Fusion Green & White Tea (White tea, Jasmine green, Chinese green, Assam green, Darjeeling green, and Organic green teas) - My first taste (to my knowledge) of white tea, this has become my favorite flavor. It is a little less bitter than most green tea.<br />Moroccan Mint Green Tea (Green tea, spearmint, lemongrass and peppermint) - smells wonderful! Very nice flavor. Doesn't need sweetener, but honey adds a nice base.<br />Pomegranate Raspberry Green Tea (Green tea, chamomile, hibiscus flowers, orange peel, citric acid, pomegranate flavor, raspberry flavor and Japanese matcha) - at first I was disappointed with this flavor, it didn't seem strong enough, but once I added honey it became another favorite.<br />Chai Green Tea (Blended green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove, clove oil, and cardamom oil) - Don't expect a `chai' tea really, but it's a nice flavor.<br /><br />I grew up on herbal teas, don't care for black tea, and drink a lot of green tea. Like most people, I didn't like green tea at first, but it grew on me. I used a really nice authentic Japanese tea from Costco (now not available any more) to get used to it. Now I mostly drink the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WB1YSE">Kirkland Signature Ito En Matcha Blend (Green Tea)</a> from Costco. I've also tried 'Stash Premium Oriental Tea Collection, teas of China & Japan' (no longer available) and really enjoy those flavors.<br /><br />This collection is a good sampler, and a good set of teas. I would have liked a different flavor in substitute of either the organic or non-decaf, as they both tasted very like the ordinary green tea. If you prefer organic or non-decaf, I don't think you need to sample it.<br />In the end, though, I can enjoy all the flavors, and will almost certainly purchase this sampler again.<br /><br />NOTE ON TEAS: It looks like the new set does not include the Ginger Peach or the Pomegranate Raspberry, which is disappointing. Also no Fusion Breakfast. There is now a Jasmine Blossom and a Lemon Spice, which sound great. I am not excited for the 'Mild Sushi' tea but we'll see.

review/text: A fried had told me the Twinings Cold Brew Iced Tea Bags knowing that I drink a lot of iced tea.  Rather than running to Starbucks or using the substandard Lipton brand, I buy 6-pack of these boxes every 2-3 months.  I love them.  What a budget saver.

review/summary: Best 'instant' ice tea out there.
review/text: I won't drink anything with sugar in it, so during the summer Ice Tea is my drink of choice. Normally I make my own with regular tea bags in a big jar in the fridge but after I stumbled upon these I find I can make myself individual great-tasting glasses of ice tea whenever and wherever I need them without having to deal with the giant jug in the fridge and without spending a fortune. I've found all the powders are generally rubbish and I steer clear of them. Great work Twinings.

review/summary: Love this tea!
review/text: Love, love, love this iced tea.  I've tried Lipton Cold Brew, but it wasn't the same as the stuff you find in restaurants.  Stumbled upon this at World Market once, and my hubby and I fell in love.  Its strong and tasty and EASY to make, and quality is of those you find in your favorite restaurants.  I normally add some peach syrup to make a peach iced tea... yummm (tea is also good by itself too...). Went back to World Market to buy more, but they don't stock it anymore... glad Amazon carries it and the price isn't bad either!

review/summary: Love it but can't get it!
review/text: My husband is a tea snob.  I found this by accident and he absolutely LOVED it.  Went back to get more, but suddenly can't find it ANYWERE!  I live in CA (Santa Clarita Valley) and NONE of my grocery stores carry it.  Even tried World Market.  Oh well ... thank goodness for Amazon ... this cold brew iced tea is my husband's ABSOLUTE FAVORITE.

review/summary: Easy to Make
review/text: My husband enjoys this tea and I appreciate how easy it is to make, particularly considering his voracious appetite for the stuff.  I don't personally enjoy tea, but I do make his tea and now that we have found this, my job is a little easier.  This would be great for camping, picnics, and power outages, too; wherever you may have water but not necessarily hot water.

review/summary: Wonderfully surprised!
review/text: My mother is British and a life-long tea drinker, so you can imagine what she thinks of tea that is brewed in cold water. I tried the Green Tea with Mint variety and was amazed at how good it tastes-- when they advertise it as "cool and refreshing", they aren't kidding! I've taken to fixing a glass of ice tea for my morning dog-walk, and even my corgi Reggie is happy because it takes so much less time for me to get ready. And I don't have to make a whole pitcher, just a glass of it whenever I want. Five stars, Twinings!!

review/summary: Review of Twinings English Classic Cold Brew Tea
review/text: I love this ice tea!  It has great flavor but the convenience is why I purchase it.  I started purchasing this cold brew tea at my local grocery store, at the end of the summer they quit carrying this  tea.  When I could no longer find it at my local store I decided to try Amazon.com.  My tea arrived on time, for less than I normally pay and it was a fresh, good tasting and easy as ever to make.  I'm so glad I found a way to continue to purchase this tea.

review/summary: Outstanding taste, perfect iced tea for busy people
review/text: This tea is ideal for anyone who likes a cool glass of iced tea but does not have access to ice. It has become my go-to tea after years of enjoying the myriad loose-leaf teas from Teavana and other such places. Why? Let me share my story...<br /><br />My daily routine was simple: brew a liter of tea in the morning to bring to work, pour it over ice throughout the day and enjoy several large glasses of fresh and tasty iced tea. Then the refrigerator went out, and we no longer have ice at work. So I spent months choosing my lunch based on what restaurants would give me a large iced tea to take back to the office.<br /><br />Well, no more of that! Now I keep bags of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028GWGYW">Twinings English Classic Cold Brewed Tea, 20-Count Packages (Pack of 6)</a> on hand, whether at my desk or while traveling, and I just fill a glass from the water cooler and minutes later I am enjoying a wonderful iced tea with no bitterness at all.<br /><br />I have used one tea bag throughout the day to make 5 or 6 large glasses of tea. Don't be afraid to let it steep as long as you like.

review/summary: Another Brilliant beverage from Twinings!
review/text: Such a fantastic product!So close to old fashioned, homemade iced tea making.Just none of the involved work that went along with it. I can crank out containers of this easily. And it's all natural....teabags, water, and sugar!Iced tea like my grandmother used to make. (Have also purchased the Mixed Berry variety of this)
