review/summary: Wasa Sourdough Crispbread
review/text: Wasa Breads would have my unconditional 5-star rating except for the breakage.  When one expects a surface for spreading toppings, a package with  half whole crackers and half crumbs reduces the satisfaction significantly.

review/summary: Yummie!!!!!!!!
review/text: I actually got a case of these at the store. They are so light. I first had these when in Europe while in the service. I carry these in the winter to work in case I get snowed in. It's happened. I can put just about everything on it. Or I can eat them plain. They are also good for dipping into thick soup or stew. My only grump about them is the packaging. Once you open the thing the crisp bread starts going stale after a couple of days. Even after placing them in a plastic bag or container. That is why I gave them 4 stars.

review/summary: Wasa Sourdough
review/text: I buy this is bulk as we use over a pack a week.  Of all the various Wasa products, the sourdough is my personal favorite.  It is thin and crisp, has a great taste and zero fat.  They make a great low-calorie, medium fiber snack. Top them with sun-dried tomatoes for a treat.  If you are adventurous, bake a head of garlic in the oven for 30 min. and spread it over the top of the Wasa crackers.  My wife puts some yogurt on them and places some raspberries on top of the yogurt.  Other uses are as a breadcrumb or croï¿½ton substitute in recipes and salads.  If you use them in salads, it is best to dry off the lettuce or spinach first to keep them crispy.

review/text: What can I say I love sourdough.  Sourdough anything!<br /><br />This are light and tasty with a nice strong flavor.  As thin as they are they still hold up to being smothered with Cream cheese or other favorite toppings.<br /><br />A couple of these with some non-fat Cream cheese makes for a seriously quick and low calorie snack.

review/text: This product is imported rye crispbread. It is full of small bugs. They seem to be thriving but the crackers are not fit for human consumption. The packages are marked, "30 NOV 11".

review/summary: Very Great Product - As Long As Well Packed
review/text: I've eaten Wasa for more than 15 years - long before Oprah and Dr. Oz talked about how great it was for people regarding fiber, whole grains and lack of fat, preservatives, etc.<br /><br />As long as the packers pack these well, and UPS is careful, it is great. I had one problem wheere the box was hit hard and the crackers inside got smashed. But they were replaced. Otherwise a 5 star rating for the Wasa product itself! No "insects" or anything else. Long expire date and very fresh.

The previous reviewer is right. These are full of small bugs. The bugs are hard to notice, but smash a cracker on a white piece of paper, and you will see them.<br />Yuck. I just ate half a pack.

review/summary: The Greatest Compromise
review/text: I love this bread. I find it crunchy and delicious, and guilt-free. Low sugar, high fiber. Passes through your body like driving on an empty highway. It is the greatest compromise because it is somewhere between an absolutely-bad-for-your-health-bread and Styrofoam; closer to the latter, but definitely palatable. I've been buying pack of 12 again and again; time for this review, don't you think so?

There were not any crumbs which I've experienced with other popcorn brands in the past. Also, its a great value considering they are local, and use all these natural ingredients. Wish I'd discovered this sooner, it is now my go to snack and gift item! Also, as the previous reviewer mentions, it is VERY addicting (but in a good/guiltless way)!

review/text: This is a great herbal tea for those that used to drink regular black Lipton type tea, but don't want the caffeine.  Decaffeinated teas still retain a small amount, as well as some decaffeinating methods use chemicals.  This is a wonderful tasting alternative.  In addition to a regular hot cup of tea, I place 4 teabags in a 2 quart container, fill with water and place in the refrigerator.  In a few hours you have a great tasting iced tea.

review/summary: The only caffeine-free tea that can pass for tea!
review/text: I love black tea, but no longer drink gallons of it day and night, because of the caffeine.  This tea is the only caffeine-free tea that can come anywhere close to passing for real tea.  It's not as wonderful as real tea, but compared to the herbal drek that most people consume, it's heaven.  It's an herbal formulation, but it contains "tea essence" as an ingredient.  I let it steep a long time.  Sometimes I put in a splash of milk or cream.  I take the bags with me on trips.  It's not so easy to find, and I've always snatched up all the boxes I could get my hands on (when I could find it in Whole Foods, for example), so buying it in bulk on Amazon is great!

The ingredients listed on my box are the same as on the red and green box, but the ingredients listed in amazon.com description for the orange box include beet root. Each of these products are caffeine-free herbal tea with roasted chicory. I purchased a 6 pack and hope I can have them replaced with the correct tea in the green & red box. This is not the flavor I ordered.

Too bad Trader Joe's is so sweet. This one was spicy but not uncomfortably so. I didn't have the issue one reviewer mentioned with too much vinegar taste. But if you've gotten used to sweet-style jerky, be forewarned that old-fashioned beef jerky has some kick to it (sugar is a preservative; less sugar means more salt and/or vinegar). But according to me: Yum.<br /><br />It would be nice if the meat were pastured free-range rather than just "organic," but a look at the company/coop's website makes it look like they're making an effort towards pasturing. If you're going to eat meat at all, I think this is about the best available on the general market from an environmental standpoint-- the only thing better would be if you have a truly local, truly pastured supplier at your local farmer's market-- and it's old-school beef jerky from before everything was sugar, sugar, sugar.

review/summary: New recipe is great!
review/text: Ordered this trying to find an organic/natural beef jerky that isn't sweet and loaded with sugar. Really like the taste. Ingredients on our batch are completely different than listed on Amazon: beef, sea salt, celery powder, sugar, garlic powder, spices. Also nutrition facts are different-- lists &lt;1g sugar on package. Best organic jerky we've tried.  Good flavor, just right chewiness.

review/text: Maybe the previous reviewer got a bad batch or something because I couldn't detect any vinegar odor or flavor in the jerky I had.  I liked this jerky alot.  Unlike most organic jerkys on the market today, this one didn't taste as sugary and also, the spicy flavor is very nice.

review/summary: Best easily-obtainable organic jerky!
review/text: I've tried a few organic jerkies and this one is easily the best. Not just because organic jerkies seem to be almost always sweet, but this jerky actually tastes good on it's own.  They aren't very salty, but it's just salty enough. This is coming from someone who enjoys perhaps less salt than the people being referred to when the media talks about America's sodium obsession problems, but more-so than a consistently healthy person. The flavor is a pretty mild spice, but there is enough of a heat that I can notice it, being someone with marginally above average piquancy tolerance. The texture can be described as very dry, stringy and tough. It goes well with this flavor, though I do prefer jerky a little chewier. This is a great low fat snack and it has a gram more protein per serving than most jerkies. I'd recommend it to anyone for it's qualities on it's own right and not just because it's better than other natural jerky.

review/text: This is very tasty jerky but I'm laughin' at the "spicy" part!  I had no idea it was supposed to have some heat to it until I read the package a little more carefully.  Really, it is not "hot" spicy at all to me but does taste good.  The pack I ate was filled with lots of smaller pieces and only a few slices.  I didn't find it overly dry, just kind of moist and chewy.  Great high protein snack for low carbers and anyone else.  Less than 1 gram of carb per serving, 60 calories per serving and 2 servings per bag.  But you'll probably eat the whole bag because it's not that much!  Enjoy!

review/text: Best organic beef jerky I've found--not sweet. The salt is just right. It's flavorful, but definitely not spicy. I'm giving it 4 starts instead of 5, because of all the small pieces. I buy it to have it on the go, but eating it on the go is not easy. As another reviewer wrote, there are one or two larger pieces and lots of little pieces. Really, you need a spoon to get them all out of the bag. It's kind of messy using your fingers, need a wipe handy.

review/text: When I saw the HOT label on this beef jerky, I jumped on this great deal. When I opened my first package, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that it's not spicy or hot at all. I barely eat spicy food or hot, but if you advertised HOT it better be HOT. I hope the company plans to add a little more spice to this great beef jerky because I am now a loyal customer because of the great tasting organic beef.

The bags are pretty small and so are the pieces of jerky, but at about 4 bucks a pop they're a pretty good deal for organic jerky.

review/summary: My Favorite Mass-Market Jerky
review/text: Sugar Ray's Honey Chipotle is my absolute favorite jerky available in average/common stores.  Its not too soft or too hard. Just enough density to give a satisfying chew without overworking my jaw muscles. And the flavor is fantastic! A little sweet with a gentle kick of spice. You say "gentle kick", what is that? Enough spice to warm my mouth, but not tear me up or make my nose run. Also enough spice to keep the vultures (my kids) from wanting more than just a taste.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price.  This jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products...I just can't resist the flavor! Haha.  So if you don't like the price, don't try it.  Like me, you might not be able to go back to your old jerky.

review/text: I was looking for a snack that was high in protein but low in fat so I started looking at Beef Jerky, but all the other brands have at least some sort of fat in them, usually a minimum of 1g, which may not sound like much, but when you're dieting, every gram counts. So when I found this brand I was very pleased. It tastes great and did I mention it has zero fat? Oh yeah, I did. But each service (28 oz) only has 50 calories, no carbs and some good protein. Switch to this brand/style. You won't be displeased.

review/text: I have been on a beef jerky kick lately, and this is one of my new favorites. It starts with the tenderness of the meat. The meat is on the soft side but still has a nice chew to it. It's real pieces as apposed to the artificial looking variety. The flavor has a nice smoky BBQ base and the sweetness of the honey and the mild heat from the chipolte is perfect. I've tried multiple Sweet Baby Ray products and have yet to be disappointed. Grab a bag or two, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Quality Hay
review/text: This 8 lb. bag of ZuPreem timothy hay is absolutely phenomenal! I have been using Oxbow Timothy hay for the longest time, but after a while, the bags of hay would be filled with sticks of very hard hay. My rabbit ended up eating half of the contents of the bag because of this. My rabbit would eat the very soft hay and ignore the hard sticks of hay.<br /><br />ZuPreem hay is great because all 8 lbs of the contents consist of SOFT,very SOFT timothy hay, with no HARD hay whatsoever. My rabbit loves it and so do I. Kaytee timothy hay is horrendous and I typically get allergic reactions to it. The 9 lbs of Oxbow timothy hay I typically order has been inconsistent since it seems like they have been giving me bags of hay that is mostly hard sticks of hay. It is my first time using ZuPreem and I am absolutely in love with it. I am not allergic to it and my rabbit is addicted to this grass!<br /><br />*My rabbit has a health issue called a head-tilt (those who have heard of this know that this is a pretty scary thing for rabbits) and this hay is perfect since there is no need to worry about hard sticks of hay poking his eye.

I've tried others like Oxbow and Kaytee, but he just trashes those brands of hay where as he actually eats the Zupreem. This hay is usually very reasonably priced.<br />My meat rabbits like Zupreem's hay as well, but I have to say that they are not as picky as Harry is when it comes to their hay.

review/text: I read on several different natural remedy web sites and written literature for natural remedies that if you mix 3 tbls of the liquid pectin in 6 oz all natural Welches grape juice a day it will lower the pain threshold of arthritis hip pain. I have been doing this method for almost a year now. It has lowered my need for any other pain reliever such as Ibuprofin. I used to take this medication 1 to 2 times a day and now I am down to 1 time a week or less. I can walk now without a cane and the exercise is also beneficial for hip pain which I was reluctant to do because it was so painful. It works well for me and this is the most economical way to keep the pectin I need to use everyday. Thank you for the opportunity to share my experience with this product.

review/summary: Certo helps my back
review/text: Don't like to take any more doctor medicine than I have to, because of the side effects. (Although not taking the proper medicine as needed also has side effects.) I believe that, like oil helps a machine's parts from rubbing together, steel on steel, Certo "oils" the joints. Joints like those in the knuckles (arthritis). For me, Certo helps with lower back pain. I also suppliment the Certo when needed with an ice pack, which cools the inflamation. I take it about 3 or 4 times a day, or I'll end up in the bed with back pain, and sometimes can't get up. (Then I have to take 4 Alieves (220mg) ever five hours for a day or two.Read that on the web under back pain and it works.)

review/summary: Great product for even a first-time jelly making attempt.
review/text: I bought this for my first attempt at making jelly.  I found a basic red pepper jelly recipe online (Paula Deen's on Food Network) and gleaned from the reviews of her recipe that it came out a bit to syrupy, so I let the pectin boil just a bit longer.  Jelly set perfectly and tasted great.  I was really worried I might mess it up, but had no issues.  Will continue to use this brand for all future jelly making endeavors.

review/summary: a must for making jam and good foryour health too.
review/text: Okay, I mainly bought this for making jam but upon reading some of the reviews that they mix it with grape juice to help them with their athritis.., I decided to give it a try also. Yes, it does help if you have some arthritis or joint problems. I always put those heat patches to put at the back of my hand and ankle sometimes. My husband said I am like an old woman...well, we are all going there anyway but after trying this for a couple of weeks I feel the difference. I don't use those patches anymore. I will buy some more to give to my mother and father. As for jam making, I will put that on hold for awhile.

review/summary: Keeps my old dog spry
review/text: I started giving my old, arthritic dog pectin about a year ago, and it's pretty effective for maintenance. I have a "subscribe and save" standing order with Amz. I transfer the foil packets into a clean squeeze-bottle and squirt about a tablespoon on her food at each meal. She hates it (it has a sour taste) but eventually comes back to finish. Using Certo, we're able to save the Metacam for the really bad days... she can no longer jump the fence or on the bed (a good thing), but  in general, her mobility is great, especially at "crazy puppy playtime".<br /><br />Other arthritis-helpers: minimal carbs, no nightshades - which means no dogfood made with potatoes.

review/summary: Certo Pectin May Conflict with Statin Drugs
review/text: I decided to try the folk remedy of ingesting Certo Pectin mixed with grape juice for arthritis.  I had just started taking a statin drug (zocor) for cholesterol.  Then I found out that one should avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice when taking statins. I believe it amplifies the effect. As i explored this conflict online, I discovered that Seville Oranges and some Limes have the same troublesome effects as grapefruit.<br /><br />Next, I discovered that Certo Pectin which is made by the Kraft Canada is made from Mexican limes.I tried to find out what variety of limes, e.g. regular limes, Key Limes, etc. but had no luck on the Kraft Canada website. Then I wrote a letter to Kraft Canada, and have not received an answer. I am playing on the safe side ---- I am not taking any chances with my statin drug. These statins are powerful drugs and can have side effects.<br /><br />Conclusion: Certo Pectin, I assume, is a fine product for baking, but if you are taking a statin drug ---- avoid it.

review/summary: A great product!
review/text: We've been using these for years, and always have two cases in each car. We've used them for taking medicine, mixing formula, washing hands, and drinking (of course.) When they get near their expiration date, we freeze them and use them as cold packs. A frozen Aqua Blox will keep a lunch cold for hours, and they're sterile, so they can be used for cleansing wounds in an emergency. Rodents recently gnawed through several cases of water bottles in our garage, but not the Aqua Blox! You can also recycle the aseptic packaging in some places, and the empty boxes flatten easily. With a five year shelf life, the price difference between them and bottled water is no issue, and they don't get brittle and leak like some types of plastic. Great for travel and home.

review/text: I just wish this was still in stock! The water came (free shipping) in a shrink wrapped carton.  I pulled out several for survival tests with my grandkids; the upside of the blox packaging is they are stackable, and of a size that one (as compared to several bagged waters) actually holds enough water to drink or use for rehydrating. Because of the cardboard outer and mylar inner, they are almost indestructable.  They also survive freezing very well; once thawed, no leakage.

review/text: The AQUA BLOX Water boxes are excellent sizes for those of us living in Apartments/Condo's without basements.  They can be stacked and do not take up much room.  AMAZON had this listed for $ 19.00 when I ordered 2 weeks ago.  NOW they raised the prise to $21.40.<br />HOWEVER, AMAZON shipped the 27-pack box of water in a very flemsey shipping box. It was way too weak to hold the water safely.  Part of the box was torn when UPS delivered it.  I was VERY SURPRISED that Amazon shipped it that way!!.<br />Since the price has gone up, I'll be looking at other sites to get this delivered.

review/summary: Too expensive
review/text: I never purchased this product. I did some research on emergency kits and one of the big questions is how to handle the water requirements. Guidelines state 1 gallon (about 4 liters) of water per day per person. It would take 6 of these cases (48 boxes of 250ml) to built a 72-hour kit for each member of the household. it would cost you A LOT of money - well over $100 with shipping - per person, for 72-hours. the only gain is the 5 year claimed shelf life.<br /><br />In contrast, buying simple bottled water would cost you about $1 - 2 per gallon, and has a 2 year "best before" date. It will probably taste better if you rotate it once a year, and will sustain life without poisoning you for much longer than 2 years. A simple trip to the grocery store and now I have 7 days of water for a family of 4 for under $40. Even if I replace the water every year, it is still way cheaper than buying specialized emergency water. Sorry Aqua Blox.

review/text: This has a nice grouping of coffees. Some are light roast, some dark roast, and some flavored. It's not a bad thing to get if you just got a Keurig and are trying to pick your favorite coffees. You're probably not going to like everything, but you can definitely taste the difference between roasts and flavors. Also, having more than one sample of each lets you try different brew sizes. However, for my sampler pack, they repackaged the hundred K-cups into a box labeled "80 K-cups, Hazelnut." My first reaction was that I had received the wrong item. On closer inspection, I saw it was relabeled as a hundred pack. I wouldn't purchase this if I knew what I liked, but for the first K-cup purchase for the new machine, it was a big win.
