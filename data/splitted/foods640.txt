review/summary: Misleading the consumer
review/text: I am always looking for new cereal products.  I usually stay away from Kelloggs as my first thought of their products is sugary cereals that mess up glucose levels.  I am very disappointed Kellogg's FiberPlusï¿½ Berry Yogurt Crunch cereal.  First it tastes similar to Sugar Frosted Flakes....way too sweet. Second, I eat a lot of 'rival' high fiber cereals and they do what they are supposed to do. Not this one.  And the product labelling is do I dare say a lie.  Misleading the public. 10g of fiber is 40% of 25.  10g of Fiber is not 40% of 28 or 35.  USDA recommends 28g per day.  Kelloggs has decided to change how many calories are recommended each day for an adult.  They changed it from 2500 to 2000.  Why. What do you think. I can think of at least three reasons.  I do not purchase Kellogg cereal and after this, never will again.

review/summary: Decent, but definitely not the best offered by Fiber Plus
review/text: Not bad, but not really that great compared to other wheat/rice flake cereals on the market.  Also really, really pales in comparison to the Cinnamon Oats Crunch varietal also offered by Fiber Plus. Makes me wonder why that one isn't available for subscribe & save yet somehow this one is. This one is merely an afterthought in comparison.

review/summary: What happened to my favorite Earl Grey tea, Argo?
review/text: UPDATE: After receiving order . . .<br /><br />My first review was a shimmering adoration of Argo tea, and this tea in particular. Now that my order has arrived and I'm drinking a cup, I have to ask: what happened? I used to be addicted to this stuff when I lived in Chicago and could go into an Argo store and buy it off the shelf. I remember it . . . differently.<br /><br />So--either I have changed, which is possible, or the other reviewer is right. (And my apologies for assuming he or she was misjudging.) There is something off about this tea, and I don't know what. But it does taste artificial and out of balance. Maybe it needs Chicago Municipal water to make the right chemical combination essential for the flavor I miss. But wow; what a disappointment. Proves the adage, "you can never go back."

review/summary: Great item, but are they worth it...?
review/text: It's so hard to find good pickled tomatoes anywhere, and these are great, but even Euromart's most basic shipping rate is exorbitant and the order processing itself is discouragingly slow.  Plus, they don't guarantee their merchandise unless you use the fastest and most expensive shipping/packing options.  My first order of pickled tomatoes came out great, so I figured I didn't need the fastest shipping option.  But when I reordered this item, the tomatoes arrived rotten and covered with mold... and according to Euromart's shipping policy, there was nothing I could do about it.

review/summary: This stuff is kitty crack!
review/text: My cat is an old fart at 16 years old so she doesn't get excited quite as often over things as she used to.  She always enjoys regular treats but for Christmas I wanted to get her a variety of different more natural treats and these were one of them.  She went off her rocker before I even had a chance to open them; she was licking around the seal of the closed plastic container!  Watching her eat them is half the fun - I'll put some flakes on the floor and she acts like a vacuum cleaner, frantically pushing them around to try to inhale them but sometimes they get stuck to her chin or whiskers and she can't figure out what's going on.  It's been a long time since I've seen her this animated over treats, and I never would have guessed it would have happened over fish flakes [they remind me of pieces of onion skin], so I'd say these are a winner in our house now!

review/text: Fish flakes are my kitty, Whiskers, absolute favorite treat of all times.  When we are out for any time at all she looks at me as if I have just absolutely broken her heart when I put another treat down in it's place.  This is not a look I like to get from her, trust me!.  Anyway, she is also quite particular about her fish flakes.  She has completly snubbed many a container, considering it unacceptable for consumption. This would be from a brand that we had bought before, so it's not like it was something new I was trying to pawn off on her.<br />These are a large container at a good price.  Plus, the flakes are nice and large, not all broken up into dust.  Which is absolutely unacceptable to her.  Also, our local pet store just stopped selling any flakes, so these are great.  Plus they are a better product at a better buy.  Whiskers and I highly recommend them.

review/summary: A Decent Product.
review/text: Relative to other products of this type, this brand, usually, is cheap - I bought this for ~$8. The flakes I received came in a resealable bag and not the container pictured. I have tried feeding these flakes to 3 different cats and under no circumstances will they eat them. When I initially gave a flake to one cat - Who eats all kinds of treats - she ate it. Five minutes later, she vomited twice. She did not eat it too quickly and chewed thoroughly - I watched her. If your cats love them, they are a healthy treat and not too expensive (4-5 stars). If your cats hate them, they are a stinky waste of money. Make sure, even if eaten, these flakes are not causing vomiting.

LOL.. the Cats LOVE the fishy smell though. The other two cats don't like soft treats.. only Crunchy ones.. So i have to hunt for another natural treat that's crunchy for them. The amount of treats in this bag was smaller than i thought; but that's fine.. i don't need to give a whole bunch since they are like shaved fish paper slivers.

review/text: Soph loves Bellyrub...it's like kitty on crack. Cannot walk into the room without her running to the window perch and letting out the Siamese call for "FISH FLAKES." This is the best product for kitty treats. Two years ago she was diagnosed as anorexic; while recuperating (after being hospitalized and tube fed for several weeks), I researched feeding enhancements for cats, and fish flakes was highly recommended. I was dubious but decided to purchase one jar from local pet store. At first, I would sprinkle a little on top of her baby food treat and it worked. Now I buy in bulk and have to hide the container. She is happy and healthy and loves "her fish flakes."  Tried different brands, she likes them all. However, this brand/site is the LEAST EXPENSIVE. Sophya gives them Five-Stars.

review/text: I prefer to eat alone as it is very important to me to savor each nuance with unobstructed emotions and not be tainted by someone else's opinion (besides the unruly one named "Dog" just horks stuff down.  I'm surprised he hasn't eaten the bowl by accident).  By dining on my own, I can laugh or to weep as the mood dictates, mindless of the sort of inhibitions companions might pose.<br />The first time I experienced Bellyrubs snacks, I tentatively licked up a flake and then another, and then another.  Each piece was a joy!  My shoulders relaxed.... my mind expanded.  For a moment nothing existed but me and the delicate tuna flakes.<br />Eating these treats do not disappoint, they are pure unadulterated, uncompromised joy.<br /><br />More please!<br />Steve-The-Cat<br />,,,^. .^,,,~

review/summary: Cat Loves 'em -- But I hate them!
review/text: NOT BAD IF YOU DON'T MIND PAYING NEARLY $150 A POUND FOR TUNA!!!  I think they could put five times as much tuna in the giant jar and it shouldn't affect the price a bit because you'd still be paying the equivalent of $30 per pound!<br /><br />The cat loves them though and I guess that's the bottom line.  But they stink!  I made the mistake of touching them to pull them out of the bottle.  I should have just sprinkled them out.  Now my hands smell like tuna!<br /><br />But the cat LOVES them.  And it's so good to see my 16-year-old cat really enjoy something and get so intense about it!  It's like they took 10 years off her life!  She's SO happy today!!<br /><br />WARNING:  One word of warning though... don't put the bottle anywhere where you don't want the cat to go.  The odor is quite strong and it leaks out of the bottle.  In other words, the cat can smell the bottle from a mile away!  Do NOT put it on a shelf, desk or counter if you don't want the cat to go there.  They will do anything in their power to get close to the bottle!!<br /><br />I don't like my cat getting on my desk.  And if I put the bottle on my desk that would instantly become her new favorite place.<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing... the cap was impossible to get off the first time.  I had to actually take a knife and cut away at the little tabs that you have to break in order to open it.  But after opening it the first time it's been fine.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because I hate the smell and because of the difficulty in getting the top opened initially.  But it's definitely a 5 Star + for the cat!  And that's what counts.

review/summary: Neither cat cares for them... and packaging differs
review/text: First off, I thought I was buying a container with a screw on lid,<br />such as the one in the photograph on this listing. What I received instead<br />was a blue mylar-fused zip-top bag. Those are harder to seal and keep fresh,<br />in my experience.<br /><br />Then the item itself. Sure, I read the reviews. At some point, food and treats are<br />food and treats, and you hope your cat will eat them. Well, count two cats here who<br />could not care less!  I shook some out on the floor. Both looked at me like I had<br />littered, and missed the trash can! There was cautious sniffing and walking away.<br />I ended up having to vacuum it up off the floor later.<br /><br />Now, I know it is a myth that cats adore fish. It's a cute story, and the fish bones<br />are just so darned cute when the graphic artists draw things about cats. The truth is that<br />most cats prefer some sort of poultry, and eat birds and mice - not fish. Few cats live<br />in the water, and even fewer own fishing rods! ;  )  They do not regularly attempt to eat<br />fish. (They do, however, love trying to catch the small ones in aquariums, just like they<br />would like to catch any moving object.)  My bad for not remembering that fish is at the bottom<br />of a cat's food choice list.<br /><br />What a waste this purchase was!<br />I can't recommend it at all. It was smelly, the cats ignored it,<br />and I definitely did not appreciate getting a different item than was pictured.<br />I wanted the one I thought I was buying based on the picture, not a substituted ziploc bag.<br />Seller should notify buyers of the difference and offer to cancel the order.

At minimum, the seller should be updating the description section to advise buyers.

review/summary: Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
review/text: These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

review/summary: Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack?
review/text: These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. "BOLD" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.<br /><br />Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.<br /><br />I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!

It gives you a chance to snack but still eat healthy.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat.  You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones.  I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 7% of your daily intake of sodium and if you are on a salt restricted diet then make sure to watch your salt intake.  The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.<br /><br />This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!

review/summary: Crunchy almond treat with a sassy Jalapeno kick!
review/text: Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.<br /><br />The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!

review/summary: A hot, bold and tasty snack!
review/text: I love Blue Diamond Almonds and this bold flavor gives you a spicy hot choice for a snack.  They are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and calcium while only being 170 calories for one serving.  They also add 3 grams of dietary fiber to your diet and 6 grams of protein while only adding 2 grams of sugar.<br /><br />They do contain 15 grams of fat but only 1 gram of saturated fat and 0 grams of trans fat. (Mostly they are the good stuff)  If you want a quick snack that is high in protein and low in sugar and sodium these are pretty good and spicy.<br /><br />While there are other flavors that I like more this one is still very good.  Just remember, they are addictive so you only get one serving!

review/summary: Great Flavor....
review/text: I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.<br /><br />I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds.

review/summary: Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting
review/text: The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.<br /><br />Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.<br /><br />Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard.

review/text: I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the "bold" flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.

review/text: When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you.

review/summary: Best flavor and best price of any Blue Diamond almonds!
review/text: The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable.

Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend.

review/summary: Highly addictive! Great with beer
review/text: I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!

review/text: Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!

review/summary: The best almond flavor out there. How could something so delish be so good for you?
review/text: The "Jalapeno Smokehouse" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older. I like to think it's partly because of these luscious babies. Dr Jeddy prescribes a handful every day!

I love salt, I love vinegar, and I love salt-and-vinegar potato chips, so how could I lose with these?<br /><br />Well, I'm just not that into them. The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.<br /><br />Oh well. Guess even my ol' reliable Blue Diamond can't hit it out of the park every time.

The cost is also lower than in local stores, but you can buy the larger bags cheaper (per oz) from some Walmarts if you can find them.<br /><br />Almonds are supposed to be appetite suppressants, but for me it's usually because I ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more.

review/summary: Great Low Carb snack to go!!
review/text: Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more.

review/summary: A healthy addiction
review/text: Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds. The soy sauce flavor is hardly noticeable but just nicely tones down the heat of the wasabi.

review/text: I've been participating in Weight Watchers for the last couple months (doing well).  I like to have a healthy snack at work mid-afternoon so I bought a bag of these at the grocery store.  They are so good I can't stop at 23 (a serving size).  I am not going to buy these again until I'm at my goal because I can't stop eating them.  They are quite salty so if you are trying to control your sodium, beware.  They are not as "hot" as wasabi peas, a more gentle kick.  I highly recommend them. Very savory.

review/text: I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot. But it's a much healthier alternative. They are still high in fat, as all nuts are, so eating a whole can in one sitting is probably not the thing to do. But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the "bold" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!

review/text: I love salt and vinegar chips, but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross, but was willing to give it a try.  And boy they are great!  They have about twice the vinegar punch of most chips, and are amazingly good, and the fat is the good kind, and you get plenty full on the almonds.  Mmmmmm.<br /><br />I was buying the tins (which are sometimes available at the grocery store), but then realized I couldn't stop once I opened a tin and was eating something like 1,200 calories in a single day just on almonds.  So these packs are perfect - there are enough almonds to really satisfy a hungry stomach, but not so much to blow your diet.  And they're great to stash when you know that you won't be able to grab a real meal, but don't want to find yourself at a vending machine or 7Eleven buying crap b/c you're so hungry.  Even my (naturally thin) hubby loves them.  Perfect!

review/summary: You can definitely taste the salt & vinegar
review/text: Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too "dry," some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.<br /><br />The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are "too" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.<br /><br />You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12.

review/summary: A nice enough flavor, but I wouldn't describe it as either "Blazin'" or "Buffalo Wing."
review/text: I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.<br /><br />And I've tried all their flavors, especially their "BOLD" line. Alas, their definition of "BOLD" is apparently "a little too spicy for kids." This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-"blazin'." It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.<br /><br />As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>. But it doesn't taste much like anything in particular. They could have called it "BOLD Generic Faux-Spicy Snack to be Eaten Brainlessly While Watching the Game" flavor and it would have been more accurate.

They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that.

review/summary: Not As Balanced As Other Bold Flavors, But Not Bad
review/text: I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other "Bold" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the "soy" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Taste kind of strange....
review/text: To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.<br /><br />When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.<br /><br />They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again.

review/text: My fav bold BD almond by far. Completely addicting. TY Lord that they are pretty expensive. Not the best nut though. That distinction, of course, goes to Mauna Loa garlic and onion fav Mac.

review/summary: After a few cans, I'm hooked.
review/text: It took two or three cans, but I love these now.  When I first tried these, I thought the taste was not as "bold" as I would like it to be.  I do wish they were a tad stronger and hotter on the wasabi taste, but I am hooked on these now.  I eat some almost every day.

review/summary: Eh, they're all right
review/text: These almonds aren't bad--better than just eating regular salted almonds.  But I tried the Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds first, and I like those a LOT more than the Wasabi & Soy.  I found that I got a stronger "kick" from the horseradish if I sucked on the almond first before eating it.

review/summary: I Didn't Know
review/text: I didn't like these.<br />I guess it's my fault for not liking them, because I actually have never tried wasabi, but I like asian flavors in food and adore all of Blue Diamond's bold flavors, so when I saw this in the store, I was like hey why not.<br /><br />Now I know why not. These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol.

review/summary: Not what I hoped for, but probably should've expected
review/text: I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that.

review/summary: I LOVE this stuff
review/text: I'd been buying it for years WHEN I COULD FIND IT, at the local grocery. Generally buying 5 or 6 cans cause I couldn't be sure it would be there next time I went. As such, I was thrilled to see Amazon selling it in bulk and cheaper than at my local store.<br /><br />These are almonds... so you get the health benefits of that. They are very tasty, with a mild wasabi tang... I've shared them with friends and they love them.<br /><br />Granted, these don't provide the entertainment value of the wasabi peas from the Japanese place that blow out your sinuses. But Its still a very tasty, semi healthy (lots of salt), snack that fills my need for something crunchy.<br /><br />MUCH healthier than potato chips.

review/summary: Very tasty but not very Habanero-y
review/text: This is one of my favorites in the Blue Diamond "BOLD" flavors line. There's a nice balance of heat vs sweet, and the saltiness isn't overwhelming. You can eat 'em by the handful, and probably will once you taste them.<br /><br /> However, true hot-pepper fans know that the heat of the Habanero pepper is a fearsome thing. You won't find much of it here, just a little hint. That's probably for the best, given that most people can't tolerate the blazing intensity of those devilish little peppers. But I kind of wish Blue Diamond would put out a "BOLD, and This Time We Mean It" line for those of us who really do love spicy foods.

review/summary: Just right for this low carb snacker!
review/text: OH MY WORD!! I love these, I love the bold flavored Blue Diamond almonds. Love this flavor first, then the wasabi then the salt vinegar. The Wasabi has a gram or so more of carbs, so I generally choose this one or the salt and vinegar. The problem for me is I'm an addict. If I got 3 pounds of these almonds, I'd eat 3 pounds of these almonds in short order. That being said. They are delicious, salty, a little spicy with a touch of sweeet - they are fantastic! This price is better than I get them at Wally World for the 6oz can and they are cheaper there than anywhere else. So, buy these, buy them now and hide the other bags from yourself (or send them to me) ...they are SO good, I'm eating them now! :<br /><br />Hey Amazon, this is sold and shipped by you, it would be ever so nice if this came on the subscribe and save!
