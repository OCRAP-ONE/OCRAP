review/summary: Not bad for what it is ...
review/text: I typically drink a large cup of hot coffee every morning, but in the summer months, I'll switch to a cold/iced coffee every so often.  I decided to give this product, the "illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, 8.45-Ounce" a try.  Below are my impressions:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- I like the idea of a coffee drink in a can.  It gives me the option of just bringing it with me and drinking it when I'm ready rather than having to stand in line every morning (or buying a coffee maker) to get my morning shot of joe.<br />- The portion size (~8.5 ounces) is good.  I wouldn't mind an even larger size, but this size is big enough to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />Con:<br />- The coffee and chocolate flavors were too delicate for my taste.  I prefer the milder coffees, but this cappuccino was a little too mild for me.<br /><br />Neither a pro or con:<br />- You can drink the product cold from straight from your refrigerator, but in my opinion, it tastes better served over ice.<br /><br />Overall, in my opinion, this product's strength is its convenience and portability, and its weakness is that doesn't taste as good as the freshly-made alternatives.  While it's a little too weak for my tastes, if you like cold/iced coffee, you should give it a try to see if it works for you.  Three stars.

review/summary: Like it, but not in love, like their other flavors more
review/text: I keep my house stocked with cold coffee. It is usually Starbucks Frappuccions. I buy them by the case. Caffeine is my one and only addiction. Cold coffee is my treat. I am familiar with illy coffee. I have bought their espresso to use in my stove top espresso maker. When I run to the drugstore and they do not have Starbucks, I grab illy in its place.<br /><br />Taste wise this is just OK to me. I like it but I do not love it at all. It was easy to drink but did not leave me craving more. I did however buy a case of their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UOA31I">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Mochaccino, 8.45-Ounces Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. I like the other one a lot more. This one is a tad bland to me where the mochaccino is a bit more bold and flavorful.<br /><br />After drinking Starbucks Fraps, these are a lot healthy for you. Starbucks is just a tad over an ounce more in size but has 180 calories where this has 100. Also, the fraps have 31 grams of sugar where these have only 18 grams, which still is a lot.<br /><br />I like illy cold coffees but will stick to other flavors. Again, this one is OK but not one I would keep stocked in my fridge. I already have made the switch from Starbucks to illy since they are a lot healthier. Still not healthy but it is my one and only treat of the day.

review/summary: Tasty Iced Coffee on the go!
review/text: I have always loved coffee hot or cold.  Depending on my mood or the season, I enjoy trying new creations.  This little can packed a powerful flavor that I really enjoyed.  This is mildly sweet with a creamy flavor, with a refreshing cold boost of energy on a warm day in June!  This I will be ordering more of and hope to find at the local convenience store.

review/summary: Extreme - maybe not, but definately good.
review/text: "Issimo" in Italian is an intensifier to an adverb much as we might say "extremely".  I don't consider the Illy Issimo Cappucino to be an extreme coffee drink but it is one that I enjoyed.  I frequently use Illy coffee in my Gaggia machine to make espressos, cappucinos, lattes, and so on so I'm very familiary with the brand and their coffees.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed this beverage first chilled then served over ice.  The perfect blend of coffee, 2% milk, and cocoa powder, were excellent but seemed to be a mocha rather than a cappucino.  My home-made cappucinos are frothy where this was not.  I'm puzzled by the "do not shake" statements printed on the can.  I would think that shaking the beverage in the can would froth it up a bit to make it more cappucino-like but they must have their reasons for not wanting it to be shaken before opening.  Regardless, this is a very good coffee drink that I will be enjoying more of in the future.  I hope you will enjoy it as well.

review/summary: Tasty, not too sweet
review/text: The only other cold cappucino drink I'm familiar with is Starbuck's Frappucino, and I like the illy issimo better.  There's more coffee flavor, and the chocolate essence is more like cocoa than chocolate.  If you've ever made hot chocolate with unsweetened cocoa powder, you'll know what I mean.  At 100 calories and only 6% carbs, it's almost health food!  I like that it's not too sweet.  I'll be buying this in the future.

Not so much with illy Issimo.<br /><br />Flavor:  As good as Starbucks, Lavazza or any other premium coffee<br /><br />Taste:  Illy has tried to minize on the calories (only 100 cals) - so it is not that great on taste, compare it with the starbucks Frappacino which is made with whole milk and obviously more filling<br /><br />Calories: 100 calories<br /><br />Ingredients:  Unfortunately it contains cellulose which is a factory product, so does starbucks and others, but a premium product like this should have not included this kind of ingredients.<br /><br />Overall - it is low on calories and OK on taste.

review/summary: If calories don't matter to you, might be worth a taste
review/text: Four individual coffee lovers from different cultural backgrounds conducted a sampling of this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> side by side with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and we had an exact split on the selection of a favorite between both samples.  Of note is that the Cappucino single serving can is a couple ounces greater and double the calories.  My personal preference was the Caffe because I found it to taste fresher, less like a canned beverage, less sweet, and stronger in the coffee flavor.<br /><br />I gave away my Nespresso machine and currently do not have an electric espresso maker other than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5F0">Delonghi EMK6 Alicia Electric Moka Espresso Coffee Maker</a> and prefer very strong coffee.  I still make it on the stovetop or prepare French drip coffee.  I sometimes use Splenda and froth steamed milk.  I used to roast green coffee beans but have also given away my roasters.  I grind beans prior to preparing coffee.  Just a little history for my frame of reference in writing this review.<br /><br />I'm not at all crazy about this coffee drink because my first impression was the sweetness, followed by the milky and very thin taste, and I experienced an aftertaste that I didn't care for.  I don't use much sugar, so that's perhaps why my taste buds were more sensitive, and as with all four tasters, although the ingredients listed Cocoa, we tasted very little in this beverage.  The coffee flavor was stronger than a simple cup of coffee, but the other flavors overwhelmed the coffee for me personally.  All three other tasters liked this flavor and said they would buy it if it's cost was around a dollar.  Two of the four tasters drink Chai regularly, always with lots of milk and sugar added.<br /><br />Our natural instinct is to shake a non-carbonated beverage, but there are strict instructions stating that the can is not to be shaken.  The can is nice to look at, smaller than a soda can and may cause problems in a beverage holder if you take these on a road trip.  At the current cost and weighing in at about 25 calories per ounce, I'm not going to recommend this product.

review/text: Strong coffee, lowfat milk and cocoa, all of my favorites in one can. What more could a person want on a hot summer day? This illy Cappucino really hit the spot after spending the day out in the sun and I put it on my shopping list for more as the weatherman said more sunny days are ahead.  You won't go wrong as this drink is smooth and thirst quenching and just plain good.

review/summary: A Cold Espresso Drink Rich in Flavor
review/text: My taste for cold coffee type drinks was developed late in life and happened pretty much accidently. I would drink coffee while working and become so inspired by my work that my coffee frequently became cold. But I drank it anyway. It tasted good enough that I soon experimented with commercial cold coffee drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos.<br /><br />The popular brand, however, doesn't do much for me so I began to look around for a more enjoyable substitute and decided to try illy issimo cappuccino, an Italian espresso drink made with low fat milk and cocoa. I loved it! This drink has a rich, deep coffee flavor that is not overbearing but lingers until you reach for the next drink. The taste-rich drink, not particularly healthy, is made of natural Arabica coffee.<br /><br />This drink is made by illy cafe, a company started in Trieste, Italy, the Adriatic port town where coffee first entered Europe. The company was started in 1933 by Francesco Illy, the man who developed the modern espresso machine. The ready-to-drink product is distributed globally through an agreement with Coco Cola. The drink is available in 140 different countries.<br /><br />I enjoyed this drink right out of the can but others get more pleasure by pouring into a glass and adding ice. The drink does come in a narrow, smaller 8.45 ounce can which does not excite me but I guess it's done for style reasons. Overall, an enjoyable drink.

At 100 calories a can and 1.5 grams of fat (in the video I misread it and said 15 grams of fat, NO NO! It's 1.5) it's a nice cold pick me up on a hot afternoon. The can says do not shake, important since my first impulse is to shake coffee drinks.<br /><br />Although Jim and I did not taste much of a cocoa taste, we would still recommend the cappuccino. The espresso taste is strong but not bitter, the drink is very smooth and tasty.

review/summary: Best Canned Cappucino
review/text: Illy is bringing their coffee brewing expertise to the much (often-deservedly) abused canned coffee drink market.  The results are products that are elevated over their peers.  Now, no one is going to do a blind taste test and confuse these canned drinks with a fresh brewed cup, but that isn't the point.  illy's cappucino drink mixes strong brewed coffee (espresso-style) with milk, a touch of cocoa and not too much sugar (usually overwhelming sweetness to mask poor quality coffee is the biggest failure of coffee drinks).<br /><br />These ingredients blend together to produce a drinkable and refreshing beverage.

review/summary: Very Tasty, but Pricy
review/text: The taste of this canned cappuccino style drink hits my sweet spot, literally.  If I had to describe it, it's basically very similar to Starbucks' mocha frappuccino - milky, very sweet, with a good coffee base smoothed out by a little cocoa.  (Of course, if you find that flavor combination too milky or too sweet, then this isn't for you).  The finish leaves some coffee and sweet notes, and the 8 ounce can was just right for a tasty, 100 calorie liquid snack.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the product currently seems overpriced at over $2 per can.  I didn't knock a star off for the price, however, because those can change frequently.  If you like the sound of a sweet, milky cappuccino drink and can find this at a price that works for you, then I highly recommend it.

review/text: -------------------------------------------------------<br />Illy Issimo Coffee Drink,<br />Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Can<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />I'm a fan of Illy coffee, an Italian brand best known for their vacuum-sealed whole beans and ground coffee varieties. I try to keep a can or two around in case civilization breaks down and I either want a little morning jolt before the aliens attack, or if need something to trade with the survivalists and atomic mutants.<br /><br />This aluminum-clad product is a pre-made, sweetened coffee drink not unlike the gooey Starbucks bottles that they sell in convenience stores, though not as syrupy, and maybe with better coffee. I found it pleasant, and refreshing on a hot afternoon. Worth checking out, although the coffee flavor could be more pronounced. Kind of weird that the drink is licensed to (or owned by) Coca-Cola, from Italy, and manufactured in Denmark. But hey, it that's the flavor of globalism, it tastes pretty good!

review/summary: Tastes like a Coffee Milkshake
review/text: For better or for worse, coffee in the United States gets associated with Starbucks. Even in those rare places without a Starbucks store, there is ground, instant, bottled, or canned Starbucks products on store shelves. Meanwhile, Illy, a brand well-known in Europe, is trying to make further inroads into the American market. This Illy Issimo Coffee drink reminds me of a more concentrated version of Starbucks bottled Frappuccino. However, it is less sweet and the coco makes me think of a milk shake. It tastes good and the espresso provides a great pick-me up, though to me I can barely taste any coffee, yet alone espresso, which is something I would expect from a coffee drink. I might grab a can of this on though go, but I doubt I would order an entire case of this particular drink.

review/summary: Very smooth tasting but a little too sweet for my tastes
review/text: My wife and I are big coffee drinkers. As an International Flight Attendant, she has traveled a lot to Europe and says that this illy cappucino tastes like a "European" coffee. When I asked her what she meant by that she said that it was smooth and mellow. I concur. And I guess it makes sense that it tastes "European" because illy is an Italian company.<br /><br />This tastes nothing like a Starbucks French Roast or Sumatra, for instance, which are both dark and bold tasting. The illy Cappucino is way more subtle in its flavor. Subtle but still there is a distinctive coffee taste that I enjoyed. There is added sugar however and for me, it's a too sweet. I do not normally sweeten my coffee beverages much if at all. Many people do sweeten their coffee though and for those, the sweetness may be just right for them.<br /><br />The ingredients seem pretty straightforward and that is good. Regarding the sugar, a single serving, 1 cup, contains 18g of sugar. A teaspoon of sugar is approximately 4g so this essentially has the equivalent of 4.5 teaspoons of sugar per serving.<br /><br />I drank and I liked. But I would not purchase again because of the added sugar. But if you don't mind the sugar and want a convenient way to enjoy a cappucino coffee beverage, you'd probably like this illy coffee drink.

review/summary: Smoother Than Other Illi Issimo Products, Likable Enough But Not Something I Would Frequent
review/text: Through the years, I've tried just about every pre-made coffee beverage imaginable. I am a coffee lover and enthusiast, so I'm married to the idea of buying a can or bottle of a delicious coffee based product that I'll live happily ever after with. My experiences, however, have yet to yield bliss. Some are just fine, but nothing has ever made me say "Wow! I'd like to drink this all the time!" I had heard some positive things about the illy issimo brand, so given the opportunity--I sampled both their Caffe and their Cappuccino.<br /><br />Caffe (2 1/2 stars) is, in their own words, an Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink. At first, I thought this drink had a strong and pronounced coffee flavor. But something is slightly off. The more I drank, it seemed too sweet and too bitter at once, which is a strange and not altogether pleasant combination. As it is essentially comparable to drinking an iced espresso, it may not be as palatable as some of their other creations. But, it's not really something that I would sample again. And at an approximate cost of $2.00 per can (only 6.8 ounce), this serves more as a caffeine boost than a refreshing beverage. Made with real Arabica coffee, I was also intrigued by the "Do Not Shake" warning which left me with the unappetizing visual of the particulate matter that must still be in the liquid drink (fine for Turkish coffee, not so appealing for something in a can).<br /><br />Cappucino (3 1/2 stars) is, in their own words, an Espresso Style Coffee Drink with Lowfat Milk and Cocoa. So, at 8.45 ounces this is a slightly bigger drink. As some of the harshness is buffered by the milk and cocoa combination, this one easily had a more pleasant taste. Still, a bit sweet for my liking but better overall. I'm still not blown away and I won't be a regular purchaser of this, or any illi issimo brand drinks, but I didn't dislike this one. Nice enough once in a while, but not inspiring enough to purchase a case. I guess I'll remain a fresh made kind of coffee drinker! KGHarris, 6/12.

review/text: The Cappuccino illy is my kind of taste. It has a good coffee flavor, slight sweetness and is refreshing. I also like the fact that an 8.45 oz. can is only 100 calories. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars because I prefer to get a freshly made cappuccino at a coffee place, but this will do fine too.

review/text: I'm a cold coffee and milk kind of girl. I don't like overly sweet drinks. Illy Issimo Cappucino is great! It is very comparable in taste to Starbucks Bottles Frappucino in the Coffee Flavor. Only, this little can has half the calories of the Starbucks drink and half the sugar. (Without losing anything to taste and no artificial sweetener.) I'd say that is a big win!<br /><br />One can contains 81 mg of caffeine. 100 calories. 1.5g fat. 5 mg cholesterol. 60 mg sodium. 19 g carbs. 4g protein. 10% RDV calcium.

review/text: I am not usually one for canned drinks but I found myself interested in the Illy Issimo Coffee Drink Cappuccino, and I really enjoyed the taste of this beverage. I did however make the mistake of shaking the can before opening it, I then read the instructions and had to wait a few minutes before opening it, also I split the drink in half and tried it warm and cold, it is definitely better warm than cold in my opinion. I would like to see it in a bigger size, but it is still a very good drink.

review/text: Illy Issimo's Cappucino in a can reminds me of the similar Starbucks frappuccino bottles.  The drinks from Starbucks are slightly sweeter and have about 25% more calories than this Cappucino.  While I prefer this drink, it is far from tasting like a freshly brewed iced cappucino.  The flavor is not as pronounced and the aroma is very weak.  There is a noticeable earthy undertone that tastes a bit like wood.  One can has a little over 80mg of caffeine.

review/text: I actually did enjoy this at first but by the time I hit the bottom of the can I found I liked it less.  Not that illy issimo Cappucino is bad.  I like that it has the cream in it and is not straight coffee, but it's still not quite up to par with some other coffee drinks I've had in the past.  Decent, but it's not very strong in flavor, which is nice if you're not a big coffee drinker.  Could have used a little more flavor for me and been slightly less of that "out of a can" type of coffee drink.  Best chilled, for sure, but even then it was still a little lacking.

review/summary: What comes in a can can't
review/text: I understand that, when it comes to coffees, something that comes in a can can't compete with the real thing and this 'issimo' doesn't. It's Cappucino because the writing on the can says it is but, Cappuccino or not, it's made out of coffee, a little cocoa, some sugar and milk so most ingredients are present. Only the the fresh taste and the fresh aroma, the froth and the Cappuccino steam are missing.<br /><br />Now, if we are to compare bland make-believe Cappuccinos, the 'illy issimo' that comes in a can is almost indistinguishable from the Starbucks version that comes in a bottle. How do I know? I did a blind test and I found it was difficult to tell which was which except for the Starbucks being a little sweeter and bolder but only a very little.<br /><br />My fair rating should be a bland 3-stars (It's Okay). Drink the 'issimo' if you must or if the real thing is unobtainable but it's coffee that comes in a can so don't expect the impossible.

review/summary: From Coca~Cola Cappuccino to Go I like it but ....
review/text: I have had numerous brands of Cappuccino-in-a-can to go; this one, by Coca~Cola aka "Coke"; is somewhat different. After having it in the refrigerator overnight.<br /><br />Overall with my experience with others; I give it an ok - there are better ones out there, however, this one packs a lot of punch with CAFFEINE even though it only packs 100 calories in one can.  In my humble opinion, for those who just can't wake up in the morning and have a long day at work or for College/University students would find this handy for their term exam time for it WILL KEEP YOU AWAKE!<br /><br />It was not bitter, but it did taste old even though the expiration date was well ahead of time; it did have something of a old-coffee taste that had been sitting around for quite some time, however, that could be Coca~Cola / Coke's version of how they created this Illy Issimo Coffee Cappuccino. It was well balanced but I did find the after-taste somewhat bothersome, that which I am exceeding picky about.<br /><br />For want of a better words - When one drinks this, the balance of cream or milk, coffee, and sugar were all done exceptionally well but, the coffee itself to me, personally, tasted something that had been sitting for several days - but that might be just me.

review/text: I enjoyed illy issimo coffee drink Cappucino flavor.  It isn't as icky sweet as some of the Starbuck frappucino's and such, so for me that's a plus.  It has a nice coffee flavor...not too bitter and just a small amount of sweetness.  This drink isn't for those of you who aren't really coffee lovers that only tolerate really sweet coffee drinks.  It tastes like coffee...just perfect for the true coffee lover.  The size is just right with 81 grams of caffeine for it 8.45 ounces.  This product is manufactured in Denmark for the Coca-Cola Company.  They are a little over $2 a piece on Amazon.  That's a little pricey for a regular habit, but it is much more competitive than a $5 drink at the coffee shops.<br /><br />Overall, it was tasty, and I would recommend it.

And not quite as weirdly viscous as other coffee/milk drinks.<br /><br />3)  The can is too thin to stay safely in my car's drink holder.<br /><br />So...I would drink this again if offered - but it might not be my first choice.

review/text: When you don't want to pack a big thermos of fresh coffee, this little can is a good alternative for picnics, beach, lunch. I usually drink coffee with half and half and no sugar, so this can was a bit sweet for my taste and a bit thin in texture. I added ice and a splash of half and half to a tall glass and it was okay. The coffee flavor was good and the hint of cocoa could be tasted, however there was a bit of a metallic taste from the can. I liked it better than Starbucks coffee, which usually has a burnt taste to me. My favorite coffee always was Dunkin Donuts, but even that has changed over the years, (or maybe my taste has change). I gave this three stars for the coffee flavor but not the five stars because it was too sweet. It's okay for a quick fix.

review/text: I normally drink hot, black coffee, so anything with milk or sugar is outside my comfort zone.<br /><br />This was one of the better cold cappuccino-style drinks I've had. It was not bitter, had a good, real coffee taste, and the sugar was sweet without being overwhelming.<br /><br />I think Issimo's ingredients (and I also tried Issimo's milkless <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> drink) are high quality. I drink high-end coffee, and this tasted similar, with the addition of milk, of course. I preferred this drink to the Caffe, though that one was okay too.<br /><br />The taste is smooth and it does not leave a bitter aftertaste that I often associate with these iced coffee drinks. It does not taste like a child's version of coffee where they throw in a lot of sugar.<br /><br />So - Tasted good, with an adult level of sweetness, low calories and a good portion! I might get it again for summer days when even I can't take hot coffee.

All I can taste is milk and sugar, making it indistinct from other such coffee beverages like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AHMCA">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink</a> and competitors. It's good, mind you, but nothing like fresh cappuccino. The can makes it very easy to toss in a bag and take with you on the road or to the office.<br /><br />The can warns you not to shake, but I instinctively shook it immediately upon taking it out of the fridge and it exploded into a small mess! Apparently, pressure can build up inside like a soda, even though this product is not carbonated. 100 calories per can (15 from fat). Made in Denmark, distributed by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />Carrageenan is an emulsifier (keeps fats and liquids from separating) derived from seaweed. Cellulose gum (and I'm guessing cellulose gel) improves viscosity. Potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate are pH regulator, used to control acidity. All these are natural and vegan/vegetarian additives common in the food industry. Why can't it just be coffee, milk, and sugar?

It seems almost wrong to put it in a can, but the flavor profile does hold up overall. This is primarily because unlike other canned drinks, this coffee is not super sweet or filled with strange ingredients. It has a little sugar, milk, and cocoa, none of which overpower the coffee, but instead balance it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of iced coffee with sugar and cream, you will likely enjoy this brand.  It is more coffee than dessert.

review/summary: Lowfat Milk Overwhelms Coffee, Cocoa Flavors
review/text: Because I like Starbucks Mocha coffee very much (is it coffee or cocoa?), I expected to like this ILLY ISSIMO "Cappuccino" drink. But what a surprise! It turned out to be a strange, thin, "milky drink". The low-fat milk taste dominates, and the coffee and cocoa flavors seem barely there. At least the drink does not taste sugary, as does the otherwise quite decent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">ILLY ISSIMO "Caff&egrave;"</a> alternative. However, this larger-sized "Cappuccino" actually has far more sugar, at 18g.<br /><br />I do not know whether this canned coffee product is supposed to be consumed hot, chilled, or at room temperature. The can includes a "do not shake" warning, but has no other instructions. I tried the product after chilling for one day in the refrigerator, and after warming in a microwave-safe cup. It tasted about the same both ways. Perhaps it was a little better hot, but it came out of the microwave with an "unmixed instant coffee" swirl on top.<br /><br />This "Italian espresso-style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa" certainly did not convert me to canned coffee drinks, especially ones with 100 calories in a single 8.45 fl. oz. can. Because this ILLY ISSIMO "Cappuccino" tastes odd, and mostly like milk, I award it 2 stars on Amazon's scale ("I don't like it").

review/text: When I drink coffee I like it with half and half or light cream. I like the consistency and flavor of a high fat cream product mixed with the coffee or espresso based drink (no matter whether it is a hot or cold or frozen espresso based drink). The illy issimo cappucino is made with lowfat milk and indeed it tastes thin and watery.<br /><br />The flavor of this espresso is pretty mild, I think. My favorite coffee is a dark robust french roast. Although this illy issimo drink is made with espresso as a base I'd call it mild but others would say it's medium. I'm a Starbucks lover and I love the cafe au lait New Orleans style coffee with chickory also.<br /><br />I rate this drink 3 stars = It's Okay because for me, it's too thin due to the lowfat milk and it's flavor is not quite bold enough for my palate. If you like lowfat milk in your coffee and if you like mild or medium boldness you will probably like this better than I did.

To me it tastes more like a cold mocha than a cappucino.  Taste is relative (and surely based in part on what we're accustomed to drinking); I like it (and normally Peet's Italian Roast is my drink of choice).  But thanks to the calorie count, for me at least, it's a sometime treat and not a morning ritual.<br /><br />For those who choose to drink it regularly, the fact that it's preservative free and the lowfat milk is rBST-free should be a bonus.  Although this does mean that the cans are labeled with expiration dates.  And the 'do not shake' admonition does not indicate that the drink is carbonated; it's full almost to the brim and shaking causes the sugary milk to spew.<br /><br />The Cappucino Coffee Drink is most flavorful when served cold, and, be warned, those who choose to plop in a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an afternoon pick-me-up had best share.

review/summary: illy issimo cappuccino
review/text: Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment.  The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids.  To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

review/text: This is a 100 calorie coffee drink. I put it in the refrigerator and after it was cold took it out and automatically shook it up - it DOES say DO NOT shake, so it fizzed out a bit. It has an enjoyable coffee taste and does not taste like it came from a can.<br />I liked this drink - it was refreshing and if you like coffee, this is a nice summer drink.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I didn't have high expectations for this cappucino drink, because I find many packaged coffee drinks taste too strong or artificial.  I was very pleased with this one from the first sip!  The flavor is very mild, but you can still taste the coffee.  It's sweet, but not too sweet. There's no bitterness, and it tastes very natural. In my opinion, it tastes much better than the bottled cappucino that is so popular.  I wish the serving size was a little larger, but otherwise I think it's the perfect prepackaged cappucino.

review/summary: Creamy and Low Fat!
review/text: I had this first thing this morning, and immediately signed up for Subscribe and Save.  This is SO GOOD.<br /><br />It's got a great creamy coffee taste -- but it's low fat.  I'm not sure how they get it to taste so sweet and creamy with only 100 calories (15 from fat), but they do, and I'm not complaining.  Also - it's really convenient that the caffeine content is on the can -- it's 81 mg.  I'm on a caffeine restricted diet (doc wants 200 mg or less) so it's great that I didn't have to estimate.<br /><br />I missed the instructions that were RIGHT THERE on the can "DO NOT SHAKE" and shook it anyway.  Oops.  It's exploded just a bit on opening.  No major mess, but there was a bit. I'll remember next time.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a wonderful cold coffee drink to start your morning.  It doesn't taste overly processed like a "coffee style drink".  It tastes like a nice cold coffee+cream.  Love it, and will probably be having one every morning.  It's not cheap, but it's not starbucks pricing either ...

I would probably buy whatever is a better value at the time. Again, this product and the product from Starbucks seem to taste the same to me and are of the same high quality.

review/summary: Delightfully Yummy!
review/text: Based on some of the reviews here, I'm wondering what some of the other reviewers here were expecting.  If you expect ANY canned/bottled coffee drink to taste like a fresh iced coffee from a local coffee house (that has actual frothed cream in it and was sugared to your own personal preference), you are going to be disappointed.  I am comparing it to other coffee drinks that also use lowfat milk in them.<br /><br />I'm drinking this wonderful little beverage, as I type the review.  As is consistent with the illy issimo coffee drinks, it's refreshingly restrained on the sugar.  Just enough to compliment the coffee, without trying to turn it into a confection.  This has just enough of the lowfat mik in it to give a slight "creamy" taste, without overpowering the flavor of the coffee, as well.<br /><br />There is a perfect blending of the cocoa, cream and sugar to combine with (and compliment) the coffee flavor.  It's not quite as robust as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. But then again, if you desired that you wouldn't be drinking a cappuccino.<br /><br />I think the illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave; is probably better for a quick wake up call on a rough Monday morning, and this is better suited for around 3 o'clock to help get you to through the rest of the work day.<br /><br />Serve chilled, and whatever you do, don't shake it. It might "asplode". :)

review/text: There aren't any surprises here when it comes to taste. This tastes like iced coffee. Very, very sweet iced coffee. It is kind of odd that the can says don't shake, because the coffee doesn't have any kind of caffeinated feel or taste to it. It will do in a pinch, although I don't think I would choose this over a bottled Starbucks Frappuccino.

review/text: There's nothing impressive about the taste of Illy issimo Cappucino flavored coffee drink, in my opinion.  It tastes like a cheaper version of the famous coffee house ready-to-drink cappucino you can find at convenience stores near you.  The can has 100 calories, and just wasn't impressed with the taste.  Not worth the calories or the price.

review/summary: Better Than Their Caffe Offering
review/text: Yesterday I tried and reviewed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">Caff&egrave;</a> drink from Illy Issimo with less than stellar results.  Today I was hoping for a better experience with their Cappuccino.  I am happy to report that I liked this one better than the Caffe.  I drink hot cappuccinos on a regular basis, and this is not a bad chilled version.  I would tweak it a couple of ways.  First it is a little sweeter than I would like, and I would be curious how this would be without any added sugar.  Second it has a bit of a twang in the aftertaste.  I am guessing this is from the potassium citrate.  I'm not sure what the purpose of this ingredient is, and again I would be curious how it would taste without it.  However I suspect it is meant to act as a natural preservative rather than to enhance the flavor.  For similar comparisons this Cappuccino weighs in with (8.45 oz, 100 calories, 81 mg caffeine) while a tall Starbucks Iced Non-fat Latte has (12 oz, 70 calories, 75 mg caffeine).  I would prefer the Starbucks option better, but the Illy Issimo option is OK.

review/summary: No Worries for Your Local Coffee House
review/text: I love cappucino, at home or at my local coffee house, so I hoped that this illy issimo cappuncino coffee drink would be a good substitute.  Alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />Here's my take on this cappucino drink:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  Convenience -- With these cans at home or at the office, you can heat up a full cup of cappucino in a minute in the microwave. No dragging out the cappucino maker or running out to get a cappucino.<br /><br />2.  Foam -- After heating, you will see a small amount of foam on the top of the coffee.<br /><br />3.  Low-Cal -- Only 100 calories in this cappucino,<br /><br />and therein lies my problem.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1.  Taste -- Even though I love cappucino, I don't have it often.  When I do give in to the urge, I want it rich with two packs of raw sugar, whole milk, and a generous dash of cinnamon on the foam.  Heavenly.  But this cappucino just doesn't measure up to my idea of what cappucino should be.<br /><br />2.  Off Flavor -- There's an odd taste of tin in my cup.  Maybe it's the cinnamon, maybe it's the can -- I can't say, but I can say that the flavor is tinged with an odd tinny taste.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />If you're not picky about cappucino, this could be your drink.  I'll wait and get mine just the way I like it at my local coffee house.

review/summary: A little better than the Caffe flavor....maybe it's the cocoa.
review/text: I enjoyed this cappuccino more than the caffe flavor.  It wasn't quite as sour as the caffe.  It has a warning at the top side of the can a note that says "Do Not Shake" but it's in very small writing.  I'm hearing from other people that the contents will explode if you shake it however I did shake the caffe prior to opening with no ill effects.  Both of them had been well chilled prior to opening so maybe that makes a difference as far as exploding.  The description on the can reads "Italian espresso style coffee drink with low fat milk and cocoa".  It has 100 calories for the 8.45 ounces.  It's 100% natural Arabica.  It contains 2% fat, 5% saturated fat, 2% cholesterol, 3% sodium, 6% carbohydrates, 3% fiber, 10% Calcium.  It is not a significant source of trans fat, vitamin A or C or iron.  The contents are listed as coffee, low fat milk, sugar, cocoa power, potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, and carrageenan.  It is distributed by Coca-Cola Company under license of ILKO Coffee International, a product of Denmark.  There's an expiration date on the bottom of the can.<br /><br />3.5/5 stars

review/summary: Don't shake it before you drink it ...
review/text: The top of the can is clear. It says "Do not shake." However, on anything except sodas, it is automatic for me to do a little bit of shaking as I open the fridge, especially when it comes in the form of coffee. So my first morning surprise involved a bit of spray ... fortunately not too big, but it woke me up even before I had the caffeine in the illy issimo. But it does speak to the quality of the item, you don't have to shake it, it is already fully mixed.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of canned (or bottled) coffee, and would prefer to make my own. So I wasn't sure about trying this particular item. However, I was surprised at how nice it tasted! Even better, unlike some others, this one did not leave me with an acid stomach ... I have gastritis and some coffees can really mess me up.<br /><br />It is a good tasting coffee, mild and just the right hint of chocolate, not overwhelming. Even the aftertaste is pleasant.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving it five stars involves the cost of the item, since it is pretty pricy, but hey, we pay an awful lot for good coffee these days! And this really is good coffee. Just don't shake it before you open it.

review/summary: Mediocre.  Can't compare to Starbucks Frappuccinos.
review/text: Competing with a company like Starbucks must be different.  To succeed, you either need to be creative enough to stand out or of such a high quality, you can gain traction.  Illycaff&egrave;, the Italian coffee company that created this product, is actually decades older than Starbucks.  However, they're relatively new (since 2009) to producing the single-serving canned beverages known as "Illy Issimo."  One thing that's for sure, if you're going to compete with a giant like Starbucks, it helps to have a giant of a partner.  Illycaff&egrave; has Coca-Cola, so we can call it a fair fight.  There are five different flavours of the Illy Issimo canned coffees: Caffe, Sugar-Free Caffe, Cappuccino, Mochaccino, and Latte Macchiato.<br /><br />The first flavour I decided to try was the classic Cappuccino.  Here's a breakdown of the elements:<br /><br />Smell: Dull, unappetizing, with only hints of a Cappuccino aroma.<br /><br />Taste: Quite the same as the smell.  It's not a vibrant Cappuccino taste and, though brewed with Arabica, the coffee flavour is just not strong enough.  The aftertaste, also, isn't very good.  It really can't compete with the Starbucks canned & bottle releases.<br /><br />Nutrition: 100 calories and 18g of sugar is not that bad for a full coffee drink like this.  However, if you again compare it to the Starbucks Frappuccinos, it's not a big enough difference to warrant the nutrition difference.  The Frappuccinos contain only 50 more calories and 8g of sugar, but keep in mind the Starbucks bottle contains quite a bit more than these cans.<br /><br />Overall, while this Illy Issimo Cappuccino drink is convenient, the taste just isn't nearly good enough to compete with the at-home Starbucks releases.<br /><br />-AP3-

But one sip and I was sold - this is wonderful! Smooth, tasty and the flavors blend together very well with the coffee.<br /><br />Although it is very good sipped right from the can at room temperature, I enjoyed it even more when poured over ice. Great way to cool down on a hot day.<br /><br />The only way to make this better would be to have a decaf option available. That would make for a great dessert drink at night when I can't deal with the caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommend!

review/summary: Very watery / thin, but tastes decent.
review/text: I decided to try this illy issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink, as I do enjoy the Starbucks and Caribou chilled coffee drinks from the grocery store as an occasional indulgence. My immediate reaction upon trying this was that it is very thin and watery. I'm assuming a big reason for that is they use lowfat milk. The Starbucks and Caribou drinks I usually buy are slightly more unhealthy than this drink, but they have a rich, flavorful taste and are slightly more substantive compared to this drink. Since I only drink them on the rare occasion (maybe a couple times a month), the health differences aren't a huge deal for me.<br /><br />This Cappucino does have a nice light flavor to it, with equal hints of cocoa and coffee, but it's not nearly as boldly flavored as the aforementioned drinks. Considering the price is just as expensive as others in the category, I don't think this would be my first choice when on the go and in need of a quick pick-me-up. However, I wouldn't be completely opposed to buying it for a change of pace down the road.<br /><br />If you enjoy a lightly flavored coffee drink that's not too thick, you'd probably love the illy issimo line of drinks. Either way, it's worth a try if you can buy it in a single can to see how you like it before choosing to buy it in bulk. Just as a side note, the product touts being "Italian Espresso Style," but it's actually a product of Denmark not Italy (for anybody keeping score at home).

review/summary: Great espresso flavor with light sweetness.
review/text: This is one heck of a good cold cappuccino drink. I like this much more than the syrup sweet thick Starbucks variety.<br /><br />Illy is a maker of excellent espresso coffee and machines. They are all over Europe, where the red square with Illy on it is visible, the espresso will be good - never great or spectacular, but never bad; always the same, always very good. It makes sense that they would produce a very nice clean not too sweet iced cappuccino drink in a can.<br /><br />The comparison to Starbucks Frappuccinos is just too easy to make. Starbucks packs 180 calories and a lot more sugar in their drink. They are good and tailored to the sweet tooth, more like a sweet soda pop than an espresso beverage. Illy's drink is about half as sweet and feels a lot thinner in the mouth. These are all good things. There's a good strong flavor of an espresso. The milk flavor is slightly burnt or caramel, a good flavor that reminds me of steamed milk.<br /><br />Illy does something a little bit different from Starbucks. Where Starbucks builds their mouth feel with sugar, Illy has chosen to use a bit of gum in the mix (carageenan, cellulose, and cellulose gel). It's a very simple food science issue, milk and coffee alone will end up feeling like water from the can. In order to make the drink taste rich, they have to add some body to it - Starbucks chose sugar and Illy chose gum. I'd take the gum over the additional sugar any day of the week.<br /><br />I really like this drink a lot more than Starbucks. I love the clean espresso and milk flavor without the sweetness. I liked this drink so much I've purchased a four pack and shared it with my wife. She really likes this drink also.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AHMCA">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink, 9.5 Ounce Bottles-(pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: A sweet does of Vitamin C--caffeine, that is!
review/text: There are 81 mg of caffeine in this drink, which is 20 mg less than in a 7 oz cup of freshly brewed coffee (I figure there is about 7 oz coffee here, and the rest is the lowfat milk and etc) but, drinking it in the afternoon is enough to raise me from my morning crash. It is advertised as an Italian espresso style of coffee, and it does have that nice rich flavor.<br /><br />I don't typically like canned coffee drinks, because of that...canned taste. But, to its credit, that acerbic bite was only present in my first sip. The subsequent sipping was pretty flavorful. The coffee taste was good quality, and the cocoa powder added a nice creamy zing.<br /><br />It says DO NOT SHAKE in all caps, so I speculated that there was some carbonation to it. But, there isn't. So, if anyone knows why we're not supposed to shake it, I'd love to be informed!<br /><br />So, for those afternoon slumps and a not-too-sweet pick-me-up, I recommend this cold beverage. I always add cream and sugar to my coffee, so for black-coffee drinkers, I cannot be 100% sure if it will be your cuppa. However, it doesn't have the cloying, overly sweet taste of some of those other bottled and canned coffee drinks on the market.

review/summary: Mocha, is that you?
review/text: This is my second illy issimo coffee drink. It's labelled Cappucino, but it's an "Italian style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa", and in my book that makes it a mocha.<br /><br />It's not bad. Straight from the can it's bland, but I nuked it as I like my mocha hot, and it tasted better that way. The color is unappetizing as it looks like a weak mocha. Tastewise, it's not too sweet, better than a lot of over sweetened coffee drinks. The coffee taste was a bit weak as was the cocoa taste. But you can't please everyone. Coffee is such a personal thing. I make my mochas with dark roast so the coffee taste comes through and only use a certain cocoa power brand so my mocha is strong with a hint of cocoa. This one is weak in comparison.<br /><br />It depends on what you want. If you don't want a very strong mocha and like convenience in a can, then this is for you. Purists would want to make their own anyway, so this isn't for you. Overall, it's not bad for the casual coffee/mocha drinker to whom convenience is important.<br /><br />And lastly when I went to put my white cup in the sink I noticed that it had a very strong stain so I went to brush my teeth right away.

review/summary: Light Bodied, Creamy, Easy to Drink
review/text: Illy Issimo Cappuccino is a new drnk for me; a brand name I had not tried until recently but one I was anxious to sample. I like cappuccino beverages and I am a regular consumer of coffee, so this beverage sounded like something suitable to my tastes.<br /><br />This cappuccino drink is a little different from what I expected. Poured from the can into a glass, it looks like chilled hot chocolate with a mocha scent. It also contains a little less volume than I would prefer. The can is only 8.45 fluid ounces in size, so it is consumed completely in a very short time.<br /><br />As for the taste, it isn't as rich as I was expecting. I wanted something a little stronger and fuller bodied- something closer to an espresso. The taste of this drink, while certainly not bad, isn't very strong. It is chocolaty and coffee- like, as expected, with a creamy, medium to light body. It tends toward the sweet side, which is also not my preference. I drink all coffee- related beverages black, so I am not used to tasting sugar with my roasted brew. In addition, the sugar flavor in this beverage is different in taste and part of the reason is because the manufacturer uses beet sugar. This is probably healthier than refined sugar, but it does result in a little different flavor that may not suit the preferences of different drinkers.<br /><br />I like a good cappuccino and this one is really not a bad selection. A few tweaks of the recipe would make it a little better, but I agree that it is very easy drinking and has enough good taste to recommend.

review/text: illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans<br /><br />I've seen these and other illy cans and packages on store shelves forever. This is my first taste of one of their products. Boy, am I late to the party! This stuff is tasty! I am a coffee drinker but I rarely get a cold coffee drink at Starbucks or other shops. I do get cappuccinos though. This is different. The instructions on the can are to not shake it. So, you are not going to get a frothy top foam. I took a picture and will upload it. It has a nice coffee with added ingredients color. There is cocoa and milk in it as well as sugar. At 100 calories for 8.5 ounces it's not that bad as sweetened drinks go, still 18 grams of sugar is a lot. Then again it tastes good so that's what's important with this type of beverage.<br /><br />I liked it far more than I thought I would. It passes the treat beverage test. Tasty, refreshing and a bit of a caffeine boost. Great stuff!

review/text: I really enjoyed the illy issimo coffee drink and I felt like it was superior to other similar products on the market (i.e. the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AHMCA">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink</a>).  The coffee was a relatively dark roast with a full flavor and the drink itself had an appropriate amount of cream and sweetener (allowing the coffee to remain as the main focus of the drink).  The drink comes in can sized to substitute for a morning or afternoon cup of coffee and it's excellent served chilled.  This would be my first choice for a chilled coffee beverage compared to others currently offered (e.g <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AHMCA">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBWKG">Java Monster Coffee</a>.

This drink is much more lightly sweetened, but was still very smooth poured over ice. My wife and I both enjoyed it.

review/summary: Convenient and tasty!
review/text: The only other canned or bottled coffee I've tried was Starbucks, and I was not sure I liked it, but that was related mostly to the fact that I don't really like French roast coffee like they offer. However, this illy issimo doffee drink is great. It is advertised as an "Italian espresso with low fat milk and cocoa" and I love it!<br /><br />First, the flavor is wonderful. This produce is made from "100% natural Arabica coffee beans", which accounts from the great taste. Then it also has low fat milk, so the calorie count is a low 100 calories in comparison to the often 250 calories of other cappuccino drinks. And I love chocolate, so the addition of cocoa just makes the drink perfect for me. It is not too chocolaty - it has just enough blend of cocoa and coffee for a great balance.<br /><br />Next, I like the slender can. It carries well in my purse/bag on the way to work. I can tuck it in a bag and then pop it in the fridge at work to cool it off for a wonderful cold drink mid-morning or mid-afternoon when I need it.<br /><br />Finally, this product is distributed by the Coca-Cola firm, which for me is a trusted company.<br /><br />So enjoy! And remember to recycle when you are finished!!

review/summary: Flat and uninteresting coffee energy drink, but low in calories/fat compared to competition
review/text: This product is obviously trying to be a tastier and better version of the typical energy drink.  With 81mg of caffeine, it will definitely give you a boost.  But it seems many drinks like this are either chock full of chemicals or are highly caloric.  I was pleasantly surprised to read that in this 8.45oz can, there are a mere 100 calories and 1.5g of fat.  Yet there are 4g of protein, so it's not just energy but some protein as well.  For those of you on Weight Watchers, it is 3 PointsPlus points.  The product is distributed by cCca-Cola, but is made in Denmark.<br /><br />Upon opening the can and taking a sip, I was surprised by how thin and watery the drink tasted.  It didn't taste bad, but not was not particularly flavorful or good either.  Perhaps this is because it is only lightly sweetened and has low fat, but there was just no body or interesting flavor to the drink.  I think it's just not good coffee.  It just tasted flat and lifeless.  I've sipped cold Starbucks left in my car for a few hours before and quite enjoyed it - this was nothing near that.<br /><br />All of that being said, competing products such as Starbucks bottled Frappucino has almost twice the calories, fat, and significantly more carbs.  Possibly this is why they taste better, but as I said before, I think the coffee they use in this drink is also not high quality.<br /><br />So for a light chilled coffee beverage, it's not a terrible choice, but not a particularly interesting or tasty one either.  I might buy it in the future, but it won't be a regular drink for me.

review/text: I tried this illy issimo Cappuccino coffee for a quick energy lift before lunch. The drink is made in Denmark (not Italy) and distributed by the Coca-Cola Co.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>The AL can chilled quickly (2.5 hrs) in the fridge OR pour in a glass and heat it up in the microwave.<br />>OK taste of Arabica coffee + lowfat milk.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />>Medium flavor and sweetness; a bit watered down; nothing exceptional.<br />>Per 8.45oz. can: 18g sugar, 5mg cholesterol, 81mg caffeine, and 60mg sodium.  My family and I try to minimize ingredients that are associated with diabetes, dental decay, heart diseases, and high blood pressure.  Those ingredients don't seem too worrisome per 8.45oz. but I drink at least EIGHT x 8oz. of drinks (water or natural juices) each day.<br />>Priced at $2.11 per 8.45oz can, x8 cans (estimated) per day for me...that adds up quickly.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Tasty drink for an occasional indulgence but we wouldn't make it our family's daily beverage due to excessive intake of the aforementioned ingredients.  Give it a try, some may enjoy the flavor and couldn't care less about the ingredients; make your own informed decision!

review/text: I love Cappuccino in general and I like the idea of having it in a can that you can take on the go. I had mixed feelings about the taste of illy Cappuccino though. I liked the taste for the most part but it had a funny milk taste to it. It tasted more like skim milk than low-fat milk and I just didn't care for the taste of the milk. I enjoyed drinking it but not as much as expected. Each 8.45 fluid ounce can has 100 calories which is a little more than I would expect for such a small size. For the cost of this product I would think that they could be a little more generous with the size of the drink. It's nice and convenient while on the go and I like the energy boost from the caffeine.

review/summary: Light Tasting Coffee for the Light Drinker, NOT for Your Regular Coffee Drinker
review/text: As a heavy coffee drinker (born and raised in Seattle, it's in our blood) I've become... somewhat addicted to caffeine and by that I mean that with all the soda/pop I purchase I might as well purchase some stock options in Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola *light bulb*.<br /><br />I am mostly addicted to Diet Pepsi and Canada Dry Ginger Ale but I also dabble in Starbucks canned mocha energy drinks despite the fact that my burn-out is longer than my energy buzz.  Needless to say, I prefer heavy stuff and am very picky about the taste.  After given the chance to try the Illy Issimo cappuccino cans, I'm not really that convinced that I want to switch or even buy them in bulk.<br /><br />In short, the Illy Issimo coffee energy drinks are lighter for your... lighter person, I guess.  They are lighter in taste, calories, and size so they're nice if you're a petite office worker but, as an hourly-wage slave laborer in retail, I'm on my feet all day and I gotta have something stronger.  It just isn't for me, but I won't discount the fact that there are others that would probably love it.  For those wishing to watch their calorie intake but indulge in a little bit of caffeine, I would suggest this product but, for everyone else, there's Starbucks energy drinks.

review/text: Since Pacific Foods has stopped making their coffee drinks, I tried this to see if it would be a good replacement product for me.<br />I occasionally work part-time, and because of where I work, it is not always possible to leave and go get a snack or coffee, so I carry my "kit" which usually contains: Yogurt, fresh fruit, a sandwich, several bottles of water, and a coffee drink.<br /><br />I really liked the taste of the Illy Issimo Coffee drink and the fact that a can only has 100 calories is a real plus in my opinion. Other good points are that it is made with<br />no preservatives and rBST-free milk.<br />I am not sure about beet sugar vs. cane, as I usually choose cane sugar when shopping, but it doesn't affect the taste in a negative way, so it wasn't really a reason to lower the star score.<br /><br />Recap of the pros: Low calorie, small and light can, no preservatives, rBST-free milk, and great tastes.<br /><br />No real cons, other than it is a little bit on the expensive side, but with suscribe and save, it is still much less expensive than a cup of coffee from Starbucks.

review/summary: Good but price is way too high
review/text: The Cappucino is good, not too strong and not weak.  Hubby likes it more than I did and he's the real coffee drinker around here, I asked if he'd buy it and he said he'd definitely buy it if the price is good.  Unfortunately the price is not good.  You can get a gas station cappucino for less or buy a cappucino maker.  A maker would make up for itself cost-wise in a short time if you're not spending tons of money on buying the cappucino.

review/summary: 100 Calories But Not Very Full & Creamy
review/text: My reference of standard for canned cappuccino is Starbucks and compared to that this cappuccino feels light and less creamy because it uses low fat milk and does not have as much sugar. So you compromise low calories for less creamy and full cappuccino.

review/summary: As Good as More Expensive Chain Shops
review/text: If you're still paying $3-$5 for an iced coffee at a national chain code shop you're wasting your money. This is just as good and in many cases lower in calories than Starbucks or Dunkin Doughnuts. This flavor hada nice and not to assuring flavor.<br /><br />The only down side to this product is the small can size, which may be right size for the calorie conscious or for snacking, but if your normal size is Grande then you'll be drinking two at a time. Even then it's still a savings and you don't have to leave your home to get it.

review/summary: for coffee lovers who don't want to wait.
review/text: Illy<br /><br />If you like iced coffee, this is an excellent way to get your first glass in the morning while that first pot is brewing.  Just pour some over a glass filled with ice and enjoy.<br /><br />I recommend this for coffee lovers who don't want to wait for the coffee to brew.<br /><br />Gunner May,2012

review/summary: Good flavor for canned coffee
review/text: I Received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.<br /><br />This has a good taste not too sweet and not strong.<br /><br />This is not comparable to a coffee shop Cappucino. It would not replace it.<br /><br />It is more on the go and no-time-to-stop type of deal.

review/summary: OMG Super Yummy
review/text: In my coffee I usually just add sugar and milk, so this review is from that perspective...<br /><br />This drink is supper yummy, but may not be for the traditional coffee drinker.  The cappucino flavor is strong, so you won't feel like you're getting a regular coffee with a just a little flavored creamer in it. The can size is nice and portable, the perfect size for a little pick me up, and easy to store in the fridge.

review/summary: Good But Not Great
review/text: I tried the Illy Issimno Coffee Drink, Cappucino and it tasted good. Because I like my drinks either very cold or very hot, I placed the drink in the refrigerator overnight. It tasted good, but I wouldn't say it was outstanding.<br /><br />Cappucino is probably a required taste and I do enjoy a good one. Go ahead and try this drink for yourself as others may very much enjoy this drink.

review/summary: Good Ice-Coffe
review/text: I'm not a super fan of iced-coffee but I did try this after having refrigerated it. I liked it. It didn't have too bitter a flavor and it wasn't truly sweetened. I'd try it again in the future.
