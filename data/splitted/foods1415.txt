review/summary: A life saver...
review/text: I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to "get the treat" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, "THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE - NOT CHOCOLATE!" We had a close call with my little sister - they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing. Really a life saver! I now buy Greenies Pill Pockets in bulk - by the 6 pack.

review/summary: Love Them!!!! and so does the my dog!
review/text: This past winter was so cold my fury friend and I didn't venture out much. Then along came Spring, and it rained, and it rained, and it rained.  Again, not out much. In April I noticed she was starting to lose hair on her back end, backside of her legs, and her back sides. :-( After a trip to the vet, I was told she would need about 6mg of Melatonin twice a day till her hair fully returned. Turns out it was happening to a lot of Boxers this year in our area due to the lack of sunlight exposure (cold winter/rainy spring). Well, giving her a heart worm pill every month is tragic in and of itself....we both hate it. So the thought of trying to shove pills down her throat twice a day, EVERY DAY, was not appealing. Then I stumbled across these pill pouches! I can't sing their praises loud enough!!!!!! Made giving her the meds each day like giving her a treat, and that's what she thought too.  We also now give her the heart worm meds in these! Our lives are much less stressful with the help of this wonderful item!  And in case you are wondering.....yes, her hair returned! We now take the supplement once a day just to be sure all is well. She still loves the taste and waits for it each morning! Now, if we could only invent something that would make trimming her toenails less of a wrestling match!

review/summary: Totally Worth the money!!!
review/text: I have a english bull terrier with ALOT of skin problems so he takes medication and vitamins 2x per day and some of them are quite big and the zinc pills apparently taste extra bad so he has become very difficult to give pills and actually hides with he hears the bottles being opened and when you get him you have to pry his very large jaw open and hold it closed until he swallows because he'll spit it out. With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it... he will even do his tricks to take his meds now and I'm not sure he even chews ha.. Its a little expensive but combining the pills together makes it last longer and it saves time and my fingers!

review/text: These are AMAZING!  I have a very slippery and sneaky cat who needed medication before a trip.  I stuck the little tablet inside the snack, put two down on the floor, and she ate them both.  No stress, no drama, no cleaning up medicine from the floor.  I will be keeping these on hand, and recommending them to everyone I know.  If your kitty is hard to medicate, you should definitely try these.

review/summary: Works great; Get the CAPSULE version instead for a CHEAPER option
review/text: I've had great success using the pill pockets with my dog. I've always used the tablet size before, but on a whim bought the capsule version (same price). The capsule pill pockets are so large, you can easily split them in in half (even if you're trying to hide capsule-sized pills). If you have tablet pills, I'd bet you could use one capsule-size pill pocket for every 3-4 pills. I will not waste money again on the tablet version of this product! Hope this helps others.

review/summary: YESSSSS!!!!
review/text: Exactly what I said when these actually worked when giving my multipoo his pills using pill pockets! He recently broke his leg and has been given many pills including pain pills, sedatives, and antibiotics. He wouldn't take them with hotdogs, cheese, or in his food. So we had to hold him while prying open his mouth and holding it shut while waiting for half of the pill to dissolve so at least he would have some of it. Not only did this lead to frustration but with his injured leg we were always concerned about him hurting himself. When he had his surgery to get his pins removed we assumed it would be the same struggle as before until we saw these at the vet's office and bought a bag. Though they were $9, we were desperate. Since he is small and we have the capsule size we usually divide them in half because the treats are soft and moldable. Now giving him his pills is no longer a hour long struggle but a treat. Thank you Pill Pockets!

review/summary: PERFECT "treat" for a dog on long-term meds!
review/text: One of our beloved dogs has seizures and is on long-term medication - and has been for a few years now. When we started giving her pills, we tried cheese, peanut butter, meat, etc... but I worried about the extra calories. Our vet recommended pill pockets and we LOVE them! She thinks it's a treat - so no medicine battles - and it is the perfect consistency so that the pills don't fall out and she can't just lick it off (like peanut butter). I use the twice-a-day medicine time as training time since these are treats to her! :-) It is super easy and we use the larger size and divide them in half for her smaller pills so the bag lasts longer. The price on Amazon (as long as I have free shipping) is GREAT and better than most pet stores. Because I can use a small portion of the pill pocket and it holds/hides the pill and she takes it greedily - I don't worry she's getting too many extra calories AND I KNOW she's getting her medicine! I hope they NEVER stop making them!

review/summary: Greenies Pill Pockets
review/text: I first got these at my Vet's when my dog got ill and I didnt know how I would get the pill down her throat.. Well the Vet suggested I buy a package of these and I did.. It was so easy to give my dog her pills, I would take 2 of them and put a pill inside and I would smoosh the pills with the gooey beefy pill pocket around this giant pill.. MY dog thought it was just a treat for her, and she chewed and swallow, wanting more.. Well I didnt give her anymore cause they were for her pills only.. I saw them on Amazon and was thrilled to get the same Pill-Pockets in a bigger size for less money than buying it from my Vet's.. They come in Chicken and Beef and she loves both of them..<br />Once again Amazon came thru with a product that I have used before.. Great Job Amazon!!

review/summary: Pretty good but you can do better
review/text: Pill pockets usually work well though sometimes my dog will chew them, find the pill and spit it out.  Here's an easy way to make a vehicle for getting pills into your dog that isn't as portable as Pill Pockets but often works better. Make instant mashed potatoes substituting low-sodium beef broth for water. Add milk and butter but no salt. Make them a little on the stiff side so they're not too sticky. They store well in the fridge. Your dog will think he's getting a special treat.

review/text: We have three dogs. Two of them will let us put the pill in their throat and/or take it with a little bit of peanut butter (I know, I'm a bad dog owner for feeding them fattening treats). We also have a dog who came to us from a rescue, and who had been abused. It broke my heart to force a pill down her throat. The vet recommended Pill Pockets and sent us home with samples. Our dog loves them. She's twelve now and on a regimen of Denamarin for liver and glucosamine for her joints. I can fit both capsules in one large Pill Pocket (with a bit of wrangling) and she eats it right up. Now we both look forward to her pills in the morning.

review/text: I just had to write a review for the Greenies Pill Pockets.  Genius!  My older dog has to take 3 pills, 3x/day.  He quickly picked up on the hiding them in cheese, bread, etc., tricks. Pill giving became a time-consuming, frustrating ordeal.  Most of the time I would think I had hidden his medication well in his food, only to find them spit out on the floor.  My vet recommended the pill pockets - just the right texture and consistency to fit the 3 pills in at once.  Love how you can shape them right over the pills and pinch the top and voila' - done deal! He must love the taste because he gobbles it up every time.  You also get a decent quantity in each bag. I will use these from now on for sure.  Thanks, Greenies!

review/summary: I'd give Pill Pockets six stars if I could
review/text: These pill pockets are fabulous. You can easily mold them tightly around a capsule (or pill) and so administering medication to a dog is a snap. I've disguised pills in just about everything, but these pockets are easier and cleaner to deal with than beef stew chunks, cheddar cheese, peanut butter on bread... lol, all the goodies I've used before. The thing is, my dogs go nuts for these. I have to give one dog a pill once a week (for the duration of her life), and I swear she's looking at the calendar to see when it's pill time again -- she gets pretty excited. The other four dogs all want pill pockets, too... so I have to divide up a second pocket just to give everyone a taste treat. The smoked flavoring/scent is pretty intense and probably the key. The dogs certainly know when I've been handling one, so I'm busted if I forget to give everyone their share. :)

review/text: As the owner of a dog who takes daily medication, these are a godsend. Soft and squishier than other "hide it in food" options, this works like a charm and is easily molded to any size pill and my dog LOVES them. It turns medicine into a no headache, treat time that he actually looks forward to. No really.<br /><br /> Like another reviewer I use the less expensive "pill pockets for cats" for small pills and they're just as good ... For dogs. My three cats, on the other hand, are WAY too smart to fall for it, easily eating around the pill pocket and leaving the pill. (They do like the taste too.) So, you know, there's that. Thank goodness dogs eat first and then forget to ask questions (and/or chew) later.

review/text: These pill pockets made by Greenies are the best invention ever in getting your dog to take their medications!  They make them for cats as well.  My dog has to take a prilosec every day and I used to fight with her to take it and then I would find the pill spit out somewhere in my house...needless to say, she was getting sick because she wasnt taking her medicine.  Now, she runs to me to take her medicine!  She thinks it is a treat!  She would eat the whole bag at one sitting if she could get into it!  I highly recommend trying these pill pockets for any dog or cat that takes daily meds or for any dog or cat that hates taking medication.  These work like a charm!

Nothing I did could get them to keep down their essential antibiotic and anti-inflammatory pills.  I tried bread, peanut butter, REAL STEAK... they rejected everything. These pill pockets make medication time painless and even enjoyable for my dogs.  I could not rave enough about this product.  I will never put my pets through the anxiety of shoving a pill down their throat ever again.  This is SO easy and wonderful.

review/summary: These are a life saver!
review/text: My nearly 9 year-old golden retriever has been taking allergy meds since he was 18 months old.  For years he was fine with me rolling the capsule in some american cheese, then one day, out of the blue, he somehow "realized" there was medicine inside the cheese and refused to eat it.  Shortly thereafter, I discovered Pill Pockets, and they've been a godsend.  Aside from the large capsules he takes every day for allergies, every time he has to take another medication it's a piece of cake.  He never tires of them, and, like another reviewer said, always looks at me as if to ask "what?  you're only giving me ONE??"  Teddy loves both flavors and yes, while they're a bit expensive, if you've ever tried to force a pill down a dog's throat, you'll find ways to make room in your budget for Pill Pockets. :-)

review/summary: Great for Liquid Meds Too!!!
review/text: I know the product say these are for pill and capsules, but the are also great for liquids.  I have a minpin who would attack the dropper and I would bet that he wasn't getting anywhere near a full dose of his medication.  So I tried mixing it with food. Still a no go. Out of desperation I took the change that these would work, and they do.  You just need to make sure you leave enough space at the top to be able to seal them properly.  For me... 1 ml of fluid takes two capsule sized pill pockets.

review/summary: Easy way to get my dog to take a pill
review/text: My dog was on an antibiotic that could not be wrapped in cheese (no dairy) and without the cheese he spits and coughs pills back out.  My vet gave me a weeks supply of these pill pockets (2 pills 2x a day) to try as they contain no dairy.  My dog liked them so much he thought they were a treat, he needed to stay on the medicine for a month, so I order this product and went through almost 2 bags.<br /><br />Not messy, not stinky easy to use.

review/summary: Awesome! Cat pockets save $ based on other review too!
review/text: Based on another reviewer I tried the cat pockets for my Rat Terrier. The price was half based on the packet having many more and being lower.  My dog likes the salmon and the chicken just fine. The 6 pack is the best price. Giving him his pill every day is so much easier now.  I had tried for ages to cover it in the doggie cheese whiz and that was just nasty and he often licked off the whiz and left the pill.  Tricky little dog. ;-) Wish I had found these sooner.

review/summary: For more economical choice, check out Pill Pockets for CATS
review/text: I have a 100lb dog, an Akita who HATES taking pills. She has NOT had Pill Pockets for Dogs, but she HAS had Pill Pockets for CATS. Now, before you click the "No" button after "Was this review helpful to you?", read further -- my comments will be of value to those with dogs that take SMALL pills!<br /><br />Andie has been taking pills for hypothyroidism for the past 9 years. Her pills are TINY. Wrapping them in meat or cheese never worked; she simply ate around the pill or spit it out. For years the only way I could get Andie to take pills was to, literally, shove them down her throat. (My hands are small enough and her mouth is big enough for me to do this. Thankfully she's a very trusting dog!)<br /><br />Then one day I was at the vet and noticed packages of something called "Pill Pockets". They had two kinds -- one for dogs and one for cats. Both came in flavors that Andie would like, but the dog Pill Pockets came in different sizes (small and large) while the cat Pill Pockets only came in one size (small).<br /><br />I looked at each package very carefully and noticed that the packages for cats had 45 Pill Pockets, while the packages for small dogs only had 35 Pill Pockets. And yet, the packages for small dogs cost MORE than the packages for cats -- huh? (On Amazon.com they are the same price, but the quantities are different.) So I looked at Andie's tiny thyroid pills, then looked at the Pill Pocket pictures on the packages and decided, "I might as well save myself a buck and buy the kitty Pill Pockets. What the hey, Andie won't know she's eating something intended for cats!"<br /><br />I've been happy with that decision ever since.<br /><br />I've bought both the salmon- and chicken-flavored Pill Pockets FOR CATS and Andie likes them both. The pockets are the perfect size, just big enough for her thyroid pills, and to date she has gulped down every one, then begged for another! And I like the fact that I get 10 more in each package than I would if I bought the Pill Pockets "for dogs".<br /><br />Pill Pockets are GREAT product, for cats OR dogs. I wish I had discovered them sooner! While I have never used the Pill Pockets for Dogs, I am 100% confident that they are excellent. That's why I'm giving this product 5 stars. If Andie's pills were bigger I would get the Pill Pockets for Dogs, and I know she would like them just as much. For the time being, though, I will stick with the smaller Pill Pockets for Cats, since they last a few days longer.<br /><br />So, this review is to pass along an idea that perhaps some dog owners had not considered: If your dog takes tiny pills like Andie does, go with the more economical choice and get Pill Pockets for Cats. Your dog will never know the difference!

review/summary: The 28th Five Star Review
review/text: Rarely have I encountered a product that doesn't have at least ONE person who either thinks it's junk, or gives a (bogus) low review because the delivery guy accidentally dropped the package before leaving the item at the door.<br /><br />As of this moment, 100% of the people reviewing the Greenies PILL POCKETS have given them a five-star rating, and I'm enthusiastically joining the crowd!<br /><br />If you're a dog owner, you've almost certainly had to, at some point, give your dog a pill that he or she was reluctant to take. The usual remedy until now, (as suggested by our vet) was to simply shove the thing down the poor dog's throat, and then rub their neck to help the pill go down.<br /><br />Recently, one of our dogs --a large yellow lab named Chip-- was suffering from untreatable throat cancer, but he still needed to take a number of pills to make his final days a little more comfortable. The vet specifically mentioned AVOIDING the "shove and rub" technique as it would be very painful for the dog --who at that point was even reluctant to eat his regular food.<br /><br />Someone mentioned PILL POCKETS. We picked up a bag and lo and behold, they worked like a champ. Though Chip was still not really interested in eating a meal, the *very* meaty smell of the PILL POCKETS was irresistible to him, and he happily gobbled up his meds.<br /><br />Sadly, we lost Chip about a week later, but then our other dog developed a minor skin rash that required he take some antibiotics. Eubie is a Border Collie, and they tend to figure things out before you do --and we were astounded when he wolfed down his medicine and then looked at us as if to ask "is that all --when do I get another?!"<br /><br />My technique for using the PILL POCKETS is to stuff the pill(s) inside, pinch off the open end --and then, using my palms, "roll" the pocket into a smooth, round ball. With Eubie at least, he loves the smell so much, that he simply swallows it whole.<br /><br />In fact, I discovered another great use for the PILL POCKETS and that is to take a rawhide bone and smear the nooks and crannies with a single pill pocket. Since they're kind of "doughy" in texture, they're perfect in this regard --and for a dog that will happily walk around the house with the rawhide bone for days without ever chewing on it, we've found that the "pill pocket infused" rawhide is something that he HAS to chew on. (In fact, he was SO focused on this task, that for the first time ever, he actually ignored the fireworks on July 4th.... it was truly amazing!)<br /><br />- Jonathan Sabin

review/summary: Pillpockets are a Lifesaver
review/text: My dog Andy requires 3 pills 3 times a day. I started using Pillpockets almost two years ago. We have used the dreaded pill popper for many years. When the popper comes out, Andy beats a hasty retreat. We all hated it, as a lot of times the pills popped out, stayed in the popper, or he gagged on them. Since he had to have pills three times a day, it was a daily ordeal. It all changed when we tried Pill Pockets. He now looks forward to taking his pills. He loves the taste of the Pillpockets, I don't think we can now do without them. He likes them so much, we use them as treats for special occasions. They have made treating Andy a pleasant experience, rather than a ordeal. I wish I would have invented them.

review/summary: Veterinary approved...
review/text: As a veterinarian, I've dispensed a lot of medications for both dogs and cats...that is, until I had to start medicating my own pets.  I've became a lot more empathetic now that I've realized that I can barely pill my own cat (who runs away from me), and that my dog will not take pills in cheese or peanut butter. In fact, pilling my own pets has smartened me up on what meds pets really need. As a result, I've started prioritizing pills - in other words, I rank the order of importance of each prescription for pet owners, so they know which pills are an absolute MUST give, and which ones they can skip if they are getting desperately fed up with pilling.<br /><br />Since then, my life has changed... thanks to Pill Pockets. I regret not inventing these, as it was one of those "duh" products that came out, making you wish you had the money-making patent.  Whoever owns a dog that needs to be pilled chronically, pay heed. The Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome... that is, for dogs, at least.<br />My dog recently got put on a bunch of medications, and he's super picky (although less so, since getting put on steroids!). Being that he needs a total of 5 medications a day, I found Pill Pockets to be a true life saver, as they improve both my dog's and my quality of life. These little tasty, greasy, soft, malleable pockets are designed so that you can stick the pill (or multiple pills) in the center, and seal them into a hidden ball of "treat."  It's like playing with palatable play-dough. Drop it in the food, and voila, it "makes pills a treat to give!"<br /><br />The pros: Pill Pockets are easy, convenient, tasty, and come in multiple flavors (Dog: beef and chicken; Cat: salmon and chicken. It also comes in a hypoallergenic flavor - duck and pea - for both species with food allergies). More importantly, they are palatable - dogs seem to love them. Another pro is that they come in multiple sizes, and I'm able to stuff 5 pills - yes all 5 pills - into the larger "capsule" dog Pill Pockets.<br /><br />The cons:  One of my two cats won't touch Pill Pockets. This is, of course, the cat who actually needs to take medication. He also won't touch Feline Heartgard monthly chewable pills either, so I suspect he doesn't like moist treats. So, try at your own risk, particularly if you have a finicky cat. The other con is that Pill Pockets are a bit greasy - they have a high vegetable oil content. As ingredients are listed in order of use, vegetable oil is #4 for the dog pill pockets. While this doesn't affect the health of your pet, a hand-washing is a MUST after playing with Pill Pockets (which you should always do when handling your pet's meds, anyway). That said, I know that the vegetable oil is needed to keep the Pill Pockets malleable (easy to fold and maneuver). The other con - cost. They're not cheap, and if your pet is on loads of meds, it can certainly add up. Try jamming 5 pills in one capsule to help. But anything for Fido, right?!<br /><br />Dr. Justine Lee, DVM, DACVECC<br />Author of "It's a Dog's Life... but It's Your Carpet" and "It's a Cat's World... You Just Live In It"<br />[...].

review/text: My dog has to take seizure pills and after 2 months of shoving them down her throat and finding the pills around the house, I saw Pill Pockets at the vet. She likes them, the pills don't get spit out, and I don't get growled at, it's great! The pills are tiny, so I split one pill pocket up and can wrap four pills up. I put the extras in an empty pill bottle to keep them fresh. She doesn't mind the smaller size. They do leave your hands kind of greasy though.

This bag contained product that was slippery, crumbly and they are not pliable like original Greenie's!  The texture of these pockets is totally different from original Greenie's PP and they could NOT be squeezed around a pill - the product breaks apart.  I know the difference because I've been using real Greenie's for month's to hide medicine from my 13 year old dog.  I will NOT purchase this product from Amazon again as I believe they are are knockoffs.  Who knows what's in them, and with recent information about poisonings I'm not taking a chance with MY dogs!

review/text: These things are great!  They were a must recently when my new puppy had a kidney infection.  She was so sick and had little appetite so was not interested in the cheese or other stuff I tried to hide the pills in.  The vet suggested these.  She loved them and would just about take a finger off when I would give them to her.  Now we are using them for house training treats.  They are very soft so you can pinch the tiniest bit off as a reward without giving a big, hard biscuit that she doesn't much like anyway.

review/summary: Best thing ever invented!
review/text: I have dogs that are very food motivated...until you put medicine in it. I don't know how they know, but they do, and always eat right around the pill. UGH! So frustrating, because then I have to shove them down their throat. It hurts their feelings, it hurts my feeling and I dread doing it.<br /><br />That was until I found pill pockets. My dogs LOVE them and actually run to the kitchen when they smell that I am "preparing" them. The smell is pretty strong, so I am unsure if they cannot smell the pills or the pill pockets taste so good, they just don't care. Either way is fine for me - this product has alleviated stress for me. Which is a relief, because just the stress of having sick dog(s) can be overwhelming. I am so thankful for this product!<br /><br />As always, Amazon has the product at a great price - beating the vet by several dollars.

review/summary: No more fighting with the dog about his pills!
review/text: These things are AWESOME! I've tried giving my dog his pills in everything from cheese- to sandwich meat- and finally liverwurst- all of which worked... for a while. Eventually though he would start chewing whatever it was to locate the medication in whatever treat it was and spit the pills out. Over And Over. SO frustrating. He has three pills to take twice daily and I can fit all three of them in one Greenie... These pill pockets actually have him reminding ME that it's time to take them.  Of course you could try something else that's cheaper- and I've done that- but when you find you're spending too much time fighting your best friend to treat a chronic condition and keep him with you- reach for these. They are worth every penny! There's no more fighting-, and no sad-dog hiding under the furniture.

review/text: I couldn't get my dog to take her incontinence pill (which is supposed to be a chewable). Put it in a hotdog, she would eat around the hotdog & spit the pill out. Same with any other type of food, food gone, pill left on the floor. Wrapped the pill in one of these pill pockets & she doesn't even chew, she wolfs it down so quickly. Now my only problem is getting the pill in the pocket fast enough so that I don't have to clean up a puddle of drool.

review/text: Pill Pockets may be the best product of any kind I've ever bought, including my first WalkMan. After months of jamming two pills down my poor cat's throat, I learned about Pill Pockets and thought I'd give them a try. Instant success. They're just the right size for the pills, and Dexter was immediately attracted to the Salmony-fresh scent. He swooped right in to gobble up his medicine. Since he'll have to take these pills for the rest of his life, Pill Pockets are perfect.

review/text: The Greenies I recently ordered here are working out great, for my dog who needs his thyroid meds.  He's usually pretty eager for any treat, though sometimes a little bit picky -- LOVES these, though.<br /><br />We have another dog that is extremely hard to 'fool' with meds, and Greenies didn't work for her.  So, it does depend on the dog, but Greenies probably work for most.

I only found out about them when I mentioned that giving my cat a pill is not fun.  The receptionist gave me a couple to try.  The cat swallowed that thing so fast, and loved it.  Every vet should offer these routinely when they prescribe pills to cats and dogs.  It really makes life so much easier for me and for my pet!  I'm ordering some from Amazon so I have them on hand for the future.

review/summary: Works like a charm even for smart and/or finicky dogs
review/text: First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works... before Pill Pockets, I only had a 50% success rate getting any of our dogs to take their pills when we used hotdogs and even steak leftovers. With Pill Pockets, the pill always goes "down"!<br /><br />Pill Pockets are like Beef Playdoh, and are easy to tear into pieces. There is no need to use a whole pill pocket for a pill or capsule if the capsule or pill is small... just use enough pill pocket to cover the pill/capsule and fool your pet.  For instance, we tear each pill pocket in half and wrap that half around the dog's medication.  By the way, the size listed on the Pill Pocket bag indicates the size of the pill pocket, not the dog. Large meds require larger Pill Pockets; small meds like phenobarbital (for seizures) require only the small pill pockets or perhaps a piece of a large pill pocket.<br /><br />By the way, please DON'T waste your money buying Pill Pockets for cats if you have dogs. The reason I point this out is that I read a review (listed under another seller) that stated that it was more economical to buy the PillPockets for cats because you receive 45 instead of 35. Well, the reviewer failed to notice that the Pill Pockets for Cats only weighs 1.8 ounces, and the Pill Pockets (Small bag) for Dogs weighs 3.5 ounces! Buy the bag that, per ounce, is the least money.

She actually slides across the tile that last few inches.<br /><br />These pill pockets are soft, moist, and REALLY stinky. Everything that a dog has ever wanted in a treat. I don't think there's a dog on this planet that won't eat these. Get them and you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Stress free administration of pills
review/text: After a failed attempt at forcing a pill down our new greyhound, in which he spewed dissolved pill all over us and our kitchen floor, we found Greenies.  My  husband was skeptical and expecting the worst, since we had unsuccessfully tried to hid the pill in yogurt and in dog food.  To the touch, the treat reminds me of the consistency of a fresh chewy brownie.  It was easy to insert the pill and squeeze the opening closed.  Our dog loved the treat and ate it without any problem.  Now when he hears me opening the bag he comes running to get his pill, oh I mean treat!  This is an excellent product that I plan to keep on hand.

review/text: Our dog is a little weird with food. He had a rough start in life prior to us getting him so now he's terrified of eating food in front of us. It's been a real trial to get him to eat treats at times but he gobbled this up right in front of us. We were really impressed. The pill fit in just fine and sealed off great. It's really stinky (in a dog approving kind of way) and I think you'll be hard pressed to find a dog who won't eat it.<br /><br />If our dog will eat it pill and all, any dog will.

review/text: Our vet recommended Pill Pockets for a very intelligent dog who is on multiple meds- she can sniff out a pill in anything, cheese, peanut butter - etc, and spit them out.  But now, pill pockets are a treat - and 3 x per day she loves that green foil bag- Product is safe and soft enough to use piecemeal for small pills and capsules.  Remarkable help for capsules, and pills of all sizes!

review/summary: My Dog Is So Pleased and So Am I
review/text: My dog has to take medications twice a day, for the rest of her life. There is no fuss, no mess or problems giving her the medication, which is three pills, in a pill pocket. She actually comes to me when she sees me open the bag. What a great product!

review/summary: Pill Pockets work Great!
review/text: Our large dog (75 lbs) hates pills and even with putting them in the back of his mouth and holding his mouth closed and massaging his throat, he still manages to mostly spit out the pills. Pill Pockets are a godsend. I simply put the pill into the pocket, form the pocket completely around the pill, pop it into his mouth and he happily chews and swallows. Highly recommended for giving pills to pets.

review/summary: Dog loves them
review/text: These are fantastic ways to get the dog to take her pills.  They work well and make life a lot easier.  The small pills are a lot smaller than in a previous purchase buying the larger ones.  Since our dog takes a lot of pills, I would pay slightly more for the larger ones because it would be more cost effective in the future.<br /><br />Again, these are fantastic and really makes life a lot easier.

review/summary: Pill Pockets
review/text: I think that Pill Pockets are just WONDERFUL!!  I have a small dog and it was very hard to give her pills and the veterinarian sold me a package of these, now my dog just loves when it is time to take her pill, she does not even know anything is in there.

review/summary: GREAT PRODUCT, but DO NOT buy Pill Pockets for CATS if you have DOGS!
review/text: First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works... before Pill Pockets, I only had a 50% success rate getting our three dogs to take their pills when we used hotdogs and even steak leftovers.  With Pill Pockets, the pill always goes "down"!  But DON'T waste your money buying Pill Pockets for cats if you have dogs. I read the review that stated that it was more economical to buy the PillPockets for cats because you receive 45 instead of 35.  Well, the reviewer failed to notice that the Pill Pockets for Cats only weighs 1.8 ounces, and the Pill Pockets (Small bag) for Dogs weighs 3.5 ounces! BUY the SMALL PILLPOCKETS FOR DOGS!  The Pill Pockets are like Beef Playdoh, and are easy to tear in half (we tear each one in half and wrap 1/2 around my dog's seizure medication).  So for the best ECONOMY, buy the Pill Pockets for Dogs (PS - the Pill Pocket's size indicates the size of the pill, not the dog.  Large meds require larger Pill Pockets; small meds like phenobarbital require only the small).  These things are Great!
