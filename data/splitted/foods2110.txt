review/summary: For me instantly addicting, others, acquired taste
review/text: I cannot believe how much I love these things. The first one I popped in my mouth made my eyes water because after a point ginger can get pretty spicy but I just love that flavor. These things for me are incredibly addictive and I don't use the word lightly. I really have to watch the portion control.<br /><br />Now that I am used to the spiciness, if I'm not paying attention I can chomp through a bag pretty quickly and that is potent stuff. It's better for the calories and the teeth to work through the candies slowly right? But yikes these things are sweet-spicy good!<br /><br />On the other hand my husband tried one only to spit his into his dinner napkin pretty disgusted....So, definitely an acquired taste.<br /><br />One observation as a simple hard-candy-eating, non-medical, lay-person, who suffers with severe asthma, these things were soothing to the throat and chest on a couple of rough breathing days.<br /><br />With the next shipment of ginger drops I am also getting a bag of the clove flavored candies just to see if they will be able to stand up to the ginger so I'll have an alternate. :)

review/text: Due to work, I had cats in South Africa for two months before they were transported to Venezuela.  I was afraid they wouldn't like the new food or get sick, since I didn't have the food they were used to previously.<br /><br />Both cats took to the food quickly and really enjoy it.  No tummy issues, but I do always recommend that if you are switching food, do so by adding a little more of the ProPlan and less of their previous food during a week's time.<br /><br />I am happy becuase I know they are eating healthy.  As a treat, I also give them wet food once a day.  Dry food is there all day.

review/summary: These are just not that tasty!!
review/text: I bought these a couple of years ago and still have a couple packages in the freezer.  It's time to discard these frozen ones like I did ALL the other packages I opened to taste a FEW cherries but could not make myself eat any more of them.  What a waste!  I don't find these to be delicious at all.  They barely taste like cherries and are rather rubbery.  One thing I have to give them credit about is that they are NOT loaded with sugar.  That is why I bought them in the first place.  I may be comparing these to fresh cherries though so it's really like comparing apples and oranges.....it's unfair on my part.  I suggest you buy one package locally before buying a whole case like I did.  You may like them....I did not!

review/summary: PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT LIKE PIZZA CRUST
review/text: BOTTOM LINE<br />If you are expecting a rising pizza crust, such as what you might get from standard pizza dough, then you'll need to look elsewhere.  That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.<br /><br />TASTE<br />I rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br />I think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.<br /><br />SIZE<br />These are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.<br /><br />USES/ VERSATILITY<br />If you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.  I personally love them with some BBQ sauce and chicken.  They make a nice bread/ carb base for anything I might otherwise eat on flatbread.  As a gluten-free option, these crusts are a wonderful thing to have at your disposal.

review/summary: Great Taste Treat
review/text: I've enjoyed the flavor of witer green since I was young. Finding these mints in a sugar free product is great. There are several individually wrapped mints in each of the several bags in this order, and they should last me quite awhile. I consider this to have been a very good purchase.

review/summary: Not at all the same.
review/text: I'm not sure why everybody else rated these so high. The taste and texture is like Certs, crumbly and unpleasantly overpowering. They may or may not have wintergreen oil like the originals(natural flavor can mean just about anything) but if they do, I sure can't taste it. I was really hoping these would be like the originals and be so hard they almost break your teeth when you bite them and have such a strong wintergreen flavor that they burn your tongue. Didn't happen. I'm very glad I bought one bag of these to try instead of buying the 12 pack on here. I'm guessing all the other reviewers haven't had the originals in a VERY long time. That's the only way I can see giving them 5 stars. I gave it 3 only because they are still edible, if you like Certs. I don't.

review/summary: Ok, but Jade can be so much better
review/text: This is an okay tea. A good enough everyday oolong for casual drinking. Compared to other teas, I'd even say it's pretty good.<br /><br />But it is by no means a fantastic delight of the senses, as I've come to expect from jade oolongs. Rishi Jade Oolong is my favorite, with a heavenly flowery aroma and flavor; most all jades I've sampled are better than SerendipiTea. This tea looks very pretty, a healthy green that brews a yellow liquid, the tiny curled leaves that open and get a lot of volume (a pleasure to watch), but it doesn't smell like anything (well, it does a little, if I sniff inside the cup) and the flavor is nice enough but bland. Nothing to write home about.<br /><br />I'd try something else instead.

review/summary: Best black olives in brine I've ever eaten.
review/text: I'm glad they have them in my supermarket in South Florida because the price here is a bit high and the shipping/handling charge is unbelievable.  My supermarket sells the 7.4 oz. jar for $3.59 and I would probably pay even a tad more than that, they're that good, but $10 seems a bit much.<br /><br />The black olives come from Peru.  They are large and plump and nicely solid, not at all mushy or wrinkled.  Packed in a saltwater brine, they do have a sodium content that's a bit high, and lactic acid and potassium sorbate are added as preservatives, so if you're a purist about your food these may not suit you.  I'm usually careful about what I eat, but these are so good and I'm such an olive lover that I don't think about the sodium and preservatives when I eat them.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I debated a while before ordering these because they are kind of fragile, but my shipment had no problems. Ha, maybe I'd trust Amazon and UPS more than the people they've got working down at the grocery store.<br /><br />Another reason I debated ordering was of course, the salt, and of course being "SALTines", there's a bunch of it. I haven't compared a lot of other snacks, but strangely enough these have less salt that other alternatives. I guess because there's no other tastes that they have to mask, the little bit of salt the do have comes right on through. I don't normally worry about such things as health and nutrition, but 12 boxes is a lot, and I tend to chow down on a lot of them because they're so good!<br /><br />Plenty of time left on the expiration date, 8 months from now, so that's not a worry.<br /><br />Prices, as with everything, fluctuate, but I got a good deal.

Just try locating it in your grocer tho... a whole other story. I've was disappointed that I can no longer find it along with several other favorite foods in my local grocers... I guess they expect us in the south to succumb to the high salt, high fat foods "only"...sigh.

review/summary: Outrageously expensive but outrageously delicious
review/text: As I said in my review of their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZ5Z92">lumache</a> (which Amazon misspells "lamache" as of May 2011), I discovered the Cavalieri brand through a marvelous Italian movie named <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040JWUY6">Loose Cannons (Mine vaganti)</a>. My five-star review of the lumache was slightly tentative because I was not sure the quality of the product justified its being ten times as expensive as supermarket pasta, but - Oh, my! - I have no such reservations about the spaghettoni.<br /><br />The list price of Benedetto Cavalieri pasta seems to be around ten dollars per 500-gram package (a little more than a pound), although it is somewhat less expensive here at Amazon. I would not think ten dollars for a pound of steak was exorbitant, and this pasta is better than steak. Besides, pasta more than doubles in weight when boiled, so it is actually less than five dollars for a pound of edible pasta.<br /><br />I have to boil it slightly longer than the instructions prescribe (about 18 minutes instead of 15-16) to get it to what I consider al dente (which means it is chewy but does not crack when I bite it), but that is an insignificant complaint. Maybe true pasta connoisseurs expect it still to be hard enough in the center to crack when bitten; I don't.<br /><br />I also have only tried Cavalieri pasta with a little butter and salt, because that is how I like pasta best. If I were going to smother it in a sauce, even in a mild sauce like Alfredo, I probably would use Wegmans excellent store-brand pasta (seventy-nine cents a pound) instead. It would be a waste to mask this pasta with ANYTHING.<br /><br />I hereby officially join the chorus of those who sing the praises of Benedetto Cavalieri pasta. It is worth the cost. It is the most delicious pasta by far that I have ever eaten, and it one of the most delicious foods on earth.

review/text: This is real authentic pasta that's very hard to find in America. It is thick spaghetti, traditionally called vermicelli in Italy, that cooks aldente and also healthier with more fiber and less triglycerides. FDA guidelines in America require pasta be fortified with vitamins and minerals, especially ferrous sulfate, ferrous lactate and folic acid to pretend to help the inner city indigent. This ruins the natural wheat product and has made it almost impossible to find good pasta in America. This pasta is expensive, but you need to take into consideration the quality as well as special costs of obtaining this upper out of sight product. Respectfully submitted.

review/summary: There's a reason why it's called 18 rabbits
review/text: I really like these bars, there's a good mix of nuts and fruit; I particularly like the sesame seeds.  The reason why 18 rabbits is such an apt name for these bars is that you need to eat them like a rabbit - nibbling.  For some reason, I've found that it's easiest to eat these in small bites rather than the huge bites I usually prefer.  I think it's probably got to do with whatever is binding it together, and it's not necessarily a bad thing, just something to note.  Buying them here is a lot cheaper than buying individually in the store, great deal!

review/text: I am a big fan of the 18 Rabbits chocolate cherry granola bars, which is why I ordered the apricot ones.  Sadly, there is no comparison.  These were flavorless, not a hint of apricot or any other ingredient.  I was disappointed and will not buy this flavor again.

review/summary: Crispy thin tasty cakes, rice cakes that is
review/text: I wanted to compare the price of rice cakes on Amazon to what was in the stores and I stumbled across these. Always intrigued with new and different products (especially those not found in my local stores) I snagged myself a case of them.<br /><br />Price wise these are about the same price (a little more or a little less, depends on if you can find them on sale) then the regular Quaker Oats rice cakes in stores.<br /><br />There are many things that makes these stand out from other rice cakes. First off is the fact that they are compressed, so they are much crispier/crunchier then other rice cakes out there. The other is that they are square, not round. So because of them being compressed/thinner and square this makes them that much easier to store which I really like.<br /><br />Taste wise, I find them nuttier and toastier. I think the process that they use retains more of the brown rice flavor then the other brands.<br /><br />Add in the fact that they have no salt, are kosher, and only 20 calories per cake make these my new favorite snack BY FAR. Add a little bit of homemade jam, some natural peanut butter, Nutella, or pretty much anything to them for a really tasty snack with some variety (I like mine with some Tabasco Chipotle).<br /><br />Just love them!

It doesn't lose its' flavor in a strong soup or sauce.

review/text: I love these yogurt melts! They were both my kids first 'finger foods' due to the wonderful melting quality they have. My kids are now ages 1 and 2 and they both love these as a treat. As they're a little expensive, I use them to 'buy' myself some time when making dinner. Have each kid sit at the table and give them a small handful to work on while I work on what I need to. Even my son (who usually crashes through food) sits quietly and eats these one at a time until they're all gone. Instant silence!<br /><br />Definitely a staple in my pantry. I like to purchase these on Amazon when they fall to a price low (~$20) to save a bit of $$$.

review/text: I was super excited to see these at Safeway for only $3. I have seen them at other places for as much as $4.50 and the competitor, Happy Melts Yogurt Melts, on sale for $5. I have to say, go with the Happy Melts version. The Gerber ones lack the flavor and texture of the Happy Melts version and are actually kind of chalky and bland. Happy Melts are all organic and are smaller, which is better for your baby and for you. I prefer the strawberry flavor but the wildberry is also quite good. I think the way they melt in your mouth is quite similar to astronaut ice cream.

review/summary: My favorite canned sardines, FWIW
review/text: There are quite a few foods I like better than sardines but I eat a tin now and then because they're (supposedly) healthful and very convenient.  I've tried most of the common grocery store varieties and found these to be the best of them, primarily because, as the box says, they are "meaty portions cleaned and scaled."  Compared to others, there's less icky bits in the tin, and they do have a nice meaty texture that reminds you more of a real fish meal and less of leftover bait.  The marinara sauce is expectedly watery and flavorless; I add hot sauce or other spices.  Yes, the ad copy all over the box is hyperbolic but presumably you're not buying them for reading material.

review/summary: In The Wilderness
review/text: Are we talking about the wild sardines?<br /><br />Uh-uh. We're talking about me, who as of this writing has lapsed into Amazon reviewer oblivion, with a ranking of 1002. Seeing my name appear without that little "Top 1000" moniker makes me feel vulnerable and exposed.<br /><br />What to do about it? Submit yet another review of a tin of sardines. I can't think of a better means of clawing my way back to the top.<br /><br />This time it's Wild Planet Wild Sardines in Marinara sauce. I already did the ones in olive oil, as well as those with a dash of lemon juice.<br /><br />So, here goes...<br /><br />There's nothing really wrong with these sardines, though as noted below I don't particularly care for their smoky taste. My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />For instance, what about the whole concept of "wild" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that there's no other kind, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're "sustainably caught along the California coast". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are "processed in Viet Nam". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, "These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, "Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk...". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these "delicious meaty portions" are "cleaned and scaled". Buyer beware: this is quite different from "skinless and boneless". "Cleaned" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste. Dunking them in marinara doesn't do much to change this.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but "aqueous natural smoke" that they're treated with...

review/summary: Decent enough rice
review/text: There's nothing really wrong with this rice, but there's nothing really special about it either.  It's serviceable.  I cook it in my rice cooker and the basmati aroma is indeed very pleasant.  I did think, based on basmati brown rice I bought from a Safeway store, that the fiber content would be higher.  It's actually 1g (4% of the RDA) per 1/4 cup.  That's not high, although it's a step up from plain ol' white rice.  Other nutritional details: 180 calories, 38g carbs, 3g protein, plus calcium 2%, iron 6%, thiamine 13% and Niacin 8%. Although not listed on the product label, B vitamins are also found in Basmati brown rice.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, the rice is not theoretically loose inside the burlap bag (which is double-sewn shut and has a zipper) because there's a inner plastic bag.  The plastic bag is cheap and flimsy though, and somewhere along the way a lot of the rice left the bag I got (assuming it started in it) and was just loose inside the burlap. I emptied it all into ziplock bags to store in the freezer.<br /><br />The expiration date is Jan 2014. I paid just under $15 and expect to be eating this rice for many months to come. Make that many, MANY months to come.

review/summary: Grown in the fertile soil of the Himalayan region
review/text: I ordered this rice after the great arsenic scare of 2012, and I am not disappointed. For those that are not aware, US rice carries "1.4 to 5 times more arsenic than rice from Europe, India and Bangladesh. As I write this, I have a pot of lentil Dahl cooking, and I'll eat it with this rice.<br /><br />I was quite happy with rice grown in America, but they decided to grow it in ex-cotton fields that had been sprayed with arsenic...and even used chicken poop that contains arsenic to fertilize *organic* rice crops with (It seems feeding chickens arsenic allows them to grow faster. Your health doesn't matter, it is all about the benjamins).<br /><br />My favorite rice is a Lundberg organic, brown/wild rice blend. Is this rice as good as Lundberg's rice? Probably not, but the bar is set pretty high there. However, this is a good solid rice and I plan on getting more in the future.<br /><br />If anyone would like to know what the tag attached to the bag says (you can see it in the picture), this is what it reads:<br /><br />Bombay Original - Basmati Rice is grown in the fertile soil of the Himalayan region. the cool clean mountain air, abundand streams and rainfall create the perfect growing conditions that give this premium Basmati rice its special flavour and firm texture. Basmati rice is low in calories, contains no sodium, and no cholesterol. Enjoy it in good health.

review/summary: Rice itself looks to be of good quality, but packaging is terrible.
review/text: I purchased this brown basmati rice after trying a small package purchased at a grocery store. The price certainly is good, 10 lbs for under $15.00 which is really good for basmati rice from India. When I received the shipment, which was delivered promptly, I found that the burlap sack it comes in has a zipper at the top, but when un-zipped it is stitched shut and needs to be cut open. This is not a problem, as the sack says it is "tamper proof", however the inner plastic bag containing the rice was already open and small particles of burlap threads must have fallen onto the rice whilst cutting open the sack. Not to mention a large quantity of rice had already spilled outside the inner bag. When I attempted to remove the inner plastic bag it burst open and about half of the rice fell all over the floor. So I had to spend the next 20 min. cleaning up this huge mess of rice. I can't believe how tissue-thin the inner plastic bag is! Now I have to go buy a large container to transfer the remaining rice into. The rice itself looks to be of good quality, and I will probably end up ordering more of this rice in the future because the price can't be beat. But be forewarned about the packaging.
