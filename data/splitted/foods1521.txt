review/summary: Nice chewy salmon jerkey.
review/text: I began buying salmon jerky after a trip to Canada a few years back. This salmon jerky is indeed chewy, so I would only recommend it to people having nice jaw muscles and enjoying chewing. For me, 20 minutes after receiving it, I already finished almost half a pack with no problem.<br /><br />Interestingly, after reading 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy, I started to have the urge to have some non-perishable food at hand. But this is just a tasty snack in my opinion. It will not last you through the seemingly endless nuclear winter. The $10 discount code for $50 Grocery purchase makes it tastier for sure.

review/summary: Too tough?  Hey, it's jerky!
review/text: Although I was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible, we had purchased this salmon jerky at Trader Joe's in smaller packets and really liked it, so we decided to purchase here at Amazon much less expensively.  Yes, this product is very dry, but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there.  My family liked it, and we are placing a second order.  That other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way!

review/summary: tasty salmon jerky
review/text: This salmon jerky is definitely tasty.  It has a slightly strong peppery taste to it, which I really like.<br /><br />The previous reviewer was correct in thinking the jerky was a bit too dry and hard to chew.  It'll take you a while to bite a piece off and chew it.  My jaws were too tired to even eat a whole serving.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the jerky is quite tasty so I'm not dissapointed.<br /><br />These come in eight resealable pounches, each with 2 ounces of salmon jerky.  I'm sure these will last a while since it'll take a while to chew them all up.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE these
review/text: There are several things I like about this product, including that these are naturally shed antlers that are collected, cleaned, packaged and then sold without involving killing to get them.  Somebody goes out and collects these and that is probably part of why they are fairly expensive, even on-line...I first found these in our local pet store...but forget about the retail price, (IF you can even find them,) the price at the pet store was twice what I found on-line, and the antlers were not nearly as large.  None of the big chain pet stores carry these, at least not in my area so far. I ordered these through Amazon and was amazed and delighted that they arrived literally the next day.<br /><br />That said, my dogs simply ADORE these things.<br />They keep my new, and very young 100# rescue lab busy literally for hours, but do not "slime" my floors or carpet, (or our bed or couch.)  He loves to set one on my desk as an "offering," which I actually don't mind since they are VERY clean compared to all the more traditional bones, hoofs and chews.<br /><br />Additionally, they double as a great "fetch" toy in the yard.<br /><br />Essentially my guys just chew them down to the nubbin's, but without any damage to my stuff. Highly recommend if you want a clean chew/toy that will keep your dog busy for hours without wrecking the party, and helps with tarter build-up on their teeth in the process.<br /><br />Really a great idea, and a great product.

review/summary: Good . . . and over priced
review/text: My dogs like these.  Everything the positive reviews say about them is true . . . they're a really good option because they don't splinter easily and it takes a good while for my pack of sniveling, snarling, white hot balls of canine terror (wiener dogs) to wear them down.  They eventually get small enough that they become choking hazards and you have to toss them.<br /><br />I have no hesitation in highly recommending deer antlers as a chew for dogs.  It's only that after first buying this brand, I then ran across real, honest to goodness deer antlers that were comparable to these in every way at a local pet store for almost exactly half the price of these.  If you can't find real antlers locally or online for a better price, these are absolutely fine.  But do look around first.

review/summary: Excellent purchase, and much bigger than expected
review/text: After reading the reviews about how some customers received an antler piece that was too small, I was concerned that the same thing would happen to me and purchased a medium sized chew for my Japanese Chin.  When I received the chew, I was surprised to see how big the antler piece was! My dog definitely loves the chew toy; she sniffs at it, and tries to chew on the end.  However, it's much too heavy and long for her to carry around happily, and she will inevitably give up on the chew.  I will be giving this chew to my friend's dog, who is a Destroyer of Toys (bit the nose off a rubber squeaky pig) to see how she likes it.  I have already ordered a small sized chew for my dog.<br /><br />I guess my only complaint is that the size estimate is really too vague.  4-6 inches for the medium?  Well 6 inches is 50% more than 4 inches.  I'd like to see the sizes more exact.

He absolutely loves these antlers and I am happy to buy them for him.  This is my third purchase and the medium lasts my boy about 3-6 months depending on where he "hides" them.  This is one of his absolute favorite chew things (other than that blue monkey which ended up in the garbage).  I love this product because I do not worry about him choking or if it is okay for him to be eating plastic.  This product also gives me some peace and quiet since my buddy is entertained for so many hours, he does not bark at me.  WE BOTH LOVE THESE!

review/text: This was thin, unlike the last xtra large that I ordered from this supplier.  I think it will still work for the dog to chew, at least until is shrinks 2 inches or so.  Since my dog is a mastiff, I'm afraid that he'd try to swallow the thing whole if it gets too much smaller, due to its thin diameter.  So far, he hasn't shown much interest in chewing it.  I think  he likes the taste of the elk and moose antlers better.

review/summary: THE BEST CHEW ON THE MARKET
review/text: I adore this chew.  Two years ago I gave up chewing tobacco, the wife and the doc teamed up on me and finally convinced me it was time to stop playing chew Russian roulette.  It was tough to quit, I'd been chewing since I was eleven and half.  The idea was, give up the chew first and then tackle the cigarettes.  Well I'm happy to announce that last July with the help of hypnosis, the Patch, and plenty of nicotine gum, I am a non smoker!  Now watch, I'll get hit by buy a bus :) I'm just joshing.  Sure I put on a few pounds, a hundred and thirteen to be exact.  My shrink said I had an oral fixation and suggested a number of remedies, rebirthing, joggin, getting my jaw wired shut, tummy tucks, fake cigarettes, you know just something to stick in my kisser, hell I tried the works, but nothing seemed to do the trick.  Until accidently I stumbled upon these Antler Chews.  I had bought a couple for my dog "Swiderski," and one night while he was enjoying one at my feet, I was having myself a plate of ribs watching the Braves game.  And you know me, all thumbs, I dropped a rib to the floor.  Well I reached down real quick to grab it and accidently picked up Swiderski's antler.  And Lawdy lawd I tell you what, I was home.  These are TAAAASSSSSTY, I'll never buy a pack of beef jerky again.  I've dropped eighty eight pounds to date, and I don't go anywhere without my new chew.  I keep one in the glove box of my truck, and I've got em in every room in the house. Hell I've fallen asleep sucking these chews.  I know it's somewhat of a cliche but they do taste a little like chicken, and I stress, they are not overwhelming.  I couldn't tell you how many packs of smokes I'd go through when I'd get to drinking my beer, but now I can go a good three or four months with just one antler.  Whew baby!  For any of you out there with an oral fixation or those who just wanna drop a few pounds, these deer antlers'll do the trick. My compliments to the chef.  God does work in mysterious ways.

review/summary: FINALLY something that my girls can't chew through in minutes!
review/text: We have two dogs that are just over one year old (a Yorkie and a Pomeranian.)  And boy do they like to chew.  When they were puppies we could get away with the conventional chew toys, but as the girls got older, their chewing muscles got stronger.  They now destroy any plastic chew toy in minutes.  Eventually we found bully sticks, which are wonderful distractions for those evenings when the girls have more energy than I do, but the sticks would still only last about 60 minutes.  And then we met the deer antlers...PERFECT! The girls love to chew on them and the antlers last and last and last.  The antlers arrived and were approximately 6 inches long.  I didn't have much hope of them lasting since they seemed kind of small and the girls really went to town chewing on them.  But for weeks now the girls have chewed on the antlers and there is still barely any gone.  Oh deer antlers...where have you been all my life?  :-)

review/summary: Product does not live up to reviews
review/text: Over the last several months I have been hearing about deer antlers and I've done a lot of research and read lots of reviews before I decide to try this product. I have three black labs that have a chew product every night to help keep their teeth clean and thought this might be a way to save money and give them something new to chew on. Although the cost was kind of expensive, I felt it was worth trying.<br />I was excited to receive this product after reading all of the reviews. The deer rack was a good 7-9 inches or more long as described, had very little smell, and is very hard compared to something like rawhide or other types of bones one might buy. These antlers were more then twice the size of the ones I seen at local pet stores in the area and only about 1/3 of the price.<br />Needless to say, all three of my girls chewed on their antlers for about 10 minutes and have not looked twice at them again. I might not be surprised if my dogs were picky but I find it interesting since my girls eat anything and everything. Perhaps if your dogs have never had anything to chew on in their lifetime they might like this product. Other then that, the product is a waste of money.

review/text: I thought I was buying a bag full of these for $9 but there was only one 4" antler piece in the bag!  If my dog's last name was Gucci, Rockefeller, or Gates, this might make sense. But I am just an average guy so the price (including shipping) was rediculous for what I got. As they say, "fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me". Never again guys

review/summary: More beans than I know what to do with.
review/text: I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65?  One click and several months later and here I am.  I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them.  I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have "surprise jelly beans" when I'm not expecting it.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box.  No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard.  There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated.

review/text: I have two small dogs and had a tough time finding a healthy dog food that both of them liked and didn't give either of them a bad reaction - Natural Balance is it!  We switch between the liver and beef cans and always give them the Natural Balance dry food.  They both seem to like it and neither are having any negative issues from it.  Before Natural Balance dog foods would either make one have a dry, flaky coat and the other one vomit, or vice versa...I don't plan to ever switch them and they've been on it for over 2 years!

In all fairness Frenchies are notoriously flatulent, but this seems to have added an especially pungent note to her puppy farts.

review/summary: A healthy eat, through the day, very neat, the easy way.
review/text: This is one of the most marvelous items that  I've purchased to date from the "Grocery" section of Amazon.  These containers, which I think of as "motel morning" portions, are extremely convenient and quite delicious, presuming one is a Raisin Bran fan. Likewise, no matter how long the food stays in storage, my cabinets, or in the crate sitting in this cluttered abode's  back room, I note that the little, light plastic, sealed containers never seem to let the bran or raisins go stale or lose their taste.  I'm now working on my third crate of these little wonders.  I suspect that most readers would skeptically snicker at this reviewer's infatuation with such a mundane product, but one should always take matters involving quenching of the munchies seriously, especially at an advancing age when the ol' love-beaten, soul-searching heart needn't be weighed down with the added burdens of fat, cholesterol, salt, sugars and other modern processed sludge.<br /><br />Rex Lewis Field

review/summary: Handy, portion-controlled servings of cereal
review/text: Many motels offer these portion-controlled packages of Raisin Bran for their continental breakfasts, which is where I personally recently reacquainted myself with this cereal after having not eaten it in years. Compared to the high-fat, pastry-type muffins, white-flour bagels, waffles and English muffins on offer by the motel, this whole-grain cereal was a much better nutritional choice, even with its added sugar.<br /><br />I did a little research on Raisin Bran and learned that apparently not all Raisin Bran is made with the same ingredients. Some has high fructose corn syrup (HFCP) and some uses white and brown sugar. I checked the label on the individual packets on the Raisin Bran I ate today and yesterday. Neither packet said where the Raisin Bran inside was manufactured, whether the USA or Mexico, where Kellogg's has outsourced a lot of their production and whose version of Raisin Bran often does not have the authentic, time-honored ingredients that give Raisin Bran its unique flavor. But I am thinking that these small packets are made in the USA for two reasons. First, these packets had no HFCS, which the Mexican-made versions tend to have--the ingredients are: "Whole grain wheat, raisins, wheat bran, sugar, brown sugar syrup, 2% or less of salt, malt flavors." Second, these packets say, "Distributed by Kellogg Sales Co. Battle Creek, MI," and no mention was made of this Raisin Bran being made outside the USA. I could be mistaken, but it has been my understanding if a product is made outside the USA it has to say so on the packaging.<br /><br />The quality of this particular batch of Raisin Bran was excellent. The flakes were crisp, the raisins in separate pieces rather than clumped together as well as not too hard, and the taste was exactly as I remembered it from all the many times I've eaten it in the past.<br /><br />For those interested in the calories count of this cereal, each packet is a single 35 gm. serving listed as 110 calories. For what it is worth, the main way I personally tend to judge if the calorie count given by the manufacturer is accurate is to assess it against the nutritional breakdown the manufacturer also gives of fat, carbs and protein. Carbs and protein are about 4 calories per gram (actually a little less), and fat is about 9 calories per gram (also slightly less--they are rounded to the nearest whole number for rough-and-ready calorie calculations). This portion-controlled serving is .5 gram fat, or 4.5 calories. It is 27 grams of carb or 108 calories, and 3 grams of protein, or 12 calories, for a total of approximately 124 calories. However--and I don't know if Kellogg's factored this in because many manufacturers do not--the body does not digest the 4 grams of fiber which are a portion of the carbs. If you minus the 16 calories for the fiber because of that, that leaves a net calorie count of 108, which is close to the 110 that the package label claims.<br /><br />This product is not suitable for those who are allergic to wheat, and it is not ideal for those who are diabetic because of the sugar it contains. If you are diabetic and want to eat a bran cereal, one option is to purchase a bran-flake cereal made without sugar and add your own raisins or other fruit. A great natural, no-calorie sweetener to use in that type of situation is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Z9ASSK">stevia powder</a>.<br /><br />If you are an environmentally and/or price-conscious consumer, I wouldn't recommend buying Raisin Bran in this format of small, individual serving packets for home consumption. It generates a great deal of non-recyclable trash, most of it non-biodegradable plastic, and it is a lot more expensive than buying the cereal in a large, recyclable, cardboard box.

review/summary: SWEET APPLE CIDER!
review/text: Martinelli's Gold Medal Sparkling Cider. Martinelli's have been making Cider for a long time since 1868, I guess they know how to do it. It is sweet tasting apple Cider due in part because the Company is located in California's Pajaro Valley near Monterey Bay where the Cool Coastal climate and fertile soils produce some of the World's most flavorful apples, more than 50 Gold Medals for Excellence has been Awarded to Martinelli's fourth Generation Family Business<br /><br />I have read all that from the bottle, very interesting, but what I really like is to drink it. I always keep a very cold bottle in my Fridge, the non-alcoholic kind, so I won't get high. My Family and I celebrate any occasion with the sweet tasting apple Cider even for the Holidays and New Year's, we stack up in dozens of bottles, if there is a Birthday, you know we are going to drink some of that sweet Cider,...we love it! An all natural alternative that the whole Family can enjoy at any Celebration<br /><br />Local Growers supply tree-ripened hand-picked apples including the Old Fashioned Tart-Sweet Newtown Pippin for Martinelli's Gold Medal premium 100% juices. Martinelli's also have many non-alcoholic sparkling juices in Traditional Champagne bottles, such Apple-Cranberry, Apple-Grape, Apple-Peach...and many more, I have done my homework and I have tried some of them, but I still like the original Apple Cider the Best! I am having one right now. Thank You

review/text: This wine, if done properly creates a good drinkable wine.  That being said, however, I prefer the Vino Italiano brand kit of Valpolicella.  I find it creates a smoother wine, as it creates wine that has 1% less alcohol content.  The Reserve Du Chateau brand is good, but in my opinion save the extra bucks and grab the Vino Italiano brand of "Val".  The RDC brand does have more options of wines, so if you've been making kits for awhile now and you want variety, you're going to find it in the RDC brands.  These kits, just like their Vino Italiano counterparts are very easy to make.

review/text: I discovered this tea at a local coffee shop. This is undoubtedly the best tasting mint tea that I can recall drinking. The mint flavor is much stronger than the ordinary peppermint tea that I buy in the supermarket.<br /><br />However this is not peppermint tea, but a combination of mint flavors. The result is amazing.<br /><br />The coffee shop served a huge 16 oz cup of tea. When I finished the first cup, I asked for a refill of hot water, and there still was enough strength left in the tea bag for another great cup of tea.<br /><br />If you like mint tea that is robust, then you will love this tea.<br /><br />Note: The rating on this product has unfairly been lowered by earlier reviews complaining about the price. However, the current price on Amazon of ten dollars plus a dollar for shipping is actually less than the current price with shipping on the Mighty Leaf website.

review/summary: PureVia is the cheapest, best Stevia type product.
review/text: While, I had shipping issues again. I have had PureVia before.  I prefer it over Truvia, Stevia, etc... It is Zero Calorie (not 15 calorie or some other "low calorie stevia alternative."  The ingredients taste great and leave no after-taste.  I grew-up during the "Equal," "Nutrasweet" a.k.a. aspartame generation and can handle the taste of Diet Coke with Nutrasweet.  However, "Sweet & Low" a.k.a. saccharin was and has been part of the carcinogenic risk my whole life and don't use it.  Sugar is plain bad (from a healthy eating stand-point) - I know, artificial sweetners are not good for you either.<br /><br />However, PureVia is an excellent artificial sweetner in place of Saccharin, Aspartame, and Ace-K (Acesulfame Potassium. Stevia based sweetners are best and the most natural. There is nothing natural about Splenda. They make claims it comes from real sugar, but the process to get that is far from natural.<br /><br />Stevia is naturally extracted from the Stevia plant, a part of the Crysanthynum family; it is done so without the use of chemicals or radiation. Then the sweetest part of the Stevia plant is also extracted; "Reb-A." It is again, an all-natural process, with no chemicals, harsh extraction processes, radiation, etc...used. These ingredients are mixed with inert substances including (dextrose, cellulose poweder, and other natural products). It is gluten free, Kosher, and leaves no bitter after-taste like most sweetners that aren't simple sugar. Research will show that not all Stevia based products (like Truvia, Stevia, etc...) are created the same way nor have the same ingredients.<br /><br />PureVia is the cheapest. A box of 40 at the grocery is about $2.50-$3.00. A small box of Truvia can run up in the $5.00+ range.<br /><br />There is a product called "Stevia in the Raw" from the makers of "Sugar in the Raw"<br /><br />"Sugar in the Raw is real granulated unbleached Sugar made from Turbinado Sugar from Sugar Cane; however, although much better than white granulated sugar, it still has 25 calories per serving and contains sugar. It is also very course and hard to dissolve in iced drinks.<br /><br />"Stevia in the Raw" is admittedly, the BEST Stevia product.  Better than PureVia. However, it is much more expensive.  The reason it is better is the lack of added ingredients.  The process to obtain the Stevia and Reb-A is the same; however, only Dextrose or Malodextrin "Carbohydrates from Corn" are used as a "cutting agent." It is Zero calorie. In addition to Dextrose, the following contain extra "Natural Ingredients":<br /><br />Truvia adds erythritol, a sugar alcohol.<br />PureVia adds erythritol and isomaltulose, a disachharide of glucose and fructose (creating sucrose by enzymatic rearrangement).<br /><br />So, as you can see, they all have their own unique signatures, "Stevia in the Raw" being the apparent "safest" and "most natural."<br /><br />However, this review is about PureVia and I find it to be a pleasant transition from the normal Diet Soda sweetners and artificial sweetner packets at your local restaurant.  Give it a try or try "Zero Calorie Sobe" flavored waters.  They use PureVia, if I am correct. Vitamin Water Zero may use Truvia (Not definite on that one).

review/summary: Not my favorite Stevia
review/text: This stuff is not bad but I can't give it more than 3 stars. I get a kind of artificial taste from it that I haven't found in Truvia. I also prefer the more sugar-sized granules of TruVia but I really like the price of this product.<br />I think any individual looking for stevia sweetener should give this a try as, obviously, others have no problem with the taste of PureVia. My assessment of taste may also be altered by the fact that I'm in a low-carb state of ketosis and have the traditional "metal mouth" which does seem to affect my judgment.<br /><br />I wouldn't go out of y way to recommend PureVia but I sure wouldn't discourage someone from giving it a try.

review/text: My husband never cared much for my homemade biscuits. I didn't make them often enough to really get it right like my mother and grandmother used to do. Then I tried the Betty Crocker Bisquick Mix and WOW what a difference it made. We like the rolled method better than the drop, but either way these are easy, quick and consistently great biscuits. As good a true southern biscuit as even my grandmother used to make! My husband is now a very happy man when I make his favorite sausage gravy & biscuits breakfast.

review/summary: Great old fashioned biscuits...
review/text: I'm an old fashioned country girl that loves to cook. One of my favorite things to make and eat are homemade biscuits. I take a lot of pride in making them, and have to admit, I make a great biscuit. The only drawback is, that it takes time to make a perfect biscuit. Then I found a wonderful secret. Bisquick Complete Buttermilk biscuit mix. I bought a package and took it home. Unlike most other mixes, this one, you only add water. I gave it a try. Well guess what...these biscuits are just as good as mine, if not better. I was amazed at the homemade taste, how easy it was to make them, and only having to add water was the icing on the cake. These biscuits really are just as good as any great old fashioned country girl can make, they are very easy to make, and I now make these biscuits instead of my homemade ones, and none of my family has been able to tell the difference...but let's just keep that "our little secret"...hehe...~

review/summary: Better Than Homemade!
review/text: Bisquick is the best baking mix on the market, and provides a good start for pancakes and crepes.  I like the 7.5 ounce units because you don't end up with extra batter.  This size is perfect for our family of 3.<br /><br />Depending on what kind of consistency you prefer, you can add more or less milk, and another egg to the mix if you like.  I like my pancakes more crepe-like but my daughter likes hers to be fluffier.  With this mix, I can make hers first, with a heavier batter, and then add more milk to the leftover mix and make my crepes!<br /><br />We actually don't use this mix for biscuits, but just for pancakes and crepes, as we aren't really biscuit eaters.<br /><br />Amazons price is, of course, just right for this product.  I feel good just knowing I have a case in my pantry!

I bought these pretzels to make chocolate dipped pretzel favors for a shower, and more than 2/3 of the pretzels were broken. I had to count the ones that were ok so I could supplement with extra rods purchased elsewhere. If you need your pretzels to come at least MOSTLY unbroken, then these are not the pretzels for you. I don't know if it is the seller, the shipper, or whoever - the bottom line is these pretzels came damaged and I would not recommend them to anyone needing whole pretzel rods.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good, Nonchemically, Not Too Salty Salt
review/text: Well I have to admit I'm surprised.  I grew up with Lawry's Salt addicts, and I find that way too harsh.  I've tried different types of flavored salts but they always seemed to be too strong, imbalanced toward one particular flavor, chemically, or otherwise just plain weird.<br /><br />Because of that, I didn't have high expectations for this product, but the reviews were persuasive, and I did want to have a product of this type for convenience.<br /><br />Upon receiving and trying it, after the first use I realized this would be a staple in my pantry.  What a great seasoning product!  It's hard to define it because this product is nicely balanced and I would say subtle while still being quite effective even in a small amount.<br /><br />I want to point out also that this isn't overly salty, which is GREAT.  I don't use salt much on my food - mainly only on certain items.  Because of that, I tend to favor specialty gourmet salts (since I don't burn through them so fast as to make the expensive price an issue).  Specialty salts tend to have a lot of punch but remain discrete.  In other words, they don't turn the entire dish salty so much as distribute some salt here and there.  This variation keeps the palate invigorated with less actual salt used.  Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt seems to work in the same way.  You don't need much, and while it adds some salt flavor, it's not overkill.  Likewise, the other ingredients in the mix are very nicely balanced such that you have a great blend that seems to enhance the food it's added to rather than dominating it.<br /><br />I wish I would have tried this product sooner.  I am looking forward to trying it on different things; next will probably be deviled eggs!

review/summary: Best Vanilla Chai -- And *LESS* Sugar
review/text: If you've never had Big Train Chai, you don't know what you are missing.  Bar none, the best chai out there from power, concentrate, or brew.  After slavishly going out of the way to a particular local coffee shop for their chai, about a hundred bucks in and months later I finally got the barrista to tell me how it was made.  You can imagine I was shocked to find that it was a mix and was available for sale to the public.<br /><br />I prefer the vanilla flavor, and this mix really is sweetened with splenda but tastes just like the full sugar version.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />If you are looking for no carbs, go somewhere else -- there are some carbs per full serving (23 I think) but well worth it for a special drink every so often.  Also you can use just a scoop to flavor coffee or espresso drinks to great effect. But, less than the full two scoops does taste watery to me unless I sub milk or soy milk for water, in which case a single scoop (half carbs!) will work just fine.<br /><br />Enjoy!

All the seller needs to do to avoid an unhappy customer is to show the nutrition facts of the product. I never would have purchased this product if I had seen the nutritional facts. Maybe that is why they do not show those facts. The tea is very good. A lot of high cal and fat products are very good to the taste, but poison to the system of a person with medical problems on a restricted diet. I gave the tea to my size 2 young daughter. She loves it and has no need to restrict her sugar and fats. I will stay away from this seller's products.

review/summary: Taste great but very expensive!
review/text: It might be cheaper than going to a Starbucks but still expensive. Too bad for me, its delicious!! I tried to limit myself to 3 cups a week. Its hard. The "No sugar added" still taste great. I just hoped the price is more "reasonable".

review/summary: Soothing, flavorful beverage
review/text: Although it does contain just over 100 calories in a cup, it makes a good substitute for a sugar free snack of equal calories, and is a warming welcome in winter

review/summary: Best Chutney Ever
review/text: I make a beet salad with an orange chutney dressing that really doesn't taste the same without this chutney. Yes, there is mango chutney, but I prefer that with Indian food. We also use this chutney to make curried bananas, Bobotie, curried eggs and Lamb Sosaties.<br /><br />It is so essential to cooking in Africa. If you need a recipe using this chutney, just e-mail me from my site.<br /><br />One of our favorite ways to use this chutney is as a sauce with beef stroganoff. I know it sounds strange, but something about the "peaches" and the "creamy taste" of the sauce just works perfectly.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Favorite Chutney
review/text: Anyone who grew up in South Africa loves Mrs. Balls Chutney. I have been living in the USA for twenty years and have tried many chutneys, including many from local Indian Groceries and home-made varieties from speciality stores. Nothing quite beats the taste of this brand. I know many recipes that use this chutney to make a wonderful marinade, or sauce for chicken dishes as well. These recipes can be found on line. I was delighted to find that Amazon had listed this incredible product. I bought six bottles and as soon as they are finished, I know where I can find them again. Either the Regular or the Peach varieties are a family favorite, even amongst my American born children. Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: Only kind my husband will eat!
review/text: My South African husband worships this stuff.  Only thing he'll eat and he'll just about put it on anything if I'd let him!  He can't find anything like it in our local grocery store, so we have to order it regularly.

review/summary: Excellent Product -Priced too High
review/text: This is an excellent product and replicates the Sharwood's Peach Chutney I used to buy for 99 cents back in the early 70's. This company is great and I have purchased from them in the past with excellent results. Today I found the same product for much less in Texas and ordered from them. Hopefully I will get the same great service. Only $5.69 per bottle and since I order so many, it will really save. Sorry Amazon, I always shop from you, but this time someone else is getting my money.<br />[...]

review/summary: New to wine making
review/text: I am new to wine making this year and purchased this from my local wine/brew shop. Of the three Island Mist kits I have made this is by far my favorite. I'm not really sure how it ages as all 30 bottles were gone in two months (Lots of gifts). Many of my friends/family who don't normally drink wine really like it as it isn't too sweet nor too dry and you can actually taste the apple. Will defiantly be making this one again.
