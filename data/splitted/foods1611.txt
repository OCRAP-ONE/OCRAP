review/summary: best syrup ever
review/text: i generally dont like the taste of coffee syrups, but, when i was working at a cafe, we had the peanut butter syrup for a short period of time, and it was the best for flavoring up coffees and lattes, mix a bit of chocolate syrup with this and you have a slammin' desert coffee.

The ingredients are of a very high quality, you can taste the individual ingredients, and the best word to describe it is "Bright"!  My husband does not like green olives but he loves this sauce.

review/summary: Dogs love it!
review/text: My dogs love this food,they share a can in the morning to take their supplements. I would give them both a whole can daily if it didn't cost so much, although this is the best price I've found. I use this can food only to mix in garlic/brewers yeast tablets and Liquid Health level 5000, (which is Glucosamine with Perna mussel, MSM & shark cartilage (chrondroitin) bromelain amoung other things)the best joint product I found for the dogs. I also put down their mouth a fish oil capsual right before they eat the can food. My dogs are big dogs, 9 years old one very active & healthy, the other is good, but allergies and going to a Chiropractor every 3 weeks( has helped him greatly (he had neck and upper back  problems; what vets call spondolous (spelling?)He is doing good. They get a primal deffense(probiotic by Garden of life)and a blue/green algae tablet put down their mouth first thing in the morning, then later I feed them the can food. I also have Natures Variety grain free dry food out for them if they get hungery they may eat,and I make patties to freez that they get,along with raw chicken necks or backs daily, (vet said raw chicken necks or backs were safe and would keep teeth clean, it's cleaning them, most of the build up is gone of the back teeth where they were getting it.)The patties are raw ground turky,flax meal, eggs, shredded corrots, brocoli, aspargus and celery blended up, along with frozen blueberries, maybe  afew cranberries, fresh apples sredded, olive oil, sea salt, garlic powder,Perfect food by G of L. mix all and make paties in freezer bags, they love to eat them frozen, it's like a treat to them.

review/text: I put a little spoonful of this on top of my dogs' serving of dry Happy Hips kibble. They go nuts for it. Even my picky JRT gobbles it down. The Nature's Variety has a "people food" smell that I think appeals to them. The ingredients are healthy and you get a good ratio of meat to gravy in each can. Some other canned foods have so much gravy that you don't really get your money's worth.

review/text: It did take a while for this Miso to get in and it came in four days after the arrival date listed as they sold out and didn't update the listing, however the seller was quick to address the issue and give a partial refund, which was great and remedied the issue.<br /><br />The packaging is kind of flimsy, but works well enough. I got a chance to taste a bit of the miso yesterday and it's delicate and slightly sweet and just a tad salty, which is perfect for my purposes. I was mostly using it for a homemade vegan cheese spread and also going to try and make a vegan version of salted caramel using miso instead of butter.<br /><br />Overall I think it's a great value and exactly what I was looking for.

review/summary: Best mix I have ever tried
review/text: We stopped making waffles years ago because if you wanted light and crisp waffles it required whipping the egg whites until stiff. Then you folded them into the other ingredients. Then a friend let me try some of this mix, I am sold. Best, simple and when made with seltzer water they were light and had perfect taste. This product forced me to buy a good waffle iron, Foreman G5. Now I make waffles any time my wife asks, OK I might ask her if she wants waffles.

review/summary: best pancake mix on the planet
review/text: Our family absolutely loves Heartland's waffle and pancake products.  My personal favorite pancake mix is their sweet cream buttermilk, and we've never tried any of their waffle flavors that we haven't just loved. Every Sunday morning the Grandkids gather early for Grandpa's waffles or pancakes.  It has become a tradition at our house and Heartland makes it easy and fun. Recently a good friend and neighbor of ours underwent a bone marrow implant and while he was recuperating, he called one day to say he was hungry for Grandpa's waffles.  Grandpa gathered up his mix, utensils and waffle iron and headed for our neighbors house.  Afterwards, our friend called again to say those were the best waffles he had ever eaten, would we please share our secret with him on how to make them.  My husband replied "just go on-line and buy Heartland, it's as easy as that and you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Marti Owens

review/summary: Exotic, amazing tea
review/text: I got a free sample of this tea at a local health food store several months ago, and tonight I finally tried it. I was with a group of women and girls at a restaurant, and we were all wowed over the scent of the tea bag. I got hot water and made the tea, and several of us tried it. It's wonderful!<br />The tea was faintly sweet, but on first taste it was almost medicinal. As I continued to drink, that impression went away. The tea was fragrant, and surprisingly rich. Well, rich makes me think of chocolate pudding, so maybe that's not the right word. This tea is really delicious. I almost sucked the tea bag when the tea was gone!<br />It's been more than an hour since I got home, and the tea is still with me. It leaves a lingering memory and a pleasant aftertaste.<br />Definitely a keeper. Too bad the store is closed tomorrow. The tea sells at my local store for about $4.50 plus tax, for a box of 18 bags.<br />If you like herbal teas, try this. I plan on trying all the Tulsi teas my local store carries, and I may mail order the rest if the ones I try are as good as this.

review/summary: Finally, I can feed my dog a raw diet!
review/text: I have 19 month old Rottweiler mix that came to me as a rescue. (rott-boxer, I presume) When I first brought her home she was a ravenous eater who was used to literally INHALING her food so the other dogs she fostered with wouldn't steal it from her. The first few months I had her on a rotation diet of various high quality grain-free kibbles and would mix in various things from high quality canned to salmon or tuna or pumpkin. I also had the luxury of being able to mix in the various supplements into her meals without her noticing.. Sigh, those really were the easy days.<br /><br />At some point during this time I read about the benefits of a raw diet, and although I'm a vegetarian of 15 years I wanted to try it for my dog. Unfortunately it gave her diarrhea and she stopped eating it completely, so I gave up. Even cooked meat upsets her tummy - (which I now know that I can slow cook meat at a low temperature in a covered glass container to help keep the loss of important nutrients and enzymes through cooking to a minimum)<br /><br />Unfortunately after treating her for worms, which definitely was the cause of her slight frame and ravenous appetite, and a bout with coccidia she lost her appetite completely. I was at my wits end trying to feed her and tried everything and anything without much luck.<br /><br />After trying out everything I could think of and then some, I managed to somewhat find a solution. If I took one of her treat toys, coated the bottom with peanut or raw almond butter, put in the kibble (and some of the supplements I used to give her, although not all) and then coated the food in peanut butter she would eat. If I partially hand fed her I could get her to eat a cup of food or more, and I could increase that amount by mixing kibbles in with our training treats while out on our walks.<br /><br />Although I was happy to at least have a dog who was eating again (at least once every few days, which actually is probably closer to how dogs would eat in the wild) I was not happy feeding the SAME kibble and the SAME peanut or raw almond butter every day. I found a bag of Vital Essentials Beef Patties on sale at a local family owned shop and decided that the $6 investment was worth it to see if she would eat it.<br /><br />I started feeding it to her by crumbling up some and mixing in with her peanut butter every night. (I figured a little raw was better than no raw at all, plus adding the extra caloric content wasn't bad either) Finally one day I took out a patty and held it out to her nose to see if she was interested - and of course it was a no go. Then I got creative and smoothed some raw almond butter on top, and as soon as she smelled it her eyes got huge and she wolfed it down. I was ecstatic - FINALLY!!!! I can feed my dog raw and know that she is enjoying some of the benefits of a healthy raw diet; without having to worry about the diarrhea that always undoubtedly came.<br /><br />She will still occasionally turn her nose up at it, and it's not the ONLY food I feed her - But it's the one I definitely feel the best about feeding! Since her appetite and diet changed her BM's tend to be loose more often than not. Even after adding a probiotic (in pill form, since I can no longer sprinkle supplements into her food) to her diet I didn't notice much of an improvement - until she started eating Vital Essentials! Now her bm's are as they should be - very small (for her size) and can be picked up without leaving any on the grass but isn't so hard that she has a hard time getting it out.<br /><br />She now will typically eat it twice a day, although she will turn her nose up at it after 1 large patty or 2-3 small ones. For a dog of her size that simply wouldn't be enough food for her, and I believe in a variety diet anyway to emulate how they would eat in the wild.<br /><br />I love the fact that I know it is filling, which I really appreciate when I'm working and I know she's sitting at home waiting. I hate to think of her sitting there hungry, but many times would come home and find her belly gurgling as she devoured kibble out of my hand out of pure hunger.<br /><br />The only concerns or issues I have with the food is as follows -<br /><br />1) When I first bought the mini beef patties on sale I was perplexed by the packaging - I couldn't figure out if they were supposed to be reconstituted with water or served dry as is, and even the store clerk wasn't sure. Maybe some added instructions on the bag that they can be served "as is" would eliminate potential confusion.<br /><br />(I also couldn't picture my dog eating the patties because even for her they just seemed too thick and large - Of course all I had to do was break them up for her after coating the pieces with pb!)<br /><br />2 - Definitely not widely available locally. The store I originally found it in ONLY had that one bag (although still listed as a purveyor on the Vital Essentials website) and has never restocked. Of course I can and do order through Amazon but it would be nice to be able to purchase locally as well.<br /><br />3) Price - Of course price is going to be a concern for everyone in this economy, but I can't IMAGINE trying to feed this as her primary food. For smaller dogs I'm sure it's not nearly as bad - the mini-patties come in a bag that's around $25 with free shipping. (with prime) Unfortunately for larger dogs that may require 8 or more patties a day that bag won't last very long.... And prime shipping isn't available for the larger patties.<br /><br />The other option is to order to large patties but a roll of those would still only last 1-2 weeks and can cost as the Origen Regional Red kibbles she tolerates that will last a month or more!<br /><br />4) Sizing - It would be really nice if they made a LARGER bag of Beef mini-patties available on Amazon - I've noticed some of their other varieties will come in 14 and 16 oz. bags, but I've only found beef in the 14 oz. Even better if it would come in a 20 oz. bag and was priced in between the large patties and the 12 oz. bag of mini-patties<br /><br />5) Some type of frequent buyer program would be nice! (Especially considering there are other freeze dried patties out there to try!)<br /><br />That said, I noticed that one of the companies I buy from through Amazon for the larger patties changed their pricing so the shipping is now built into the price and they offer a 5% discount if you buy two packages and 10% if you purchase even more - I usually only buy one at a time because of the cost but since they are offering the discount I figured heck, why not?<br /><br />Still, I'd like to see something from the manufacturer directly, or even just an occasional coupon from their website here or there.<br /><br />Overall these are all MINOR issues - just wanted to point them out for people who may be considering this food. My dog LOVES their beef rolls and so do I. I love the fact that she eats it, sometimes twice daily! This is a dog that routinely sticks her nose up at steak or chicken or lamb but absolutely LOVES to chow down on grass.<br /><br />I love the fact that it's raw, AAFCO approved meaning it's a balanced raw diet, and that the company has such stringent methodologies of ensuring safe, nutritious food for your dog. I definitely recommend this food to at least give it a shot and see if your dog will like it - hopefully the company sends samples if you contact them.

review/text: I usually don't particularly like shortbread cookies, especially from Scotland, since I think they're too hard, but I buy it for my mom who loves them, so I picked a box up at Marshall's for $5 and instead of their usual, they had "vanilla shortbread."  The picture of the tender looking stylish cookies looked so yummy in the package that I kept it for myself and tried it.  It's made as a "light viennese style" shortbread which is why it's soooo soft compared to their usual shortbread cookies.  Also, there's a distinctive vanilla taste to it.  There are 12 shortbreads in the 5.3 oz box.

review/summary: I was sold pass use by date candy - Beware
review/text: The Health Candy Bars from Amason were just pass their use by date when I got them. I wonder if that is why they were discounted. It would be helpful to know before one buys a product if it is near or past the end of it used by date. it sure effects the value of the product. Amazon needs to fixed this.

review/summary: Fave Candy
review/text: I decided to buy this because the stores hardly ever have Heath Bars.  I would have preferred to have regular single-packaged bars but the price on these was quite good.  The king size is simply two regular 1.4 oz bars packaged together.  The only problem (and I don't know who is to blame here) is that every single bar is broken -- some broken multiple times.  Like I said I don't know if Amazon shipped them this way, or if it happened during shipment.  They came in a box with those air bags but should have probably been shipped in peanuts or some other impact-absorbing material.  Anyway it doesn't matter for just us nibbling on them at home, but it would matter if they were being using in gift baskets or something like that.

review/summary: Beware! Bad batch made me sick 4/10/11!
review/text: I love heath bars, and they agree with me quite well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I ordered this item and even without eating a whole one, I got sick from it and have been all night, and am still.<br /><br />The bar was "off" with a slightly odd taste and the center was a bit "chewy" rather than crisp. Odd enough that I set it aside after eating part of it.  Soon I was queasy and I slept badly, and now 12 hours later it feels like there are knives in my intestines and I'm having diarrhea.<br /><br />Amazon was good about it, gave me a full refund and told me to dispose of them, which I will do. Into the trash they go.<br /><br />The lot number is a bit smudged on the box, but appears to be<br /><br />40PR2<br />BB 01 2012<br /><br />I don't blame amazon, but I feel like I've been poisoned.  And no, I didn't eat anything else, it was utterly clear what has made me ill. Also, the same day I had some heath miniatures I also bought from amazon, and they were great!<br /><br />I suspect that I'm not the only person to get a bellyache from this batch.<br /><br />These should be recalled, IMO.

review/summary: Great rice seasoning
review/text: I bought this because I'm slowly getting into doing bentos, and rice onigris seemed like something cute to try to do, but I feared they would be too bland.  I heard about furikake and it seemed like a good idea in order to give rice some taste; then the problem was: which furikake variety to choose?<br /><br />I like nori (the seaweed used to wrap sushi, and the one most furikakes contain if it just says "seaweed"), but I know I would be wrapping my onigris in it to avoid them falling apart.  I was reticent to try one of the more "fishy" ones, as I'd heard that the fish taste could be overwhelming.  So this one -- mixture of bonito and nori -- seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />Just tried it for the first time last night, and it's great!<br /><br />I just wish that either my Asian grocery or Amazon also stocked egg furikake, since I've heard that that one's pretty good too.

Even my mother, who detests sushi, loves this flavoring.  She even requested her own bottle!  A little goes a long way, and we just sprinkle it over the serving bowl.  People who can't get enough, usually sprinkle a little extra on their own portions.  (Like myself!)

I bought a whole bunch of this stuff, different styles that were all in standard size packaging that most companies provide a lb of pasta to realize they mislead you into thinking you are getting a lb.<br />The stuff is not cheap to begin with. I truly wonder with a company that is misleading if their claims of 5 digestable grams of carbs is true. They can say whatever they want as this stuff is not FDA regulated.

review/summary: A Decent Cup of Decaf
review/text: Compared to the espresso or just brewing a cup of drip coffee, I the standard caffeinated Caffe Lungo, does not measure up. It has a relatively weak taste and isn't particularly flavorful. But it isn't bad; it just isn't great. Caffe Lungo Decaffeinato tastes about the same.<br /><br />But I will find myself making this decaffeinated coffee often. When I buy decaf beans, I waste them by making a whole pot when I only want  a cup. And because I don't want to waste them (and the money) I only infrequently make it.<br /><br />Dolce Gusto Caffe Lungo Decaffeinato has fixed that problem for me. For just over thirty cents using the discounts available now, I get a quick cup of decaf coffee (which is all I want in the evening) without making a mess.

review/text: We enjoy all kinds of furikake.  My kids love to put it on their rice, and in nori rolls.<br /><br />The name of this type of furikake is misleading.  With Wasabi in the name, one would easily believe they were buying something with some kick.  Not at all.  This furikake is sweet, with a mild seaweed flavor.  I prefer Nori Komi over this type, however, I still eat it.  Regardless, I believe this sweeter furikake has it's place at the table.  I simply use it sparingly.<br /><br />To really illustrate what the other negative reviewers are pointing out:<br /><br />Wasabi Fumi - 1 Tbsp = 2g sugar<br />Nori Komi - 1Tbsp = 1g sugar<br /><br />Wasabi Fumi contains double the sugar of another popular type of furikake, also available on Amazon.  I recommend buying several types and trying them all.

We always serve this with sticky Asian Rice and it's been a hit with all our guests who Asian food palettes may not be as developed as ours...just realized this one is called Nori FUMI Furikake.  The one I have is Nori Komi Furikake - ingredients listed: sesame seed, salt, sugar and seaweed.  Suspect they are very similar.

A little goes a long way, and this 1.7oz container has lasted us months.  We have rice three or four times a week.

review/summary: Great for a Bento Box Breakfast
review/text: I recently discovered this seasoning at Foodland in Maui.  It was used as a flavouring for a bento-box breakfast with steamy rice as a base, two slices of Spam, and scrambled eggs.  The green of the seaweed was the colour that attracted me then the taste made me a fan of the Furikake.<br /><br />I declared this delish dish as my new fav food and was not alone.  I had to get to Foodland every day by 7:30am to beat the surfers to this delish dish.  The Deli guy told me about the seaweed seasoning being Furikake - I brought home two bottles and am now delighted to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />Ruby

It makes your rice taste sweeter (it contains sugar) and gives it extra flavor. After using this, it would be hard to go back to eating rice without it. Tastes great on brown and white rice.

review/text: This is the stuff you pray for if you are searching for real divinity candy. It is fresh, well packaged, and tastes the most like the kind my sainted Great Grandmother always made for Christmas. It comes in immaculate little packages of two candies each and the sweet pieces don't have that old yellowed look and lardy taste that some other companies try to temp you with. There is no shiny, waxy satan, outer coating here to devil you ; just innocent, fluffy white clouds that  melt in your mouth like the heavenly host or manna with pecans.  The shipping charges can be sinful but well worth the indulgence!

review/summary: Good but not quite like the real thing
review/text: I was happy to find Avena smoothies available in the US, as it is a delicious, smooth and nutritious drink that blends oats and milk. The Tetra pack with straw makes it perfect at home, for school lunches or on the go. It can be drunk by the glass, in cereal, or as a snack. The long expiration date (about 6 months without refrigeration) is a big plus. It is made in the USA and distributed directly by the manufacturer, Alpina Foods, out of Miami FL.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised at the ingredients: water, sugar, powdrered milk, oat flour, mono & diglycerides, carragenan, guar gum, xhantan gum, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate. In terms of nutrition: 180 calories, 4 grams of fat (3 are saturated), 10 mg cholesterol, 115 mg sodium, 22 gr sugar, 1 gr fiber, 5 gr protein, Calcium 16 DV%. While it tastes similar to real avena, the overly processed ingredients give me pause. I will be looking for a recipe for real avena which is probably not that hard to make and a lot healthier.<br /><br />As a sidenote, you can buy this at your local supermarket (in the section of south american foods) in 8 oz containers for half the price.

review/summary: Premium Edge Senior Dog Food Lamb and Rice
review/text: I have fed my last two dogs Premium Edge Senior dog food with lamb being the protein.  I am currently mixing it with Premium Edge large breed puppy chow which is a 27/16 protein/fat.  Typically German Shepherd's are fed<br />large breed puppy chow through 15 months.  My GS has Panoesteitis (Long Bone Disease) and I needed to reduce the protein without any additional growth components while still feeding her the necessary requirements.  She eats Premium Edge Large Breed Puppy Chow Lamb based and I substitute one of her four cups a day with the Senior Light.  I discontinued her vitamins due to the excess protein and I feed her as mentioned above.  I think the added supplements for seniors helped with her limp and strengthened her bones overall.  She is 13m months old and almost done with the Panoestetis; it is a self-limiting disease and generally heals by 18mo - 2 yrs.  I am not advocating that protein causes Panoesteitis - its just one of the mentioned possible causes.<br />I would recommend Premium Edge which is made by Diamond foods.  Google Diamond Foods and you will see all the brands they supply.

review/summary: Miracle Dog Food
review/text: I cannot say enough good stuff about this dog food.  I've been using this dog food for over 10 years and it has been difficult at best to find.  I'm so glad to see it on amazon!<br /><br />My 8 yo 50 lb. mutt was showing signs of age, sleeping a lot, and basically not much else.  My vet asked what I fed him and I told him Science Diet.  He said - well that's a good food.  I was then turned onto this food (for my 65+ lb lab) and I noticed an enormous difference in my mutt.  He became the fun active dog I'd always known him to be and basically stayed that way till he died at 15.5 years old.  I totally attribute his activity and long life to this food.<br /><br />My lab was always active so in all honesty I did not notice any changes in her.  The food is dosed with glucosamine and chondroitin for healthy joints - which is a nice to have when you have larger breed dogs that sometimes have joint problems.

review/summary: vet recommended
review/text: My Boston is 12 yrs old. Two years ago, he developed a skin condition characterized by flaking, excessive itching and bald spots on his coat. The vet prescribed methazolamide and Omega -3 fish oil: the former was toxic to his system, the latter, alone, didn't improve the condition. She then suggested Premium Edge in combination with the fish oil. I started out with the salmon (blue bag) which he's been up until this month. This time I ordered the lamb and he gobbles it up despite the fact that it's never a good idea to change your pet's diet, taste-wise anyway. Since he's been on Premium Edge, his coat has returned to normal and he no longer suffers itching. Whether or not the cessation of symptoms can be attributed wholly to Premium Edge may be coincidental but I wouldn't feed him anything else, either. I order the 35-lb bag because, for an elder 24 lb dog, it lasts months. Also, I no longer add fish oil. This food seems to provide all the nutritional requirements for a soon-to-be 13 yr old terrier.

review/summary: Best SF Chocolate!
review/text: For years, Russell Stover had the best Sugar-Free/Low-Carb chocolate on the market.  That was until I found this delight!  Their dark chocolate bar is so supremely rich and decadent that you'd never know it was sugar-free at all!  I prefer their dark chocolate (50% cacao) for everything.  They do have one with almonds (45% cacao) that is good for snacks.  My sister prefers their milk chocolate, but I find the dark has a much better chocolate flavor without being bitter at all.<br /><br />It's also FANTASTIC for cooking!  I use this bar in any recipe requiring melted chocolate or baking chocolate and it is incredible when used as a glaze or for dipping (my friends RAVED over the chocolate-covered almonds I made with this).  I used to be able to find this at Wal-Mart, but I believe they have stopped carrying it.  Hopefully, I will be able to find it locally, but if not, Amazon, get this in stock!

review/summary: 93% Chance this Contains GMO Soy
review/text: Since 93% of soy is GMO(genetically modified organism), this probably contains GMO soy.  GMOs (genetically modified organisms) pose a danger to our environment and to human and animal health.  According to a newsletter article I recently received from Dr. Joseph Mercola (some of his stuff has to be taken with a grain of salt) Monsanto infiltrated the U.S. government in order to gain approval for its GMOs.  GMOs have never been studied for safety in humans.  They are banned in many European countries. Dr. Andrew Weil has come out against them.  In animal studies, they have been shown to cause organ damage and infertility.  Dr. Mercola said that theoretically they could cause the good bacteria in your intestines to produce pesticides.  Most of the soy, corn, zucchini, squash, canola and Hawaiian papaya are GMO. Honey can also contain GMOs. You have to carefully read labels as a lot of vitamins and supplements contain soy lecithin or soybean oil. Yesterday I went to Whole Foods Market in Paradise Valley and stopped at the adjacent yogurt shop called Zoyogurt.  I should have asked to see an ingredient list, but it didn't occur to me.  On my way home, I got the worst stomach ache.  When I got home I went to the yogurt shop's website and read the list of ingredients.  Corn syrup is the main sweetener. Most corn is GMO. Well, I won't be getting yogurt there again.  Also, Whole Foods Market is supposed to be GMO free, but the Cornucopia Institute did a study on breakfast cereals and found that Whole Foods 365 brand corn cereal contained 51% GMO corn.  Trader Joes has also said that its brand does not contain GMOs, but if there were GMOs in Whole Foods corn cereal, I wonder if I can trust what Trader Joes is saying.  Organic food cannot contain GMOs.  Farmers who do not want to plant these poison seeds on their land often have their crops contaminated by adjacent fields where GMOs are being grown.  Monsanto has sued and ruined many of these farmers for patent infringement.  We need legislation requiring the labeling of any product that contains GMOs.  Even honey should be bought organic as the bees that are allowed to feed on GMO crops transfer them to the honey.  The Environmental Working Group  has a link to a petition against them on their website.

review/summary: Limoncho
review/text: This stuff tastes amazing though and everyone I share with loves it! Although I am sure the seller did not mean to mislead buyers, each individual limoncho container is .4 oz and not 4 oz like written in the description.

review/summary: Great for Big Dogs
review/text: I bought the General Panton bones for my Dobie and Great Dane. They are fantastic. The dog loved them, and they are big and strong enough to hold up to some serious chewing. They lasted a few weeks, where most other bones have lasted only a few hours.

review/summary: The Bone That Won't Splinter!
review/text: Years ago this bone was recommended to me by the owner of a small pet store. I have a dane/lab mix, Gumbo. He literally splintered every bone i gave him. The owner recommended this bone and it has been just wonderful. Gumbo loves them and tho he can eventually chew the knuckles off, he has never been able to splinter this one. I have recommended it to people w/ med to large dogs and it has become the bone of choice for everyone I know.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Thoroughly enjoy all the Two Leaves and a Bud teas I have tried. This is a great tea for the winter and with the bulk packaging will make excellent care pack gifting! Easy instructions for steeping, ingredients are listed on the outside and packing is convenient as each tea bag is in its own plastic sealed bag. Would definitely recommend and will be purchasing again.
