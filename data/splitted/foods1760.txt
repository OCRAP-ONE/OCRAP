review/summary: Chemical cardboard taste, soggy cereal
review/text: Wow this is truly horrible. The cereal taste like the cardboard box it is in, chemically, and it becomes almost instantly soggy after adding the milk creating this slimy texture. After chewing it, it does get stuck in your back teeth which is also annoying so it is definitely not on my to buy list. Contrary to their picture on the box, it is not filled, but rather a thin line of chocolate is drizzled inside. What are they thinking? Did they not have anyone in their facility try it out before mass producing it? NOT RECOMMENDED

review/text: One's first thoughts on eating this cereal are of the bathroom, and for two reasons. First, that's where its taste seems to come from, and second, because that's where any mouthful should immediately be coughed up. The best that can be said about Krave is that it will, one hopes, soon be off the market. Its commercial success, if it wins any, will mean only that America's taste buds have finally succumbed to their long-sustained beating at the hands of disgusting products that companies try to pass off as 'food.'

review/text: This stuff was so disgusting I ate half a bowl and threw out the rest of the box.  I'm a poor starving student and single mom, and for me to waste money like that, you know it's got to be bad.  The crispy outside is good, actually -- light, stays crispy in milk, nice texture and fresh taste.  But the "chocolate" on the inside is GROSS.  Tastes chemical-y, acrid, artificial -- truly inedible.

review/text: I really tried to like this cereal.  I had tried the chocolate, chocolate flavor and didn't like it so I was hoping that I would like this one better but I didn't.  The cereal turned to mush just after a few minutes in the milk and it tasted like burned brownies.  The picture on the box is very misleading as the cereal itself is not nearly as big.  Definetly does not live up to it's name.

review/summary: I'll pass!
review/text: I love anything chocolate,and almost every cereal from Kelloggs but Kellogg's new cereal Krave is not appetizing at all. The outer part of the cereal has a taste like a not so sweet teddy graham cracker with an inferior tasting liquid like chocolate inside. The cereal didn't get soggy fast so it did provide you with a crunch, but even that didn't help the taste. Krave is a cereal that actually tastes better right out of the box without the milk.<br /><br />I think that this cereal would have been better with a more textured coat and more firmer chocolate on the inside. I just didn't care for this cereal because it tasted almost like a generic brand.

review/summary: This stuff is awful
review/text: I really like cereal and eat a lot of it.  The sweet cereals are a treat I give myself from time to time.<br /><br />Saw Krave and it sounded interesting, had a coupon and it was on sale so decided to take a chance.  Tried the chocolate flavor (instead of double chocolate) first as it sounded like it was going to be very sweet.  Not even close.  The texture is overall soft, like it's barely staying together.  The center is gooey.  The taste is an odd one (the words "chocolate" and "sweet" don't come to mind) and there is a strong chemical aftertaste, so much so that I found myself reading the ingredients list to try and understand why.<br /><br />Had another coupon and it was still on sale, decided to try the double chocolate to see if maybe that's better.  Same overall results.  Both flavors of this cereal are just plain nasty.  How can you possibly ruin a chocolate flavored cereal???  I'm amazed it made it though the taste tests at Kellogg's to be released to the public.

review/summary: Krap, No Krave!
review/text: There are no words sufficient to describe how horrible these taste, but I will try. There is NO chocolate taste, but rather, a burnt chemical-flavored filling that bears no resemblance to ANY chocolate I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot of chocolate. The shell is flavorless, with a slightly crispy but quickly evaporating dust-like consistency. That it also looks like cheap dog food only makes it worse. How Kellogg's could get this one past their tasting panels is beyond me, but if it's chocolate you're looking for, buy something else. If it's dust you want, look under your bed and save some money. If it's dog food you're after, consider your dog's happiness and buy dog food. And the one thing you will NOT be doing after you taste these God-awful little morsels is craving them.

review/text: This is one of the worst tasting cereals I've ever had in my life. After eating this cereal I went online to see what other people thought. I found people on Youtube reviewing this cereal and loving it. They must be paid actors as part of a viral video scheme because this cereal was terrible. There was hardly any chocolate inside these things unlike the pictures on the box and the texture of the cereal is not good at all.

review/summary: I quite enjoyed it
review/text: I am not someone who likes most "breakfast" foods, like eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.  So cereals, hot or cold, make up a lot of my breakfast choices.  I am always looking for something new, so I was super excited to try Kellogg's Krave.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the nutritional information.  A 3/4 cup serving is only 120 calories, 3.5 grams of fat, 3 grams of fiber, and 2 grams protein.  Not awful nutritionally, certainly better than a lot of cereals out there.<br /><br />When I opened the box, it was initially just to look at the cereal, but Hubby and I tried a piece dry.  It has a nice crunch, and tasty flavor.  It was not overly chocolatey, just a mere hint of chocolate in the middle, which I actually really liked.  I tried some with soy milk as a late night snack.  With my milk, it was only 155 calories.  And I enjoyed every single one.  It stayed crunchy in the milk, and it had a nice flavor.  I especially liked that the cereal was not overly sweet, just sweet enough with a hint of chocolate.<br /><br />I really liked the cereal, and it is a nice way to break of the routine of oatmeal and traditional healthy cereals.  In terms of where it falls on the health-taste balance, Krave falls somewhere between Kashi and Cocopuffs.  I would, and in fact already have, recommend this to someone looking for a good cereal to break up the breakfast routine.

review/summary: BLECH!
review/text: Kellogg's Krave cereal tastes like chemicals to me. It contains ingredients which are patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab by inserting foreign genes into their DNA and made them resistant to massive amounts of RoundUp. The sugar in Krave comes from GMO sugar beet, and the soy is GMO soy. I called Kellogg about a month ago to ask if they are using genetically engineered ingredients and they said they do use them because the FDA says they are safe and Kellogg's complies with the FDA regulations. I called Kellogg's again yesterday (twice) and this time they told me that they don't know if their products contain GMOs because they don't test for them. Kellogg has pumped $632,500 into the propaganda campaign in California that is fighting to trick people not to vote for Prop. 37, for the labeling of genetically engineered foods.  Kellogg's doesn't want you to know that Krave contains GMOs. My family thinks they taste disgusting anyway. Poured the box down the toilet. We won't be eating Krave again. Blech!

review/summary: Krave Cereal For Chocolate Cravers
review/text: Krave is an interesting cereal, providing some grain goodness along with a chocolate center. The center is a chocolate filling, made with cocoa and chocolate, with a consistency somewhere between syrup and mousse. It is a bit on the sweet side, so children will definitely like it and adults shouldn't be put off by it. The shell is a crunchy, grainy texture. When served with milk, the shell softens and becomes somewhat slimy, which is a rather odd feeling in the mouth, but not really unacceptable.<br />Krave is a bit on the expensive side, but considering the price of most popular breakfast cereals today, it is not out of line. However, I wonder if it was really necessary to use embossing on the box? Doesn't that add to the cost, unnecessarily?

review/text: Crispy, stands up well to milk.  The corn nuggets are similar to Cap'n Crunch, but not as sweet.  The chocolate inside isn't as much as the carton indicates (as usual with groceries!), but I think if there were more it would overwhelm the rest of it.  Good, good stuff.  I guess if I had kids I would buy this for them as a *treat*, not an actual nutritious breakfast.  It probably has good vitamins and minerals, but I personally can't eat one serving by itself; so I would imagine your average munchkin would have the same difficulty.

review/summary: decent taste with a kick of chocolate in the center
review/text: This is a good addition to my evening snacking cereals.  I'm a sugar and chocolate lover; definitely not a fan of things that are good for you.  So when I had a chance to pick up another new cereal food group - combo chocolate and sugar, who could pass it up.  To top it off, the nuggets stay crispy enough (not like Capt'n Crunch, but as good as Frosted Flakes) through the entire bowl.  The nugget piece is not cardboard tasting like other cereals (the round circles that have gone all anti-cholesterol on me) and the chocolate center is a terrific late taste bud pleaser.  So I'm rating it a very good addition to the cabinet stock.

review/summary: Could be better.
review/text: I expected this cereal to be sickeningly sweet, and for the middle to be rather gooey and overpowering.  Fortunately, the cereal is none of those things, thank goodness.<br /><br />But it's not Nutella or Ghiradelli in cereal form, either. At best, it's average, and I doubt that I'll buy another box.<br /><br />Why? Mostly due to the "crunchy coating." It's hard to describe the texture of these little floury pillows. They are a little bit like the texture (but not the taste) of Captain Crunch, in that they dissolve almost instantly when you bite it. But the moistened coating sticks tenaciously to your teeth after you eat the cereal, which turned out to be the thing that turned me off the most. It's one thing to rinse your mouth after eating, it's another to scrub your teeth as if you had been chewing taffy.<br /><br />The chocolate in my box of cereal was almost skimpy. It was solid and not terrible chocolate, much to my surprise.  Frankly the chocolate, although average, was the best part of cereal. It was the bizarre crunchy layer that had the main taste/texture/aftertaste problem that made the cereal a no go in my house.

Truthfully, I've tried to think of a cereal it reminds me of, but so far, I can't think of one.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this cereal, as I love chocolate and am always looking for a way to sneak chocolate into my breakfast, but I think I would have been better off just eating a Hershey bar.<br /><br />This cereal was a sad, mushy mess.

Krave is made with whole grains , has 11 vitamins and minerals , and is a good source of fiber.<br /><br />  Krave is like heaven in a box! It has a crunchy shell and a smooth chocolate center.I feel it is  a great way to start the day, by eating a bowl of Krave in the morning.Everyone who eats Krave will fall in love, thats what happened to my Brother and I. This is a perfect cereal for kids, I believe that every kid will love it.<br /><br />  I have never found a cereal I like to eat for breakfast, until I found Krave. Krave is the most delightful cereal in the world. I recommend everyone to try it. I love Krave and I love that it is available  at any store so you can get it anywhere. I especially like how Krave will keep you full until around lunch time. Other cereals I have eaten leave me hungry 30 minutes after I am done eating them. But the grams and fiber in Krave help me stay full longer. The great taste makes it a favorite for everyone, and the ingredients make it great!

It's my all time favorite cereal. That being said, it's much cheaper to buy at Walmart and even at Publix(which I avoid because its expensive) than Amazon. Currently Walmart has the cereal for about 27cents/oz and Publix has it for 35cents/oz.<br />In the past I would find a cereal, eat it so much I'd get tired of it and then move on, this one is so good I can't move on from it.

review/text: Krave is a great cereal, crispy texture on the outside, smooth chocolate center. It has just the right amount of sweetness without being overbearing. While it runs a far distance to Reese's puffs, they hold their own for the chocolate lover in all of us. The primary drawback is that it doesn't hold up to milk well. If you are looking for that chocolate bleed into the milk, it comes at a price, soft outside texture, to the point of mushy. If you eat quickly, it won't bother you.

As I took my first bite, the chocolatey taste filled my mouth, and at first I was in heaven.  The one thing that I did NOT like about this cereal was the actual cereal surrounding the chocolate.  I was hoping for something with a little more crunch to it, like Cap'n Crunch.  What I got was a very soft coating that had very little, if any, crunch to it.  Because it was such a soft cereal coating, it got soggy very quickly.  If Kellogg's could make the outer portion crunchier, then I would gladly buy this cereal.  As it is, I will leave it on the shelf.

review/summary: Better as a snack than everyday cereal?
review/text: If you are a chocolate lover and/or like things that are very sweet, then you might rate this a 4 or 5 star product.<br /><br />It was quite good, with an enjoyable chocolate taste that held up as well as you can expect from a cereal once milk is added to the equation.<br /><br />But, for me, it is too sweet to entertain as my morning cereal.  I used it more as a snack - sometimes with milk, sometimes just a dry handful - and enjoyed it in that regard.<br /><br />I could see buying this as an occasional treat that has more nutritional value than typical sweets, but I would not have this as a mainstay breakfast option.

review/summary: It's OK.... Just not "great"
review/text: This cereal was more like candy, with a slightly odd taste.  It did have a unique texture, from the creamy chocolate filling to the crispy cereal outside.  I didn't see much value, nutritionally, and it didn't keep me full or satisfied, at least in the amount that was specified for a serving size.  I give is 4 stars for snack candy value, butonly about 2 stars as a breakfast food.

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: My daughter has been begging me to buy this cereal, so I was excited to get to try a box to review.<br /><br />Upon pouring my first bowl of cereal, I was a little surprised.. I hadn't paid a lot of attention to the commercials, so I had pictured this more like shredded wheat with chocolate in the middle. It's actually a golden crispy cereal on the outside with a chocolate center.<br /><br />About the cereal itself, it's quite tasty, the golden crisp nicely offsets the yummy chocolate blast in the middle. It does get a little soggy in milk, but it generally doesn't last long enough to be a real concern. It was a huge hit in my household, I only got one bowl, when I went back for more, it was gone! Since then, by popular demand, I purchased the double chocolate Krave. While the chocolate is too intense for me, my husband and daughter love it. I must now keep a box of Krave on hand at all times or suffer my family's wrath!

review/text: Does that sound like faint praise? I don't mean it to be. I remember enthusiastically trying the Special K chocolate cereal and being disappointed. So I'm pleasantly surprised to rate this one as "Not bad." It has a nice crunch and the chocolate isn't overwhelming. I don't think I'll have it every morning, but for a nice change of pace from rice crispies or corn flakes -- or to snack from the box when I'm craving chocolate -- I think I'll reach for Krave.

review/summary: Identity Crisis
review/text: Krave is a cereal with an identity crisis. It's not nearly a grow-up cereal like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6KBJ4">Special K</a>, but it's not a kids cereal like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AMN3T2">Fruit Loops</a>. If you're used to eating "grown-up" cereal, you will think this is too sweet. But if you are trying to wean your kids (or yourself) off of the cereals with a prize in the box, this may be a good transition. It is sweet, but not overpoweringly so. The chocolate doesn't have a super artificial taste to it, and I've enjoyed this cereal by the handful as a snack as well as by the bowlful in milk.

review/summary: Not Appetizing, Not Nutritious
review/text: I might have been the wrong person to review this product - I'm in the medical industry, and I see firsthand the problems caused by modern American eating habits.<br /><br />So putting chocolate in the middle of a breakfast cereal is not the ideal that I usually endorse.<br /><br />That's okay, because I didn't like the taste anyway. It had a weird aftertaste. It was crunchy, but it was not very appetizing. My boys ages 11 to 7 liked it, but they are not the most discriminating audience.<br /><br />The label lists vitamins and a token amount of fiber as nutrition. However, this is still a carbohydrate laden food, and it is something that shouldn't be a regular item of people's diet.<br /><br />To be honest, we do buy a "sugar cereal" for our kids, but they are only allowed to have it once a week. However, I won't be buying Krave for that once a week treat due to the poor taste anyway.

By all means, accompany this snack with a glass of milk; just don't dare turn it into soggy mush by adding the milk to it.  My whole family liked this product very much and we all five agree, milk makes it mushy and gross.  Without milk though, it is the perfect amount of crunch with just enough chocolate to sooth chocolatey cravings.  Low calories and low fat make it a wonderful snack.

HE BEGGED for it daily asking each time I came home from the store if they had it in stock. It was awesome timing that Amazon had it FIRST before my local stores. When we received the box my son even ate it for dinner as he loves the crunchiness of the cereal but the best part everyone agrees is the chocolate flavor inside!  It makes the cereal unique and truly makes you want MORE.  We also love the chocolate version of this cereal. I have found it locally and have been buying a box a week and will be watching for sales on Amazon as I love buying in bulk.

review/summary: Different, but kids like it and it grows on you
review/text: Krave cereal is an interesting concept.  Kellogg's seems to be targeting both kids and parents with the promise of whole grains as well as a chocolate center, plus somewhat unique branding for a broader appeal.  This is in contrast to Special K Chocolatey Delight which is aimed at grown-ups or Froot Loops which is marketed to kids.<br /><br />From an appearance and texture standpoint, the cereal consists of little pillow-shaped bites with a small amount of "chocolate spread" inside each one.  Without milk, they are fairly crunchy, but after adding milk, the oat content (and lack of a waxy milk-resistant coating) makes it easy for them to start to get soggy in much the same way that Quaker Oat Squares do, with the outside layer becoming soft first.  When eating it, the texture is just slightly course, perhaps on purpose to highlight the whole grain content, but not unpleasantly so.<br /><br />Flavor is rather oat-like with some sweetness and a touch of chocolate flavor.  I would describe it as similar to Oat Squares, but smaller and with a little less crunch, plus the added chocolate.  It's different, but can kind of grow on you, and kids seem to like it.  The box was gone quite quickly.<br /><br />I like the cereal, but would prefer to see a little bit higher fiber content per serving and perhaps a touch less sugar.  3g fiber is the same as Multi-grain Cheerios, but Oat Squares has 5g per serving.  It's actually very close in both fiber and sugar content to Froot Loops, surprisingly.<br /><br />Overall, I would describe Krave as a cross between Oat Squares and Cap'n Crunch (and somewhere between the two in size), plus a touch of chocolate.  If the way that Oat Squares get soggy from the outside in bothers you, you probably wouldn't like Krave, but otherwise I think most people who like oat-based cereals and chocolate would enjoy it.  Kids like it too, so it might be a reasonable option if your kids are sick of Chocolate Cheerios or Life Cereal, and with about the same or a little more fiber (though also a little more sugar).

review/summary: Delightfully Delicious for the Inner-Gamer in You
review/text: I'm not exactly your typical cereal connoisseur as I rarely have mine with milk but, rather, I take the nerd/gamer approach of keeping the box nearby and promptly remove necessary amounts from the box with my bare hands when the need arises.  Munchy food in other words.<br /><br />For us gamers, we have battled the problem of easy access munchies by trying various cereals and trail mixes to little to no avail.  The problem stems from small sized cereal pieces slipping between the cracks of our fingers, falling on the floor and necessitating the unthinkable; cleaning our living space.  Other nibble-sized cereals leave unpleasant residue on our hands such as Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  So far, Cookie Crisp and Captain Crunch seems to be the only cereals that fit all our criteria but, munching on those for years at a time while playing the Mass Effect Trilogy, the monotony gets to you and makes you wish for more variety.<br /><br />After having tried the Krave I gotta say, I think we found our next munchy food.  It blends the perfect mixture of soft crunchiness and gooey chocolate insides.  It's the perfect nerd blend!  Now all Kellogg needs to do is create a Hot Pocket version!<br /><br />I was honestly expecting Krave to have that processed metallic taste like most other novel cereals that last two months to have, but no, it actually tastes pretty good as my initial box only lasted one night.  My little brother, another hard-core gamer (World of Warcraft in particularly... no one's perfect j/k), came over the same night and I instructed him to try it.  At first, he was really skeptical about trying anything new but, after some convincing, he gave it a shot and this is his response verbatim.<br /><br />"Dude... I don't really like hippie cer-... *takes bite*... I could fall in love with this!"<br /><br />He and I finished the box that very night.<br /><br />So, the tastefully awesomeness in Krave is undisputed, but what about the nutritional facts?<br /><br />Truth be told, if I was THAT concerned about my health I wouldn't sit around playing Mass Effect 3 and Skyrim for hours on end... although I play Dance Central a few times a week.  ;)<br /><br />All in all, Krave is more than just a novelty cereal that will fade into memory but a hopeful contender to stick around for years to come.

review/summary: Enjoyed by my Family
review/text: I had no idea what to expect with this cereal, but it was surprisingly enjoyable. Naturally, enjoyment completely depends on one's own personal preferences. So, I'll try to describe it to the best of my ability to help you, the reader, determine whether or not you would like it.<br /><br />The crispy cereal shell definitely tastes like a multi-grain crunchy cereal. The most predominant flavor seems to be similar to a graham cracker, but it is obvious that there are other flavors there as well. My biggest concern was how well it would hold up in milk - I don't like cereals that turn mushy in milk. We never ate a whole bowl of just this (we mixed it with Cheerios, typically), but for the most part it seemed to stay relatively firm and did not break down in the milk. I wouldn't say it stayed crunchy, but definitely didn't turn to mush. It did, however, flavor the milk.<br /><br />Then there's the chocolate. There was a nice chunk of firm chocolate in the center of each piece of cereal. It seemed to be decent quality chocolate, too. It was a very pleasant contrast to the crunchy shell.<br /><br />We enjoyed this cereal both as a snack and as a flavor variation with our Cheerios. The whole family has enjoyed it. I'm not sure it's something we would buy on a regular basis because it's obviously not going to be the most nutritiously balanced cereal. But, with the whole grain - and not sickly sweet - crunchy shell and the real chocolate, I would put it above some other sweet cereals. Calorie-wise, it's not bad, but I'm not sure it would be very filling on its own.

review/summary: The nutrients of multi-grain, the sweetness of chocolate!
review/text: The Kellogg's Krave Chocolate Cereal is a great day starter for those of you who are regulars when it comes to cereal. It tastes great and my kids and niece liked it very much. It is packed with different vitamins and minerals and only packs a 120 cals per serving. Although nutritious it may seem, this would not be a regular cereal choice for me because of the dizzying sugar content. It may not matter to the kids but I have to start them off early eating the right kinds of food and acquiring the proper types of nutrition. They are however very fun to eat and the kid's reaction could attest to that fact. But I would strongly suggest to make this an "occasional" cereal treat, never make it a regular. This should have been better if the sugar contents were less of what it should have but let's be clear about one thing....chocolate and any kind for that matter wouldn't be chocolate if it did not have sugar, and lots of it. 4 stars is the best I can give.

They went crazy when they tasted the chocolate and I had to confiscate the stuff before they ate the entire box.  When I asked if they wanted milk in their bowls of cereal they scoffed at the idea of diluting the chocolaty goodness.  They pretty much consider this stuff a treat like getting a cookie or piece of candy.  This is somewhat appropriate since a serving (3/4 cup which is a lot less than what my 3 year old can eat) contains 24g carbs of which 11g are from sugar.  Looking in my pantry I found an 8oz bag of Chips Ahoy Mini Chocolate Chip cookies that contains 21g carbs with 9g of sugar.  To be fair, the Krave nutrition label is in line with many of the cereals marketed to young kids these days.  Similar to Cocoa Puffs, Capt. Crunch, etc.  However, in looking at Kellogs' marketing of this stuff I don't think they are going after young children.  I believe they are targeting tweens, teens, and young adults.  I'm not sure that makes anything better or worse.  Just an observation...  Anyway, the cereal does taste sweet and chocolaty and crunchy like they advertise.  Far too sweet for me to imagine sitting down and eating in a bowl with milk.  I admit I have reached in and taken a small handful to munch on when craving something sweet.  However, I would not be a buyer of Krave cereal for my young kids as I think that similar to most of the cereals marketed to kids they are just too high in sugars and empty calories.  The vitamin fortification all the companies do is really just a way of distracting consumers and really offer little in terms of healthy nutrition.  I will step off of the Michael Pollan soap box and say that the stuff does taste good as advertised and if you get it, eat it as sort of a treat and not a main course.  Remember, back fat is never coming in to style...

review/summary: Just eat it dry
review/text: When I first got this cereal, I popped a few in my mouth just to try it out real quick (middle of the afternoon snack, if you will). "Hmm", I thought, "Not bad!" A little crunchy, and a nice little satisfying bite of chocolate. My kids enjoyed them as well. The next morning, I tried it as cereal with milk over it. My impression went downhill from there. It got soggy fairly quickly, and though the chocolate stayed together, the texture and consistency of the coating was unpleasant to say the least. So, 3 stars - in my opinion, it's much better as a snack, but there are better (and cheaper) alternatives for a healthy and chocolatey snack item.

review/summary: Kids Love Krave
review/text: What more do you need to know?  In the short time this product has been on the market I must have purchased Chocolate Krave at least 5 times in addition to receiving it on the Vine.  My children like to eat it plain (without milk) as a quick snack as well as in a bowl with milk.  I've tasted it without milk to give a grownup perspective of the cereal and the outer shell reminds me of Golden Grahams with soft gooey chocolate on the inside.  It's actually pretty good.  If you buy them from the store, the boxes currently have a $1 off 2 boxes coupon on the back that's good for the next year.  That's good considering the cost ranges up to $4.19 at one local grocery store and $3.99 at another, both of which I find to be pretty steep for cereal.

review/summary: Tasty Dessert Bowl
review/text: I love it when people go to Starbucks to order a coffee and walk out with a triple mocha-frappa-hot fat silliness with whipped cream on top. It's not a coffee people, it's a milkshake with a little coffee flavor. The same questionable behavior applies to the "cereal" Krave by Kellogg's. You set out to have a hearty bowl of cereal in the morning and what happens? You end up with creamy, chocolaty, crunchy goodness. It sure is tasty, but to call it cereal is a stretch. Krave is more of a defrosted Hagen Daas flavor than a cereal, but if you don't kid yourself, it's very tasty. Mix it with not-so-sugary cereals for a decent combo or actually put it on ice cream for the real experience. No trans-fats make it somewhat less guilt-ridden.

review/summary: Cap'n Crunch, but sweeter - poor consistency
review/text: The exterior of each cereal bit tastes like Cap'n Crunch but doesn't stand up well to milk, giving it the consistency of wet paper. It sticks to teeth and to the roof of your mouth if it starts out moist. The interior chocolate tastes, as others have noted, like chocolate syrup, so you end up with a mass of cereal coated with Bosco. Eaten dry, as a snack rather than as a cereal, it's a little more tolerable but only if mixed with other less sweet cereal. Perhaps as a 1:3 ratio with Corn Chex? Not a great everyday breakfast cereal, unfortunately.

review/summary: OK
review/text: Kellogg's Krave Chocolate Cereal, 11.4-Ounce<br /><br />This new cereal from Kellogg was okay in taste; however, I could not in all honesty say that it would be the most nutritious cereal for a meal. I would say that it's more a snack food or a semi-nutritious snack to munch on while watching TV. I would not want to make this my daily choice, as the sugar content was quite high. I would think that most children would make this their priority for breakfast because of the chocolate and the sweetness. This is where a parent or guardian would have to step in and say later or put some type of a boundary on how much they would actually get.<br /><br />I would recommend it for a snack but not on a daily basis. The taste was not too bad I've had better chocolate flavor but then I am spoiled when it comes to chocolate. I hope this review is helpful; because this really does have some high-quality nutrition with all the chocolate.

review/text: YUM!  All you ladies out there who are chocolate addicts, thank Kellogg's for coming through for us!  Wow, is this stuff awesome!  Imagine little puffs full of rich chocolate, oozing out and gushing all over your mouth, while floating in milk.  Now you don't have to dunk your cookies to get the same effect!  Wow!  It is quite rich to eat for breakfast, no doubt there, but if  you're used to having chocolate chip pancakes, well, by all means, indulge!  This does have some good things in it besides chocolate - whole grains too.  You don't get much in this box but hey, that's what coupons are for!  Great, great, great stuff, HIGHLY recommend!

review/summary: A Delicious Means of Eating More Fiber and Controlling One's IBS!
review/text: I'm an incurable chocoholic who craves chocolate on a daily basis.  I've also suffered with a highly annoying form of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) since I was a teenager. Powdered laxatives are disgusting and I refuse to take drugs because you can become dependent on them.  Therefore, I chose to control my IBS by consuming more fiber.<br /><br />  Dannon Activia Yogurt is great for treating IBS.  However, even eating two cups a day, despite all of its delicious flavors, can be monotonous.  I also eat a tiny container of chocolate cereal.  My favorite varieties were once Cocoa Puffs [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5E6E">Cocoa Puffs, 11.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>] and Cocoa Krispies [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E6EEE2">Cocoa Krispies Cereal, 16.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>].  Now, my new favorites are Kellogg's Krave Chocolate and Krave Double Chocolate [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006BXV1H6">Kellogg's Krave Double Chocolate Cereal, 11-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].  Both are delicious, crunchy chocolate cereals that are high in fiber.  Each serving has three grams of fiber.<br /><br />  I take both the Krave Chocolate and Krave Double Chocolate to work with me.  (See the photographs that I have posted on the Amazon website.)  The latter one is more for chocoholics because it has a rich chocolate flavor; the chocolate wheat body has a chocolate pudding-like center.  The former one has a plain wheat body with a chocolate pudding-like center.<br /><br />  Sometimes I mix the two Krave cereals together in one bowl.  They taste great whether I use skim milk, soy milk or almond milk.  Also, I've eaten then dry as a munchy, crunchy snack.  One of my coworkers gave me a box of Cheerios Banana Nut Cereal [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002866EWM">Cheerios Banana Nut Cereal, 10.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>] because she didn't like the taste.  I mixed them with my Krave Double Chocolate and thought they were excellent together; the combination reminded me of a banana split.<br /><br />  On the supermarket shelves, there are nearly a dozen brands of chocolate cereal.  Obviously, America has an insatiable kraving for chocolate.  However, I predict that Kellogg's Krave Chocolate and Krave Double Chocolate will rise above the rest.  All of America will soon be kraving them!<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/summary: Great for snacking too
review/text: I liked this right out of the box.  For breakfast, it's fine with milk, but for me Krave cereal really shines for snacking.  It's a light and crispy whole wheat shell, filled with a sweet chocolate flavored paste.  Pop one in your mouth and it tastes a bit like a chocolate graham, not too sweet and you get your fiber too.  I actually prefer it without milk, right out of the box.  It might go good as a crunchy topping for vanilla ice cream too--I will have to try that next!  Yum!

review/summary: Sweet and Crunchy
review/text: Open box and you get a fairly strong chocolate odor. The pieces inside are "pillows" approximately 1 in. long X 1/2 in. wide.<br /><br />Bite off the end of a piece and you see a hollow multi-grain pillow with a very thin (approx. 1/8 in. wide) ribbon of chocolate inside. While nothing like the half-filled cavity shown on the box, still enough to give it a nice chocolate flavor.<br /><br />They are very munchable dry, with a chocolately "Golden Grahams" sort to flavor. The hold up fairly well in milk, too.<br /><br />Once you get past the fact the first ingredient is "chocolate flavored filling," followed by sugar, the remaining ingredients aren't too bad. While it's not health food, there is whole grain flour and no hfcs. You could do a lot worse.<br /><br />Mrs. Boilermate liked them as well, but just not for breakfast. "I don't understand the need for chocolate for breakfast." This just means more for me.

review/text: Named correctly KRAVE is one of the best cereals i've tasted in a long time. I first tried it as a dry snack and found it very satisfying then tried it with a bowl of milk and found it extremely tasty. It had a nice time span in milk before the soggys set in. I noticed my daughter really likes the cereal she had a box from the store she was enjoying  when I was taste testing my box to write the review.<br /><br />Would write more but on my way out the door to the store to get more :)

review/summary: So yummy we hid it from the little kids!
review/text: Yes, we really did hide it.  My two teenage daughters and I hid it away, on a high shelf, where only we could find it.  And we ate the whole box ourselves.  I know some of the reviews have been really negative, but all three of us enjoyed this cereal.  To be honest, I hardly got any of it myself, because my daughters gobbled it up.  We enjoyed it dry, without milk, but we also enjoyed it in the traditional way, with milk. Some of the reviewers said it turned to mush in milk ... but we didn't have that experience.  Maybe they started with too large a bowl, or ate too slowly, but it did not turn to mush for us.  It did soften a bit, but my daughter decided she actually liked it better that way.  We'll be watching for coupons so we can buy more Krave ... to hide from the younger children again.

review/summary: Its a hit in our home!
review/text: I generally have picky eaters in this house.  They all typically eat the same things daily for breakfast.<br />I prefer to have a nice variety of healthy choices on hand simply because I tire of the same old bowl of oatmeal every morning.<br />So you can imagine my surprise when my pre-teens were fighting over this cereal!  Rest assured I am quite accustomed to their usual arguing, however I was not prepared to find them arguing over who ate the last of this healthy 'Mom' cereal.<br />It just came in the mail yesterday afternoon.  I opened it upon arrival & tried a handful, commented that it was tasty and I planned to have a bowl for breakfast.  This morning before school, my beloved boys finished off this box of cereal.<br />So, I am off to the grocery store to buy another box....I might have to hide this one!<br /><br />Good stuff, I can confidently feed this to my growing boys!  Kellogg's Krave is a keeper for our family.

review/summary: Multi-grain cereal outside, smooth chocolate inside.
review/text: The outsides of Krave cereal, reminds me of the texture of Captain Crunch. The texture is very airy and then you get a touch of chocolate. There isn't very much chocolate in each piece of cereal. It is mostly a hollow inside with a bit of chocolate hanging inside. Not sure if I like or dislike this cereal.<br /><br />I like to eat cereal, well I like to call it, naked, the cereal not me. I don't usually like to add milk to the cereal so I just eat it by itself, naked. It is a good cereal to just eat by the handfuls because of the size and shape. I am sure it would be good with milk as well, but I haven't tried it that way.<br /><br />The description the box gives it is: Crispy multi-grain cereal outside, smooth chocolate inside. I guess that is pretty accurate. Serving size is 3/4 cup, and it has about 10 servings. 120 calories, 3.5g total fat, 100mg sodium, 11g sugar.<br /><br />I think kids would probably enjoy this cereal a bit more than adults, it seems a bit too sweet for me to really eat too much of it in one sitting. I don't really Krave it...

review/summary: Chocolate filled Captain Crunch
review/text: This cereal is very much like what the title describes.<br /><br />It is comprised of two parts the cereal shell and the chocolate coating.  The cereal shell is very much like Captain Crunch cereal but less sweet, less crystaline (Captain crunch can be very hard on your mouth) and with a somewhat bran-like taste (most likely due to the different grains used).  This does include oat and wheat grains while the Captain is mostly corn.<br /><br />Then there is the chocolate filling, which does have a nice chocolate flavor and is little enough that you don't feel like you eating a candy bar for breakfast.<br /><br />Still, the cereal itself is very sweet.  The first two ingredients are chocolate filling followed by sugar and the first ingredient in the chocolate filling is sugar.  Back to cereals with sugar and the main ingredient?<br /><br />Anyway, I found the cereal portion to have a weird flavour that was not entirely masked and didn't work well with the chocolate filling.  My wife was more amenable to the taste than I was though.<br /><br />In summary, I suppose this boils down to whether a "healthier" version of Captian Crunch filled with chocolate sounds like something you'd enjoy.  It wasn't for me.

review/summary: Pretty good stuff
review/text: I'll start off by saying this cereal is pretty doggone tasty.  It's a crunchy (but fairly absorbent, so it gets soft in milk pretty quickly) shell filled with a soft, very chocolatey goo.  And looking at the nutritional information it doesn't look too terribly bad, for breakfast cereal; it's got some fiber and some whole grain in it, at least.<br /><br />Having said that, it's a bit like eating candy, and a little sweeter than I like to eat for breakfast.  To me, it's a better snack type cereal.  But it's good, and if your morning tooth is a little sweeter than mine, you should be good to go.

review/summary: Warning:Mushy when wet!
review/text: The cereal has a graham cracker tasting outside and a creamy chocolate filling on the inside. Like S'mores without the marshmallows.  Okay, I hate smores so this cereal was just "okay".  I preferred the double chocolate Krave better.<br /><br />That being said, much like the Double Chocolate, this tastes better dry.  Milk ruins the inside and makes the outside so mushy.  It's pretty gross.  I do like my cereal dry, so, it could work for me.<br /><br />The cereal is fortified and the vitamins and minerals offset the high sugar content.  I would probably not buy this variety of Krave again.  Like I said, not a Smores fan and the cereal gets soggy too fast for my kids to eat with milk.

They are just the perfect size, about 1/2 the size of chex cereal. They taste a bit like cocoa puffs, and have the same amount of fiber as Cheerios, although it isn't soluable fiber.<br /><br />I make my trail mix with peanuts, craisins, m&ms, and something salty or crunchy. If you would like to use this to make trail mix, you can take out the candy and use these. You can add goldfish crackers for the salty part.<br /><br />These are tasty and crunchy in this setting.

review/summary: Crunchy & gooey all at the same time
review/text: Kellogg's Krave Chocolate Cereal, 11.4-Ounce (Pack of 4)<br /><br />I've been eating cereal for breakfast since childhood. I'm 56 now and still do. My earlier sweet tooth yielded to better breakfast grain choices over time. I like Special K, Shredded Wheat, Oatmeal and other more subdued choices. I was never koo koo for Cocoa Puffs nor Count Chocula.  Yet trying a box of Krave, sounded like fun. So given the opportunity, I did.<br /><br />Krave is a cereal that is oat based with a soft creamy chocolate center. Like little crunchy pillows. The outer shell reminds me of Cap'n Crunch, a bit. The inside is like no other cereal. It's almost like a bit of pudding. The combination is definitely unique and tasty. I'm not sure I would make it a normal part of my breakfast routine, 11 sugar grams is a bit high for me. Still if you want to treat yourself, or a little one, it's pretty tasty and chocolaty. I'm also put off a bit by finding palm oil in the ingredient list, twice.<br /><br />In milk the cereal holds onto its crunch all the way through. It would have to sit awhile too sog out. Overall it's a decent cereal that tastes good and keeps its crunch. It has a couple of points I don't like but not bad Kellogg!

review/summary: Sweet and Crunchy
review/text: I would definitely classify Krave Chocolate as kids' cereal. It's sweet and crunchy, and I'd be happy just grab a handful and eat them as a dry snack. That being said, the nutritional content is about what you would expect: 120 calories and 3.5g of fat per serving (which is 3/4 of a cup), though it also contains plenty of fiber (3g per serving) and various vitamins too.<br /><br />As I mentioned, it's a sweet and crunchy, though it gets soggy fairly quickly, and it tastes a lot like a small bit of chocolate filling wrapped in corn flakes. The exterior, however, is multi-grain. Each piece seem to contains only a relatively small bit of the chocolate filling, so the chocolate taste isn't overwhelming, it's more of a chocolate `kick.'<br /><br />Overall, I like this cereal and would have loved it as a kid. It's not something I would purchase regularly, but it would make a great snack every now and then.

Not bad as a dry snack, if a bit grainy.

review/summary: Cereal with chocolate in it???
review/text: Cereal with chocolate in it???  This was something the wife and I had to try.  "Kellogg's Krave Chocolate Cereal", is a whole grain, fortified cereal with a bit of chocolate on the inside.<br /><br />While you can get the full nutritional information on the product description, a few things jumped out at me.  First, a � cup serving (and who eats only a � cup serving?) contains 3 grams of fiber, or about an eight of your recommended daily intake.  I never seem to get enough fiber in my diet.  And the � cup serving only totaled 120 calories, which isn't bad for a pre-sweetened cereal.<br /><br />So, how does it taste?  Not bad, it reminded me of Captain Crunch, although bit less crispy, and with a strong hint of chocolate.  I was fairly impressed at how well the two flavors worked together, although, overall, the cereal was a little too sweet for my adult taste-buds.  I would consider buying it occasionally as a change of pace.  My wife, the true chocoholic of the family, said it "wasn't bad", but didn't like it enough for a second helping.<br /><br />Overall, I like it when companies experiment food products and introduce new varieties.  This product is a more of a hit than a miss, and I would consider occasionally buying it for my breakfast cereal or to just munch on.

review/summary: Kids' cereal in disguise
review/text: Here's the good news about Kellogg's new "Krave" chocolate cereal: it's fairly low in fat (only about 25% of the calories in one serving), very low in saturated fat, fairly low in carbohydrates, fairly high in fiber (3g per serving), and it contains whole grains. It's also chocolate flavored. Here's the bad news: that chocolate flavor means that sugar is listed twice in the ingredient list--it's the first ingredient listed as a sub-ingredient of the first overall ingredient (chocolate flavored filling) AND it's the second ingredient listed overall. Although the taste is fairly palatable, sometimes there's a hint of that sweetened-cereal-artificiality that plagues a lot of kids' cereals. So Krave is pretty much a kids' cereal that's been "healthed up" for adults. Reserve this for when you want to cheat a little on your wholesome and nutritious morning cereal--but I doubt this will become a favorite.

review/summary: Not So Guilty Pleasure
review/text: If you are craving a taste of chocolate without breaking the calorie bank, this cereal is for your. A bite of chocolate is contained in small cereal envelopoes.  Krave has 120 calaories per 3/4 cup serving with 24 grams of carbs, 3 grams of fiber and 3.5 grams of fat (one gram of which is saturated).  But the bottom line is whether or not it tastes good.  I must say I did enjoy it.  I first tried it as a snack.  The texture of the cereal envelope is grainy, a bit like the texture of cornmeal,  different but not unpleasant.  The taste of chocolate added some sweetness and overall was pleasant.  Note the choclate is not on par with say,  Scharffen-Berger or Valrhona..it is more like of the cheap stuff you buy at Halloween on sale in Walmart.  It is sweeter, probably more sugar than chocolate but again, tasty enough.  I did also try it as a traditional cereal with (soy) milk.  It held up well but  I preferred it plain.<br /><br />This cereal is ideal as the occaasional cheat sweet.  If children can get past the texture, they would probably enjoy it too.

review/summary: ehhhh.... I could take it or leave it.
review/text: This cereal is just so so for me. To me, it tastes likes chocolate stuffed Captn' Crunch. It tastes OK. But the expectation that this is to help fill a craving is a little high. For the same amount of calories, and similar nutritional value I could get a Skinny cow ice cream, and have a full chocolate taste.

review/summary: a tasty treat
review/text: Krave Chocolate cereal is very tasty. The cereal holds up well to milk (of course I do tend to eat quickly) and the chocolate filling was just the right amount of sweetness. I can understand maybe not wanting to serve this for breakfast because of the chocolate but it makes a great snack while watching TV in the evening; I figure it's healthier than cookies or ice cream. the cereal pieces are smaller than what is pictured on the box so you get multiple in every spoonful

review/summary: Crispy on the outside, chocolatey on the inside!
review/text: So this tastes pretty good, and it has a great mouth-feel. When you bite into it, you get a bit of a crispy crunch and then a tasty burst of chocolate! Those are very good things.<br /><br />On the other hand...this is clearly not health food. If I had kids, I wouldn't let them within a thousand feet of this stuff. When I was younger, my mom had a guideline for me and my sister where we couldn't buy any cereal where sugar was the first or second ingredient. In this case it's the second, the way my teeth tingled after made me feel like it was the first.<br /><br />That said, this was indeed very tasty. I think I'll have another bowl, then break out the toothbrush.

review/summary: Most delicious cereal I have ever tasted
review/text: Krave Chocolate is the most delectable cereal I have ever eaten. It consists of multi grain "pillows" filled with a cocoa-tasting chocolate filling. The chocolate filling bursts in your mouth as you bite into them. The texture of the multi grain cereal is not crunchy, it is soft and almost melts in your mouth. Not only is the texture pleasant but will be a big plus for anyone with dental or gom sensitivity. The box indicates the cereal is a good source of fiber and whole grain. It also contains 70 percent of the recommended daily value of vitamin A and 25 percent of most others. A lot of chocolate cereals are too sweet, but the multi grain in this one balances it out well, and it has just the right amount of sweetness. This is an excellent cereal  to treat yourself with. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: We don't crave the new Krave cereal
review/text: My 15 and 18 year old kids didn't like this; neither did my wife and I.  It's not that it's bad, it's just not good.  It leaves a bit of an after taste.  We tried it dry, like a snack, and in milk.  Neither option was great.  To us, it does not taste too sugary dry, and the so-called chocolate stuffing in each piece does not taste much like chocolate (sort of, maybe).  Maybe younger kids would like this, but my kids who like other chocolate-tasting or chocolate-looking breakfast cereals didn't like this stuff.<br /><br />So, we gave it to our married daughter and her husband (in their mid-to late 20's) and they offered this view:<br /><br />"Kellogg's Krave Chocolate cereal was tolerable as an out-of-the-box snack -- dry and not too chocolaty, so it didn't feel like overindulgence. All that changed, though, when milk was added. The milk "activated" the chocolate, turning it into a rich frosting. This paired with the "whole grain" shell made the cereal very filling, but not in a good way. Both my husband and I felt a bit queasy and sugar-high after eating it, as if we'd had cake for breakfast. I can't imagine eating the Double Chocolate variety. We wouldn't buy this product as we prefer cereals that are naturally whole grain and less sugary."

review/summary: amazingly delicious ... my initial review was rejected because of implied profanity (it is that good!)
review/text: My initial review of this product was rejected due to my use of profanity (implied, anyway).  Yes, I used profanity to describe eating this cereal because it is that GOOD!  So here is my more "tasteful" version of my review of a fantastic product!<br /><br />This cereal is incredibly delicious. Like eating a bowl of candy.<br /><br />Is it sweet? YES<br /><br />Is it packed full of chocolate? YES<br /><br />Is it nutritionally similar to other cereals? YES (yes a bit more fat grams, and a little more sugar than some, but not off the charts bad)<br /><br />This cereal is so good that I seriously will be bagging it and taking it to the theater the next time I need to "sneak" in some "candy". Sorry M&Ms, there is a new treat in town, and it is much much much better for you.<br /><br />In summary, if you are an adult who gravitates towards kiddie cereals (you know who you are), TRY THIS CEREAL!!!

review/summary: chocolate
review/text: I'm a chocolate fan, but sometimes even I find chocolate-flavored foods to be a little much; this is not too sweet and not artificial tasting.  When I had a fairly large bowl of cereal, I found that Krave did start to get soggy which causes the outer shell to fall apart.  But I otherwise enjoyed the cereal (which also tastes great straight from the box without milk added).  For nutrition I compared it to a box of Kashi Cinnamon Crumble and was quite surprised to see that Krave beats Kashi in that Krave has fewer calories (120 vs 190) and substantially more nutrients like Vitamin A.

review/text: This cereal has a crispy whole wheat outer shell filled with a sweet chocolate flavored filling. The outer shell tastes fine and surprisingly crispy for holding a semi-solid filling. However, the filling is too sweet and feels a bit sticky. When you bite the cereal, the filling comes out and sticks to your tongue and teeth making it a not so good experience esp when you eat your cereal with milk.

review/summary: Great snack and dessert replacement potential
review/text: I have to admit that I was leery of a chocolate breakfast cereal, having never enjoyed the flavor at that particular meal since my boyhood Cocoa Puffs many, many moons ago. But these were excellent. They multi-grain coating is tasty and a good counterpoint to the very flavorful and not overly processed chocolate bit within. These hold up well to milk and kids would enjoy them for breakfast...or adults who are of the mindset that a slice of apple pie, chocolate cake, or a fruit-filled Danish constitute a good  breakfast. For me, they are optimal for a lo-cal snack in the evening (at something like 120 calories for 3/4 of a cup). They're a good replacement for a high-fat, high-calorie dessert and they satisfy my many sweet teeth. I can see these lovable little nuggets as being a new kitchen staple.

The only drawback is that after using about 1/4 of the bottle, your mouth develops a tolerance and you have to move on to hotter sauces.  There is a workaround, though: buy a jar of cayenne powder, and simmer it into the Cholula on the stove for a couple hours.  Or you could get some red Yucateco and mix it in.

review/text: This is the only whole wheat flour I'll use. I use it to make the infamous "Simple Whole Wheat Bread" by Nita Crabb at allrecipes.com (and I have a review of that recipe too). It is light with an excellent texture. Also worth noting (and this is true with most (if not all) of the King Arthur flour products is that it has a 100% grade on the Whole Grains Council's list (wholegrainscouncil.org). That makes it quite trustworthy.<br /><br />I will say that I've never used it in a bread machine, so I wouldn't know about that. I don't appreciate all the make-it-fast gadgets that tend to be trendy. No offense, but money saved is money earned.<br /><br />That said, I would highly recommend this. It's simply the best!

review/text: It may sound like a mix of a bunch of 'southwestern' ingredients, and it essentially is, but they work well together.  The soup is quite filling, has a pleasant and interesting taste (made much better with the addition of actual crunchy tortilla chips, like doritos- the tortilla things they include are really just noodles), takes a minimal time to cook (less than a minute, I believe), and has two servings per container.  I never just have one serving, so it's also nice that the sodium is fairly moderate for a microwaveable soup, around 45% for both servings.  With the addition of other chips, I'd give it five stars.

So we end up with 12 bags of croutons that we have to try to finish in 3 months.  I realize that they will most likely not "expire" then, however the taste may have become stale.  The company should really watch to make sure that the freshness date isn't soon for so large of a package.

review/text: I jumped on these Marshmallow Pebbles because they are gluten free and looked like something similar to Lucky Charms. The marshmallows are identical but that is about where it stops. This cereal is extremely sweet -- the pebbles have a somewhat strange smell and the color is something left to be desired. The marshmallows mask the flavor of the pebbles which I also think is off. Marshmallow Pebbles are okay in small doses, even my small children only requested one bowl when normally they would want multiple bowls of their "treat cereal."

review/text: As you can tell just by the picture of the cereal, this stuff contains enough sugar to wipe out an entire village of diabetics. So unless you want to be another victim of Mary Poppins' misinforming ways, steer clear of this. That being said, I expected a lot more out of this cereal aside from the usual great cereal marshmallows. That's all this stuff has going for it! It's too bad, since Fruity Pebbles is easily one of my top 10 cereals, and I was hoping this would be at least somewhere in the same ballpark as those. Nope, not even close.<br /><br />The marshmallows are what you'd expect- the same kind like in Lucky Charms. But the pebbles portion of the cereal looks like hamster pellet food. Seriously, pouring it into my bowl, I frowned and wondered what I was getting myself into. But after I poured the milk, I was debating on if I should dump it down the drain. Not one to waste food, I took on the bowl, and was disgusted by the texture of the pebbles in my mouth. These things get soggy FAST. Unless the free prize inside each box was a twenty dollar bill, I'm not going back for more.<br /><br />If you need marshmallows in your cereal, stick with good ol' Lucky Charms or one of the knock-offs. Don't fall for poor Fred, who obviously doesn't look that thrilled on the box about what he's holding. You just know that off to the side, someone's got a gun pointed at his head.
