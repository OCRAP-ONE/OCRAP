review/summary: a great cup of Coffee
review/text: This is the third box of the Island Coconut coffee I have purchased.  it is a medium roast coffee with more than a hint of coconut that comes out in every sip.  It also has other nutty flavors.  Out of all the flavors I have tried (a bunch) this is my favorite flavor, but I love coconut.  I don't like very strong coffee and I don't like weak coffee so this is roast is perfect for me.

review/text: I'm a fan of coconut so I was happy to see this as a flavor.  The coffee and coconut flavor are both mild and I usually prefer a bolder coffee (jet fuel is one of my favorites) but I like the smell and hint of coconut.  It's a little trip to the tropics every morning.

review/text: To be honest I'm not a huge Green Mountain Roasters fan, and I'm from VT so I've tried just about every flavor they've come up with at one point or another, but I love their Island Coconut, and it drives me crazy that their best flavor is only available during the summer...or at least from them. Amazon, however, seems to have it all the time, I suspect someone over there loves this flavor as much as I do. If you like coconut and coffee you have to try this one, it's like being on a tropical island.

review/summary: GREAT coffee/Good iced
review/text: I love this coffee.  I love anything with coconut in it.  The only place I have found Coconut flavored coffee at was a coffee and tea shop on Christopher St in NYC and I hate using the filter for bulk coffee for the K cup brewer, so just used my regular coffee brewer when in the mood for cocounut coffee, so I was very excited when it came out in K-Cups.<br /><br />Coffee has a really good coconut flavoring and it is great iced.  I had some coconut flavor sugar free torani syrup I used to flavor regular coffee with, and that is really good mixed in with this coffee in place of sweetner and makes a delicious iced treat.

review/summary: Surprisingly weak!
review/text: I love coconut coffee and I was extremely excited to give this coffee a go on my new Keurig B60. All of the rave reviews made me even more eager to try this seemingly great flavor. Unfortunately this coffee fails to deliver. There is hardly any aroma when it brews and the coffee itself on the smallest cup setting looks and tastes like dirty water with a hint of coconut flavor. Since this coffee was the first coffee I ever brewed in my Keurig I thought the machine was faulty. But then I tried out other flavors and it turns out that the coffee itself is to blame. I usually have my coffee with a generous amount of flavored creamer so for ME to think certain coffees are weak means that it is EXTREMELY weak. I even tried the coffee without any creamer or sugar and it was STILL without much flavor. I will NOT be purchasing this coffee EVER again.

review/text: This is my absolute favorite K-Cup flavor. I don't like many of the coffees, as some of them are simply too strong or have a "burnt" flavor to me. This is a wonderful coffee that I add just a splash of "sweet cream" creamer to, and reminds me of dipping a coconut macaroon cookie into a cup of coffee.<br />For anyone complaining it isn't very strong, keep in mind it is not meant to be an intense or stronger brew. Expect a nice lightweight, easy to drink coffee. If you prefer the more intense brews, this one is probably not for you.

review/text: My sister bought a box of this flavor, and I was pretty skeptical.  Coconut and coffee didn't seem like a natural mix for me.  However, she gleefully described it as "liquid Samoas" and let me try a sip.  Amazing!  The aroma is tantalizing.  I love coconut flavor and it really comes through in this coffee.<br /><br />I immediately bought a box for brewing at the office, and she bought several more boxes as well.  It's quickly become the favorite flavor of everyone in my family.  It's sad that it's a limited edition, and we're hoping it becomes a normal flavor for year-round purchasing.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious. One of my all-time favorite Green Mountain flavors.
review/text: I have been a big flavored coffee fan ever since I first tasted hazelnut coffee about 20 years ago. My wife orders the K-cups for our Breville coffee maker and likes to rotate the flavors so that we don't get bored. Green Mountain certainly makes a wide variety of flavors- Perfect Peach, Wild Mountain Blueberry, Golden French Toast, etc. and I like them all, but when I tasted the Island Coconut for the first time I was blown away by how coconutty it tasted. This is not a strong coffee, it is more like a medium strength (probably on the weaker side of medium) but anyone who enjoys coconut should try this flavor. This is definitely one that I will be asking my wife not to rotate out in the near future. (My second favorite flavor right now is the Van Houtte Candy Cane which is peppermint flavored, but only available over Christmas, so we will be running out soon).

If you prefer a stronger brew, then consider the "Jamaican Me Crazy" coffee from Wolfgang Puck (coconut infused, but medium roast).  The Island Coconut coffee definitely has coconut flavor and people will definitely smell it in the room (it's not subtle).<br /><br />I love it!<br /><br />NOTICE:  This is a "seasonal" coffee, only available from April - October (or something like that).  I wasn't aware and ran out over the winter, and couldn't get more until April!  So, if you like it, stock up before the winter.

This is so good....not sweet, not creamy, just a good cup of coffee with a definite hint of coconut.

review/summary: Don't know what the raving is about
review/text: I was expecting more (much more actually) after reading the reviews.  And for the record, I really like coconut.  But maybe it's that I really like REAL coconut.  As for this coffee?  It's okay, that's about the best I can say for it.  Flavor is rather synthetic and seems to vary from pod to pod.  Smell is nice.  It isn't the worst flavored coffee I've ever had, but it ain't a "contenda" for a regular spot on my shelf.<br /><br />I love (and drink) many flavored coffees but I can't see going out of my way for this one again...maybe if I find it on clearance or something.<br /><br />Green Mountain's Pumpkin Spice.. now THERE is a flavored coffee (another limited edition) that is superb (and I stock up with half a dozen or so boxes when its available).  This one?  Meh at best.

review/summary: Light mistake
review/text: I love coconut.  I love coffee. SO, this coffee should have been a match made in heaven. It smelled absolutely sinful while it brewed.  But, it smelled way better than it tasted.  I guess i should have somehow noticed it was a light roast, instead of my customary medium roast.  The smell of coconut was stronger than the flavor. I will finish them, but i am not likely to order them again.  I think it could be improved with Almond Joy creamer though.

review/summary: Great taste but texture clogs my coffee machine
review/text: I like the taste of the coconut but I'm tired of cleaning out the funnel of my Keurig with a paper clip.  I wasted a lot of these pricey K-cups because the filter clogs up from the mushy coffee grinds. I would purchase more of this flavor but the costly waste along with the aggravation of a clogged up coffee maker is a big deterrent.  This was my first attempt at the green mountain flavored coffee and now I'm afraid to try the others.

review/summary: My Favorite Summer Flavor
review/text: Didn't know what I would think of this flavor when I first bought it.  My husband was especially skeptical.  It turns out that it's my favorite summertime flavor and he's good with it too.  It's just the right amount of flavor without going overboard.  Who knew coconut and coffee would go together so well?  But I guess if you think about it, lots of "nut" flavors blend well with coffee.  In any case, I love it.  Highly recommend.

review/text: This is one of my favorite k-cup flavors.  The coffee roast is mild and has just the right amount of coconut flavor. It is not over powering or cloying.  I like to brew this on the second to largest size setting (on my machine) and add one splenda and liquid carmel creamer.  It sounds like a weird combo but it's really good.  It's my Saturday morning go to coffee combo.

Not sure who the genius was who decided it would be great to ship an 8lb gate on top of the box of coffee, but I would love to meet him/her.  Needless to say, I ended up with 3/4 of the K-cups and the 1/4 of the cups which spilled over into the box, permeated coconut aroma all over my office.  The aroma lasted for days and smelled wonderful. Overall, I cannot knock the product, it tasted great!

review/summary: Surprisingly Delicious
review/text: Let me begin by saying that I REALLY like coffee.  And I strongly favor the darkest, boldest flavors.  I'm generally not a big fan of flavored coffees.  Most of them use the flavors to hide the fact that the coffee itself is not that great.  Imagine my shock when I found the opposite to be true of this coffee.  Even without the coconut flavor, this would be a rich, delicious coffee.  And the coconut flavor just serves to enhance what is already a tasty brew.  Quite simply, this is by far the most delicious flavored coffee I have ever tasted.  But do yourself a favor...try it yourself, and take a few moments just to inhale the aroma.  From the first tantalizing scent to the last sip, this coffee is a great  experience.  By the way...I just ordered some more of it!

I think it would have been even better with a more bold say medimum roast versus the light roast they use.<br /><br />If you like coconut it adds an unusual and different taste to coffee.  I would never have thought of coconut as a flavor for coffee but it is actually very good.

review/summary: My favorite flavored coffee EVER
review/text: Coconut sounded like a weird flavor for coffee, but then I remembered: years ago my favorite little coffee shop ago made a delicious Almond Joy-inspired drink that prominently featured coconut flavor, and I had completely embraced that recent Toasted Mochanut Frappuccino that tasted like a Samoa/Caramel Delight Girl Scout cookie ...so, apparently I already like coconut coffee! I grabbed a small box of this flavor once I'd worked that out, and I cannot believe how much I love it! Most flavored coffee is too in-yer-FACE! for me; I end up cutting it with unflavored because it's too cloying or strong, but this is just right. I have noticed that some Keurigs brew differently - the fancy one at my work makes this pretty weak, but using my super-simple one at home it comes out nice and tasty. For me, this one works just as well hot as it does iced. My only problem is that little "limited edition" label on this - I'm planning to stock up like it's Y2K. :D

review/text: I can't say enough good things about this K-cup. This was one of the flavors brought into work recently and well, I've been in a coconut mood lately.<br /><br />First off, you can taste the coconut flavoring in this without it being overwhelming. One of the biggest flaws with flavored coffee is that many times you'll get drinks that say they're flavored with some sort of taste, but it's so subtle that you'll wonder if it was added at all. No worries with this- you can taste the coconut and it tastes good. The coffee underneath is nice and smooth, very drinkable.<br /><br />This really was a great tasting drink. Even with Sweet and Low (which I absolutely hate), the drink tasted great. If you're a coconut fan, this is a must try. Now I just have to figure out where my coworkers bought it and buy more of it for my house.

review/summary: Something different
review/text: I LOVE the Keurig brewing system and I have tried many different kinds of k-cups. This is up there with the good ones, in my opinion. I drink coffee every morning, and was looking for something different and "summery" to replace my pumpkin spice and hazelnut flavors (I know hazelnut is a classic, but it just makes me think of fall/winter for some reason). Like others have stated, the brew is pretty weak (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). Don't buy this if you're looking for a full-bodied, bold coffee. The coconut flavor is really nice, and the smell when the coffee is brewing is to die for! I think it would be the perfect flavor for an iced coffee. Overall, I recommend this product to you if you have a variety of k-cups and want a fun new flavor to add in for something different.

review/summary: Too weak
review/text: I'm a coconut junkie, so was very excited to try this island coconut flavor.  It is extremely weak.  I use coconut creamer, and if I put in my usual amount of creamer the coffee turns white and has zero coffee flavor.  I'm not really a strong coffee drinker, but I like to be able to taste the coffee AND my creamer.  I'll keep looking for a stronger brew coconut coffee, and finish off this box mixing it half and half with regular coffee.

review/summary: Good coffee but Coconut flavor is very weak!
review/text: Like all Green Mountain coffee the flavor is smooth and good and definitely not a bad cup of brew, that said, I was REALLY looking forward to Island Coconut (since I always get coconut coffee at Dunkin when I'm out) and ended up being disappointed. Like I said the coffee is still good but you can barely taste the coconut.

review/summary: I love this flavor
review/text: My department at work has a Keurig machine and drinking Jamaica Me Crazy while at work had me craving some coconut goodness on my off time.  I chose the Green Mountain Island Coconut for the price value but also because I've never been disappointed with Green Mountain.  This blend was not an exception.  The coconut taste is wonderful without being too mild or too overpowering.  For me, this has been a great blend from Green Mountain. Much like their blueberry coffe, I will continue to buy the Island Coconut throughout the season.

review/summary: Fantastic Flavored Coffee!!
review/text: Normally don't drink flavored coffee but this one intrigued me. Very glad I tried it. It is amazing. Taste like I am sitting in the islands. Very pleasant coconut taste while not over bearing. Coffee is not strong but a mild flavor. This is a seasonal flavor so you better get it while you can! I am ordering more now. I already finished my 1st 24 count. Everytime I would get ready to fix a cup and think about my regular Donut Shop I would grab this!!

review/text: I can say hands down this is the best coffee for me.  It is slightly coconut flavored and a very mild roast.  When you brew a cup the entire house takes on the island coconut scent.  I wish that they produced this flavor year round and I also wish it came in decaf.

review/summary: My favorite flavored k-cup!
review/text: Green Mountain Coffee should really consider making the Island Coconut k-cup available year round! It is my very favorite flavored k-cup! The taste is fantastic black and I also love it iced for a nice summer treat. It's not necessarily super sweet, but just right and enough flavor to make it an amazing coffee. I also get a lot of comments about how good my coffee smells when I bring this flavor to work in my travel mug. Please keep making this flavor, even if it is just available for part of the year!

review/summary: so good iced
review/text: This was one of the first K-Cup blends I tried. It's a very light coffee, and I was very disappointed with it as a hot drink. After some looking around I found people put it in the fridge and then have it as iced coffee.<br /><br />This is genius. The coconut flavor really pops when the coffee is cold, and it doesn't taste watery. I would not attempt to make it like the specifically iced drink K-cups but if you have time to spare, putting a cup of it in the fridge really makes it better...maybe add some chocolate syrup to it while it's still hot too...

review/text: I wanted an organic alternative to Lipton onion soup mix which I use in several recipies.  This is heavy on garlic.  I only use 1/2 an envelope per recipe and it's a decent replacement, but not the same flavor.  Will buy again just to avoid MSG.

review/text: When I mix it, I use a little bit of mayo (preferably the olive oil-based) and a full container of fat-free sour cream.<br /><br />The mix is low in sodium, for people watching their salt intake. And people like it. It makes an easy, healthier onion dip for veggies and chips.<br /><br />And sometimes, it makes a good sandwich spread, too.

review/summary: the best of the best
review/text: This is the best french onion mix.  If you want a great chip dip, mix one pkt. with a 24oz container of daisy sour cream the night before you want to serve it.  The other great use is to sprinkle one pkt. over a roast and slow roast it all day at 250 with some fresh organic rosemary sprigs on top.<br /><br />The only bad product this company has is the revised mushroom sauce mix.  It used to be wild mushroom and because their quality control didn't like it anymore they changed it.  They need to bring it back.  I gave it a fair chance when I recieved it and I threw it all away because there's no flavor to it.  I wonder if this company forgot about that old cliche' if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Please bring the wild mushroom back.  That really was a much better product.  There's a local organic store and that product isn't moving on their shelf.

review/text: Absolutely love this stuff. Love the simple ingredients "Organic onion, organic maltodextrin, sea salt, organic garlic, organic black pepper" and agree with the reviewer trying to avoid MSG (and other extras) in my old standby.<br /><br />I mean, we've used Mrs. Grass, Lipton, and knock-offs for onion dip in my house for 20+ years now so I didn't have high hopes for this organic brand. But I can mix it to taste and get just the flavor I'm looking for.<br /><br />Perfect.<br /><br />Now, you DO give up the little onion bits of the old kinds... I did always like those and I did miss them at first...but I'm thrilled with this organic variety and will be purchasing it from now on.<br /><br />SOLD!
