review/summary: Really good, quick meal!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this pasta meal. My last experience with microwavable pasta was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035XVQF2">Kraft Easy Mac</a>, and this Barilla product is a huge step forward!<br /><br />The pasta is precooked, so it needs just 60 seconds to heat up. I was afraid of either too hard or soft pasta, but after 60 seconds in the microwave, it was a pleasant al dente. The sauce (which heats beside the pasta in a removable cup) tastes wonderful--neither too sweet nor too acidic. It is a chunky sauce, and the tomato chunks seemed a little slimy. That's probably not a problem for most people, but as a texture person, I didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a great product. It's certainly much better than a brown bag lunch!

review/summary: Nice Taste But Package Difficult to Open
review/text: I frequently buy Barilla pasta sauces, so I was prepared for the sauce to be pleasing and was not disappointed. The pasta was not overcooked if one followed the directions -- I even added another 20 seconds after opening the product and it still had a good texture, slightly chewy, which I like. Both the sauce and the pasta have all natural ingredients, and no preservatives. This would make a good lunch to have on hand in the workplace, as the soft-canning method of producing microwaveable products is becoming more popular. They cook faster than frozen entrees and have the advantage of being stored in one's desk. At only 320 calories, the Mezze Penne with Sauce lunch is satisfying without overloading the diner with calories. As with all pasta, it is high in carbs, which is not an issue for me but I do know people who try to keep their carbs lower. Because sugar is only 7 grams and carbs are 58 grams, there should be no blood sugar spike as occurs when the sugar and carb grams are closer in number. Each serving has 11 grams of protein and 6 of dietary fiber. The one draw back on the nutrition front is the amount of sodium in the serving: 700 mg is close to 1/4 to 1/3 of what most people should be striving to achieve on a daily basis, so you would have to watch your sodium intake for the rest of the day. I sprinkled a little over two teaspoons of grated Parmesan cheese on the pasta, which which brought the sodium content up to about 800 mg. The addition of the cheese was not really necessary, but I generally always add it to pasta dishes.<br /><br />My big problem with the product was the design of the package. It is awkward to open. It has a sauce dish and a pasta dish -- one is supposed to keep a thumb firmly on the sauce dish while at the same time pulling back the film with the other hand, otherwise you could burn your hand with hot sauce while attempting to remove the film. I finally gave up tugging on the film and used a knife to cut it open. The sauce dish then separated from the rest of the container and I poured it over the cooked pasta. Since I am retired, I don't usually buy frozen or soft-canned convenience food, but when I was working I found it to be easy to take to work. I might keep it on hand now for lunch if I don't have time to prepare something more substantial.

review/summary: I really liked this!
review/text: I don't know why I was surprised that this product tastes so good, but I was.  Perhaps it stems from the fact that I've been disappointed in microwave meals so often in the past.  I can now put all that behind me and make sure I have an assortment of these convenient meals in the house for quick, convenient, but most importantly, tasty meals.<br /><br />The packaging is designed so that the pasta sauce and penne noodles stay separate until you mix them together.  I liked it just fine the way the noodles turned out after the 60 seconds, but if you want yours a little softer there are directions for how to do that.  This traditional marinara sauce has lovely chunks of tomato in it.  There are other ingredients also, but nothing overpowers so it all blends well together.  At 24% of daily dietary fiber this is a good source of fiber, but you might need to watch out for the 29% of sodium.<br /><br />This was really a tasty meal which would be good for both lunch or dinner.  I added a salad with mine and it was certainly an ample amount.  I like that it is 100% natural and I like that there are no preservatives added.  And the carton is even made from recycled paper.  So I enjoyed the taste, had an ample serving size (9 oz at 320 calories), and even put the outside cover in my recycle bin so it can be useful again.  Not bad!

review/summary: Probably the Best Microwave Pasta Meal I've Had.
review/text: "Barilla Mezze Penne with Traditional Marinara Sauce" is a 9 oz (255 g) single serving microwave meal that heats up in just one minute. Mezze Penne is smaller than traditional penne, and these have a ridged surface to better hold the sauce. The marinara sauce has a few chunks of tomato in a tomato-herb sauce. The sauce is in a separate container inside the oval serving bowl. Preparation is fast and easy: Peel back the film on the bowl to the dotted line to give it some ventilation. Microwave for 60 seconds. Remove the film carefully to peel it from the pasta bowl as well, where it tends to stick. Pour the sauce over the pasta, stir, and enjoy!<br /><br />My experience with microwave pasta meals is pasta that is overdone on the edges and sauce that is cooked to the bowl in places. Separating the pasta from the sauce has solved some problems. This meal is both tastier, faster, and has better consistency than a frozen microwave dinner. I'm very particular about jarred pasta sauces. Rao's is the only brand I'll buy. Barilla does not make the best jarred sauce, but it is not bad. The sauce is flavorful. The chunks of tomato are few but have good consistency. The pasta was not quite soft enough for me, however. The instructions recommend adding 1 teaspoon of water and microwaving for an additional 30 seconds for softer pasta.<br /><br />This Barilla Penne with Marinara Sauce was better than I expected it to be. It's easily as good as frozen pasta meals that are heated on the stovetop, yet this takes less than 2 minutes from start to finish, and it's convenient for one person. The bowl does not get hot, and it's easy to hold onto from one side that has a wider lip, so it would make a nice quick meal at the office or over a cluttered desk. You don't really have to put the bowl down to eat from it. It contains no preservatives, artificial color, or artificial flavors.<br /><br />Ingredients: cooked mezze penne pasta (water, semolina, durum flour, olive oil, salt, natural flavors), marinara sauce (tomatoes, citric acid, tomato paste, water, carrot puree, olive oil, onion puree, tapioca starch, celery puree, sugar, salt, garlic puree, basil, oregano, natural flavors). Contains per serving: 320 calories, 700mg sodium, 58g carbohydrates, 5g total fat, 1g saturated fat, 11g protein, 180 mcg vitamin A.

review/summary: Tasty, healthy choice
review/text: This microwavable shelf-stable meal from Barilla is surprisingly tasty. It takes only 60 seconds to heat up (unless you add some water to the pasta after the initial 1-minute cooking period and reheat it for 30 more seconds in order to soften the noodles a bit--which I did, and which I recommend). The marinara sauce heats separately from the pasta in a small container attached to the main tray; you simply pour it over the noodles and enjoy. I was impressed by how evenly everything cooked and how well the pasta and the sauce mixed. The noodles were tender, and if you've tried Barilla's jarred sauces, you can expect an almost identical flavor in this meal. At only 320 calories, this is an economical, tasty, and sensible lunch choice.

review/summary: Easy, fast, and delicious
review/text: I'm always on the lookout for lunches I can take to work and store several in my desk without refrigeration, but that don't taste like pre-prepared food.  This Barilla pasta fits the bill perfectly.  The pasta is already cooked to perfection, and it is stored separately from the sauce, so you don't end up with a watery mess like some competitor products.  The sauce is flavorful enough to be interesting without being overwhelming.  It's a filling meal that is definitely staying on my shopping list.

These are very tasty though - don't get me wrong.  I like the food.  I just find the Hormel pasta packages preferable because they're more convenient.  Otherwise, these are quite good.

review/summary: Ok but there are better Barillas.
review/text: Barrilla's pasta is basically canned spaghetti but the sauce is separate - making for firmer, tastier pasta when you heat it. 70 seconds was enough to heat to my taste.<br /><br />I had tried a different Barrilla pasta before and it was a bit too firm.  With this one I tried the alternative cooking method and that worked better.<br /><br />Sauce was TOO SWEET.  No aftertaste so not a disaster.<br /><br />Low fat, (5g/ 1g sat) Sodium 700mg - ok if you're good for 2,000 mg a day. 6g(!) of fiber. That's pretty good.<br /><br />Summary.  It's decent but it wouldn't be my first choice among the Barrilla meals.

review/summary: Yikes!
review/text: Sorry, this was a disaster from the beginning...Here's what just happened...<br /><br />This meal is not frozen, so I followed the instructions as provided. Note that I do use this type of packaged meal quite often, although normally frozen.<br /><br />The package says to pull the top back exposing sauce tray...I did...<br /><br />I microwaved it for 60 seconds. It was not done...<br /><br />I found this out by having part of the sauce fall out all over the place! Fortunately for my hand, it felt cool, thus I knew it wasn't even hot enough to consider eating...<br /><br />At that point, I saw that the sauce was in a separate container and, though holding it by my thumb as explained I had to pull so hard (something I didn't realize I would be doing or I would have cut it open) to continue to get the top off, that the sauce flew out, together with the separate cup coming partially out!<br /><br />Packaging is definitely a problem! I've never had this type of issue with any other company's product and that includes Stouffers down to Banquet which is just about the least expensive of this type of food...<br /><br />I then tasted the pasta...Now I like al dente...but this just was not done.<br /><br />For this type of food, I taste it to see how it "tastes" as made by the company. I was disappointed.<br /><br />Soooooo, I added onion and garlic power, salt, pepper and a little buttered oil...<br /><br />THEN I cooked it an additional minute beyond the instructions. Note that my microwave heats high and I rarely use the time suggested...so I have confidence that the instructions for heating will not make the meal hot enough for any microwave...<br /><br />With all the additional herbs/spices, I was able to enjoy the pasta.<br /><br />For 320 calories, I've tasted better and more pasta coming from other companies. There is no sweetner which I usually add to my own spaghetti, but I didn't add that for this trial. Without anything, this would be a very bland meal indeed.<br /><br />The sauce and pasta itself was fine for basic ingredients...but given the packaging, poor instructions, and lack of any "true taste" in the sauce. I certainly wouldn't buy it nor recommend it. Given the name, I had expected a tasty Italian sauce. Better check out Stouffers--their sauce needs little added, if anything! Too bad, because a package that does not require refrigeration would be useful to working people.

This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

review/text: I have a hard time finding nettle leaf tea at regular grocery stores, so I purchased mine from Amazon.  I generally enjoy English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Japanese green, and Oolong teas; this is a great addition to my current mix.  The tea bags make it easy to enjoy at work.

review/summary: useless - I feel no effects whatsoever
review/text: I'm not a tea drinker, so I'll start with that right off the bat.  However, I was reading online about some non-medication ways of coping with a stuffy nose.  One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

review/text: I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.

review/text: My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.

review/text: I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.

review/summary: Mild sweet tea
review/text: I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

review/summary: Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!
review/text: I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas.

Also, it helped me in other way. After I started drinking the tea I stopped craving sugar. Needless to say, I lost like 15 pounds while drinking it. Is amazing and very medicinal. It also helps me with menstrual cramps. I love it! You can find it here online or in any natural health food store near you.

review/summary: IT WORKS  FOR ME
review/text: I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck

review/summary: No more breast milk!
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply.

The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again.

review/text: We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.

review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.
