review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: If you love thick, chewy, rich chocolate brownies, these are the ones for you.  The chocolate is rich, but not overwhelming and they are somewhat cake-like and thick, and are nicely chewy without being gooey.  Interspersed throughout the mix is a nice balance of semi-sweet, bittersweet and milk chocolate bits and the whole thing is so yummy, you aren't even aware of what flavor of chips you're eating, in case one of those is not your favorite chocolate.  It's that good. The box makes 6 batches, and that's 6 individual packs of mix, so it'll keep you supplied with brownies for a while.  If you're going to go with a mix, this is the one to get.

review/summary: Best brownies in a pack ever!
review/text: I'm not a big fan of baking ready made brownies, because they never seem to live up to the home made ones..but Ghiradelli is one exception...The chocolate chips are what set this brand apart. Will definitely re-order...and soon! I've run through almost all of the six batches I received...

review/summary: The Best Brownies I've Ever Eaten
review/text: Like many others, I found the big six pack of these wonderful brownies at Costco. I make two packs at a time and add two cups of diced walnuts. I feel as though I'm in heaven when I warm one of these brownies and add a big scoop of the finest vanilla ice cream! I'm totally addicted to these brownies! Unfortunately, I can no longer find them at Costco. I hope they didn't stop carrying them!

review/summary: Why waste the time on scratch made? Use these!
review/text: I've thought about trying to make brownies from scratch some time, but why bother when these boxed ones are sooooooo good and sooooooo easy? I, too, get the big box from Costco, which is nice because once you make one package, you are going to want a second package sooner rather than later.<br /><br />They are moist and chewy and OH SO chocolaty. We have made these for a lot of people, and we always get raves about them. Just to spice things up a but, we will sometimes add nuts, M&Ms, coconut, or peanut butter for some variation...and those are just as tasty!

review/summary: most awesomest brownies!!
review/text: I can make a pretty good brownie from scratch, but after trying this brownie mix I've decided WHY BOTHER!  This mix is so easy to prepare, add milk, an egg and some oil and stir!!<br /><br />They have a texture that I can't duplicate, the brownies from this mix turns out chewy and crispy on the edges, with deep chocolate flavor.  Absolutely awesome.<br /><br />I've made some adjustments to customize it to my liking.  I use melted butter instead of oil and I use a spring release ice cream scoop and scoop the batter into lined (I've baked straight into oiled tins too) muffin tins so that I can get those even crispy chewy edges in every serving. They bake faster this way too, about half the time. Make sure not to over bake them. Then remove and  I just turn it over onto a cooling rack and wait 10 minutes for warm brownies.  Yummy!!

review/summary: Excellent for boxed mix
review/text: I buy this at Costco.  It's the only brownie mix I will buy - or I make them from scratch.<br /><br />It's fast, tastes great, and the Ghiradelli chocolate chips (3 kinds) makes it just a bit more outrageous.  I like to add toasted nuts (walnuts or pecans) to the batter before baking.<br /><br />I have even made one serving (still experimenting on actual measurements) in a bowl and microwaved it for a quick snack with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top drizzled with caramel sauce.  Eye-balling the mix and ingredients, using a tablespoon egg in cartons, a spoon of oil...etc... you get the idea, to make your own single serving of chocolate delight.

review/summary: Great Deal- if you're not a C*stco member
review/text: First of all, this is the standard by which all box brownie mixes, (and most 'from scratch') recipes should be judged.  I've been buying them from my favorite BIG BOX store for years.  I enjoy making them even more decadent, sometimes adding cinamon for a Mexican flavor or adding a ganache for the "OMG" affect at parties.  (Sometimes both!!!!)<br />The price is significantly better at C0stc0, but if you're not a member, then rock the Amazon deal.<br /><br />If you like these, I'd also recommend the Ghirardelli chocolate chip cookie mix.  It's not readily available in stores, and sometimes only found in PTA gift catalogs at xmas time at about $4.00/box.  On Amazon, they're available at about $3/box or less with free super saver shipping (case of 12).  I share the case with friends, neighbors and other foodies at work.

All came packaged as stated, perfect sized bars. Not huge, not mini, but perfect 2-bites sizes. Just like Goldie Locks and the 3 Bears. I ordered this for when company stops over - Everyone loves to choose from my candy dish. Only problem was, I ate more than I shared. Uh oh. Not melted, but I didn't order during a warm time of year. Maybe during the summer, a cold pack is included....We'll see because I intend to order again.<br />Great buy. Great Price. And love the door to door service. I also got a $50 credit when ordering, can't beat that!

review/summary: For Coconut Fans
review/text: So for many of you, if you're here reading this, chances are high that you've had these candies before and know what to expect. If not, then I would tell you that if you've got any aversion to coconut at all, to steer clear of this particular treat. That said, if you do like coconut, then these candies are definitely for you. The coconut is flaked throughout the center surrounded by a nice dense layer of chocolate, which is all offset nicely by the texture of the almonds inside. It would probably be more accurate to call this candy [Coconut Joy] - but then I suppose [Almond Joy] has a better auditory ring to it.<br /><br />As for the product itself, the pack of 6 that I received through the mail were actually quite fresh. There was none of that chalky-white film that you often find with a lot of the older candies that have been sitting in storage boxes, no, these were pretty much perfect. I enjoy the bite-size as well, since as one reviewer put it, the candy is already portioned out for you, so you don't run the risk of accidentally nibbling that extra bite at the edge on the full size bars.<br /><br />Overall, shipping was hassle-free and product was in excellent condition. The candies last a long time, but my suggestion would be that if you do not intend to share these with anyone, you may want to order/purchase a smaller portion, otherwise you may find your candy getting stale. My family and I have already finished our first six bags (lasted about 2 months) - and will be ordering again.

I usually know what he is buying because he brings home the empty boxes (like Twinkie boxes) for recycling. I then of course have to look at the empty boxes wishing he would have saved me one treat. Well finally he did remember to bring me two Almond Joys. I must say they are one of my favorite chocolate candies. The crunch of the almond goes so well with the smooth chewy coconut all encased in a bliss of melting chocolate. One bite and you are hooked.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: I did a price comparison and picked one of the less expensive popcorns Amazon had available, so I'm really pleased to report that it is very satisfactory popcorn.  I pop mine in the microwave using one of those microwave poppers.  This corn pops up more quickly, makes larger kernels, and there's fewer unpopped kernels, so I had to experiment with how much unpopped corn to use and how long to go a bit at first (it didn't help that I got a new microwave around the same time).  But now that I've worked through those details, this corn pops up nicely, has a good flavor, and was a reasonable price.  What more could you ask?

review/summary: Miracle-grow for cats!
review/text: We originally got this for our Bengals, it was what the breeder recommended.  Then, we found two kittens only a day old on the street and adopted them.<br /><br />After they were weaned they took to this stuff like gangbusters.  Now, they are both 20 plus pound monster kitties.  Never sick a day in their lives, glossy coats, full of energy.<br /><br />Picky cats love Felidae, it is full of healthy ingredients.  Obviously, however, it's not the best food for cat weight control! Now the boys are on a "light" cat food, and they aren't quite as happy.<br /><br />So, I suggest this for Bengals or cats who need to put on a few pounds.

review/summary: Omaha Steaks 8 (12 oz.) Private Reserve Ribeyes
review/text: Well, Grandpa made out like a king this Christmas.  Grandma bought him some Omaha Steaks (12 oz. ribeyes) and I must tell you that they are delicious!  Gramps shared his steaks with Grams and we had a delightful dinner.  There are six more for him to enjoy and there's not a piece of fat anywhere on them.  They cook even better on the George Foreman grill that went with them as a second gift (also purchased through Amazon.com -- thank you).  It's so easy to clean and he was like a little kid waiting for Santa to finally bring the gifts this year.  Of course, I made out like a bandit this year also, so now we're both flat broke.<br /><br />Who cares?  We have our health, our children and grandchildren, and we have each other for the past 44 years.  Who could ask for anything more?  Thanks to Amazon.com for making our Christmases so special!!

review/summary: Great purchase!!
review/text: Blazing fast shipping, product as ordered, great price-this is the best of ordering online. I received this package at least a week and a half before I received a bag of different food that I ordered online from somewhere else.<br />The food itself is great stuff. I mix it with Evo's chicken and turkey dry food to cut the carbs. My boy cat loves it and maintains his weight on the mixture. He is healthy and his fur is softer than silk. I use one cup of Evo and 1/2 a cup of this food when mixing together in a Tupperware cereal container. It goes in the bowl from that.<br />I also give my little guy a feline multivitamin from PetSmart. GNC makes it. It has fish oil in it among other things and helps to keep him in the best shape.

review/summary: Great Snack Food
review/text: I have had these crackers several times throughout the years.  I bought them from amazon.com because they offered them in bulk.  I didn't realize that the bags were full size bags.  It's not a terrible thing, it just means that I have more to eat.  I like the way the taste is subtle and not cheapened with strong artificial tastes.  I can see where some people may be coming from with saying they're bland, but I think that they definitely have a taste and it's a good taste at that.  It does take eating a few crackers before you really get the full effects of the taste.  I would probably say that people should order these if they really like them or often host parties or whatnot where people will consume them.  Otherwise, it's a lot for a single person.  That's not really a bad thing, but it is something to be aware of.

Fortunately the UPS man did not get much enjoyment out of these crackers. No real shrimp flavor, more like a fishy after taste. I couldn't give these things away to family, or co-workers (which says a lot, because nurses will eat anything). This was money wasted. The whole box went to the trash.

review/summary: Not nutritionally sound
review/text: I had been using this food mixed with the canned science diet for my lab puppy (because that is what the shelter had used), and didn't have any issues.  However, after reading the other review, I asked the manager at a local pet food store what he thought of this brand, and he said it was NOT good - all fillers (corn) and animal by-products.  He suggested I gradually shift the dog to Blue, which has a similar protein/carbohydrate mix, and then when the puppy is a bit older (around a year), move to a food with a higher protein content.  (To ease the puppy into a new diet, he suggested I start by mixing 1/4 cup new food with 3/4 old food for a few days, then half and half, etc).  He also recommended that I mix in a couple of tablespoons of canned food with some water, just to make the dry food moist.  (He said the nutritional content of the canned food isn't as important, since the dry food will provide most of the substance, and that I can vary the canned food.)  Finally, he also said that bully sticks are far better for dogs than rawhide (which are basically like eating leather).

review/text: Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your dogs.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo.

review/text: I thought this soup tasted pretty good.  Of course as others have stated, nothing beats homemade but this was pretty tasty.  I'm not sure if I got an updated package but the soup I purchased from a local store was microwavable.  The directions stated you had to first open the container and remove the metal lid then cover with plastic wrap. I just put the plastic lid back on top loosely and had no problems. Overall I think this was a great lunchtime alternative.  Will be trying the other flavors soon.

review/summary: Same Soup, Expen$ive Packaging
review/text: This stuff is terrible! To begin with, the packaging is completely misleading. The hefty plastic cup appears very similar to other microwaveable convenience soups, pasta dishes, etc. on the market, but they are NOT microwaveable. To microwave, you must first dump the soup into a separate dish. The instructions further state to "discard the container" after opening, so I was not sure it would even be safe to store my leftover portion in it. Turns out I didn't need to worry about it, because the soup itself was certainly nothing special! Same old salty-yet-bland canned soup garbage that ALWAYS disappoints. I ate about 1/3 out of the bowl hunger, then dumped the rest once I felt like I could make it through to dinnertime.<br /><br />I had bought several of these in preparation for returning to work after maternity leave because they seemed like a nice, convenient cold-weather lunch option. BIG mistake and BIGGER waste of money!!! I predict these will meet a swift end and you won't see them around much longer.<br /><br />PS - The Campbell's Healthy Harvest Tomato Basil Soup (NOT The Kettle Cooked version, just regular canned) is very good, and my husband and I always keep it in the house. It's the only canned soup we like. I should have known better not to waste my money elsewhere.

review/text: I thought this soup was delicious as far as canned soups go!  Tastes way better than a lot I've tried.  It had more depth of flavor that just salt and I loved the beans and greens in it.  I didn't care about the packaging not being microwavable because I've gotten into the habit of never microwaving things in plastic anyway.

review/summary: Campbell's Slow Kettle Chicken Bean soup
review/text: I don't know where the other reviewers are coming from; they must never make homemade soup and think the prepared type should taste the same!  Especially comparing it with other prepared soups, Chunky ,etc.  I love this soup....of course, it doesn't taste like homemade-from-scratch soup but I think it's very tasty for a prepared soup. I like the chicken bean flavor the best followed by the portabella mushroom.  We have it for lunch and sometimes dinner with a salad.....bon appetite......

review/summary: Same old canned soup
review/text: This soup is just your regular old canned soup with lots of very salty broth and rubbery chicken pieces.  First bite was a big piece of some sort of chicken fat, processed chicken by-product and it didn't improve much from there.  Some of the chicken was actual chicken meat, but the way they are promoting this product as a premium soup, I would have expected all of the chicken to be identifiable as such. The vegetables and beans were fine, but they were pretty much lost in the broth.

review/text: This is really gross. Salty beyond belief. One container contains 1520mg of sodium! They try to minimize the numbers by saying this is two servings but even then it is at 760mg of sodium (32% of your daily recommended consumption of sodium). In addition it has a really bad metal after taste even though it is packaged in a plastic container. One spoon full and it went in the garbage. Should have read the label first :-(

I add to more spices and cheese to this to make it taste good. I'm thoroughly disappointed. Don't bother spending your hard earned money. If I could give this soup 0 stars I would.

review/summary: Absolutely Awesome
review/text: I'm sitting here shocked and amazed by the two reviews before me. Maybe they got a bad batch because my family, my friends, and myself love this soup. It's absolutely delicious. So let me speak for me.<br /><br />I bought the soup on impulse and left it sitting in my kitchen cabinet until I the only things I left to eat for lunch were apples, peanut butter, and popcorn. I opened the soup and was disappointed when I saw the broth, thinking all broth soups were "blah." I decided to give it a sip before throwing it out and I was pleasantly surprised. The broth was good. So I put it straight into the microwave. A few pops later, I thought something was off and took it straight out of the microwave. Oh, there's metal around the top of the bowl. Do Not Microwave. Gotcha. Apparently I'm easy going because I just reached above me, got a bowl, and poured the soup into it. No biggie.<br /><br />Heated the soup for 1 to 2 minutes, took it out, stirred it up, and dug in. It was awesome. I was like what the heck? I already knew the broth was good but it's way better hot. =)  I think the amount of salt in it is perfect.  If you have to watch your sodium and the soup has too much for you, I would suggest not buying it. Cause buying it and then complaining about the sodium in it is weird. Anyway, I'm healthy, I stay well-hydrated, sodium is not a problem for me.<br /><br />Back to the soup. The chicken pieces are solid pieces - not those little "is that chicken?" pieces some companies give you just so they can legally put "chicken" on the label. Plus they make a very frequent appearance. The beans are Northern beans and they're good. I'm not overly fund of beans, which is why the soup sat in the kitchen cabinet, but I like these. They're soft but not mushy - but I prefer mushy over hard so take that into account - and they've soaked up all the other flavors in the broth. If the broth is good, the beans are good.<br /><br />I was also loving the carrots and spinach. I didn't taste them specifically but they added to the overall flavor. And there was enough spinach to easily add it to the label listing. I pasted the nutrition label below to give you an idea of the ingredients. As you can see, most of the soup consists of simple, easily identifiable ingredients and there are no preservatives.<br /><br />I am picky about my nutrition labels though. While I don't watch sodium, I do watch calories, fat, carbs, fiber and protein. I love this one. One bowl has 2 cups of soup so it's pretty feeling. Here are the totals for the entire container:  280 calories, 5g fat, 0g trans fat, 34g carbs, 8g fiber, and 24g protein. Those numbers are awesome. Especially since I was too full after eating the soup and drinking water to even eat the apple I had left.<br /><br />Maybe if you're a gourmet or you want to taste every single vegetable in a dish, this soup might not do it for you. But if you like canned soups, you're going to LOVE this soup. And if you're in a rush and you just want a healthy dish that's not fast food, I would recommend it in a heart beat. Heck, after I had it the first time, i texted my sister and my friends and told them they had to buy some. Yeah, I'm overly dramatic but for someone who prefers not to cook, this soup is a tasty, healthy, God-send.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Chicken Stock, Chicken Meat, Great Northern Beans, Carrots, Diced Tomatoes In Tomato Juice, Celery, Spinach, Tomato Puree (Water, Tomato Paste), Contains Less Than 2% Of: Modified Food Starch, Salt, Asiago Cheese (Milk, Cultures, Salt, Enzymes), Onions**, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Parmesan Cheese (Part-Skim Milk, Cultures, Salt, Enzymes), Broth**, Chicken Fat, Flavoring, Whey (Milk), Ascorbic Acid For Flavor, Eggs.

review/summary: Not your grandmother's condensed soup!
review/text: The MTR line of soups in shelf-stable retort pouches is generally of good quality.  This Simply Tomato soup is mildly spicy with Indian flavors and is not at all bland but for more of a bite, try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UUXPPG">MTR Spicy Tomato Soup</a>.<br /><br />It's very easy to make-- just boil 500ml (0.5 liter or about 2 cups) of water in a pot, add the paste, and stir a little with a wooden spoon.  I make it as directed but substitute � cup of milk for some of the water.<br /><br />Ingredients:  tomato, milk, sugar, edible starch, salt, refined sunflower oil, onion, ginger, jeera (black cumin seed), garlic, and black pepper.<br /><br />This soup is vegetarian but not vegan as it contains milk.  Note that the label indicates five servings per packet but two or three is much more realistic as it makes less than three cups of soup so each serving would be a little over half a cup which is not realistic.<br /><br />Calories 70<br />Calories from fat 20<br />Total fat 2.5g<br />Saturated fat 1g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Cholesterol 10mg<br />Sodium 950mg<br />Total carbohydrate 10g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Sugars 7g<br />Protein less than 1g<br />Vitamin A 2%<br />Vitamin C 6%<br />Calcium 0%<br />Iron 0%<br /><br />The primary nutritional criticism is the high sodium content--each package contains about 4.8g of sodium.

review/text: My cat is about 8 years old, and up until the summer of last year, she ate Kit 'n Kaboodle exclusively. She has never had any serious health problems. I switched her to Science Diet after moving out of my parents' house because I figured it would be healthier, but honestly, I have noticed no difference in her overall appearance, behavior, and health, other than the fact that she has hairballs less frequently. That is an improvement, though, so the extra $12 per bag of food is worth something.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: The freshness seal doesn't "lock", it's flawed
review/text: I've been feeding my cats science diet for probably 3-4 years and the one thing they've had in common over time is that the reseal freshness "lock" seems to always be flawed in some way. I've used this sealing technology on lots of food and non-food containers for probably 20 years so I think the common denominator here is Science Diet. Someone at Science Diet probably needs to look at the QA results for their bags and figure out how to create a working "lock" that seals.<br /><br />I've resorted to just pouring the contents out into a large jug and feeding Sassy and Hoshi from there.

review/text: I ordered this in multiple colors. It's not that glittery, and it becomes gummy upon contact with moisture... I think this stuff only works if you sprinkle it on and then immediately serve the dish. I used it as a decoration on top of a cheesecake, and within 30 minutes it had "melted" into a gooey substance - and the cheesecake had just come out of the refrigerator. Cute idea, poor execution.<br /><br />Plus, for this silver color, the package came WITHOUT a safety seal of any kind - just unscrew the white top and the stuff comes pouring out. So I never even used the silver one - and it would have cost way more than the cost of the glitter to return it, so I just "ate" the cost.

The baby loved them and I loved the ingredients.  I thought I would try the other products so I ordered the carrots and sweet potatoes.  To my surprise and disappoinment, when they arrived, I saw that they contained ingredients that I was not pleased with.  I wrote Nurturme and asked why they put maltodextrin in their products unnecessarily and they responded, The organic maltodexrin in our products is derived form organic corn.  Maltodextrins are manufactured form starch and are extensively used as an emulsifier in foods.<br />They are included in our foods because they are binding agents that are used when our foods are dried.  Like starch, most maltodextrins are easily digested and used for energy in the body." So, while the carrots and sweet potatoes are probably fine, they did not contain ingredients that I wanted to feed my baby.  The biggest issue being that this information was not included in the product description on amazon.

review/text: What a zesty change from my coffee routine. As I get older, coffee no longer agrees with my stomach. I started drinking pu-ehr tea last year when I traveled to China and it has helped my digestive system a lot. I then searched for it on Amazon because I needed an American supplier and came across this version of the tea. I live in Korea and have tasted their ginger tea which has a bite to it. This tea has the bits of ginger to give the pu-ehr tea a fuller flavor without the bite. It is smooth and mellow, and I love it with honey or sugar in the raw. Highly recommended for serious tea drinkers and those who would like a change from their coffee habits.

review/text: Wow.  Just Wow.  This tea took me by surprise - when I first started to brew it, the ginger nose was a little sharp and pungent (did not like the initial smell), but the heat during steeping mellowed the ginger and the tea became a a dark velvety smooth warming exlir.  After a month of having this tea in my pantry, I was shocked to realize that I had powered through almost three tins while my other teas were virtually untouched.  Unlike other teas, leaving the tea in the pot "too long" doesn't make it too bitter, but actually improves the tea.  Drink w/o milk or sweetener.  My morning tea that I drink throughout the day!

review/text: I absolutely love Pu-erh loose tea by Rishi and thought it might be fun to give a try of the ginger blend during the harsh winter times where ginger can be a real treasure in providing support to blood circulation, especially to women.<br /><br />As much as I hoped I could love this blend, I did not. The ginger aroma is way too strong. It is so over-powering that the pu-erh flavor is pushed away. It is like mashed-potatoes with all the peper flavor but not potato-ish at all. Odd and unsmart way of blending the ginger and pu-erh. They could be a perfect match.<br /><br />But it could be just me as tastes of teas are so personally different. Think about all the health benefits you could get from a pot of tea and give it a wave if you love trying new things out. It could be next on your favorate list.

review/summary: Like a Black Ginger Tea
review/text: It does not have the darkness that I'm use to with Puerh tea. I kind of miss that.<br /><br />The ginger is very strong, but I really like ginger so I'm not dissapointed with that at all.<br /><br />Each serving is good for multiple steepings.

review/summary: Great quality and great taste!!!
review/text: Very tastily blend tea! All the flavours: Pu-erh, ginger and orange peel are very well blanced. I have a cough these days, drinking the tea makes me feel better. Highly recommend it in cold days, especially when you have a cold.

review/summary: Pu Erh Quality ok, and too much Ginger
review/text: Rishi really markets their tea for political reasons, i. e. it's Kosher, it's picked by ethnic minorities, it's organic and fair trade.  In the case of tea, I don't think it's extremely important that it's Kosher, and I believe the marketing attempts to fill in for the mediocre quailty of the tea.  The Pu Erh Ginger has way too much ginger to taste the Pu Erh, and I also feel that is a way to mask the quality or lack thereof.

review/summary: great tea
review/text: Rishi Pu-Erh Ginger is amazing.  I have had other pu-erh teas with ginger and they have been overly pungent and not at all enjoyable.  Rishi Pu-Erh is smooth and very refreshing. I look forward to taking my daily ginger now.

review/summary: WARNING: Major Side Effects- Death by Tea
review/text: I purchased this tea from Whole Foods yesterday and I had my first cup this morning. I followed the directions on the package and drank it after I had breakfast. After half way drinking the tea I felt somewhat nauseated, sick and like I was going to throw up. That wasn't the end to my symptoms. The next 8 hours were extremely horrible. I felt more nauseated, my heart raced, head ached,some slight pain and my concentration was sharp but it made things appear so fast that I got dizzy. I also felt great anxiety. I prayed that I would be okay. I feel better now, but I really did think I was going to die. This tea just isn't for my body type. I really recommend seeing a herbalist before trying out "natural" products like these even if you do year about it on Dr. Oz. BOTTOM LINE: be careful what you consume even if it is natural.<br /><br />BEWARE!

review/summary: A Holiday Discovery!
review/text: We were visiting family for Christmas on Cape Cod and bought three varieties of Trois Petits Cochons pate at a local deli to bring home for appetizers. They were very reasonably priced and came in a reusable plastic tureen. Our choices were, the Pate au Poivre Noir, Mousse de Foie de Canard au Porto, and the Salmon Mousse...WOW!!! What a treat to share with our family.<br /><br />Now I am desperate to find a source in California and it looks like I can get it from Amazon...a happy smile is on my face! Just as good as what you would expect to be served at a fine French restaurant.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Delicious P�t&eacute;
review/text: I ordered this p�t&eacute; because the type I wanted was out of stock, but I wasn't at all disappointed.  It's very good, very rich and arrived quickly.  I still want to try the other type but this was a welcome substitute.

review/summary: this is a spice mix, not actual harissa
review/text: beware  - this is a spice mixture only, not actual harissa<br /><br />Not what I intended to order, but the ad wasn't clear.<br /><br />Harissa as I ate it in North Africa was a pulpy mash of peppers and spices, some oil. Fantastic stuff.<br /><br />I recommend Mustapha's Moroccan Harissa - it was terrific.

review/summary: Wind & WIllow mixes
review/text: I have tried 5 of the Wind & Willow mixes and all are excellent. Guests who have enjoyed them rave about them...taste homemade and yummy. The unit price is much lower buying in quantity from Amazon, but you have to take 6 packs of the same 'flavor'. I bought two six-packs and my daughter bought two different ones and we mixed and matched to get variety.

review/summary: Too Salty
review/text: I love oil cured olives, and these would be fine, except that their is about 5 to 10 times too much salt in them. I cut them up and add them to salads, etc, but as whole olives, again the salt is way too high (think of really salty potatoe chips and then make them 10 times more salty).
