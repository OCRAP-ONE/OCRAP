review/summary: Almost perfect
review/text: Love Wellness canned food.  I've done a lot of pet food research, and I've come down to Wellness canned (grain free non-Core varieties only) being the best. It's grade A food, that is actually MADE IN THE USA!!!  You'd be surprised how hard this is to find (e.g. Weruva is made in Thailand).  I only wish they didn't use BPA in their cans.  My cats loved the turkey flavor for a very long time.  However, as with all foods, they got sick of it eventually.  So now I rotate between Turkey & Salmon, Chicken & Herring, and Chicken and Beef.

review/summary: Inconsistent quality
review/text: When I first started ordering this product on Amazon I received damaged cans - every single can on the wrapped pallet of twelve cans was dented so I know it didn't happen during shipping.  The food was also dry so I stopped ordering the product after receiving two shipments of poor quality product.  After getting reminder notices to reorder I decided to give it another try a few months later.  The quality was excellent and the food was really moist and fresh - perfect, my cats loved it!  After receiving about four good quality product shipments, the fifth one that I currently received is back to being dry and chunky instead of moist and creamy and my cats won't eat it.  How can the product be that inconsistent???  Very disappointed.

review/summary: High quality, grain free, popular with the whiskered-ones!
review/text: All of my cats LOVE the Wellness canned foods ... and I love the ingredients and quality.  The turkey flavor is in my cats' top 3 favorite canned foods.  When Amazon offered Super Saver Shipping on Wellness, it was practically the only thing I would buy because the price made it a no-brainer.  I've had to branch out some since it has become more difficult to find online (and I can't buy it locally in my remote location), but I still get it whenever I can.

review/summary: Wellness Turkey canned cat food
review/text: Wellness cat food has a great reputation. I have 5 cats and it's hard to please all of them, but I find all of them eat this food.  I know it's a tad more expensive, but I feel good knowing that they are getting a good food - good tasting and good for them, too.  AND I do feel it makes a difference with their coat and skin. The delivery was shockingly fast - and reason cost.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Not to my cat's taste- but adding warm water helped
review/text: I purchased this cat food after reading glowing recommendations from two or three different cat nutrition websites. One site did offer the caveat that while the quality of this brand was excellent it would not help the cat's diet if he refused to eat it and the reviewer's experience was that some cats would love it and others wouldn't touch it. My cat was somewhere in the middle - he didn't love it, but he would sometimes leave it half-eaten and the rest would dry up.<br /><br />My 8 year old cat is new to canned food - he has been fed a diet of 99.5 percent dry food since we adopted him as a half-grown kitten. (The other .5 percent he obtained himself from ferns and the occasional mouse. After reading an article about the nutritional needs of cats, I discovered that our rotund feline was getting too many carbohydrates and not enough protein, and I began adding canned cat food along side his daily bowl of dry food. I have tried a few different brands to find something that suits him.<br /><br />The Wellness canned cat food (I purchased the chicken and herring formula)has a pate-texture and I think this was my pet's primary objection to it. After trying several different canned foods, I find that he prefers more of a filet in gravy style preparation.<br /><br />When I first gave this to my cat I simply plopped the chunk of food into his bowl - leaving it largely in a solid can-shaped blob. Later, I began to add a half-can of warm water to the bowl and mix it up to make a thinner mush. Using this method, he seems to do fine with it, so I may or may not purchase it again.

review/text: After feeding my recently-acquired cat a case of Wellness Turkey and Salmon without issue, I fully expected her to love the Beef and Salmon as much.  Unfortunately, she loved only the first three cans and won't touch it now without adding some dry food to it.  Hopefully, she will still eat the Turkey and Salmon without any problems.

review/summary: Completely worth the price.
review/text: Is Wellness relatively expensive? Yes. Is it worth every penny? ABSOLUTELY, yes.<br /><br />As new cat owners, my husband and I wanted to make sure our two newly adopted cats would get the best care possible. After spending hours researching pet foods on the internet, I was completely shocked (and disgusted!) to find out how terrible the cheap grocery store brands of food really are. It didn't take long for us to settle on Wellness because of its premium ingredients and stellar reputation.<br /><br />Thankfully, our cats LOVE this food. They're happy, and we're happy because it's so good for them! We gladly spend the extra money to ensure the health and well being of our two furry children. They love the turkey, chicken, and turkey/salmon varieties, which are all grain free. Turkey is their favorite, which is why I'm posting the review here. :)<br /><br />If you want your cats to eat great food, try Wellness. We are SO glad we did!

review/summary: Pricey, but well worth it
review/text: There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there.  My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.  I'm hoping she'll remain diabetes-free for the rest of her life.<br /><br />The Wellness food, labeled "Core," is very low carb and both my cats love it!  It contains a lot of water ("no more than 78%" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood. Instead I'm spending the money on food.<br /><br />As a side note, our other cat without diabetes loves this food, too.  She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad. She's doing super now and I attribute it to the wet, cereal-free food.<br /><br />I highly recommend working with your vet to wean your cat off dry cereal foods, especially if they're diabetic.  The Wellness canned food is fantastic and might save your kitty's life!

review/text: I feed several Savannah Cats, all of which can be very picky eaters. Everyone wants something different and if I change anything about their diet they get upset stomachs.<br /><br />I bought Wellness food trying to get them all to eat the same thing. I was simply amazed. As I gave it to them one by one they loved it. Even my 2 biggest picky eaters ate it right up. I watched closely for any upset stomachs and nothing. They all accepted the food with no issues.<br /><br />I was a little worried at first as to how much they ate as it could be expensive, but within a few days they leveled themselves out. I am just thrilled with the food and their reactions. I will promote this food to all my new homes. The food smells good enough to eat. Hum, wonder how my husband would like to try a new dish tonight :)

review/summary: Great Option For Diabetic Cats!
review/text: My 14 year-old cat was diagnosed with Diabetes and Chronic Renal Failure earlier this year; it was devastating. I had to administer insulin shots to him twice a day and twice he had hypo-glycemia due to the enormous challenge of balancing insulin levels. Worse, he was miserable and wary of me.<br /><br />At 16 lbs, he was overweight even for a large frame cat so I promptly began an intensive internet research (agree with the earlier poster who cautions against the foods prescribed by vets and sold in grocery stores) and after narrowing the field of high-protein pet foods, decided to try wet food. I was nervous because I had been guilty of feeding my baby delicious, awful-for-him dry foods (I was clueless) so I had no idea how long the transition to Wellness wet would take.<br /><br />There was no transition: He loved the food immediately and the switch was painless. Best, he lost 4 lbs in about 6 months, his blood sugar has stabilized and he's off insulin, hopefully permanently.<br /><br />Wellness isn't cheap, but when compared with the cost of losing a beloved furry member of the family too soon, the price is well-justified!<br /><br />ps. Maximillian's favorites are the chicken and the turkey. Vary for best results!

review/summary: Wellness Grain-Free canned cat food
review/text: When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.  If I get another cat someday, I will feed her grain-free food from kittenhood.<br />BTW, they also make grain-free dry food, but I haven't tried it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Allie

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Awesome Cat Food
review/text: Being new to raising kittens, I have tried a variety of canned foods in recent months.  Although my kittens readily took to the Fancy Feast brand, it is not the most healthy of foods - my biggest concern being the by-product content.  I thought I would never get them off of that kitty krack!  However, MUCH to my surprise, they absolutely love this food and ate it readily the first time.  And the best part is that it is a very healthy food - no grains, no by-products.  There is a little gravy in the bottom of the can so I put a little bit of water in, give it a swirl, put it on top of the food - and whalah - instant broth and MORE water for my babies to lap up which is so vital for avoiding UTI's.<br /><br />I just can't say enough - good - about this product.  Thank you, Wellness.  My kittens are happy and that's all that matters!!!

review/text: A short background on the eating habits of my two cats, one is super finicky and the other cat will eat just about anything. When even my non-picky cat wouldn't touch any of it, I knew something was not right with this food. They refused to eat any of it. I like the premise behind the food, all natural and grain-free, but I am going to have to go back to the prior food my cats like. Hopefully my local animal shelter can make use of the food for their cats, if they even eat it.

review/summary: Great food, but...
review/text: ...lousy packaging/storage.  While the food itself is wonderful and the cat loves it, Amazon really made a mess of my order.  When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid.  We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it.  I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can.  It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands.  Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.<br /><br />So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon.  Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible.

review/summary: My cats now love it!
review/text: I have two cats, one under 1 year old and the other is 4 years old. After researching about proper cat diets, I realized that they needed a good grain-free meaty canned food. Wellness fit the bill. The younger cat ate up the chicken flavor instantly and loved it! The older cat however, refused to eat it at first. She was used to eating dry kibbles and occasionally canned fancy feast. She kept refusing to eat the Wellness and I caved in and let her finish the bag of kibbles. Only when we didn't have any other food than the canned wellness did she approach it. So once she was good and hungry, and the younger cat was in another room, she crept out and started eating it!! Now she loves it and eats the chicken flavor with no problem. I haven't tried out the other flavors, but since I had such a hard time getting her to come around to eating it in the first place, I've been feeding them both the chicken flavor exclusively. If your cat won't eat Wellness, be patient and get rid of their previous food so when they get hungry they only have one choice. Mixing the old food with the new one wasn't as successful as just waiting it out. Their coats are super shiny and they are both at a healthy weight on a wellness diet.

review/text: Did some googling on kitten nutrition and found that the food I was feeding my kitten did not have very high water content and that she was supposed to be eating a meat based food (grain is no good for cats).  This food seemed to match well with what google told me, and I've been feeding her this wet food for 2 months now.  She seems to like the food and she looks great.  She seemed pretty healthy before as well, but there was a noticeable difference after I switched her food.  Her coat is shinier and softer, she's more energetic, and has been maintaining a good weight.  I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I think its worth the price and I will keep buying it.

review/summary: Great, natural product
review/text: Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love. I chose this brand for its natural ingredients. Two of my cats have issues - one with diabetes and one with obesity. I needed a cat food that is grain free (for the fat kitty) and low carb (for the diabetic kitty). If you need a cat food that is not loaded with byproduct garbage, then Wellness is a great choice.

review/summary: Excellent Grain-Free Option
review/text: I ordered the Wellness Turkey to create a rotation for our kitten with Felidae grain-free formula. Until tonight he had only eaten Felidae, but when I opened a can of Wellness he went crazy for it! This will definitely be a part of our food rotation. Very high-quality food, mostly protein from excellent meat sources.

review/summary: Better than most canned food but still BAD
review/text: I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called "acceptable" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is "Turkey", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and "flavoring" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star.

review/summary: Positive for Wellness
review/text: My background is 50 years of dog/cat owner and college degree in chemistry so I'm not completely ignorant about pet nutrition. After a few days of Google research and reading pet food negatives and positives, I decided on a mix of Wellness both wet and the dry exclusively for my two rescue/shelter kitties based on reviews and availability. Price was not a deciding factor. After 1-1/2 years, they still gobble it down and I'm pleased to report both kitties mental and physical health to be outstanding with shiney, smooth coats, regular bowel movements, and healthy, energetic activity. I contribute this good fortune mostly to their diet of Wellness and a loving home environment although my billfold wouldn't mind if it were a bit cheaper. In my experience, Wellness has been outstanding.

review/text: We have been transitioning our 4 cats over from the crap Purina makes to Wellness, and for most of the flavors, they love it. They like it much better than Friskies. Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders.

review/text: My two cats will eat anything. So why do I even care what they eat? I care because it's about their health and it's a important responsibility I accepted when I adopted them. This Wellness Canned food is very fresh and (according to the experts) has all the healthy nutrition cats need. I've tried a few different brands and this one gives my cats the best soft, full coat and even makes their poop smell less (super bonus!). It's pricier, but give it a shot.

review/summary: Flavor let it down - not much there...
review/text: I've been looking long and hard for a no/low calorie drink that is safe for diabetics.  Thought I had found a winner here, but the taste did not come through.  This is better than some others since it is enriched with vitamins (which is why I gave it a 2), but the flavor has let the product down.  I mixed one packet into a standard 16.9 oz bottle of water.  First off, it took a bit of "shaking" to get it to mix.  The taste was like watered down Kool-Aid, with a strong "artificial" sweet aftertaste.  So far in my search, the best for flavor is Crystal Light.  Now if we could get the flavor of Crystal Light along with the enriched vitamins - we would have a winner.  My search continues.

review/summary: The best red beans
review/text: I spent about 5 years living in Alabama as a child, and these beans where a staple in my family's diet. My mom would cook sausage and onions and toss them in a stockpot with these beans and serve the meal over rice.<br /><br />I was so excited to find them on Amazon, and I ordered a case. My fiance and I mix them with cooked ground turkey and onions and serve over rice. It's such an easy and satisfying meal! I haven't been able to find another brand that compares, and I'm so glad that these can be ordered online.

review/summary: Red Beans n Rice better than my own and 10 times faster.
review/text: While living in Mississippi, my Illinois reared husband became enamored with his company cafeteria's red beans 'n rice.  For 3 decades, I've been working to create the best. The best?  Popeye's can't be beat!!  Finally, I've found it on my own range.  No, my NOLA daughter did.  Blue Runner does it.  Fix the rice.  Warm up some pork.  Open the can.  Dilute and warm the contents.  Combine.  Comfort food, oh, oh, oh, comfort food.  I use 1/2 cup white wine to dilute.  (Cider could be interesting.)  And I add two minced garlic cloves.  I hear you can find Blue Runner locally if you live farther south in the South than we do now; but for me, Amazon is truly the greatest.

review/text: If you want to make the best New Orleans beans and rice than look no further. These are the only authentic beans in a can I ever found. They usually sell them in the south but since I am military I just have them shipped to my front door where ever I get stationed. These beans are so good you can eat them right out of the can. Take them camping. It makes a quick meal. I like to add sauted onions to mine that I heat on the stove. Rice makes a good addition to this dish. Buy a case and thank me later :-) You won't regret it.

review/text: First came to visit Louisiana in 1994, and had these beans (on a Monday, of course).  Took three cases home and still get them.  Thank goodness we still have kept a Lousiana connection, and are able to get these (not available in Pennsylvania).  Now with Amazon, we are relieved.<br />We use any kind of sausage, slice it up and add these beans.  For REAL bean lovers, add another can of red kidney beans, drained.  Of course you need Frank's or any other kind of hot sauce to dump in.  Anytime it is a quick nutritious meal.  Try these, you won't regret it.

review/text: These red beans are excellent.  I grew up in Louisiana near New Orleans and occasionally cook my own red beans -- these are every bit as good and a whole lot quicker.  I usually fry up some sliced pork sausage (I like the Hillshire Farms Kielbasa or Hot Links) in a skillet, drain the excess grease and then add the sausage to a pot of the beans.  Serve over rice for a delicious, quick and easy meal.  Big thumbs up!

review/summary: Just like Mamas
review/text: I grew up in New Orleans, my mama cooked Red Beans and Rice at least once a week. (I used to hate it!) But oddly enough now I can't get enough of her Red Beans and Rice when we visit.  Once we were home visiting and she had Red Beans in the crock pot ready for us when we arrived. I couldn't believe how good they were, she said "I have a confession. I didn't make these. These are canned beans and all I did was add some sausage and Tony's". I have been hooked ever since. She just sent me a 12 pack for my birthday. The white beans are just as good. I add them to my taco soup, or serve over brown rice. Superb!<br />I try not to eat much meat so I don't even bother with the sausage.. I do add some liquid smoke though and sometimes if I have time I add the trilogy minced..(onions, bells and celery). But it taste totally fine without it.

review/summary: Delicious Organic Olive Oil from Spain  !
review/text: I decided to try this product after searching for some organic products online that could be stocked in my kitchen and easily incorporated into my everyday cooking ... I have been on an 'organic' kick lately, making a conscious effort to choose healthier organic products for me and my family which includes 2 young children.  I love making different sauces, salads and mixed vegetables and have now used this olive oil to do so.  Let me say, I LOVE IT !  You can definately taste the difference.  I had never tried olive oil from Spain, I found that this particular one has a nice finish to it.  I felt it really enhanced my dishes nicely.  I used this for "dipping" some nice warm Italian bread too ... I thought it was fantastic!  I wish it were more readily avilable in stores... I haven't been able to find it in any local market yet.  So, thank you to AMAZON for having this product just a click away from my door !  Would highly recommend this product and would purchase it again.  Just ordered some other products (sundried organic veggies) that were available on amazon from this same company ... will post a review for those soon!

review/summary: Amazing, Just Ask My Guests
review/text: After trying this, I thought it was amazing and tasted great accompanying a typical dinner. Since I don't consider myself an expert in the world of wine tasting, organic olive oils, etc, I figured that this was just my average Joe opinion and personal preference. However, my opinion was more than confirmed at a recent get together with friends. We have a "tradition" of get togethers / bbq with the same set of 8-10 friends periodically and the menu of what we serve stays consistent for the most part per our "tradition" (e.g. fish, meat, baked desserts). The only thing that changed recently was that we incorporated this olive oil into everything from the fish to baking(having used different kinds including other organic brands in the past). Let's just say that at first bite (from people that have tasted the menu many times before), we were asked what we changed. The general comment was that altough the guests could not pinpoint exactly what it was, the flavor was much richer than previous times. We of course responded that there is a secret ingredient, but knew that this olive oil did the trick. This will definitely be part of the ingredient list going forward.

I used it on Thanksgiving (2011) and my family and I enjoyed the succulent taste that it gave the turkey immensely.

review/text: I purchased this for one brother on the recommendation of my oldest brother and I could not locate the brand anywhere in my local area.  So, just hoping by chance Amazon would have this item, I scroll through and bingo.  The projected delivery date was not going to arrive in time for Thanksgiving so I was told.  But, it arrived within two business days.  My family was very delighted to say the least.

review/summary: My cats LOVE this very healthy food!
review/text: When Pet Promise, a safe and healthy pet food, went out of business, I was desperately looking for another healthy food that had no by-products, rendered fats, meat meals, or outsourced ingredients. (You might want to check out what these types of ingredients can include - if your stomach can take it - but avoid commercial manufacturers' "spins" on this). Good books to get in this regard are "Foods Pets Die For" and "Protect Your Pet":<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165562">Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0939165422">Protect Your Pet: More Shocking Facts</a><br /><br />My cats were completely unaffected by the melamine contamination tragedy of 2007 - which killed many pets, especially cats - because their Pet Promise food was one of the few brands in America that didn't use outsourced ingredients (and was never on the recall list - unlike some of the very expensive "premium brands"). I felt so lucky that I had already switched to Pet Promise, a petfood company that bought ingredients only from North American farmers using sustainable agriculture and free-range livestock.<br /><br />I finally discovered Halo's products, and was encouraged by the fact that Ellen DeGeneres, a devout animal lover herself, not only endorses it but also has become part-owner of the company. Their website also included a specific message written to us former Pet Promise users. So I went to my health-food store and bought some.<br /><br />I was delighted to see that it had no by-products, no rendered meats, no meat meals, and that the label stated that all its ingredients are "Made in the USA", except the pea protein from Canada. Furthermore, the salmon in Halo is wild Alaskan, not farmed salmon (aka, pharmed salmon, full of antibiotics, etc.). Moreover, it is low in carbohydrates and even includes probiotics in the mix! Making it even more promising than Pet Promise!<br /><br />But the ultimate test was whether my cats would eat it or not. Unlike my dachshunds, who would eat just about anything that hit the floor (they're really low to the ground, you know), cats are notorious for their persnickety eating habits. BUT THEY LOVE IT!!! Can't get enough! So I have to dole it out so they don't overeat! And after five months, their health and energy seem to be great.<br /><br />Oh, and hi, Ellen - and many thanks!

review/summary: Cats don't seem to go wild for it
review/text: After finding out what horrors I'd been perpetrating on my kitties with their expensive "premium" pet food, I set out to find something that wasn't full of by-products and unnecessary corn ingredients. Halo Spot's Spew definitely fit that bill and their ingredients are probably the best you will find in a cat food. My cats, however, weren't as impressed as I was and turned their noses up at their new food. They did eat it, but clearly weren't enthused.<br />Although I like the human grade ingredients used in Halo foods, I do wish they used more meat sources. There are only a couple protein sources in the food and as a result the protein content of Spot's Stew, around 30%, is also a little lower than what I'd like.<br />Overall, however, this is definitely a great food to feed your pets, though if you have a cat that's a finicky eater or that needs a high protein food, Halo Spot's Stew may not be for you.

review/summary: Fantastic for kitty's energy and coat, the key is introduction of new food.
review/text: I switched my cat to Halo's Salmon indoor formula and have noticed a marked difference in her coat and reduced smell from the litter box.<br /><br />Cats are snobs when it comes to food.  Switching them to a new food takes at least a week, more if you have a picky eater like me.  Start small and work more in each day. If you moved from a diet of Raman Noodles to a high protein, high fiber diet instantly you wouldn't want to eat it either.  :)  You get what you pay for when you buy food for yourself or your pet.

Vomiting began in about 2-3 weeks and is now instantaneous.  Eat some cat food--go right to throwing up. Both chicken and salmon.  So for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing.

review/text: I am not sure if my cat loves Halo, but whenever I try to change brands, my cat looks happier going back to Halo. Like other reviewers, the poop seems to be least smelly. Also, one noticeable difference when I feed Halo is that my cat seems to eat in a controlled manner- eats throughout the day. I guess that is a good thing? When I feed other brands, my cat eats it uncontrollably all at once.

Some cat food really smells like.. cat food.  This doesn't. The little girl kitty loves the smaller morsels, so she is eating more. I had been using Iams and although it's great also, she had a hard time chewing the bigger pieces.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this brand.  It may be a bit more expensive, but I notice I am not filling the litter bowl as much. My little girl kitty is putting on some much needed weight, but I am not buying cat food as often with this brand.

review/summary: At last - a delicious, reasonable cracker
review/text: The price of crackers seems to have skyrocketted in the past few years, and other than saltines (not so good for one), I'd almost stopped buying them. Then one day, on sale, I discovered Grainsfirst Crackers and thought I'd give them a try.  Oh joy, a delicious cracker, with as many good qualities as one could expect of a cracker and a fairly reasonable price point, especially when on sale.<br /><br />The one difficultly is that our one and only local supermarket doesn't carry them and it's a minimum of 18 miles to the nearest one that does! So finding Grainsfirst here on Amazon, eligible for subscription and priced even better than at the grocery store, made my day!<br /><br />In sum, if you are looking for a good cracker, either stand-alone or as a not-too-obtrusive vehicle for cheese or sundry other edibles (peanut butter is good on these), I highly recommend Grainsfirst.

I know that I can see whole seeds in the crackers and they taste good.  Plus, in a comparison to other crackers that my family likes- they have less sugar and sodium and more protein and fiber.  They are a superior cracker to a lot of others out there and are a huge hit with my 1 year old.  She is able to hold the cracker easily and take bites safely.  I don't know if they are as 'healthy' as they advertise, but it is better than feeding a 1 year old something in the shape of an animal or dyed a rainbow of unnatural colors.

review/summary: Tasty snack cracker
review/text: I keep a box of these in one of my desk drawers at work to snack on from time to time. Each cracker has only 20 calories, is relatively low in fat and sodium, and has just the right amount of salt and seeds to produce a really great taste. These crackers also work well with dips and vegetables.<br /><br />Even though the box says "baked with 10 whole grains and seeds," these crackers are definitely not some kind of health food and would never be sold in a health food store. But that doesn't matter to me. I eat them because they taste great and are very good as a snack.<br /><br />Bottom line: These crackers are a good snack food, but if you are looking to add whole grains to your diet, buy something else.

review/summary: Deceptive or insufficient information?
review/text: I don't specifically disagree with the first reviewer -- but he makes some claims that I, personally, cannot find information on the box to support.  Yes, they group the "whole grains and seeds" as first ingredient (actually, the first set of ingredients).  Within this "ingredient", they include whole wheat flour, black and white sesame seeds, millet, mustard seeds, poppy seeds, triticale meal, rye meal, malted wheat flakes, oats, brown rice meal, and barley flakes).  Then the next "ingredient" is enriched flour.<br /><br />The problem is that there is no way to determine whether the first "ingredient" is 80% of the total recipe or 40% -- and no way of knowing, within that amount, how much is in each sub-ingredient.  I suspect that they did this unusual grouping of ingredients to hide their recipe -- but, as noted by the other reviewer's reaction, it may very well be counter-productive. If they had split out the set of ingredients into their separate parts, one would have a much better idea as to how it is made.<br /><br />I have been counseled that I am pre-diabetic.  For me, therefore, it is very important to keep up the dietary fiber in the carbohydrates that I eat (slows digestion, keeps insulin levels steadier).  Looking through my local supermarket, the GrainsFirst crackers was the only cracker & cheese type of cracker that met the criteria of 2g dietary fiber or more per serving (they actually list exactly 2g).  It's tasty and it fits my dietary needs (sure, I'd rather have 3 or 4g -- work with what one can get).<br /><br />There are other crackers that meet the dietary criteria -- like Triscuits and a few others -- but they aren't really the same category of cracker in my opinion.<br /><br />Worth some extra money -- but you may be able to beat the price from Amazon if you can find them locally.

review/text: Grainsfirst's name and marketing is designed around a deception in their ingredients list.  They group together all of the whole grains AND SEEDS, in order to put this "item" first on the list, before white flour, which would otherwise be first.  This is not a whole-grain product.<br />It tastes good, unless you really want a whole-grain product, but it is overpriced.

review/summary: Really Great for Concentration - Love The 3 Pack Price
review/text: I'm a big coffee drinker but I don't like energy drinks because they make me sick to my stomach. My friend started using turbo snort and I was interested right away. The best thing is it gives me a mild boost that really helps focus and lasts a long time without making me edgy or sick. My boyfriend thought it was a little weak for him at first because he drinks red bull all day long, but the other night he snorted about 10 squirts and he was up pretty much all night. Now he uses it in between red bulls because he says it definitely helps him concentrate at work when he's tired. He does a lot of paperwork and his beloved red bull only makes him edgy so he cannot concentrate. Turbo Snort helps him do his paperwork so he uses it all day at work. It's a great product.

review/summary: Like an Old Fashion Cherry Lollipop!  Juicy and Very Cherry.
review/text: I am so in love with Albanese Gummi Candy.  The consistency is not too soft and not too hard.  It is definitely a little softer than Haribo, but is much, much juicier and has more flavor.  It is not as soft as a Fruit Slice by any means.  There is a good chew to this gummi and the flavor releases as you chew.  I do like Haribo, but, sometimes it feels like chewing and sweet rubber; you will not have that feeling with the Albanese brand.  The Wild Cherry flavor is very cherrylicious and just sweet enough.  My husband favors the Wild Cherry over most of the other flavors, but he does love a lot of the other flavors as well.  This Wild Cherry flavors compares best to a cherry lollipop like you ate as a kid.  It's got a pure cherry candy; not artificial.  The kind your doctor would give you for being good at your check up.<br /><br />So, if you are a gummi bear lover and a cherry candy lover, get this candy.  The price is phenomenal.  You get two bags of five pounds each for a total of ten pounds!  That's a lot of candy.  I always have candy out in pretty clear containers at my home so that my friends will feel comfortable taking what they want.  They all seem to gravitate to the Albanese Gummi Bears.  I seem to love most of the flavors.<br /><br />The gummi bears are really cute too!  They were shipped in perfect condition and there was no melting and I am in Florida.  They were a bit warm, but they quickly come to room temperature and are perfect.<br /><br />These would be cute for a red themed party, Fourth of July party, wedding treats and a candy bar too. This is a candy everyone can enjoy, young and old!

review/text: We drink almost no sugary drinks, but having grown up in the South my husband and I still drink a bit of "sweet tea," and Tetley is the best brand for making it. The trick for making: pour boiling water over two tea bags in a teapot, cover and let steep for 7 minutes, pour tea into pitcher, steep bags again with cool water and drain, add sugar (about 1/3 - 1/2 cup for one gallon), add water to just under one gallon. It gets sweeter and better if it cools overnight.  We use decaffeinated because we drink it late in the day, but any Tetley black tea will work. Just decrease water or add more sugar to your taste.

review/summary: Tetley Decaffeinated Black Tea, the best out there!
review/text: I used to drink any kind of black tea, but after I became intolerant of caffeine, I had pretty much given up ever drinking tea again. I don't like herbal tea particularly, but this Tetley is extremely good in my opinion. I like it much better than other decaffeinated black tea on the market, a lot more like "the real deal." The family sized bags don't seem to be available in grocery stores in my area, and it's much easier to make it by the gallon this way. 4 of these large bags, 2 quarts of boiling water, let stand for about 30 min., add about 4 cups of ice and fill it up with water. You can add about 1 cup of granulated sugar or honey to taste while it is still warm if you prefer. Refrigerate.

review/text: I bought saffron advertized on this page from "GourmetFoodStore" - its not good and we didn't like it.<br />When I bought it, they were selling it as "AlTaj" Crown brand saffron which is much better in quality IMO. What I got was "Harvest of saffron" - the one displayed on the page now.<br />I had to send many emails to get a reply, I filed a buyers claim but the seller kept delaying their response and finally amazon close the claim as time-out -- hello amazon , you should have checked with me first<br /><br />So my feedback in short<br /> - I didn't like this "Harvest of Saffron. IMO Al-Taj and Gathering of Saffron are much better brands<br /> - I didn't like the seller. So check other's reivew and feedback about seller before buying.

review/summary: Quality Anchovies
review/text: Quality anchovies, not mushy. It is nice to always know there are anchovies in the pantry for Salade Ni�oise, bagna c&agrave;uda, greek salad or pizza. And the price is so much better than buying one can at a time.

review/summary: Delicious - but assortment mix is not evenly distributed
review/text: I received a couple of bags of these for Christmas. I absolutely love getting these for Christmas and it's become a tradition in our household. The only disappointment this year though was that the mix was very uneven. There were only 2 peanut butter, 2 white chocolate, and 2 milk chocolate per bag. The rest were evenly distributed between dark and extra dark. In a bag of 22 chocolates, I would have expected around 4-5 of each flavor.<br /><br />These are very high in calories at 220 per 3 balls, with 160 calories from fat. Considering I only eat these at Christmas, I don't mind this little indulgence!

review/summary: Great Gift Idea
review/text: I love giving and receiving these for the holidays and Christmas.  It's fun to sample the flavors and one truffle, individually wrapped, is enough for a treat.  The dark chocolate truffles are actually good for you, say nutritionists.  The wrapping is quite festive and sparkly and indicates the flavor inside.  They look pretty in a glass bowl or pottery.  My sons love these and so do their friends, so it's a treat anyone can enjoy. The chocolate tastes rich and "gourmet", and I love the distinctive flavors.  These seems to have popular appeal so any hostess/host should be glad to receive them.  They can put them out for guests, or save them for their family to enjoy. It's a quality gift!  Or get them for yourself as a special treat.

review/text: OMG!  My husband has Celiac Disease and we have both tried MANY gluten-free cookies.  Some are disgusting, some ho-hum, some great, these are FABULOUS.  I still can't believe how great they are.  I first purchased them for him as a birthday gift, thank goodness they turned out to be tasty.  You will not be disappointed with this WHOLE line of cookies.  Thank you to this company you have an excellent product!

review/text: There are many cookies from the WOW line of baked goods, but this one is my favorite. I make really good snickerdoodles with wheat, but I am supposed to be wheat-free. When I found these I thought I was in heaven! The texture is perfect and that I-must-have-more taste of really great snickerdoodles is there. This cookie and their brownie are my favorites!

review/summary: The Best Gluten-Free Cookie!
review/text: I bought these for my daughter.  At the first bite she said "These are the best gluten free cookies EVER!"  Of course, I had to try one and they are Wonderful!  She has been gluten-free for almost a year and we have tried many gluten-free cookies.  Most are chalky and taste pretty bad.  This one was soft, flavorful and wonderful.  It rivaled any home-made non-gluten-free snickerdoodle I have ever had.  Thanks WOW!

review/text: Mom used to make meatloaf with this mix and I can only get in through Amazon now that I don't live in Massachusetts. Was visiting my brother and his family once and his wife said he didn't like meatloaf. I asked if she had tried Tempo and she said no. That night I made meatloaf with Tempo and when my brother came home he said something smelled good....surprise surprise...he got meatloaf he liked and remembered...happy ending to all. It is real good!!!

review/summary: Not a substitute for fresh or even frozen but very convenient
review/text: As a single guy with bad grocery shopping habits and whose only use for the stove is spaghetti, mac-n-cheese, and similar pasta dishes, keeping some of these dried veggies on hand is great for quickly and easily adding a little color, flavor, and nutrition to simple meals. Fully reconstituted, these would never be mistaken for fresh or even frozen flowerettes; looks more like what I would call the shards left over after cutting broccoli heads into flowerettes, but they taste great and look good mixed into sauces.

I ALSO THINK THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE AT LEAST 1/2 MORE FOR THE PRICE.  I DO LIKE IT IN CHEESE/RICE HOTDISH, AND CAN SEE IT WILL BE VERY HANDYM, AS WHO HAS BROCCOLI IN THEIR FRIDGE IN WINTER?  NOT ME!  GET THIS ONE AND USE IT!<br /><br />LINDA

review/summary: Dingo Denta-Treats are great!
review/text: I bought a bag of these on a whim at TJMaxx and both of my dogs love them.  I have a poodle mix who had horrible breath, after giving her one of these a day for about a week I noticed a marked improvement in her breath.  She has refused to eat all of the dental/breath freshening doggie treats I've tried (she buried the greenies in the fireplace ashes) but she goes nuts for these.

review/text: We tried these as a cheaper alternative to Greenies.  Our dog loves 'em and they do seem to help keep her breath under control.  They don't last quite as long as a Greenie does, but otherwise we're very happy with them.

review/summary: Great alternative to Greenies
review/text: These seem to be a good alternative to Greenies that my dog loves. As far as cleaning the teeth I haven't noticed a difference but it definitely helps with my doggie's breath. This one doesn't contain wheat for those dogs allergic to that like mine. Greenies have wheat in them
