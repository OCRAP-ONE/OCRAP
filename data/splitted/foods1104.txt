review/summary: My cat loves Amazon!
review/text: My 10 year old cat, Ernie, is a spoiled, fussy eater.  He only likes the pate, only likes Friskies, and only likes the seafood varieties.  I'm 63 years old and it's difficult for me to shop often and even harder to carry enough cat food home to last a month.  In addition, the multi-packs in the grocery stores contain a mix of meat and fish flavors, so unless I want to waste 1/4th of the carton, I'm on my hands and knees trying to find just the seafood varieties. Believe me, my 63 year old knees don't appreciate that!  I now have this product on auto-delivery and it's terrific!  It's delivered right to my door, only has Ernie's favorites, I never run out of cat food, and it's about 10 cents a can cheaper! Ernie, my wallet and my knees love Amazon!

review/text: I have several cats.  They all love this stuff.  I particularly like the pate' formula as it does not "gum up" any of my long-haired cats' faces.<br />I would recommend this as a good quality product.  None of my cats have ever had any digestive problems related to this food - one of them has a very touchy stomach,too.<br />I use the subscribe and save program which has been a life-saver.  Not only is it cheaper than buying at local pet stores (except for very few and far between discounts).  It has saved me alot of hassle.  I buy a month's worth at a time and having the boxes delivered to my front door is fantastic.

review/summary: Terrible cat food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Fish, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. At least the first ingredient is 'fish' and not a by-product or cheap filler, but I find it odd that its not "salmon" or "tuna" just "fish". If they were using quality fish, they wouldn't have to hide behind an ambiguous label. Also, the rest of the ingredients are disgusting! There are many by-products in this food. By-products are not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, bones, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that put off an appetizing aroma, and taste good to cats. Also, I usually feed my cats dry food for dental and digestion reasons, so I think they were excited just to have a wet food "treat." I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a marketing company with no regard for the feline diet; thus producing very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats are carnivores and need to eat meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods, such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat- with no added fillers or low quality arbitrary "meats".

review/summary: MY CATS WILL NOT EAT THIS AT ALL, AT ALL
review/text: I have 4 felines of my own and feed the one who sleeps in my backyard who has been stopping by to eat supper on an  almost daily basis for 3 years.<br />I am never surprised at the things my finiky, spoiled kittys will turn their collective noses up about. I have learned through testing and error what they will generally eat, but they never cease to amaze me: will not touch crab, shrimp, calf liver or lamb. Usually they are pretty good about all things seafood though. I am aware that the older female is not fond of food in the form of Pate. However, I have two kittens who will generally eat whatever is put before them (the no crab, shrimp, liver or lamb rules were in place when they arrived.) The older male is better about taking on new things than the older female. He WILL eat pate.<br />This particular item Friskies Cat Foof Classic Pate, 4 flavor Seafood Variety Pack was purchased primarily for the outside kitty who is not technically mine. I buy Friskies food for him all the time. It is so convenient to have these Packs set up on Subscribe and Save. They are delivered to my front door and I do not have to lug them home from the local grocers. That gives almost everything that arrives from Amazon on a routine basis a 3 star rating from me to start with. Usually Subscribe and Save Items work UP to a 4 star or 5 star rating from there. I have no shame, but say with gratitude that those items have a favorable positive predjudice from me going for them from the beginning! This Pack was no exception. I thought my older female might refuse it, but expected to hysteria from the others, outside Kitty inclded.<br />All four inside cats are now getting a half of a 3 oz can at their back feeding station at supper time. I used to give them all a whole can, but jealousy of the kittens is still present, so each gets a half and then I go to fix dinner for my outside, feral guy who is known simply as "Yellow Kitty."<br />Now, I am not dense, I realize that the four of mine were accostomed to an entire 3 oz can each for supper at one point. Then the green eyed monster of Jealousy appeared on the scene and brought along with her Screeches and Skirmishes over what bowl belonged to whom (Each had his own station which was 10 feet away from the next fur person. Squabbles ensued anyway.) So the Front Feeding Station now has two bowls which hold a half can each and in the next room is the Kitten Station with two bowls which hold a half can. Everyone circulates around and disagreements have almost disappeared. I admit to the use on the elder cats of a calming collar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLYWLQ">Calming Cat Collar 1 Count</a> and to the use of Feliway throughout the house.:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00608SVD4">Feliway Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial</a>.<br />Having become an artist at cat rigamarole, I usually suceed in finding foods that the cats will eat. Friskies is a dietary staple. I receive The The Meaty Bits and the Seafood variety pack plus the Pouches of Gravy Sensations on a regular rotating basis. EVERYBODY will eat those. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00376301U">Friskies Prime Filets Seafood Selections Variety Pack, Seafood, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJG2H2">Friskies Cat Food Meaty Bits Variety Pack, 24-Count</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Gravy Sensations Pouch Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a>.<br />The Pates being reviewed came up on Amazon's Recommendations For Me a few days ago. I was thrilled. This was a 32 pack instead of the 24 Packs that I usually get. So I ordered it right away. I was just about out of large canned food and none was due until mid January.<br />During my feeding production tonight, I gave part of one can of food, thereby using 3 of the varieties, placed at various feeding stations. I paid no attention to who ate what but headed out to feed the outside boy, Yellow Kitty. Salmon flavor had not gone to an indoor cat, so I gave it to him, along with a can of Mariner's Stew. Yellow Kitty eats a lot in the winter when it is cold and hunting is difficult. He is only fed in the evening, so will eat a lot at his first sitting, then nibble on and off until his next feeding.<br />Today was a BUSY DAY. It is 21ntin days until Christmas and I still have many things to wrap. Little last minute sales precipitate unplanned purchases, and that means more wrapping, and, what is for Christmas Dinner. Better be on that too!<br />So, I paid little attention to who ate what and went busily on my way. It must have also been "noisily" on my was as no one mentioned a thing.<br />As I was preparing for bed, I started turning off lights. The back door light was on. Yellow Kitty is fed by the back door. His wet food bowls were almost full though the dry food was almost depleted, which was unusual. Usually he eats the wet food first. Hmmmmmm.....<br />Front feeding station: Friskies Meaty bits which were a leftover, had disappeared. Otherwise, it appeared that one or two bites had been taken and then the rest was left. Kitten Room: Bowls were full, just as they were in the back feeding station. Oh well, I went to bed.<br />The next morning, bowls were still full. Breakfast of a different variety was served and gobbled down by all.<br /><br />This scenario took place several times over the next 10 days. Yellow Kitty, who lives outside, finally began to give in and eat about half his normal portion. My inside kids continued to nibble at the pate. They then ate some dry food and waited a bit, THEN BEGAN TO COMPLAIN LOUDLY FOR SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT! I finally caved and gave them a different menu.<br /><br />This product recieves 2 Stars which represents "I don't like it." I really would not personally have feeling about the Pate and would let the cats vote. HOWEVER 1. I have had to clean up several uneaten meals which means picking up and doing something with 4-6 bowls of disgusting looking brown stuff which purports that it is Cat Food; however, my guys will not eat it. 2. I have to delete my Subscribe and Save order. It ism't much of a pain to do so, but I like to think that if I put an item on S&S, I will give Amazon their money's worth and reorder the item several times. 3. Also, I now have about 3/4 of the pack in the cupboard and that must be taken out and donated to someone. It adds up to more work than I had in mind.<br /><br />I guess that is the 2 star bottom line: my cats will not eat it and it causes a disposal dilemma. Gabriella, Trinity, Mischief, Mercy, Yellow Kitty and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT because none of my 5 Fur People will eat it.

review/text: We've had cats for approximately 20 years and we have tried various wet food "treats" for them throughout the years, with a staple dry food primary diet. For some reason, they always respond best to this type of cat food over the others, especially wet food with the "meaty bit" consistency. Personally, the other food always looks more appetizing than this SPAM lookalike, but I go with what they want. It smells awful, but all wet cat food does.<br /><br />Good price, easy subscription service, shipped well = happy customer.

review/summary: 7 cats are rating 7 paws up
review/text: I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.<br /><br />We had a cat develop a kidney stone, with urinary problems, and the Vet claims it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit or chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meats varieties in p�t&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is less now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food.<br /><br />As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We have Subscribe & Save on some but that'll probably disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand.

review/text: Who can account for a cat's taste?  My cat love seafood pate, and hates any of the various filets in other cat foods.  She also hates beef, chicken she will tolerate.<br /><br />All these people complaining about busted cans . .I have never had any problem with the quality of the cans or leaking cans.<br /><br />The other complain is that sometimes Amazon jacks up the price when their inventory is low.  This has nothing to do with the cat food . .  that is Amazon's pricing policy.  If you think the cost is too high, don't buy it.<br /><br />My supermarket sells this for 60 cents plus sales tax.  Amazon is 50 cents, no sales tax plus the convenience of free delivery.<br /><br />I would give this 5 stars, but I am not sure if my cat will like all of the 4 different varieties.  Cats seem to like very smelly fish food.  My cat likes this stuff.<br /><br />Follow up:  My cat doesn't like anything with salmon, so I won't be buying this pack again.

review/text: My cats love the Friskies Seafood Pate.  I had given them dry food and they just nibbled at it here and there.  I opened up a can of this and they got excited and stayed and ate hungrily until they were full!  Also thier poop is firmer and hardly even smells now!  This is all I give them and they are happy. I dont buy them anything else. :D

review/summary: Get out your calculators complainers
review/text: I wonder why there are these 4 people complaining about the price of this cat food. I subscribe to Amazon's gourmet foods and get the 32 can case of Friskies cat food for $13.57 delivered to my front door. If I went to Walmart in this state it would be an additional 9% sales tax and the price would be about a dollar more or almost $15. Add a gallon of gas and an hour of my time and it's over $20.  Is it just me or are you guys completely on a different page? Add your time, gas and sales tax and figure it out.  $15.57 to your front door IN 2 DAYS is a great deal and my 2 Siamese just love it! Think about it~~

review/text: My cats love all the Friskies Pates, all six of them, although the price on amazon, even with a subscription and $1 off coupon, is far above what I would otherwise pay.  If you catch this at a good price, go for it.  The product is great.

review/text: I purchase this same exact case of cat food at the local grocery store for about $13.00.  I don't know why Amazon is charging so much. Buy local and get twice as much.<br />With that said, as well as a 1-star rating, Friskies is a high quality cat food that I will continue to buy for my cats....but I likely won't be buying it from Amazon.

review/summary: Never ordering cat food online ever again!!!
review/text: I ordered this for my 17 year old cat. She only has one tooth and is very finicky. She will only eat the seafood pate of Friskies. I thought the purchase was a great deal since it was cheaper than Walmart and I could have it delivered to my house for a free price. I thought this was a good idea.<br />Well, I was wrong.<br />My housemate and I wondered what that godawful smell was. After weeks of dealing with cockroaches scurrying under furniture and fruit flies perching everywhere, I found out where they were breeding. One of the cans arrived banged up and maggots decided to call it home. You think fresh cat food smells bad?<br />I brought home a premature infant and was afraid of all of the germs that infested the place at the time. I did not want a single risk posed to him getting sick. So I kept him in his room until I found out where the funk was coming from.<br />The moral of this story is unless you don't mind infestation and possible contamination, don't order cat food online.

review/summary: Great food, but purchase from local store for A LOT less
review/text: As 2 others have stated you can get the 32 packs from Wal-Mart for about $12-13. You also do have the variety of choosing different flavors and different textures like the pate or shreds. My older and younger cats would rather eat the shredded or meat bits then the mashed pate thing, and I think they don't have such a strong smell as the pate does either!<br /><br />If you do not mind paying double then go for it, but I am always searching for the lowest price and knowing that Amazon is usually cheaper thought I could find them on here, but that is obviously not true in this case! Better just to buy some when you're at the store. At the store it is about .42 per can and at what I have been seeing on here it is about .78 -.80. So if you're like me and don't go to Wal-mart all that often or even if you do, best just to stock up on a few cases and save quite a bit of money!

review/summary: A staple in my spice cabinet
review/text: First I should state that I don't make pumpkin pies.  I am really not a dessert kind of guy, I leave that up to others.  However, I love this blend and use it all of the time.  My favorite would be for French Toast, I add a little to the egg and milk mixture and then sprinkle some on the finished product.  It also goes well with sweet potatoes, yams, Cinnamon rolls, peanut butter (just try it before you cast stones), carrots and many other savory dishes that could use a little bit of flavor.<br /><br />The combination of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice adds an extra dimension to many foods. I often make my own version from freshly ground ingredients but this brand is fine for when you want to add a lot of flavor in a hurry.

review/summary: A simple soup with a bit of a sweetness
review/text: I have eaten quite a few of Amy's soups and frozen entrees.  I've only run into a couple of misses and, fortunately, this is a good Amy's product.  Overall, it's a simple soup.  It doesn't have chunks of vegetables and is really just a little thicker than a broth.  If you love butternut squash and the sweetness that tends to accompany it, this is a nice soup for lunch. When paired with a simple garden salad, you have a complete meal. I've also provided it as a side dish as holiday meals, particularly Thanksgiving, because it pairs well with mashed potatoes and stuffing.<br /><br />When I first tried it, I thought it was missing exactly what it purports to be low in -- salt.  However, after two tries, I don't notice a lack of salt.  In fact, for those seeking a low sodium diet, this may not be your ticket.  A 14.1 oz. can has two servings.  Each serving has 290 mg. of salt, which is calculated to be 12% of the average person's daily serving.  If you eat the whole can, you are getting nearly 1/4 of your sodium for the day.  Still, this soup has less sodium (and calories) than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM4TR6">Imagine Butternut Squash Soup, 16-Ounce Aseptic Cartons (Pack of 12)</a>, which is an equally tasty soup.<br /><br />Because this is a fairly light soup, it is easy to eat a whole can and therefore two servings.  Calorie wise, the soup is great.  It has 100 calories per serving (200 calories for a can).  If dieting or counting calories, this soup would be a good meal option.

review/summary: More Flavorful Than the Original
review/text: Kids like Goldfish crackers, the size, the shape, the color, the texture, maybe even the flavor. Personally I find them too bland to satisfy my occasional craving for something cheesy. These Xtra Cheddar Goldfish, on the other hand, though not finger licking cheesy are a step up from the regular Goldfish.  They do have an enjoyable flavor that could almost compel a snacker to eat the entire bag. That may or may not be a good thing.<br /><br />For flavor and satisfaction, the Extra Cheddar is definitely a better option that the original cheese goldfish.

review/text: My family loves gold fish, we eat them all of the time. Put them in soup, snack on them at lunch and late at night. I bought the whole grain version to have something a bit healthier... although they aren't healthy by any means! The box is a great size, it's a bit smaller then the ones you might see at a grocery store though so do not expect one of the humongous boxes but it is still a great size and lasted my family of 3 for about a month which is a lot more affordable than buying the smaller boxes every week! These do have a powdered cheese on them that can stay on your fingers unlock the original so if you have small children you don't want cheese fingers everywhere I would stay away from them.

review/summary: Absolutey incredible!
review/text: My husband and I are dieting. He was looking for another sweet dressing because he was tired of Walden Farms' Raspberry Vinaigrette. Litehouse's Blueberry Pomegranate is pretty good, but we didn't find anything else we liked at all. I knew I had to try this when I saw that it was fat free. Although the bottle doesn't list the calories, I sent an email to the company and learned that the dressing has 25 calories for a two tablespoon serving size. I have to say that this is probably one, if not the best salad dressing I've ever eaten. We just use it as is, and don't add oil. I made a spinach salad with fresh cherries and blueberries, craisins, a tablespoon of reduced fat blue cheese (Treasure Cave), and candied walnuts. It was absolutely heavenly. I have tried other fruit combinations and candied pecans, as well. Butter lettuce works well, too. We liked this so much we finished the bottle within a week. Since I saw how fast it went, I ordered five more bottles, and one of their other flavor, wild huckleberry, which we haven't tried yet. If you use fresh cherries, I highly recommend the Oxo Good Grips cherry pitter, which will make quick work of the pitting.

Some friends and I tried both the huckleberry and chokecherry varieties from Huckleberry Haven (a Montana company)and we liked the chokecherry best.  It is sweet, but not overly sweet.  I mix it 50/50 with extra virgin olive oil to make salad dressing.  My new favorite salad is fresh spinach, feta cheese, pecans, blackberries and chokecherry/EVOO dressing.  Very simple, very tasty.

review/summary: okay for pancakes; skip the other baking options
review/text: I've been through about 3 boxes of Insta-Bake and tried many of the recipes on the back.  For pancakes, they're okay.  I like feeding my kids whole wheat pancakes, but honestly I think Aunt Jemimima makes a better whole wheat pancake mix product.<br /><br />As for the other recipes I've tried using Insta-bake, I've been disappointed every time.  The biscuits are flat, hard, dry little pucks.  No one wanted them.  I've tried a couple of times thinking maybe I just did something wrong.  Nope; they're gross.<br /><br />The cookies I made were also awful.  Yeah, maybe healthier than a tollhouse cookie but since I ended up tossing them out because, healthy or not, they STILL weren't worth the calories and at ANY rate, just tasted bad.  For a good cookie made with whole wheat flour I make these cookies [...]<br /><br />Anyway, for pancakes, fine, but there are other options out there.  Don't expect this product to be as versitle as Bisquick or Jiffy baking mix.

review/summary: Some of the best pancakes ever!
review/text: Food manufacturers have made it very hard to eat healthy -- have you ever looked at the ingredient list on a box of pancake mix?  So when I saw this Whole Wheat baking mix at the store I had to try it.  I had tried other brands of Whole Wheat mixes in the past with so-so success, so I wasn't going to bet the farm on this one being too good in the taste department.  Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />It makes some of the best pancakes you will ever eat!  Your family will think you are pulling their leg when you inform them they are full of whole wheat goodness.<br /><br />A lot of whole wheat items come out "dry" and the taste can be off.  Not with Insta-Bake!  Hodgson Mill makes some of the best speciality "healthy" baking mixes and ingredients on the market.  The pancakes came out fluffy and full of flavor and moisture.  I was shocked and everyone loved them!<br /><br />For an added treat, try throwing in a handful of chocolate chips or some chopped up fruit.  Your kids will think you are serving them dessert for breakfast and gobble them down.  In fact, why not make some of these for dinner one night for a "special" dinner night with the family!

I was pleasantly surprised especially after reading the healthy ingredients.  It's really hard for me to eat healthy even though I try, but most healthy stuff doesn't taste good to me. I am going to start keeping these in my desk for those days when I can't get away for lunch.<br /><br />If I hadn't been given a free one, I probably never would have tried these.  I'm glad I did.

review/text: Stumbled upon these at Whole Foods in Southern California; I am a regular natural-products-shopper had not previously seen them anywhere on the East coast. I picked this flavor because it's one of few (3, I believe) Zing Bars that is also dairy-free and uses brown rice protein instead of whey. It was absolutely delicious -- rich-tasting and peanut-buttery, with a generous amount of miniature dark chocolate chips throughout. Very satisfying. I usually only go for the USDA-Organic bars (with logo), so I'm glad I gave these a look because they contain many organic ingredients; I suppose they just do not have certification. Glad to have discovered these and hope to see them in more natural foods shops both in person and online. Tip: I like to "knead" out bars so they flatten/extend to the entirety of the wrapper -- more fun to pick at and makes it last longer. (The Chocolate Coconut flavor is also out-of-this-world! It tastes like an Almond Joy!)

review/text: I have ordered Hawaiian Shaved Ice 10 pint pack for $44 and this time around decided to try Great Northern Polar's 10 pint pack for $29 (both have free Super Saver Shipping).  I was pleasantly surprised and happy with my Great Northern purchases upon testing.  The ten flavors all taste very delicious and I prefer the texture of the shaved ice when G N P's syrup is poured on, as opposed to Hawaiian Shaved Ice's.  I'd definitely recommend this less expensive option for snow cone syrup!!

review/summary: Lots of peanuts
review/text: Usually these are priced the same as Planter's Deluxe Mix.  However, these contain a lot more peanuts, which are cheaper.  They contain peanuts, almonds, pistachios, pecans, walnuts and hazelnuts.  And I think that's the order of abundance as well.  Looking down into this fresh opened can here, I mainly see a lot of peanuts and almonds.  I don't find them particularly greasy or oily, but they certainly are not dry roasted.  The peanuts don't have skins.  They have 50mg of sodium, compared to 110 in most other Planter's mixes, and they have 600mg of Potasium, compared to the 500mg in the deluxe mix.

review/summary: Great Taste with a Unique Mix
review/text: I've seen some of the reviews complain that this particular mix is just a typical one and there is nothing special about it. That is just simply not the case. It's odd to see too many mixes with pistachios and hazelnuts and they really do add to the flavor of the mix. As for the "Heart Healthy" aspect of it that probably is more of a marketing thing than anything. The basic part is just that nuts are a good source of protein and these have less salt than the regular mix. You won't miss the salt at all though.<br /><br />I would buy this particular mix over the regular given a choice every time.

review/text: This new product certainly takes advantage of the power of marketing. Basically, it's common nut mix marketed as health food. The price per can is about $2 more than nut mixes found in supermarkets and certainly much more than a "mix it yourself" solution. Great marketing, convenient, but a bit overpriced.

review/summary: I don't know exactly why, but my baby goes nuts for these!
review/text: I began giving these to my daughter when she was 12 months old.  At that time, she was still having difficulty with many table foods - but she was able to eat these without any issues.  While other fruit strips are usually gummy and tough, these are extremely soft.  Sadly though, they're very expensive and have a lot of packaging waste.  That being said, my toddler REALLY REALLY REALLY loves these.  In the past she loved them so much that she used to cry when she realized she only had a bite or two left.  When she was going through her picky eating stage - these were always a food that she readily accepted.<br /><br />Now that she's approaching 2, I don't buy them very often due to the price.  However, these were a great food to use when transitioning to table foods.

Each bar is 1 serving of fruit; and they have no preservatives, artificial flavors, or artificial sweeteners.  They are individually wrapped and great for packing in purse or diaper bag.  I buy them in both flavors, and keep plenty on hand at all times.

review/summary: Spicy Flavor
review/text: If you like food with a kick, you will enjoy this. Was fine for me but hubby thought it was a tad spicy so I will just use half of the seasoning packet next time (I have three packages to use) Not really sure yet if I will purchase again as this is just a good basic chili mix and for that is a little pricey. Is a good chicken chili and you could just add beef to this to have a nice spicy beef chili, which is what I will do next time. So for the price I can make my own alot cheaper. You add tomato sauce,a can of tomatos, a can of corn and black beans your meat and add the seasoning packet. Easy to do in the crockpot. Says it makes 11 servings but I think 5 servings is more like it. The only difference between the ingredients in this package as opposed to the Tortilla soup mix from this company is that this one uses black beans and the Tortilla soup mix uses navy beans. The spice ingredient packet is the same and the add ins are the same.

review/summary: Great drink, but Nescafe needs to rethink pricing structure
review/text: I'm quite happy with my Dolce Gusto machine, and 95% of the time we drink the Caffe Lungo.  That product comes in a box of 16 capsules, but since there is no milk/sugar capsule involved in Caffe Lungo, we get 16 drinks from every box.  One capsule makes one drink.  The iced cappuccino also comes in a box of sixteen capsules, but you need two (one coffee, one milk/sugar) for each drink:  so you are only getting 8 drinks from every box, at the same price as the other.  In other words, the iced cappuccino costs twice as much.  I think Nescafe should make each box the same number of SERVINGS, rather than the same number of physical capsules.  I do like to have these around for super hot days (like today :-) but it's not a product I'll repeat after August is over, simply because of the pricing issue.

review/summary: Not that expensive compared with "ordering out"
review/text: This is by far my favorite of the flavors! I do like mine a little sweeter than it comes, and I've found that a little agave nectar is the perfect solution...it mixes wonderfully with cold drinks, adds just the right amount of sweet, and doesn't make me feel quite as guilty as plain sugar.<br /><br />I've noticed that the biggest complaint is the price, but I don't think it's that bad. I purchase my capsules locally--and usually on sale. On average, one box (or 8 servings) costs me around $9. That is just over $1/drink. If this is a new addition to your diet--then this may be a little pricey...but for those of us who are willing to spend $2-$5/drink at a coffee shop--this is a savings! A little perspective and moderation can go a long way in appreciating what you have in front of you!

I had not subscribed for the iced cappuchino because I wanted to try it first. I now go on to order and subscribe and see that the price has doubled. I am assuming because it is being sold by an alternate vendor and not Amazon but as much as I loved it I am not going to pay double the price. Amazon please go back to the orginal price and you will have an order from me again. Thanks.

For those who complain any of these caps are not flavorful enough, your adding too much water. If you want a mega sized coffee, use two sets then. This is just right for me, not too sweet and right amount of flavor. I enjoy them every morning, it is always such a treat and reminds me of Europe a little and a feeling of being back home.

I ordered a 3 pack of this iced cappuccino thinking I'd like it because I really enjoy iced coffee at Starbucks.  This stuff though, not so great.  It's not bad, just not good either.  Maybe if they offered it with some hazelnut flavoring, it would be better.  I keep trying to offer the iced cappuccino to guests at my house because I've got three boxes of this stuff and I'm not going to use it all myself unless I get really desperate for caffeine. This beverage has yet to impress anybody I've served it to either.

review/summary: Yummy.
review/text: Since I purchased my dolce gusto circolo I've been saving time and money not driving to get my morning venti mocha daily. Portions are approx. 8 oz per serving which is less than I am use to, but just as tasty.

review/text: I've had the Palm Island red clay salt and that was good but this is even better. It knocks the socks off Celtic & Himalayan salts too. Has an enjoyable salty taste and is good in Asian foods yes but other foods as well. I used it in cole slaw, hummus, havla, maccaroons & tabouli but I'm sure it would be good in anything.

review/summary: Bamboo Jade sea salt, amazing and unique!
review/text: I recently had an wonderful opportunity to try the Bamboo Hawaiian sea salt.<br />It smells like sweet green tea, and is made with organically grown bamboo leaf extract, which after looking at a bit of literature on this ingredient, it is loaded in lots of great nutrients.<br />I tried it on Jasmine rice, grilled halibut and my favorite; mango.<br /><br />I loved this one!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSZJEU">Palm Island Premium Bamboo Jade Sea Salt, 6-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Best PEZ Dispensers EVER!
review/text: With so many different PEZ dispensers out there, how can I say that you ask?  There are a couple of reasons.<br /><br />First, most PEZ dispensers are simply that: PEZ dispensers.  They perform no other function (unless you count "catching dust").  These are also pullback cars, which cross the floor at a pretty good clip.<br /><br />Second, I'm old enough to remember when PEZ dispensers actually shot the candy into your mouth.  Trial lawyers ended that fun; modern PEZ dispensers are designed to merely push a piece of candy out far enough so that you can grab it with your fingers.  However, these PEZ dispensers use an entirely different mechanism, and at least in some of them, when you push down the button at the front, you can bounce candy off the ceiling!<br /><br />Note: Should you be so lucky as to acquire any of these accidental throwbacks, please be content to catch the candy in your mouth ON THE REBOUND off the ceiling, and for God's sake don't tell a trial lawyer!<br /><br />You get a randomly selected three out of the following four Models:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176GRDU">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Blue #24 Jeff Gordon</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176B76C">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Red #9 Kasey Kahne</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N531RG">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Blue #2 Rusty Wallace</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176EZG6">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Orange #20 Tony Stewart</a><br /><br />There are four other models that I know of, differing only in plastic color, paint, and decals:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002F8PXAW">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Yellow #17 Matt Kenseth</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00176IE22">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Light Blue #43 Richard Petty</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZWF52E">PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Green #18 Bobby Labonte</a><br />PEZ Candy Dispenser NASCAR Race Car Black Daytona 500 50th Anniv.<br /><br />Each car comes with three rolls of PEZ candy.

review/summary: Pez Nascar Pull and Go
review/text: The description was misleading.  The product desriptor stated that it was an assorted pack of three and it listed all the different cars.  I placed the order thinking there would be three Pez cars coming.  When I only received one, I was very disappointed.  Because it was for my son's birthday, I had to look for something else online to put in my son's goody bag.  After I received it, I went to look at the description again because I thought I had read it incorrectly.  The description was not written clearly.

review/summary: Adjustable heat sauce review
review/text: When I ordered this, I didn't really know what to expect. This is really a good idea. You just turn the lid on top to adjust your heat preference. And it comes out in a spray pattern instead of drops. I took one bottle to work and everybody liked it. I'm keeping the other two for my wife and I.  We'll order some more when this runs out.

review/summary: Good concept, but doesn't replace your regular sauce
review/text: This is a good way to alter the heat of your dish, but it is a rather thin (watery) sauce.  It doesn't replace the other sauces in my collection but is useful for changing the heat of them or for spicing up another dish that I won't use a thicker hot sauce in.
