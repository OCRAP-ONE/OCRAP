review/text: Joyva's Marble Halvah Bars are a delight for the senses. Dense and rich, they are filling in a few bites. They blend the chocolate and the sesame deftly. They're not the usual candy bars. Unlike the Camel bars,they aren't dry. They're a sesame seed equivalent to marzipan (almond paste) These Marble Halvah Bars have one disadvantage--they're not enough! There are bigger chocolate bars around. Joyva makes excellent,delicious,delectable halvah. It's exotic Middle Eastern food for the comfort of your own home.

review/summary: Big fan of Steviva Blend
review/text: I started using Steviva Blend because my blood glucose was elevated. My naturopathic dr suggested I eliminate sugar and grains from my diet... and NEVER use artificial sweeteners. I use this every day in my coffee with full fat half & half.  At first it took some time to figure out how much to use, but it is a dream come true to me.  It's all natural and has the same consistency as granulated sugar. The ingredients are erythritol and stevia. One tablespoon = 2.4 cal, 0 fat, 0 sodium, 0 carbs, 0 sugars.  No more gagging on unsweetened coffee!  (FYI: The photo shows the product as packets but is actually a bulk 1 lb bag.)

review/text: I love to take these packets traveling.  Great as a slushy with a twist of lime, in a yoghurt/soy smoothie or hot with milk.  My favorite is two teaspoons of crystals from the packet, two of Splenda, 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla and a tall glass of cold water.  It's an unusual flavor.  I like it plain, but some people prefer it with mint, citrus or vanilla. It's a four hour drive to the closest Asian market - this is MUCH cheaper.

review/text: Since popcorn is my snack of choice, I thought this product would give me a little variety.<br />The label says to sprinkle it in the bag of popped corn.  Well, that only takes it to the bottom of the bag!!!!  So, I use the same method as when I sprinkle parmasean cheese on my corn.  I empty the bag of popped corn in a big bowl, spray it with olive oil cooking spray (what I coat my cooking pans with) and then sprinkle the parasean on the corn.  The spray helps the cheese to adhere to the corn.  It also works with the Kernel Seasonings, except that I do it in half bag batches (1/2 of the corn in the bowl, spray, sprinkle and then the second half of corn.

I can't seem to find these at Sam's anymore in the BIG containers and gave Amazon a shot. I wanted to see what the 2 oz. size looked like to get an idea before purchasing but couldn't find a close match in our spice cupboard so I pulled the trigger. UGH! At the store today and I see the 2 oz. is the tiny one and about $2.50!! A rip off as each is about $5.00 here!

review/text: I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.

review/summary: Awesome healthIER snack option!
review/text: I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.

review/summary: A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored
review/text: The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of "there must be something better".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per "serving"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word "puff" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed "all natural". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.

review/summary: Good chips with an occasional bad aftertaste
review/text: These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them - very dangerous. Most of the time, the chips tasted quite good, but every now and then I'd get one with this somewhat bitter aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Besides that, I would definitely buy these again.

review/summary: Best flavor, hands down of Popchips is barbeque!!
review/text: I bought a multi-box of flavors but this was the absolute best flavor (IMHO) in there so it's the one I'll comment on.  Spicy, sweet, flavorful, fun, crispy, lower fat than chips, I loved it.  I'll be buying more but only of this flavor.  The other flavors weren't so great (salt & pepper and cheddar aren't too bad) but this one rocked.

review/summary: Great Chips Less Fat
review/text: I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of "regular" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Best "healthy" salt and vinegar chip out there
review/text: I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.

review/text: I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are "salt and pepper", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor.

I decided to give the popchips a try, thinking if they were at least okay I could replace my cravings for them.  They are better than okay!  These little guys are full of flavor and crunch!  And not to sound like a pig, but I could eat a half a bag of Bettermade in one sitting, but these little 8 oz bags, even though they are small, they fill me up!  I was shocked!  I am not kidding, I am eating healthier, giving in to my craving, and getting full from one small bag.  You cannot go wrong with these, even my kids love them!  I am thrilled to have found a healthy alternative to fatty chips!

They are light and as far as junk food goes they are healthy..'er than your regular chip. They do not leave your fingers greasy or any oily / greasy feel or taste in your mouth. That is because they are hot air popped and not fried. I almost ate the whole bag on my first taste; by the way it was the huge Costco size bag, twice the size of their large bags. With in two days I was back at Costco to by another bag. Like I said I just love these chips!

The pepper flavor rounds up the chip rather than defines it, so it doesn't feel like you're eating pepper in it's raw form.<br /><br />It's a good thing the fat content is low because these are quite addictive.

review/summary: I wanted to love these...
review/text: I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying "chip" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.

My kids love the chips and, I agree, they are YUMMY!  I'm sad that I can't have them!  :-(

review/summary: Salt & Pepper Popchips - I crave these!
review/text: If you like hot peppery spicey food (and drink), you will like these.  I get a craving for them.  Of course, I like to drink Habanero Margaritas -- yes, there is such a thing! -- so you may prefer to order the Popchips variety case first (you'll get 3 packages of these in the case) to see how your taste buds react.

review/summary: THE BEST CHIPS, EVER!!!
review/text: I first sampled these chips at a volleyball tournament in California.  I'm a big chip lover, and these are by far the best chips I've ever had.  Better than the baked; not greasy at all, sturdy for dips.  I highly recommend these chips to any chip lover!  (I've not purchased them from Amazon, so I don't know how they will fare during shipping.)

review/text: I am doing Weight Watchers, but there are certain foods I did not want to give up.  One was potato chips.  I love the Popchips and they do taste like potato chips unlike other products I have tried.  One serving is 3 points on the WW point system and you can have 18-22 chips, depending on the flavor you choose.  Very good!

review/summary: Great and Healthy
review/text: I love Salt & Vinegar chips and once I went on my diet I felt like I had to give them up because it's so hard to find healthy ones.  Then I finally found these and I love them!  They're strong tasting and I actually like them better than regular salt & vinegar chips.  They're less oily and I don't feel sick or guilty after having some.  The one-ounce bags are perfect for a snack, but the 3.25 ounce bags end up being cheaper so I divide it up into 3 ziplock bags once I open them.  It works great!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I was really hoping to get a really great nutritious & delicious snack for my family when I ordered this product.  I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, "potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best.

review/text: Popchips are ok.  However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to "Pringles".  If you have ever eaten "Funyuns" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try "Grandma Utz" potato chips, a true potato chip.

My last order however, arrived at my house in an open box with a huge amount of tape.  This resulted in me getting a case of crumbs.  I was very disappointed because usually they come in safe packaging. I give the chips 5 stars, but the packaging this time around was horrible!

review/summary: Delicious and a little bit nutritious....
review/text: Not greasy or salty like a traditional chip, these actually tend to be more satiating as a sweet snack than a salty one, at least in the sweet potato chip variety. A handful of these is a sufficient pick me up and relatively wholesome, with just around 100 calories. The sugars are low too so even though you feel like you are having something slightly sweet it's really not going to spike your sugars (I think around 3g per serving). Overall these are a great little snack that you can feel good about eating.

review/text: I've tried most of the Popchips flavors, and the barbecue flavor is my favorite. It has a sweet spiciness, but nothing is overpowering; just the right balance of smoke, sweet, and spice, they're all good, but the barbecue has the most robust flavor.<br /><br />Popchips are a good choice for those who are trying to trim a few pounds. They're tasty and filling, but relatively low in calories compared to traditional chips. I parcel mine out into sandwich-size reclosable bags to help with portion control, and still manage to have a satisfying snack that fits in my program.

review/summary: Best Popcorn-type Chips of 6 Brands I Bought & Tested!
review/text: I wanted to have "sized" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor

They are not as healthy as eating fruits and veggies, and are still chips, but they are a much MORE healthy alternative to your regular chip.  And they do still have an excellent taste!

Yes it is derived from wheat or corn but this highly processed food flavoring is hardly what most would consider when we hear "all natural no fake flavors" - of course they are technically telling the truth it is just a natural sourced -highly processed, sweetner from starch and a source of carbs.<br /><br />So aside from the weasel words in the label the product is fine  I just wish they wouldn't try and pretend to be something they are not - they are  snack food - we expect some downside

review/summary: Pop Chips Barbeque Potato Chips
review/text: My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation "spices" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.

The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors, but not the sweet potato.  So I broke down and bought a box.  I went with the 3-ounce version because the price per oz was lower than the smaller bags.  These bags aren't TOO big, and I just use a clip on them to keep the air out after they're opened.

review/text: I love Popchips. They are a lot different than regular potato chips, but they are quite good. Sea Salt and Vinegar and Chili Lime are my two favorite flavors, and I'd like to try Parmesan Garlic one day (they don't seem to be sold in my area for some reason). Popchips are lower in calories and fat than most regular potato chips, which makes them a healthier alternative when you're looking for something crunchy to snack on. I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn. If you're on the fence about buying these, I would recommend trying a small bag to see if you like them before buying one of these big multi-pack deals. I've seen them at a lot of grocery stores--that's where I buy mine. They really are quite different from regular potato chips, but they're tasty and definitely worth trying.
