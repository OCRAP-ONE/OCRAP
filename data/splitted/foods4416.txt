review/summary: Glutino's Version Is Better
review/text: Don't get me wrong, I ate the entire package just fine (2.5 days), but compared to Glutinos 'oreo', this one isn't as good. Look for Glutinos instead. They are the same price in the store.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: These cookies did not taste chocolatey like an Oreo does and they were very chalky in texture. When I dipped it in milk, I had to work very fast or the dipped portion would fall off. Even dipped, it was a weird grainy texture. They were sweet, but not chocolate sweet, just sugar sweet... Everyone has different opinions when it comes to their gluten free preferences. Just to give you an idea of mine, some brands I usually like are Pamela's Best and Udi's.

review/summary: Does Not Contain Crack Cocaine, Just Seems That Way
review/text: These cookies have one small flaw that makes it difficult to give them five stars, they are almost literally addictive.  If you open a package of these cookies and do not eat them all at once, then I bet we can count the hours they will last.<br /><br />They are delicious.  To my memory they seem amazingly similar to another brand of sugar goop sandwich cookie, you know which brand I mean.<br /><br />If you miss "real" cookies because of your gluten free diet these cookies are more like their regular counterpart than any other GF cookie I have had.  They also seem genuinely vegan too.<br /><br />If it were not for the fact they are as addictive as crack cocaine they would be the perfect occasional snack. Not recommended for daily use, but really, really good.

My father visited and ate some before I could tell him they were my son's "special" cookies, and he couldn't even tell they were gluten free.  I sent a package to my son's school so that for special events they have them on hand, and my son isn't excluded....in fact just yesterday they had a Teddy Bear Tea, and even he was able to have a plate of cookies like everyone else in the class.<br />I am so glad we found these...

I used these as the bottom of an ice cream cake and it worked out great. Next plan is to try it as a pie crust in place of a graham cracker crust.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: I was excited to try these, as they get rave reviews.  I've not had a sandwich cookie since I went gluten-free 10 years ago.  Sadly, I was unimpressed.  This surprised me, as other Kinnikinnick products are really good.  Right away I noticed that they do not look like the image on the package--golden and rich.  Instead, they appear pale and not particularly creamy.  Looks did not deceive.  They don't have a vanilla flavor at all.  In fact, there is no flavor, just overwhelming sweetness.  The cookies are OK, though they are very crumbly.  They have the barest hint of vanilla.  The filling has pretty much no flavor, is gritty, and leaves a powdery residue.  They are way too sweet and come off tasting synthetic. I scraped the filling out and just ate the cookies.  Despite my craving for a sandwich cookie, I would never buy these again.  The search goes on.

review/text: If you're gluten free and have been longing for that Oreo flavor, texture, and deliciousness - your wait is over. These are the real deal. The consistency  of the cookie is just right and the flavor of the filling couldn't be more perfect. They did a good job to even match the design on the tops of the cookie to match what you'd get from Nabisco.<br /><br />You get 21 cookies per pack and these aren't diet food at about 50 calories per cookie, so save these for dessert only!<br /><br />I haven't tried it yet but I bet these would also make a mean pie crust or crunch a few up as topping on an ice cream sundae.

review/summary: Almost as good as Oreos?  Not quite...
review/text: I was really excited to try these cookies because I really love Oreos.  After reading rave reviews, I went out and got a package of them from Whole Foods.  Maybe it's the fact that I have just recently been diagnosed as Celiac (1 month ago) and the amazing taste of real Oreos is fresh in my mind, but these just don't do it for me.  They taste nothing like real Oreos and probably have more in common with a Hydrox cookie.  If you are on a GF diet, you can eat these and pretend they are Oreos, but you have to have a strong imagination, because they leave a LOT to be desired.  I'd much rather do without (or make some home-made GF oreo cookies).

review/summary: NOH HAWAIIAN BAR-B-Q SAUCE
review/text: Fantastic barbeque sauce!!!  Made in Honolulu, HA!  Have you ever checked the bottles of BBQ sauce on your grocer's shelf and tried to find one without high fructose corn syrup in it.  I have, and it's nearly impossible!  I ended up going to a "Good Earth" health food store in order to find one.  I was so surprised and happy to find this one on an end cap at Walmart for $5.62/20 oz. bottle--not much more here and well worth it no matter what! It is absolutely the best barbeque sauce I have ever had!  We used it on ribs, that I sprinkled with salt and pepper and baked in a covered casserole dish in the oven at 350 degrees for an hour, took them out and basted them with a basting brush with this sauce and put under the broiler to glaze, turn ribs to glaze the other side too.  This BBQ sauce has such a wonderful "sheer goodness" flavor and thickened up beautifully to a wonderful glaze on the ribs.  Oh my gosh, they were so-o good!!!  My family kept saying how good the ribs were.  I served them with leftover baked potatoes that I peeled and sprinkled with salt and dried rosemary and browned in a pan that I lightly coated with olive oil, and with artichokes, and strawberries.  It only took about 1/4 of a bottle to glaze both sides of two racks of pork baby back ribs, which is two meals for my family.  I can't wait to try it on BBQ chicken and as suggested here, BBQ chicken pizza!  I'm sure it'll be fabulous.  The BBQ sauce bottle's label has directions to boil the ribs for 30-40 minutes first, baste with the sauce, and then bake them for 20 min. in 350 degree oven.  That sounds like a great way to cook ribs, so I'll be trying it that way next time!  You can also write NOH Foods of Hawaii Intl, PO Box 8392, Honolulu, HA 96830 for a free recipe booklet.  How nice is that! I'll definitely be buying more of this sauce!<br /><br />Also, take a look at the list of ingredients on the bottle:  Tomato Puree (water, tomato paste), Brown Sugar (sugar, molasses), Distilled Vinegar, Salt, Worcestershire Sauce (distilled vinegar, molasses, corn syrup, water, salt, caramel color, garlic powder, sugar, spices, tamarind, natural flavor).  Contains less than 2% of:  natural Smoke Flavor, Onion Powder, Water, Mustard Seed, Cornstarch, Garlic Powder, Caramel Color, Tumeric (Color), Dextrose, Paprika (Color) Spices, Natural Flavor. I really liked knowing that all the ingredients in the sauce were things I actually knew what they were! Says on the label it is "All Natural."  60 Calories in 2 T. and fat free.  Love it!!!

review/text: Noh Foods Hawaiian BBQ Sauce is just the best I know of still on the market, both the regular and spicy are excellent.  Lea & Perrins used to make a BBQ sauce that I thought was just as good, but they no longer sell it.  This is now in my opinion the unchallenged BBQ Sauce Champion!  Try it!

review/summary: Tasty Sauce
review/text: This sauce is by far better then most, if not all, you will find in the supermarket.  It's a sweet and tangy sauce, not at all spicy.  It is great with anything from chicken strips to bbq ribs and chicken.  This is the only sauce we will use and since we can't find it anywhere here in Arizona, we stock up on it everytime we go to California (normally available at Stater Bros).  You definitely won't be disappointed.

review/text: Normally, I'm an unflavored Italian Roast girl...I may ADD my flavors, but haven't bought flavored beans at all.  Then, I get a gift of five 1.75 pouches at a going-away party, prompting my first pot of CAMERONS FRENCH VANILLA ALMOND...That was 4 months ago, and I've never looked back.  I literally go thru 5 to 7 pouches a week, and NATCH but Amazon-is-the-way-to-go for getting them.  Amazon's SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE PROGRAM makes keeping it coming, both affordable and convenient. The vacuum sealed pouches smell FRESH FRESH FRESH when you open them, and believe me when I say that this IS the quintessential flavored coffee, absolutely BECAUSE the almond flavor IS subtle, and is not overpowering (it plays a lower note to the Vanilla)...NEITHER flavor interferes with the dark roasted taste, rather they ENHANCE it's richness immeasurably...Thank goodness for Cameron's French Vanilla Almond, a brand name in coffee you may not recognize (yet) but one that packs a quality and flavor punch you cannot forget...Ummmm Rich!

review/summary: Finally, an affordable, delicious green tea powder
review/text: I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.

review/summary: great alternative to bottled green tea
review/text: The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something "healthlier." I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.

review/summary: nice substitute for soda or sugary tea
review/text: I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Very Reasonably Priced and Delicious
review/text: If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for "White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream," "Green Tea Papaya Nectar" and "Green Tea Sugar Cookies." You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: No Flavor - Not Authentic
review/text: I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.<br /><br />I tried to return it to Amazon, but they don't allow grocery items to be returned!

review/text: This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isn't sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry, but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: "Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties." Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well.

review/text: What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />unfortunately by doing that to this flavor, the ginger was out of control, and not in a good ginger tea sort of way.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.

review/summary: Mild taste, easy to mix, will buy again
review/text: I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.

I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity "kool-aid" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price.

review/summary: got me off the diet soda
review/text: I wanted something easy, tasty , and healthy to sub for my diet soda addiction. This did the trick. I drank it for 10 days without adding any sweetener. Once you get past the color, which is a nasty green, the tea is tasty. About a half tsp of sugar really adds to the taste. I will buy this again!

review/summary: YUM....Yum, Yum!!!!
review/text: This is just the quick iced tea fix I have been searching for.....it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural, refreshing blueberry flavor. Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea "add to bottled water" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this "top shelf" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!

review/summary: Best Instant Green Tea Ever
review/text: Drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years. Then they changed production and began using sucralose which I don't tolerate well.<br />Tried several different teas before I found Stash's instant green tea. I like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice. I can drink all I want--don't even need sweetener. Plus as I understand it, it's just made from dried, pulverized green tea leaves--no chemical process. Also it's very coolby I get a discount forn having it delivered by monthly subscription. Phil K.

review/text: I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people.

review/summary: Just had a glass today
review/text: When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said "natural", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong "mint" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)

review/text: This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected.

review/summary: Not bad.  A bit light.
review/text: I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea.

review/summary: Great product - at last!
review/text: LOVE this!  I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment, right?)  The flavor is great, ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!

review/summary: lightly sweetened green iced tea powder
review/text: i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs. i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese. they were sweet and gave us tea from japan. my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it. he smoked all his life and died at 92. anyway, i found when at times i would quit drinking it i wouldn't feel as good as i did when drinking it. i got tired of boiling the water with the teabags and then getting everything in a container to put into the frig. i really drank a lot of it.  well, i stumbled onto a warehouse to pick up some things i had ordered and noticed this tea. i was immediately interested as you get to drink the whole tea leaf which gives you 10 times more antioxidants. wow, that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand. i really love it. i love that it is LIGHTLY SWEETENED, i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler, add ice and water and be on my way. it's just right. but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel. so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being. no getting around about it i don't get sick often for sure. now i haven't tried the other brands and i feel i don't have to because i am so satisfied with this one. the price is also cheaper. i don't think you can go wrong with this choice.  perky

review/summary: Not So Much!
review/text: I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund.

review/summary: Pretty good stuff, with the right sweetener
review/text: This is one of my favorite water add-ins. I think it has a really crisp, clean taste...with a hint of grassy-ness. The tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle, if left standing for more than a few minutes, so I have to shake it up periodically. There are times when I feel like I'm drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower, but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener. It tastes great when I use stevia, but when I use Sweet & Low...I get a bitter-ish grassy taste.

review/summary: Don't bother
review/text: I bought this "flavor" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to "stash" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this.
