review/summary: Love the Earth's Best brand usually, but...
review/text: I agree with a previous reviewer - when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earth's Best choices) they are watery and SWEET.  Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  I've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own).  I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!<br /><br />The Earth's Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isn't the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up).

review/summary: Not a fan of BPA in baby food jar lids
review/text: As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains "trace amounts" of BPA, but it "doesn't come into direct contact with the food."  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing "accelerated testing" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).<br /><br />This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!)

review/summary: We love these dinners, but Amazon price is higher than retail
review/text: My daughter loves these dinners. There's no other organic meat option at my grocery store, so we're stuck with this one, but I don't mind at all. I think they're great. I agree that they are runny, but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal, and problem solved (turkey dinner is thick enough).  I also don't understand why people complain that they are too sweet, or unhealthy. First of all, if you don't like the ingredients, buy something else. Second, I trust Earth's Best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product. Third, the belief that if baby tastes sweet food, they will not eat regular food, is an old wife's tale. Are you people saying that you don't give your babies fruit and vegetables? They are all sweet.<br />The only reason I gave this particular item 4 stars instead of five, is the price. I can buy it at my grocery store for 79 cents a jar. Here, they are being sold for over 91 cents. And that's at the sale price. If you buy these at the regular price, it comes to $1.41. Way too much!

review/summary: Earth's Best variety pack
review/text: Our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack.  We make most of our own baby food, but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult.  Since packing space was limited, we had this shipped to our destination.  It was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack.  The kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good.

review/summary: My baby's favorite flavors!
review/text: My 6-month-old is a fanatic for these flavors!  She gobbles them up and we can't load the spoon fast enough for her!  We introduce new foods every 3 days and we always get the interesting blends as well, so she has tried tons of flavor profiles by this point and these really do get a notable reaction from her.  She goes, "Mmm, mmm," lol.  It's so cute and meats are an easier-to-absorb source of iron compared to artificially-enriched iron that is found in baby cereals.  I definitely prefer this as a compliment to Mommy's milk as oppose to the cereals that are hard for little tummies to digest.

review/text: To be honest, my baby didn't really love all of these at first. He's pretty picky, so I had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them.  He took to the gourmet meals pack right away, but didn't love all of these.  But as he's gotten older, he's gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to bribe him by mixing in fruit.  The prices on Amazon are good, so I will continue to order these here.

review/summary: For almost the same price as Gerber, better quality for your baby
review/text: My baby has been eating this brand since he was 6 months. I like the convenience of high quality/yet not overly pricey jar food like this. It is easy on his stomach. Never had any health issues with it. The "dinners" are a bit more filling than the usual watery vegetable puree but it still does need a little cereal to thicken up. Summer vegetable is his least favorite. The zucchini (like cucumber) smells pretty strong. He would eat it now but when we first started, he hated it. My son loves the other 3 flavors and that's why I continued with my subscription since it's more expensive to buy them separately.

review/text: My 8-month old son is not the picky eater my first was. He had only refused one flavor of all the baby foods introduced to him in 3 months (and it was peas-can't blame him for that one) but he REFUSED to swallow the Rice & Lentil flavor in this variety pack. He actually spit it back out and then blew raspberries (cute, but messy). I tried several times over 2 weeks and got the same response each time. We will not be ordering this pack again even though he loved each of the other meals.

My 9-month-old daughter eats all these flavors and particularly likes the meat flavors.  I've had difficulty getting her to eat other meat foods, so I'm happy to have found two meat meals that she loves.  As with other Earth's Best varieties, these varieties include only organic ingredients without any of those funky preservatives.

review/text: Don't let the "Earth's Best" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here - CHECK THE INGREDIENTS!  No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, "My kids will only eat Earth's Best!" .. Well that's because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly.  They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this.  There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods.  That's just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand.<br /><br />Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water.  That's it.  Don't buy a vegetable that has "applesauce" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it's sweetened.<br /><br />Shame on Earth's Best as a company.  Kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think it's a great product based solely on the name.

review/text: L'olivier olive oil is a one of the best tasting oils I have tried. I look for three things when it comes to a good olive oil 1) Body 2) Flavor 3) Aroma.<br /><br />1) L'olivier has a good body not to thick but not runny or watery at all, on the palette it is buttery and smooth,<br />2) This is a fruity/fresh tasting olive oil rather than and an earthy taste which I think lends well to this oil working well for both cooking and finishing dishes.<br />3) L'olivier has a nice floral aroma - not the strongest around but noticeable. I recommend their green and red tins for infused oils which have aroma to spare.<br /><br />Great olive oil but the crocks are not a good deal, you can get the 2 pack drums on amazon for less which also contain more oil per container.

The packaging from Amazon has no yellow.<br />Looked elsewhere - found several suppliers which still had the old image but the new candy.<br />Are now continuing to buy from this company

review/text: We get this chai for our office and everyone loves it!  We used to buy it at Sam's Club but then couldn't find it so we buy it here by the case and split it up, some for the office, some of us take some home and some of our friends want in on the split.  It's the best Chai, next to Dunkin Donuts, I've tasted!

review/text: My first Chai tea was Tastefully Simple and I loved how rich and creamy it was...but expensive!  I tried Starbucks, but the spice flavor is too strong.  I tried many different places, but still did not like them.  Mystic Chai has the absolute best balance of spice and smooth creamy flavor!!  I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Yummy Tea Ambrosia
review/text: I'm not what I would consider to be a "spiced tea" kind of person.  In fact, until just recently, I've always been more of a simple plain tea drinker (ie. green tea, red tea, Lipton tea, etc).  However, as I was meandering down the aisles of Sam's Club a few weeks ago during their sample hand-outs, I was handed a cup of this strange yet inviting, intoxicating-smelling drink.  Didn't think I would like it, but tried it anyways...  To my surprise, it was not only delicious, but by the next day, I was addicted to it.<br /><br />Everything about this tea is wonderful-- the smell, the taste, just the right amount of sweetness and spices.  Comforting like hot chocolate, yet made with spices you'd find in a pumpkin pie.  More like a frothy elixer than tea.  Delicious.<br /><br />Hopefully, they never stop selling this Chai tea, because I plan to always have some on hand and will be drinking it for the rest of my life.  Hopefully, it is a tradition I can pass down to my child, and eventually to her children.

review/text: This is a very good Chai and I drink some every day, but I prefer a Chai with a bit more spice, such as Trader Joe's chai.  Unfortunately Trader Joe's has discontinued it!  The Mystic Chai tastes about the same to me as the Target brand Market Pantry chai, and between the two I'd pick Mystic since the price per serving is lower.

review/summary: Dreamfields pasta
review/text: I love this product line.  I have been on a low carb diet for 5 years and never found an acceptable low carb pasta until I discovered the Dreamfield's line.  These pastas look and taste exactly like regular pasta but do not release the large amounts of starches and spike your blood sugar as do regular pastas. I have used nearly every type of Dreamfield's pasta and have found them all to be excellent.  I have served them to guests without telling them it was low carb and they couldn't tell the difference.  You MUST cook the pasta exactly as the package directs and no longer.  If you reheat the pasta it will lose the low carb effect.  As with all pasta products, the longer and softer you cook the pasta the more carbs and starches the pasta will release.  I only make as much as I will eat when it is first made and I even cook it a minute or two less than the package says. You must also watch your portion size as with any food.  While I am not diabetic I can certainly see how this would be a huge benefit to anyone who is.  My only complaint is that the full product line is not carried by my local supermarkets.  I usually can find only the spaghetti, elbos, and penne locally but have to mail order the other shapes.  The price is a little higher than some other pastas but is well worth it for the health benefits.

review/summary: My favorite canned Tomato soup!
review/text: This soup rocks my tastebuds. I love cream of tomato soup (though I don't necessarily love the high salt of some and the high fat of others). This soup is lighter in salt (but could go lighter, if you ask me) and very high in sweet, satisfying tomato flavor. For those of us/you who love the comfort food power of a good creamy, tomato-ey soup, this one gives you that with organic ingredients, less salt, and has only 2 WW points per serving (4 WW points, about 200 calories, for the whole can). With some whole grain toast with melted lowfat cheese all gooey in the middle, it's a primo comfort food lunch/supper.<br /><br />I had some of this soup last night for supper with penne pasta tossed in and some parmesan on top and it was sublime.<br /><br />Better than Campbells and the other tomato soups I've had from cans. Amy's makes some wretched frozen entrees, but this soup they get right. Thumbs up.<br /><br />Mir

review/text: This is a great soup.  I had tried and liked their full sodium version and really don't taste any difference.  Of course, it is still a lot of sodium, but less than most tomato soups.  It is also quite low calorie at 200 calories per can. It has a very strong, pure, tomato taste.  I don't really taste the cream.  It actually tastes much like marinara sauce.  It would serve as a lovely base for chili or even pasta sauces.  But, I eat it "as is" at work for an affordable and low caloried lunch that fills me up!  I am on subscription for this because it is so good. I like it best of all the canned soups at any calorie or sodium level, so it is great that it is almost healthy!

But this is pure yummy, healthy goodness in a can! The only real downside is that it is a bit expensive, but I'll take that over cheap "tomato soup" any day. This "light in sodium" version is already ridiculously tasty, so I'm not sure what more I'd get out of the regular version, other than excess salt. :)<br /><br />I've kinda liked tomato soup in the past, but whatever Amy's put in there has made me simply love it. This stuff is thick and tasty just on its own, or with minimal additives. I like to just add a dash of black pepper myself.

review/text: Honestly, I was really, really looking forward to trying this.  I ate this expecting great things from the reviews, and it honestly just has the flavor of untouched tomato puree you get in a can at the grocery store.  It has no flavor, it's tinny, as if it sat too long in the can, and is way too acidic.  I've made tomato soup at home with regular puree, garlic powder, onion powder, pureed fat free cottage cheese, paprika, a little vegan vegetable broth, and some other spices and it was WAY better than this.  Also with way less sodium than this "reduced sodium" option.  Not good.  I don't understand how it gets such high reviews.

review/summary: My Picky Dog LOVES WeRuVa!
review/text: After I adopted my dog we purchased about 10 different brands of canned and dry dog food over the course of 6 months (e.g. Nature's Balance, Merrick, Nature's Variety, Tripette, Royal Canin, Acana, Orijen, etc.)  Every product was a high-quality brand similiar in price to WeRuVa, but my dog would turn his nose to all of them.  At one point he starved himself for over 3 days and would only eat grass or treats.<br /><br />I told a local pet store clerk about how I had to start making homemade dog food because he would only eat "real" meat and none of the products we tried looked real.  He asked if I had tried giving him WeRuVa because the meat looks like real human quality meat.  He popped open a can and my dog inhaled all of it, licking the can totally clean.  I bought a few more cans to try out at home and sure enough, he LOVED it.  He's been eating WeRuVa for over a month and it's the first time I've ever seen him get excited when I open a can to pour in his bowl.<br /><br />Also, his fur is becoming shinier and it doesn't upset his very sensitive stomach.  I'm so happy to see him excited for food that is good for him.  They have a great selection of flavors, which is nice for variety.  Another nice perk is that the food looks and smells pretty good too. The paw-lickin' chicken flavor smells just like chicken noodle soup, which is nice because some of the brands we tried smelled awful and didn't resemble anything close to real meat.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater or just want to treat your dog to some great high-quality food, try WeRuVa!

It didn't seem fair not to get the dog good food too.

review/summary: Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken
review/text: Our dog loves this food. He barks for it. We mix a fork load with his dry food. It's gravy and strips of real chicken.<br />The shipping was free and fast from Amazon. Highly recommend it. You get what you pay for. I know Boomer, our Bishon,  recommends it.<br /> Will buy this again at Amazon.

review/summary: Looks, smells and probably tastes like real chicken!
review/text: We've recently been sampling a variety of canned dog foods for our one senior + two puppies, and this was one of the brands that stood out to us. The food looks like fresh shredded chicken, doesn't have a strong odor, and has a clear gravy to keep the chicken hydrated (as well as add nutrients to make it a more complete meal). My senior chihuahua / pom who was on dry dog food for a long time loves this food, and it makes his coat very shiny and healthy (he used to have dry skin). It says it's made in a human grade facility (plus!), but is also made in Thailand, so not sure how to balance the risk of unwanted chemicals making it into the food - haven't seen any warnings about this brand before.<br /><br />The only issue for us is our senior has slightly sensitive digestion, so it takes him longer to breakdown chicken like this, we can't feed him too much at a time or else it comes back up. If you have a dog with sensitive digestion, it may just be a thing to look out for - as always with dog food, probably safer to get one can from your specialty pet store first before getting 12 cans.

review/summary: Possible Problem
review/text: We purchased this food for our two year old Cockapoo as she has allergies.  After three weeks she became extremely sick, liver enzymes were five times normal range, had to be hospitalized with IV's and medicines.  There is nothing else that we can think of that she came in contact with during that time frame that would have caused this problem.  Fortunately we have excellent vets who got her back to good health again.  This is just a caution, so watch your dogs when switching foods and feeding this one.

review/text: A good year-round or hot weather product! I like cold-brewing this tea with 3 teabags in a 2-quart pitcher for 6 to 8 hours. It's relatively strong, robust, and undistinguished, but it's also not expensive and "wears well" with repeated uses. Please do not consider Lipton's so-called Cold Brew; that one's basically dust that ends with a bitter, almost undrinkable outcome. This is the way to go!

I saw this Community Coffee guatemalan that had 15% off and another $3 coupon off, so i said what the heck i'll give it a shot.  Not nearly as good as Starbucks and not even close to Kirkland's.

review/text: We had first tried the Salish Alderwood Smoked Sea Salt and REALLY liked it. Based on reviews I decided to try this one as well. In our opinion they are both great but I would have to say at this point the Alderwood remains my favorite but I'm sure that is just due to personal taste.<br />I use these salts on just about anything you can imagine. I put it in soups, on salads, on vegetables and without question meat.<br />My husband travels so I eat alone a lot. I can take some chicken breast meat or a few pieces of shrimp toss it in a small skillet and sprinkle a little of this salt on it and it's just about as good as having it grilled.<br />Definitely worth trying!

review/summary: Great Smoked Salt
review/text: This is a great smoked salt, naturally smoked over oak Chardonnay wine barrels.  This is the third variety of Artisan smoked salt I have purchased and all have been exquisite.  I use this salt as a gourmet table salt that has really positively complimented every dish I have tried it with.  I tried a different brand in the past that appeared to be made with liquid smoke (trashed it).  That is definitely not the case with this salt.  I highly recommend this Artisan salt.

review/text: When someone told me about smoked salt, it sounded nuts.  Then I read about it in my favorite cooking blog, the author had thought it sounded nuts also, until he tried it.  So I gave it a shot, and absolutely love it. I have shared some with friends who are also very pleased with it.  One friend told me that she likes to open the lid just to get a whiff of it... now I do too.<br /><br />The grains are a bit large for me when I use it on steak or veggies, so I put a bit of it in a salt grinder that I have used when sprinkling it on meat or grilled asparagus.<br /><br />I read about many varieties of smoked salt, and this sounded the best to me.  I am sure I will try others.

Don't hesitate to buy this, you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I like keeping canned fruit around because gelatin salads with fruit are a great almost-last-minute food to take along or serve unexpected guests. These worked fine (I saved the drained juice and nuked it to dissolve the gelatin in) and the couple I "liberated" from the can (just to test for quality, you understand) tasted fine also. I won't need more for a while but I wouldn't mind buying them again.

review/text: I was not pleased by the flavor of these black cherries.  They were not sweet nor were they tart..... just 'blahhhh'.  It was probably because I ate them staight out of the can as a desert instead of making a pie or pouring them on ice cream.  If I decided to use them for the later two treatments, I would buy them again but not as a desert in and of themselves.  They were OK but that is the highest rating I feel they deserve even though they were firm, not mushy, and tasted like cherries...just blahhhh.
