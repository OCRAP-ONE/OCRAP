review/summary: Favorite snack chip
review/text: Tried these the first time a few months ago, and I was hooked! I have purchased two cases within the last 2 months, and shared them with my family. The last case I just bought is gone, and I am ready to buy another case.  Only problem is, the price for the sea salt (my favorite) increased within the last week, which is disappointing.  I am wondering why the other flavors are the exact price that I paid for but the sea salt is higher???  I am hoping this will change so I can buy them soon.

review/summary: Just what the doctor ordered!
review/text: After purchasing different brands of pills and treats containing glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, I stumbled upon this brand. Initialy, I purchased their "chews". A short time later they discontinued the chews so I began purchasing the biscuits instead. They both contained much higher amounts of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in comparison to other brands and my dog absolutely loves them. I no longer have to come up with creative ways to get her to take her medicine. I give her 3 biscuits a day each as a treat following her morning, afternoon and evening walks. I have to say that this is the ONLY product which has helped with her hip dysplasia. She no longer has audible clicks when she walks. I am disapointed that the company has discontinued the "chews" because they had higher levels of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in them but am thankful they still carry the biscuits. This is a MUST have for my dog. The only thing keeping me from giving this product 5 stars is it is not as potent as the chews. Please bring them back!

review/text: My Golden LOVES these! Although they are (my opinion) a little pricey I believe them to be a good investment. They are a hard biscuit so they help with keep his teeth clean and also they have glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in them which is good for his joints. I can't find them anywhere locally so I have to order online. I haven't found a lot of difference in the actual cost of the product but I've found Amazon gives me the best rate on the shipping and overall is the best deal.

Also, they are next to impossible to find in a pet supply store, and if you can locate them, it is always at an inflated price. I have purchased around thirty bags of this product, I would love to receive a bag gratis to disburse to my friends!<br /><br />Regards, Murray Selarz

review/text: This coffee is so great that I have had little fantasies of getting a cup, lying in bed, pouring the beans all over me and tossing them in the air so I can get more of the aroma.  If you are a cherry lover, this is the thing for you.  I may have to visit Traverse City in one of their 4 weeks of summer just to get a taste of the place that creates such juicy tantalizing visions and tastes.

review/summary: great, powerful flavor
review/text: Although I am a fan of flavored coffees, I have no special taste for 'cherry' as a flavor.  I tried this flavor once and was hooked:  very aromatic (I might buy it just to set the aroma free in my kitchen once in a while) and rich tasting.  It is so strong in flavor that you can cut down the amount you use... if you must!  It has replaced irish creme as my favorite flavor.  I haven't seen it anywhere other than from Paramount in Michigan, and Traverse City certainly is the cherry capital of the US.

review/summary: I really wanted to like it
review/text: I love cherries and cherry flavored things. I love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Q44M3C">Paramount Coffee Blueberry Muffin, Ground, 12-Ounce (Pack of 2)</a> and drink it nearly daily. Given those two things, I ordered the Traverse City Cherry coffee, thinking I'd be just as pleased, if not more. Boy, was I disappointed.<br /><br />I eagerly awaited the delivery and opened the package as soon as I got it into the kitchen. I opened one of the bags and was hit with a waft of artificial cherry scent. It reminded me of cherry licorice, mixed with coffee. Very unpleasant.<br /><br />I let it sit for a day or two, thinking it might mellow with exposure to a little air. Also, I was honestly apprehensive about trying it after the first whiff. I just made a cup, using my Keurig brewer and an Ekobrew reusable K-cup, so I know the brewer wasn't the problem. My 5 year old daughter came into the kitchen, asking for licorice, because she could smell it. I had to tell her it was my coffee. I gingerly tasted it and it was actually worse than it smelled. It was a mix of cherry licorice and cough syrup. I added sugar, as I usually take my coffee with both sugar and cream. The sugar didn't help. I stopped short of adding the cream, convinced that it would make no difference in the hideously bitter, odd tasting coffee that I'd had such high hopes for.<br /><br />I'm thoroughly disappointed, particularly because Amazon does not offer refunds on grocery items. I'm now stuck with three full bags of coffee that I won't drink, two of which are unopened. I'll stick to the Blueberry Muffin flavor from now on, which I recommend without reservation.

I think this Kona is probably my favorite.  The only downside is<br />for some reason I tend to get heartburn when I drink this coffee.  That is the<br />reason for only 4 stars.  I still like it, I just have to take an antacid<br />before I drink it.  I highly recommend the CBTL system to anyone who wants<br />a single serve machine. This one wins hands down over Keurig.  The only<br />problem is now I drink more coffee than before because it is so good!

review/summary: Fine Basic Orange Tea
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orange-y teas.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as "tart, sweet, smooth, licorice". Tazo describes the aroma as "oranges, roses, lime". This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.<br />****

review/summary: Blend with Tazo Lotus Tea
review/text: This is the story of two Tazo teas. I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality.<br /><br />I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer.<br /><br />The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea.<br /><br />Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root.<br /><br />I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents. The boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful.<br /><br />A romantic tea with a golden-orange color. I can never decide if I like this best hot or cold, so I end up drinking it hot and cold. Half on ice and half in a mug. When this tea is hot, it is much more romantic and aromatic. When chilled it takes on a more bitter component.<br /><br />For something even more exotic, try the Tazo Green Ginger tea. That was the first Tazo tea I tasted and so far I can't think of a Tazo tea I don't love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Best Gluten Free I've Taste So Far
review/text: I've been searching for a great gluten free bread for the last two years. No luck. An associate at Trader Joes told me that this bread was probably the best Gluten Free in the store. I tried it. It was small slices and hard. I put the slices in the microwave for 19 seconds. After I took it out, the bread felt super soft. I made a turkey sandwhich and the bread tatse like regular bread nearly. I was so shocked at how amazing the bread taste.<br /><br />I will continue to buy but keep looking for the perfect gluten free bread. If the slices were a little bigger and I did not have to heat the bread before using, this would be the perfect bread.

I love that it is light and there are air pockets and it actually gets crispy in the toaster.  I don't know how they did this - I've been playing with gluten free recipes for about 6 years & haven't come close, but for me, this is the perfect bread.  At my grocery store, it's $5 for a loaf in the freezer section.  I'm the only one in my family that eats gluten free so it's fine.

review/text: I bought the bread knowing it was way too expensive,($24.99) but since there are no stores close enough for me to buy it here, I bought it through Amazon from "Linda's Diet Delites". The bread was not soft as other reviewers have stated, but I thought it was to be expected as other brands I have purchased were a good deal harder. So I toasted it. I crossed my fingers and was pleasantly surprised, unlike the other brands, it tasted good.  The problem was, I opened the bread and made a sandwich but when I opened the bread three days later, it had spoiled. I'm not talking a little spoiled, the loaf was entirely green!!  I have never bought any product in my entire life that did this.  I threw it in the trash and the other one that I had froze. Needless to say I won't be buying this again.

review/text: In general, I'm usually poor, so I never bought Lindt's Lindor Truffles (White chocolate with a smooth filling) before.<br /><br />I ended up getting small 5.1oz bag the other day and it was a big mistake!<br />I'll never again be able to really enjoy the gritty cheap white chocolate I usually end up getting.<br /><br />White chocolate has always been my favorite... and now I found out just how good white chocolate actually is.<br /><br />I'm looking at this cheap-o white chocolate easter bunny sitting on my counter knowing that it will be nowhere near the yummy smooth goodness that is the Lindor.<br /><br />I'm restricting myself to one a day trying to stretch out what I have :)<br /><br />Tony!

review/summary: Ginger candy - yum!
review/text: I am a ginger fanatic and this is the best candy I have found. Soft, chewy, full of great ginger flavor and 'heat'! And the packaging is the best. With other brands I have tried, while they have been very flavorful, it was difficult to unwrap them without playing tug of war with the wrapping. These are wrapped in powdered parchment and then an outer wrapper, easy to remove and pop in your mouth. And the Amazon 5-pack price cannot be beat. I paid over twice this price in a local health food store. Stock up - they have a long shelf life!

review/text: After going to a Bobby Flay restaurant, I decided to buy the sauces as a Christmas present. It's not quite the same as the sauce you get in the restaurant but it's very close. I was expecting more of a smokey flavor but it's more like cocktail sauce. It's tangy and delicious on steak.

I needed to drink something with caffeine first thing in the morning to help wake me up but I did not drink coffee.  Someone told me about the Maxwell House International Cappuccino and so I thought I would give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did !  The cinnamon dulce cappucinno is awesome !  I start out the day with one cup of this cinnamon, frothy drink and I love it !  I am so glad I gave up diet coke !

review/summary: Appears to be processed salt
review/text: I inquired with the seller if this salt was unprocessed sea salt and they had no clue.  I was very disappointed but should have known it was processed by the whiteness of the product. Unprocessed sea salt retains all the natural occuring minerals from the sea which is why it appears speckled and beige (gray if Celtic). However when it get processed those sea minerals that gives it that speckling effect are stripped away making it no different than the mineral empty table salt you find on most grocer shelves for 30 cents.

review/summary: If your looking health benefits, this is A-plus
review/text: I'm back again, to buy this unrefined Sea Salt, Barry Farm---after finding that this unrefined sea salt is the only one of Four, including 2 known name-brands, that has benefited my family's health! One of the biggest benefits for my family, lowering high blood-sugar counts. If that hits home with you and your needs, look into Googling--The Sea Salt Diet and chat with your doctor. God bless you. I hope you see health benefits, too. Note: you must have true "unrefined" sea salt. There are shams with no shame, out there. Many retailers claim that their product is better as the "true unrefined" sea salts because they are colored "gray/grey." I fell for that. My health benefits steadily dimmed. Their assertion is only an empty advertiser's tagline. I've paid dearly for another brand's high-priced unrefined salt and saw my family's health benefits favorably respond. My wallet/purse says buy from Barry Farms....my wallet/purse likes the extra bucks that stay behind. As for shipping...we received this product well packaged to survive whatever the Shipper-process put its box through. Great!

review/summary: Mood Enhancing Lemonade!
review/text: The Lemon Lotus is a wonderful product. Absolutely delicious, it's like drinking a glass of sweet lemonade with an ever so slight hint of the x50 Blue Lotus extract flavor (which I also love).<br /><br />I like how they switched from the shots to the powder. It dissolves easily when steeped and stirred into hot water (or when funneled into a water bottle and shook). I prefer this for 2 reasons.<br />One, the shots where just that, shots. As a powder I can enjoy a whole glass of it!<br />Two, I can more easily control the dose -- stronger when I'm in a bad mood, or weaker if I just want a nice refreshing drink.<br /><br />As for its effects, I would say overall, it subtly puts me into a calmer, more talkative and generally happier mood.<br /><br />Overall, I really love this product and will definitely buy more as needed. Was shipped and arrived very quickly and Mood & Mind have always been more than happy to answer any questions I have about their products.<br />Highly recommended, 5/5!!!

This company has always had super fast delivery and has answered any questions I've had quickly and thoroughly.  Couldn't be happier (and that's not just the lotus talking) :)

review/summary: Lemon Lotusade? Lemonotusade? Whatever you call it, it's great!
review/text: In the time since I first discovered blue lotus, I've tried several conventional and a few unconventional methods to to consume it. The first time I got the powder, I just sort of grabbed a handful and dumped it into my mouth. That did not go well.<br /><br />Next I tried dumping a few tablespoons into yogurt and then eating it. That also did not go well.<br /><br />I tried buying the plant itself and burning it, steeping it in hot water, and even tossing it into a salad, but overall, my favorite method was making a tea out of the powder.<br /><br />Or so I thought. I decided to try the mood drink despite my apprehensions, and boy am I glad I did! When I got it, I opted to have two servings at once, since I'm what you might call a tall drink of water (or lemon lotus drink, as the case may be), and after making the drink and seeing how easily it dissolved , I resisted my urge to pinch my nose and down it in one.<br /><br />It tasted GOOD! And I don't mean the sort of "good" where you grimace and rasp "H-hey, this is *cough* kind of good!", I mean good like a nice glass of lemonade, with a hint of blue lotus. There was no annoying grit (the biggest problem I have when I make tea, but that's my fault) and it had a nice effect that wasn't too overbearing. Yet another highly enjoyable experience from a company that actually cares about the quality of their merchandise.<br /><br />BONUS RECIPE: Lemon Lotus Piledriver<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1-4 servings of Lemon Lotus Mood Drink<br />1 bottle of Perrier or something similar<br />1-4 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />Vodka (Citrus works well, but plain is fine too)<br />2 pinches of lemon salt<br />Ice<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix lemon lotus powder with room temp vodka, mix until drink powder is thoroughly dissolved.<br />Add in Perrier and lemon juice, put into shaker with ice and shake vigorously.<br />Pour into highball glass, garnish with lemon wedges or lotus ice cubes and serve.<br /><br />PS: Check out my blog for more recipes and such!

review/text: 50:1 lemon lotus 4 pack shots (first time user) Item was mind altering but not as powerfull as expected, started with one shot early in the day and recieved mild effects felt sort of like an alcohol buzz, later in the day i had another shot and had the same effects as b4 drank a can of beer and another shot trying to get more out of the lotus within the hour i did not feel much of a change,had a 3rd shot and no change 45 minutes later i was sober. problem could be because i didnt use right, was left wondering if maby you can only get so much effect out of product similar to kratom (you can only get so high with kratom after that you get sick and misureable) then thought maby i was suposed to take all 4 shots at once for the great feeling and phychoactive or hipnotic effect who knows it was fun anyway. After i do more research on using lotus i will most likely buy this product again and give it another run.<br />  Please do not let my story discourage you from buying and trying this product. my intent was to get the message across if you dont know how to use this product learn about it first then try it out, that way the seller doesnt get blamed for your poor results

review/text: *****<br />St. Dalfour's Certified Organic Earl Grey Tea is made from hand-picked, organic Ceylon tea. It is enhanced by "the all natural flavor or bergamot orange", which added interest and made my tea experience delightful. The orange flavor was subtle, not overwhelming at all. I left the tea bag in as I drank the tea (the whole time, much longer than recommended), which turns most teas bitter, but not this one.<br /><br />St. Dalfour is a French firm that makes natural teas, including this organic tea. There is not a lot of information about them on their web site beyond the basics, but what is there looks good.<br /><br />Earl Grey teas are one of my favorite black teas, so if you are a fan also, this tea is one not to miss. Note that black tea does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

The raw flavor is lighter, more friendly and just tastes smoother on the tongue to me. With any carob powder know that it gets everywhere when measuring it so just be extra careful and gentle with it and you'll be okay. If you like carob powder try this version!

review/text: I've never had "raw" carob powder before, so I thought I would try this out. It's not bad. Since it is not roasted, it has a very mild flavor, and is less chocolate-like than the roasted Carob. So if you use Carob as a chocolate-substitute, you would probably find that this product is not what you want. But if you can appreciate Carob as a separate individual food, then it's worth a try. I thought the price was a bit high, though.

review/summary: Same taste as cocoa
review/text: Great product, perfect substitute for chocolate, same taste without the side effects of caffeine, oxalic acid, and theobromine. Carob, also known as St. John's bread, algarroba, locust bean, and locust pod, is a healthful substitute for chocolate. The slightly sweet powder is relatively low in calories, and it is thought to be a good source of potassium.<br />Carob does not contain cholesterol, caffeine, theobromine, and oxalic acid, as chocolate does. Its natural sweetness also reduces the need for big doses of additional calorie-laden sweeteners, as are found in most products made from naturally-bitter chocolate.

I made him brownies using this and they turned out to be the best brownies I had ever had.  Everyone liked them so much that I now have requests to make them for birthdays.  If you have never had carob, this is the one to try.  Wonderful flavor and since it is raw it better for you.

review/summary: Like a box of chocolates...
review/text: The first order was great.  It came as a fine dark brown powder that smelled and tasted like Carob.  The second order was very granular and more of a blackish brown and neither smelled nor tasted like carob - it was pretty nasty.  If you're feeling lucky, then I highly suggest ordering this.  Just realize that... you never know what you're going to get.

review/summary: Sometimes Nice Carob Powder
review/text: I'm amending my review to SOMETIMES: it has a very rich,sweet flavor.  Great in smoothies and for making candies.  It costs a little more than others, but the flavor makes it worth the additional cost and it is a staple in my kitchen.  For something great, mix with tahini, a little honey and a little olive oil, adjust ingredients for taste and texture - delicious!<br /><br />The LAST time I ordered, it was a totally different product, grey and tasteless and a great disappointment.  Called the company and they said that the batches vary....

review/text: This is the best carob product I have found. One of my favorite recipes that I use carob powder for is a shake consisting of soymilk, frozen banana and carob powder. This carob has a milder flavor and I find this makes the best shakes. I have used it as a chocolate substitute in other recipes and prefer the taste and texture of this product to the roasted carob products.

review/text: Five stars for the sugar itself. It can be substituted 1:1 for "regular" sugar. Some other organic sugars have a higher moisture content which can cause problems when baking. It's not cost effective buying the case of 1 lb bags, however, even compared to the big "natural" food grocery chains. Why doesn't Amazon sell cases of the 4 lb or 10 lb bags, with their lower price per pound?

review/summary: Excellent sugar at a good price (although could be more affordable)
review/text: The sugar is excellent. It is just a touch more brown than pure-white sugar, and the texture is a little on the coarse side (the grains are a bit larger). However, the sugar still dissolves and mixes just as well as regular sugar when baking or sweetening my coffee. Honestly cannot complain about the product itself.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the box comes with 12 small 1 lb. bags. This is quite surprising as I've seen other retailers selling a 4 lb. version (so aside from real bulk orders (>25 lbs) a larger size does exist). Nevertheless, when it comes to price, Amazon.com still seems to do just fine, in my opinion. I've never seen a grocery store carry a 1 lb. bag of this sugar for less than $4 (and you'd be lucky to even find it at that price). Obviously, with Subscribe and Save, you're getting a bag for about $2.50. Outlets that I've seen carrying the 4 lb. version are usually selling those anywhere from $8 to $9 each. So yes, Amazon.com could be doing a touch better, and when it comes to selling 12 tiny bags of sugar as opposed to 3 decently sized bags, obviously Amazon.com has some work to do.

It has a slightly "caramelier" and lighter flavor than regular refined sugar and is just delicious in coffee, tea or for baking in a 1:1 ratio.  I love this product and will buy Wholesome Sweetners brand exclusively for ever and ever. I have tried three of their products now and stand behind them as a consumer.  Whohoo!  Love this stuff!!!

review/text: I don't use a lot of granulated sugar but when I do, this is the brand I buy. Like other reviewers mentioned you can sometimes catch the 10lb size at Costco for much less (membership factors in cost too) but prices change here and often times you can find it priced fairly reasonably.<br /><br />My most recent use for this sugar was for fresh lime-aid and soy milk ice cream; in both cases the sugar melts/blends well without excessive stirring and no settling on the bottom with the beverage and no graininess in the ice cream.<br /><br />I like the fair trade aspect - a small, sweet way to help.

review/text: When I learned that most sugar is refined and filtered with animal bones I started looking for natural, organic sugar. I've dived into the bins at Whole Foods, New Seasons and other natural food stores. But Wholesome makes better sugar than the bulk bins and, although I see more expensive varieties beckoning from the shelves that they are better (and probably are), Wholesome is good for the price. It doesn't clump. It dissolves nicely. And, best of all, it makes my baked goods have the perfect amount of sweetness.

review/text: I have been purchasing several varieties of this brand of sugar for sometime, but I have found the powdered sugar product less and less acceptable.  It clumps.  This requires the extra step of sifting the sugar, several times and then throwing quite a bit out.  I am just tired of having a lumpy finish to my frostings, especially after all the extra effort I seem to be going through.  Until they can provide a more consistent product I guess I am going back to Dixie Crystal.  Bummer.

review/text: Here's the trick to softening - and then keeping soft - brown sugar.  Get a container that you can seal well.  Then purchase a terra cotta brown sugar disk: Brown Sugar Disc - Various, Eagle, Cat<br /><br />First, soak the terra cotta disk as directed.  If the brown sugar is so hard you can't get it in the container, then put the soaked disk into the packagine.  Otherwise, put sugar into the container, add the soaked disk and seal.  The next day your sugar will be soft.<br /><br />I have one of these disks.  One time I forgot to seal my container and the brown sugar dried out.  I re-soaked my terra cotta disk, added it back to the container and the next day it was all softened.<br /><br />I love wholesome sweeteners sugars and buying it off Amazon (especially if you have Amazon Prime) is a good deal.

It's richly flavored, its texture is delicate and tender, and best of all, it's organic. No nasty chemicals! That alone would make it worth it. It's great for baking or eating straight (strawberries dipped in sour cream and then brown sugar... I'm drooling just thinking about it). It's the only brown sugar I've used in the last two years and I'll continue doing so.

review/summary: Great brown sugar, better for people and the environment
review/text: I am glad I found this product on Amazon.  The box of six packages of brown sugar were very fresh, not hard as some store brands that sit on a shelf for eons.  The sugar itself is of great quality and tastes fantastic.  My wife loves it in bowls of cream of wheat (wheat farina).  The whole family uses it for baking.  My primary reason for liking this brand is I know the company helps the farmers who produce it, and it is produced in a manner that is less harmful to the environment.  Part of any products value is not just the product itself but also in knowing how it is made and being sure of the products claims, in this case the sugar is certified as USDA Organic, and it is Fair Trade certified.
