review/summary: My Favorite Tea
review/text: Wonderful tea. I think most of the reviewers who hated it already had their own favorite vanilla-nut tea and found this tea different from what they expected?<br /><br />I usually dislike Stash Teas, but this flavor is just so pleasant and homey. Add some sugar and milk and it's a real treat. I agree with the reviewer who found it reminiscent of hot cocoa. It does have a tiny chemical smell, or maybe that's the vanilla. I have a poor sense of smell. It's a very cozy winter tea, but I like it too much to not have it all year 'round.

review/summary: Didn't last long...
review/text: My grandmother used to make homemade chocolate walnut fudge, and it was delicious.  I recently had a craving for it but grandma was otherwise occupied, so I bought this, but wasn't really expecting it to be as good as homemade.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This is very good fudge--not perfect, but irresistible nonetheless and the two of us ate the entire package in less than a week!  The flavors with walnuts/pecans aren't chock-full but have enough pieces, of large enough size, to get a good taste in every bite.  The maple and vanilla are both very sweet but I also thought they were the best of the bunch--rich, sweet, creamy, and the maple flavor was excellent. The vanilla flavor didn't come through quite as strong, it tasted more like generic "white" chocolate/fudge, but was delicious.  The chocolate was good, but not remarkable.  I would say it was worth the money, but not the best I have had.  The peanut butter had a good peanut butter flavor and was extremely rich--something about the flavor seems a little bit off, and this was definitely my least favorite of the bunch, but with that being said we still finished it off and overall were pleased with the purchase.  If you are buying it with your heart set on the peanut butter, I might look elsewhere.  Otherwise, I would recommend.  I would feel good about giving this as a gift as well to someone who enjoys rich, sweet candy.

review/summary: Veggies, veggies, and more veggies.
review/text: I love vegetables.  But, I hate buying cans of one "specific" vegetable since I like so many vegetables.  Interestingly (in my area, anyway), if you bought a similar-sized can of every single vegetable in Del Monte Mixed Vegetables and divided the costs by the number of cans, the mixed vegetables would be cheaper.  So why settle for one vegetable when you can have several - especially since variety is cheaper???

review/text: I expected a milder version of earl grey but it really isn't.  The flavor is very mild and if you up amount to make it stronger it only really gets bitter.  I'm not an aficionado of tea so maybe those with a more discerning pallet will appreciate it more.

review/text: It's quick.  It's really easy to make.  If you're starving, it works well in a pinch.  You can obey the simple package directions of boiling for a few minutes then adding the flavor packet, or do what I do.  I like to boil it & drain it, then add many different ingredients to make an actually filling meal.<br /><br />It's a bit bland, but what do you expect for under 25 cents a package?  A great value for the money.

review/summary: ramen: the duct tape of the food world!
review/text: There's nothing you can't do with ramen. It makes a pretty good soup. You can remove the flavoring packet and use it in casseroles or on top of pizza. Ants like it, too. The noodles can be used in a seemingly infinite number of dishes--three ramen casserole, for example. It's great camping, dorm, or space food. The noodles can even be crunched up and used as a faux buckwheat pilliow. Ramen makes a very good loofah, although be advised it's for single use only.

review/summary: Maruchan makes the best ramen noodle
review/text: Ramen noodles are great for families on a budget. Leave the water in and you have a large bowl of filling soup for around twenty cents, drain the water and you have flavored noodles. Pair two packs with mixed stir fry veggies and some cut up chicken or beef and you have a meal for four that costs a little over a dollar per person. There is a good ramen noodle recipe book on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883385148">The Book of Ramen : Lowcost Gourmet Meals Using Instant Ramen Noodles</a> but I have found that most of my best ramen noodle recipes are ones I created making mock ups of favorite foods like beef stroganoff, lo mein, tuna noodle casserole, etc.

review/text: First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!

review/summary: Cinnamon Spice
review/text: I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words "Super Dieters" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it.

As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.

It is very close the taste I have been looking for.  When I first ground the coffee in an old grinder it did not taste the best, not bad but.... I bought a new coffee grinder and ground it supper fine and BOY what a difference that made!

review/summary: Primo Kona blend
review/text: Magnum is one of the best tasting Kona blends I've had (and I've tried a few!). The medium roast is close to perfection and delivers a smooth tasting brew that makes me think I'm drinking 100 percent Kona at times. You really can't go wrong with this coffee.

review/summary: In between it's ok and I like it
review/text: I use a conical burr grinder to grind the beans. And  I've used the right temperature for my tastes. To get an idea f what that is, I find Starbucks STORE coffee to be on the bitter side.  Starbucks made at home is very good because I probably am using a slightly lower temperature than them. Depending on the bean, I vary the temperature and soak time just a little till I settle on what is best for me and for that bean. My favourite seems to be their house blend. I look for medium to dark roasts. These beans seem to be medium or a notch below perhaps. So with that background, I'd say these seemed ok to me. The first taste had me go "Huh.. different. Not bad. But I'm not loving it yet". I've finished the whole bag now and I can say I did get used to the slightly different taste. Pleasant. But not great IMO. And if it's your cup. Another thing I want to mention is that I had to use a greater quantity of beans to get it to taste ok. So for a single serve, I'd have to use an extra teaspoon of (unground) beans. While the bag is bigger than the standard sizes (I think), it prob does not matter that much as I had to use more beans.<br /><br />YMMV.

review/text: I received the coffee beans two days ago, and have made several pots. It has a smooth taste with no bite, and is one of my wife's favorite brews.<br /><br />It has a mellow taste, with low acidity and great body. I normally chose a darker, stronger blend for myself, but this is a very good coffee with which to start the day. And, the delivery was fast.

review/summary: Decent Kona for a great price
review/text: This is a great Kona blend for a great price.  It's definitely not top-grade, as there are better, more expensive Kona blend coffees available.  This Magnum Kona is bold, with very little bitterness and a hint of the signature Kona aroma.  However, it's not as flavorful as the higher quality blends; the more expensive ones have a stronger fruity aroma that I look for in Kona.  If you're looking for Kona coffee without paying exorbitant prices, this is the one for you.  Combine it with another order from Amazon and get the free shipping for a great deal.

review/summary: Okay kona coffee
review/text: I saw the beans on sale at Busch's and grabbed it.  It was a little different than what i had expected since I've been having Millstone Kona Blend up to this point.  Compared to the Millstone, the color of this coffee looks darker and it tastes slightly more bitter as well.  I did not detect a strong fresh coffee aroma once it's brewed. But it does inherit the characteristic mellow and smooth feeling of Kona beans. Btw, I brew with a Biatelli stovetop espresso maker which makes just about 1 mug of coffee.  Overall, i think it's an okay coffee, probably not the best, but not the worst either, just feels a little plain in terms of kona beans. The bean itself has an oily shine to it and smells good. I remember the Millstone beans had no shine but it was light roasted while this one is medium-dark roast.  I think I would go back to Millstone or try something else with more Kona.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I'll confess knowing little about different coffees. However,  compared to the standard off-the-shelf fare we'd grown accustomed to over the years, this is a noticeable improvement - mild, yet flavorful, with a pleasant aroma.  At the current $9.99 for a full pound (vs. the typical 11-13 oz package on your grocer's shelf) price is competitive.  Amazon offers a tremendous assortment of coffees for different  tastes and budgets.  I've noticed a few pricey ones (not name brands) where there appeared an organized effort to hype the reviews. When reading reviews it's sometimes helpful to look at author's past reviews to gain perspective. Absent any other past reviews, take the occasional  "This stuff will blow your socks away ..."  with a healthy grain of salt.

review/text: Magnum Kona Blend whole bean coffee is fresh, smooth, and full bodied.  Kona beans grown in the Hawaiian Islands are roasted in small batches, therefore ensuring mastery of product and overall flavor.  Intoduced to Kona whole beans on desire to try a Pacific-American Coffee, I was surprised to taste a brew rivaling the best.  Many producers may offer Kona Blends but not as fresh or distinguished as Magnum Kona Blend.

review/summary: Smooth Kona blend; mild coffee tastes good neat.
review/text: I drank four double espresso's of this smooth mild Magnum Kona blend of coffee just now. I made it without adding anything to it. It tasted pretty good. It does not have the complex flavors of their Jamaica Blue Mountain blend; but it a Kona blend and therefore mild and smooth. I like it; but the Jamaica Blue Mountain blend is still my favorite as it has a lot of flavor though I do like this Kona blend as it is so smooth and tastes good. The beans are roasted a little dark; not as lightly roasted as the Jamaica Blue Mountain blend. I have enjoyed other Kona coffee blends so I wanted to try this. I feel happy with this Kona blend as I can drink it neat and enjoy it full strength.

review/summary: Wonderfully rich and decadent chocolates -- Very High Quality
review/text: The Godiva kiosk closed in our local mall.  I was very disappointed, because my family expects a selection of Godiva chocolates for Christmas, Easter and birthdays.  However, they have their favorites, and unfortunately when ordering Godiva off-line, you have no choice but to purchase assortments over which the consumer has no input.  They are selected and pre-packaged for you.  So I was looking for other candy companies which might sell chocolates which approximated my family's favorite items, without having to buy extra candies they might not like.  Enter this wonderful collection by Leonidas of Hazelnut and Almond praline-filled milk chocolate confections.<br /><br />These are fantastically excellent chocolates -- just as good as, or better, than the Godiva signature oysters which my family loves. They arrived protected in styrofoam by overnight shipping. I will definitely be dealing with this seller again. I am very impressed and pleased by the chocolate and the high quality of the product.  And the taste?  Just heavenly.

review/summary: Tas-tee Dredssing by Herni's
review/text: Have used this dressing for years until it was not sold in any stores in the Albany, NY area.  Just love it with a Chicken and fruit salad that I make.  I ordered 6 bottles from Amazon, thought it was a little expensive along with the shipping and handeling.  While on vacation in Georgia I found it at the Publix Super Market for $1.99.  It doesn't take long for me to use up a bottle.  Yum, Yum.<br />This product is worth ordering through Amazon if you can't find it in your grocery store.

Then we couldn't find it anymore.  Imagine my delight when I finally found it again!  Just as good as I remember.  Still just as wonderful with a juicy tomato sliced up as well as on chicken, salads and sandwiches!

review/summary: Fresh, Lightly-Spiced, Crunchy Kettle Chips. Good Value, Good Product.
review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/text: These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.
