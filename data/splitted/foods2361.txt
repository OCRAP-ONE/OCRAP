review/summary: Beware -- broken teeth in your future if you buy this!
review/text: I purchased three cases of this kettle corn in the small bags when it was on an Amazon special price.  Unfortunately, I found that each bag has WAY too many small unpopped pieces, both full kernals and smaller pieces.  Many of these hard pieces are fused to the popped pieces with the glaze, so you don't know what to expect until you crunch down on a hard piece.<br /><br />After breaking a molar on this stuff, I have resorted to eating each piece with great care to make sure it doesn't contain hidden surprises that will send me back to the dentist.  It's tasty, but I won't be ordering it again.

review/summary: Tastes Great!
review/text: I don't eat stuff like this very often, but when I'm in the mood it's nice to know I have an alternative that isn't quite as bad as the original.  It's handy enough to throw in my purse and take to the movie theater - and a much better option than the popcorn there.  I wouldn't recommend making a steady diet of the stuff - after all, it is essentially all refined carbs, but for that occasional treat, this would certainly be a better choice than other alternatives - and the taste is fantastic.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: Lesser Evil classic kettle corn is so addictive. It is touted as a healthy alternative to normal kettle corn. It is low fat but still has a lot of sugar so you have to be careful and watch how much you eat. It is really delicious and I have noticed over the years that the quality is better than when it first came out. I used to see a lot of unpopped kernels, however, now there's never an unpopped kernel in any bag I open. I pour each bag out to check for this because I want to make sure I don't crack a tooth! I am sure earlier complaints about that problem is what caused the improved product quality.

review/text: You know I wrote to Lesser Evil before I had purchased the individual size bags. I was buying the large bags at the grocery store and it was great. The small bags had so many hard kernels that I actually broke a tooth. I had split the box with a friend and she too said that she about busted a tooth also. I don't know the reasoning but maybe the way it is manufactured. I absolutely love this popcorn, but I know that I will never buy the small bags again. I was sad because this is my absolute favorite snack.

review/summary: Tasty but it is CARAMEL Corn NOT Kettle Corn.
review/text: Delicious, but the popcorn is completely covered in a crunchy caramel topping - aka CARAMEL corn, so why call it Kettle corn?<br />Kettle corn should be salty and sweet with no candy coating.  If you want a lighter cracker jack this is delicious (although on some pieces the coating is so thick you almost have to wait for it to melt before you chew it).  Was hoping for something similar to trader joes kettle corn and this is NOT it.

review/summary: Why Settle For Less Than The Best?
review/text: In the past, I had tried to prepare other brands of polenta (dry mix or the 'tube'), but always ended up with a lumpy, sour-tasting porridge, no matter how much water I used or how diligently I stirred the pot while cooking. I resigned myself to the fact that I was unable to master the proper polenta-cooking-technique and had to be satisfied with ordering it as a side dish in pricey restaurants. About 15 years ago, I happened to be shopping in my local gourmet food shoppe and spotted the now-familiar yellow box and decided "what the heck, I'll give Valsuga Polenta a try". From that day forward, my family and I became 'home-made-polenta-converts'...Valsuga consistently cooks up quickly, never lumps and always tastes sweet and fresh as a good polenta should. Sadly, my local supply dried up when the gourmet shoppe closed, but I was relieved to discover this product was offered on Amazon. The price is right, the product is fabulous: whats not to like? I'll keep buying my Valsuga Polenta from Amazon!

review/text: I'm 100% Italian and in the past always used the traditional polenta which takes approx. 1/2 hour to cook.  The stirring is tedious and so often the boiling/simmering polenta will bubble and pop and burn your hands during the stirring.  I then discovered Valsugana polenta which I believe tastes every bit as good as the old fashioned type and with much quicker cooking time (5 minutes)reducing the possibility of painful burns from the bubbling polenta.  It is fairly difficult to find Valsugana in stores near me, so I usually order a case of 12 packages from Amazon which allows me to always have a box on hand.

review/summary: pretty good for what it is; it adds to my recipes
review/text: Recently, I purchased a cookbook by Donatella Arpaia. One of the dishes was macaroni and cheese, normally simple fare. My son loves mac and cheese, so I decided to try this recipe. One problem: It called for drizzling the final product with truffle oil. This was not something in my pantry.<br /><br />So, I checked out Amazon reviews of various Truffle Oil products. Most at some reasonable price feature olive oil, infused with a bit of truffle oil. Many of the products were negatively evaluated by reviewers. This tended to be responded to fairly positively. So, I took a shot and ordered a small bottle (3.5 ounces).<br /><br />And, boy, did it work out. It added a real richness to the final product. As a result, I am now more intrigued at the prospect of using truffle oil on recipes that might benefit (I just had a delightful dinner at Capital Grille, where French Fries were topped with parmesan cheese and truffle oil--quite tasty!).<br /><br />So, despite the reality that this is olive oil infused with truffle oil, it works well enough for me. . . .

review/summary: Fantastic! Wow!
review/text: A nutritionist recommended truffle oil to me as a healthy alternative to butter. I don't use a lot of butter to begin with but am always looking for ways to improve my diet and I do like popcorn with butter, it's kind of my "downfall" Well, the nutritionist recommended truffle oil I then e-mailed her and asked her "which one" white or dark truffle? She said both are good, the white is milder. I have only used this on a couple of items so far. I've used it on steamed pot stickers and on some bow tie pasta. I must say, it is the most delicious condiment...I never would have dreamed that a flavored olive oil could be so magnificent! And fortunately, a little bit goes a long way because it is, as you can see, rather expensive. I haven't tried it on popcorn yet. Instead I bought some of the 100 calorie Jiffy Pop Microwave Kettle Corn (also available from Amazon and also recommended by my nutritionist). It too is great and needs not butter or anything added.<br /><br />You really should try truffle oil. I don't know how this particular brand measures up to the other brands but I can tell you this Plantin White Truffle infused oil is delicious. I believe you can buy this product with confidence. I am going to order some more but I'm going to order the dark truffle instead just so I'll experience the difference.<br /><br />One final note: I was warned that once opened it can go rancid rather quickly. Accordingly, I've been storing mine in the refrigerator and when I want to use it I just take the cap off and microwave it for about 20 seconds. Voila! This is truly a gourmet and HEALTHY item. Enjoy!

review/summary: Mixed Feelings
review/text: Is this a delicious product?  Yes, it tastes great on anything, pasta, pizza, steak, eggs, you name it.  Is it worth $22+?  Not in my opinion.  This oil is infused with truffle essence, its not olive oil that has real truffles added to it as many chefs, particularly in europe, still prepare it.  It does taste good but for 3.5 ounces (less than half a cup!) its simply not worth it for me. It's not even the money that bothers me but I feel kind of guilty spending so much on so little on a product that is probably not very costly to produce.  If I was buying real truffles<br />or a fine wine it would be another story but I would look at other similar products for less, the producers must be making an incredible margin of profit on this.

review/summary: Best Mayo substitute!
review/text: A friend introduced me to this one afternoon. The taste was amazing!  It was light & had a hint of lemon which only accented the salad ingredients she had used.  I began searching & found it as well as other tangy flavors!  We ordered ALL of them & they were delicious but my fave is Light Lemonaise!  Perfect with all meats & salads. In my opinion, tastier than any mayo & less fat!

review/summary: Love the product but hate the shipping.
review/text: For taste I would rate this: 5 Stars<br />Price: 0 Stars<br /><br />I absolutely love birch beers especially the white ones. The Kutztown is smooth, has not funny aftertaste and has that incredible wintergreen taste that is characteristic of the birch beers.<br /><br />I was so excited to see this product sold at amazon because birch beers are nearly impossible to find locally. The $1.50 price tag was nice as well but then I looked at shipping -- the cost of which brings it up to $8.00 per bottle (shipping is $6.50 for each).<br /><br />If you can find it locally I would highly suggest you try this awesome drink but at $8.00 a bottle here it is not worth the money.

review/text: If I had gotten more in the package, I may have rated this better. But truth be told, I felt pretty ripped off when I opened up the package and saw what I got. Lets just say, a 35g packaged isn't very big. The gum is ok. Pretty minty. I probably would have liked it more, but like I said, were talking pretty dinky for 9 bucks altogether.

review/text: I have two senior dogs that were on a raw natural food diet for many years.  I had been hard pressed to find something that would fulfill my pets nutritional requirements while being comprised of healthy ingredients.  This is it!  Even my vet, a fierce advocate for raw food, approves of this.  My dogs love it, I no longer have to mix my own ingredients together, and I have peace of mind knowing my beloved pets are being fed high-quality food.  They devour every last particle!

review/summary: My Yorkie Likes It, So I Like It
review/text: My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: This is the ONLY food my dog will eat
review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/summary: Great for hiding medication.
review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/summary: Wellness Canned Dog Food for Adult Dogs, 95-Percent Lamb, 12-Pack of 13.2-Ounce Cans
review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl.

review/text: I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

review/summary: My dog Sashie loves this supplement w/ her dry food!
review/text: I have to say its a bit pricey but at the end I actually saved alot because you only need to give a couple of spoonful along with the dry food. My dog loves it! You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories. Sashie did not experience any problems when I switched to this new dog food. It's also a great coverup for any medications your dog might need to take.

review/summary: My fussy eater loves this
review/text: My geriatric dog has been an extremely fussy eater ever since I brought her home at 14 weeks.  I recently tried Wellness kibble and wet foods and she likes them all, but she particularly LOVES the 95-Percent canned toppers and WOLFS her kibble down with this product mixed in.  Wish I had tried Wellness foods before but better late than never.

review/summary: Good value and fast shipping
review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

review/text: This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

If you like chi these would be good. If you don't care for chi and think it will be cover by "mint" flavor or any other flavor you probably won't like these. They were party favors so some people liked them some people didn't. I didn't and I had a few tins left over so I took them to work where again some people liked them some didn't. Mostly people who told me they liked them told me they were good chi mints; people who didn't like them said "ew what kind of mints are these" - obviously not chi fans. Everyone was a fan of the name of the mints though.

review/text: Classic bubble gum flavor with a subtle mix of mint.  Just like other chewing gums, I have to open two every time. One seems like too small that I almost don't feel it in my mouth. Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price. Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle. But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out. What more, it cleans your teeth. No calorie and no sugar.<br /><br />Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley, the maker of "Juicy Fruit". Believe it or not, Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war.<br />It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health. It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States.

review/text: There are so many benefits to ginger that I don't know where to start!  I had a bit of a sore throat due to a lot of singing I've been doing with the band.  I opened this matcha and absorbed the spicy scent and put it into a tin to keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I had been saving this matcha for the perfect time and after a day of singing I needed to bring it out.  Not to mention the fact that I could use a bit of a pick me up.<br />I decided to prepare this matcha hot first since I wanted to sooth my throat.  I added just a pinch of sugar and a generous helping of honey (I love my honey)!  I did take a sip before adding the honey just so I could get the original flavor.  This matcha is very smooth and spicy.  It is not in your face spicy, but just enough to give it a little flavor.<br />This matcha was very soothing on my throat so I think I'm going to save this one for next week when I have to sing again.  Sorry friends, no sharing of this one!<br />Red Leaf Tea mentions this for treating motion sickness when suffering from an unsettling stomach among other things so it's definitely useful for everyday use.  Think I might have to save a bit for my hubby to try.<br /> Here is how I ordered my Ginger Matcha from Red Leaf Tea:<br />Size: Small<br />Quality: Classic Starter Grade<br />Flavor: Delicate<br />Storage: Air tight refill flat pouch - would definitely recommend purchasing a tin for your matcha to keep it fresh.  I did not order one this time since I already had a tin.<br />To get your own tasty Ginger Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]<br />A sore throat soother!
