review/summary: Tastes like cherry Kool-Aid
review/text: The first thing I noticed about this ultra-red fruit punch liquid drink mix is that it tastes a lot like the cherry Kool-Aid I used to sometimes drink as a kid. It's a good taste, and a little mix in the water goes a long way in terms of attaining the sweetness you want; it doesn't take a lot of mix at all. (Just be sure you blend the mix with water, which I neglected to do the first time I drank it -- way too strong!)<br /><br />Another plus is that there are some B and C vitamins, electrolytes and "natural caffeine" in the mix, which I'm guessing my Kool-Aid didn't contain back in the day. The mix comes out fast with just a little squeeze, so make sure to get it in the cup. I spilled some of the mix on the kitchen counter the first time I squeezed it out, and it doesn't wipe off easy. I'm guessing this stuff would for sure stain a carpet.<br /><br />Finally, it would be better if this mix was made with a natural sweetener or even sugar instead of sucralose, but overall it's tasty stuff.

review/summary: A good source of vitamin C
review/text: I gave this product only three stars, not because the product didn't deliver on its promise of providing an easy way to get the vitamins and nutrients that you want, but simply because the taste was not on par with some of the other similar products that are out there.<br /><br />The vitamin squeeze is simple and easy to use, and it provides a  shot of vitamins and minerals in a zero calorie additive, this is the inherent strength of the product.  However, I only gave the product three stars because the strength of the taste was not as strong as other products like this (however, other products don't offer the shot of vitamins that this product offers).  With this product you get the additive nutrients, but you sacrifice a bit on the taste.  The taste is not bad, it simply is very weak, you have to add a great deal of the product in order to really get the taste out of it.<br /><br />I liked the product, didn't love it.

review/summary: Pleasant! Doesn't taste like chemicals!
review/text: My roommate is a huge fan of Mio, but I find that it tastes too much like I've just dumped some petroleum into a water glass for me. I was pleased to fine that this product adds a nice flavor to water without adding any chemical-like after taste.<br /><br />Pros: good flavor, no aftertaste, easy to get the proportions right (works if you just add a little; hard to get "too much"), helps me to drink more water<br />Cons: bright red color unnecessary, not sure about the need for added vitamins, needs to be refrigerated, not terrifically concentrated (large bottle won't last long)

review/summary: Not bad at all for zero calories
review/text: I'm a bit conflicted about how to rate this.  On the one hand, it tastes surprisingly good for a diet flavoring. And the addition of plenty of B and C vitamins is nice. However, I don't really care for this much, and the reason is the chemical aftertaste of the Sucralose that they use. For some reason I mistakenly assumed this product would just be unsweetened flavoring. Since I was clearly mistaken about what I was getting, I don't feel it would be fair to write a negative review. So, I'm giving this four stars because for a diet drink, this is pretty darn good. The flavor is well balanced and like a Red Bull if Red Bull has any sense of sublety,, and the aftertaste is pretty much par for the course for artificially sweetened stuff. So if you're used to diet drinks, I think you'll probably like this. The convenience and cost efficiency of having a super concentrated syrup that you just squirt into tap water is great, and makes me really wish they made this without any sweetener at all.<br /><br />Just be aware if you're considering this that part of the "energy" boost comes from caffeine.

review/summary: Tasty energy drink concentrate w/ Zero calories
review/text: One bottle of this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink makes 24, one cup, servings of fairly tasty diet juice drink.  The flavor is similar to something like Vitamin Water Zero, but slightly less "diet" or fake sweetener flavor.  This fruit punch concentrate basically consists of natural flavors, sucralose (splenda) caffeine, and vitamins + taurine.  The flavor is better than I expected.  I will drink this daily, no doubt.<br /><br />Each serving gets you 120% daily vitamin C, and 40% daily of B vitamins.  There is 40mg of caffeine (slightly more than a coca cola, slightly less than a mountain dew, or 1/2 the caffeine in a Red Bull).<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- Flavor.  Pretty good for a zero calorie drink.  Sweet but not too fake tasting.<br />- Compact.  Saves fridge space.<br />- Nutrition.  Zero sugar.  Vitamins and a splash of caffeine.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Dosing.  One squeeze is supposed to yield 15ml (1/2 fl oz).  I placed my glass on a kitchen scale and found it takes about a medium-long squeeze to yield 15ml.  A short squeeze is 10 ml.  The longest squeeze was more like 22ml.  I say go by flavor.  In 8 oz of water it should be fairly flavorful, but not too strong or watery.<br /><br />Overall I like this product and will use it up.  4+ stars.

review/summary: Tastes Good, Maybe it Gave Energy
review/text: This Vitamin Squeeze had 40mg of caffeine, and since I don't drink caffeinated beverages, I thought it would give me a buzz. It did not, but it mixes instantly, tastes terrific, and made my boring water a vitamin dream. I held back one star because of the packaging. The plastic that rips off the flip-top was not perforated well and I ended up having to pull a good bit of the label off. Not good. Then, underneath the flip-top, you remove the "seal," but the tab to pull it free with snapped off and I was forced to dig the seal off another way (i.e. teeth, lol). I like this product for what it says it does.

review/summary: Like it for a change of taste.
review/text: I don't drink as much water as I should, so I was happy to get a bottle to review. I like it for what it is. It has 0 calories and give the water a sweet, artificial fruity taste that look like a popular red punch drink. So, I'm not huge into the flavor, but it is different than other obvious options like adding fruit or fruit juice to water. It has vitamin C, B6, B5, Zink, B3, B12, magnesium and chromium and 40 mg of caffeine. The bottle is a size that I can keep in the small fridge at work. It is suggested to finish it within 30 days. The squeeze once feature doesn't seem to work on my bottle. I was putting it in a glass of water (16 oz?) and it hadn't stopped coming out when I had more than enough. From now on I will just measure or use less. I'm not a huge fan of sucralose, but I'm only planning on 1 or less servings a day, so won't worry about this. In conclusion, I like it for what it is and will consider purchasing it again for a change of taste with a pick-me up.

review/text: I tried out this vitamin squeeze hoping i would at last get one of those drink mixes that does not have an after taste. Well, this turned out to be like the rest. Flavors the water well, nice while in the mouth, after that the after taste sets in. I don't know about the vitamins. there is no noticeable sign that i am getting any additional vitamins. And except for the claim of adding vitamins,for me, this is the same as any other flavoring for water.

review/text: I cant say how much energy this drink supplement will give you, but I do enjoy the taste. It tastes like Hawaiian Punch did to me as a kid, but without the sugar. You just squeeze some into some water and you have a healthy drink without the carbonation or sugar of soft drinks. I like it. It's a nice break from lemonade, iced tea and other such drinks. And it makes water taste good!

review/text: The flavor of this product is good - a bit too sweet, but that's par for the course with these sort of things. It is satisfying to know that my daily afternoon drink is providing all the vitamins i need for the day!<br /><br />It isn't as concentrated as some of the other flavored drink mixes on the market, which means the bottle is really big.

review/text: It did make my water taste like fruit punch. Of course, I felt like I wasn't gauging the "one squeeze" correctly. Or maybe I was? It felt like I was using a lot to the ratio of water to get a taste that wasn't so diluted. Regardless, it didn't taste bad once I reached a nice saturation point.<br /><br />As far as energy? I don't really think so. It wasn't any different from when I use Mio. No more or less feeling of a 'boost'.<br /><br />I'll stick to my Mio. Thanks.

review/summary: Meh ...
review/text: This Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, was short on Energy.  I didn't feel more energized or refreshed when using this product.  Also the directions are to add 1 `squeeze' of this vitamin packed liquid to 8 oz of water or other beverage.  However I felt these directions were a bit vague considering it's a vitamin supplement, my squeeze might be lighter then say my husbands, and my kids would just squeeze till it stopped.  It should really have another measure for dispensing or wording like "1 Squeeze or about 2oz" It would only take 1 or 2 times of squeezing 2oz into a measuring cup to figure out the right amount of pressure and flow for accurate dosing/taste.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavoring was a bit fruity, but when I added a lot it got a bit mineral tasting I thought.  Over all I wasn't that impressed with this item.

review/summary: It's Okay for a quick shot of caffeine that tastes like Kool-Aid
review/text: This Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is a simple way to get a few extra vitamins and some caffeine added to your drinking water.  It contains some vitamin C, B vitamins and a couple others.  Nothing real special about that.  It has some caffeine, about like a cup of coffee would have.<br /><br />It sort of reminded me of drinking Kool-Aid.  (I hadn't had any for a long, long time.)  It's not bad, but you have to like Kool-Aid and similar sweet drinks.  With the easy squeeze bottle, you can regulate how much you add to your water pretty easily and come up with the sweetness/flavor you like.  (Again, if you like sweet Kool-Aid type drinks.)  It does leave a bit of an aftertaste after drinking.  Not bad, but it was there.<br /><br />It's faster and easier than powder, and I like that the squeeze bottle doesn't leak or drip.  However, it is recommended to be kept in the refrigerator.  Makes it harder to take on the go to add to water when you are out and about and need that boost of caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's okay.  I actually prefer to just hydrate with plain water and get my caffeine from coffee.  But for a once in a while squirt of vitamins and a caffeine boost, this isn't bad.  And being reminded of yesteryear drinking Kool-Aid isn't bad either.

review/summary: tastes better than MIO, like the price but the caffeine made me jumpy
review/text: I liked the taste of this a little better than the MIO ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4ADKU">MIO Fruit Punch, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> )fruit punch and found that the instructions were much more clear on how much makes a good mix for the right amount of flavor.  I liked that there was some nutritional content to the drink as well.  The design of the bottle is better and it's easy to figure out just how hard to squeeze to get the correct amount into your bottle or into your tea pitcher.  It's fruity enough and since I don't mine Splenda, the Sucralose in this product didn't bother me either.  It was not too sweet.  The price for the number of servings works out to be more reasonable than MIO because I find I have to use almost 4 times the recommended amount of Mio to acheive the same flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's a tiny one, was the first time I used it, I squeezed an awful lot into already caffeinated Tea and gave myself quite a ZAP!  I got a minor headache a few hours later.  Now I know to use this alone with water or with herbal tea.  It works totally fine that way for me.  If you too are careful about your servings of Cafeeine per day, be sure and count this into your daily intake to avoid withdrawal issues, ok?<br /><br />Overall, good price, good taste and nice design.  it could be a little better but I'd buy it on sale.  UPDATE 4/27/12:  I have gotten used to the caffeine in the product and bought another bottle on sale after getting used to adding this to my homebrewed iced tea.  Now I used it more to kick up the flavor in Herbal Iced teas due to the caffeine quotient.  I still prefer this packaging to MIO on every level.

review/summary: 'it's okay' about sums it up
review/text: A bit ambivalent about this drink, as it has its pros and cons.  The fruit punch has a nice flavor to it, not too sweet but about what you'd expect for a flavor enhancer.  It says that one squeeze will do for 8 ounces, but mileage can vary per that squeeze (depending on how much force you use).  Maybe I'm not squeezing that much.  You have to be careful removing the inner seal, something that can be a bit nerve-wracking considering the red coloring of the contents.  I'm also not sure how much of a boost the caffeine will give.  If you want to carry this around to flavor your water all day, you might want to rethink that considering the size (similar to that of a ketchup bottle).<br /><br />That said, it does have a nice list of vitamins and no carbs or calories (which is a lot better than most 'vitamin' waters out there that you buy by the bottle at quite the cost - as long as you don't mind fake sugar) and should last you a while.  It's great to keep at the office or home.

review/summary: Eazy Squeezy
review/text: We have all seen the commercials lately for little squeezy bottles of flavoring, energy, vitamins you can squirt right into any bottle or glass of water. Apparently its all the rage to do this, I thought since I am a happening gal I better get to squeezing.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze is a largish bottle, sort of like a mini ketchup squeezer except this isnt for Fries or a burger. Its for your water. Because drinking plain old water just wont hack it anymore. This product, with one squeeze per 8 oz of water will give you 120% of your vitamin C for the day, 40% of your Vitamin B3 B5 B6 and B12, 40 mg of caffeine, 10 mg of Taurine, and lotsa Electrolytes.<br /><br />So its an energy drink with perks. How does it taste? Well this is the Fruit Punch flava and it taste pretty fruity punchy, very very sweet, a bit overwhelmingly so. But I liked it just fine. Its good to have if you havent had your coffee, and flintstones, and need a boost for the day. I dont think anyone should be chugging this on top of already having caffeine or your fruits for the day.

I am a Mio drinker and feel this drink could give a Mio a run for its money if it came in a smaller more compact bottle. With Mio, I can throw it in my purse, but it has this odd after taste. On the flip side, a bottle of MIO makes 12 8oz glasses or bottles, where as Vitamin Squeeze makes 24. I will definitely be purchasing this product on a regular basis.

review/summary: Adds a bit of pep
review/text: Liquid flavorings and vitamin enhancers have been all the rage for a while.  I was drinking a lot of vitamin waters last year.<br /><br />I have had the opportunity to try two favors of the Mio type of water additive.  It's pretty good and has the big plus that the small bottle fits nicely in a glove box, a backpack, etc.<br /><br />The thing that really surprised me was how big the bottle of vitamin squeeze was.  It's almost as big as a bottle of water itself, which doesn't seem very convenient.<br /><br />The flavor was decent, if you like a look aid style fruit punch.  Of course it says one squeeze, and I gave it a manly squeeze.  It came out a bit too sweet.  You'll have to experiment a bit and find out what works for you.  Of course if ts too sweet, add some more water.  I don't think everyone would like the uncertainty of how much to put in, but, there are always those powders for that.<br /><br />The bottle says to use it within 30 days if opening and it has 24 servings, so, if it's just for you you'll need a daily jolt.<br /><br />The can also recommends refrigeration.<br /><br />Overall it's fine, but I think a half-size bottle would be ok too.

review/summary: Personally, I enjoy it.
review/text: With so many different additives to water these days, what distinguishes this one?<br /><br />It comes in a larger bottle of 12 ounces and makes 24 8-ounce servings. This fruit punch flavor is light (similar to, but not heavy like Hawaiin Punch), and I found it refreshing. It has a combination of vitamins B 6, 5, 3, and 12, Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium, and Chromium. Most importantly it has approximately the same level of caffeine as soda, so I can get a nice little jolt.<br /><br />I use a lot of powdered additives to my water, and enjoy the fact that this liquid fully dissolved, unlike the powders. I am keeping this next to my refrigerator and give my bottles their treatment as I take them out of the fridge, before I jump in the car. However, I have had some warm, and it was OK then as well. I don't add a lot to my water, I couldn't figure out how much a squeeze was, and so I started light, and it works nicely for me.<br /><br />The one thing I would like to mention is that the servings are 8 oz size, and most water bottles are 12-16 ounce. If you are figuring price per serving, do keep this in mind. Also, it is recommended that you use this within 30 days of opening it.<br /><br />I have small hands, and often have trouble with pull off tops under seals, so I have the habit of keeping a sharp knife handy to run around the top and remove it. So I opened my bottle using my normal technique ... the extra hermetically sealed package wasn't a problem for me.<br /><br />Good flavor, reasonable price. I will be finishing my sample bottle and looking for it in the market.

I do notice a slight energy kick to it - different from caffeinated soda.<br /><br />I can only really compare this to Mio as I have not had anything else that is comparable.<br /><br />1.The packaging on this is much larger.  With Mio you only get 1.62 oz and with Vitamin Squeeze you get 12 oz.<br />2.This you have to refrigerate after opening and with Mio, you don't.<br />3.This bills itself as an energy drink with caffeine, vitamins and electrolytes, Mio does not.

The fruit punch flavor I tried tasted pretty good, with no bad after taste, though it did taste a bit artificial to me. That said, I prefer Coca Cola in moderation and really natural drinks like orange juice and iced tea....and cold water. One word of caution, my container with the Vitamin Squeeze, leaked around the top. Maybe I caused this when I unsealed it using a knife - so I suggest being extra careful when unsealing it.

review/summary: Disappointed, but others may not be
review/text: I really wanted to like this product.  I'm a pretty active person who is always interested in trying out these supplements (even though I know drinking plain old water works as well as anything else), and I love the taste of fruit drinks.<br /><br />This product certainly delivers when it comes to providing a fair amount of vitamins, especially C.  That makes it a good choice, I guess, for those who don't eat fruit but it may be somewhat superfluous if you're already a healthy eater.  There is taurine in this product too, but only 10mg which is a fraction of what you'd find in energy drinks.  It's a good way to get some vitamins, but I have not noticed any kind of energy boost from its use.<br /><br />I had two issues with this product, which I'll cover briefly:<br /><br />1) Taste - I have always liked the taste of fruit punch, and was disappointed with the flavor of this product.  It tasted vaguely of artificial fruit flavoring, but even with a generous amount I never found it very fruity.  It turned my water red, but no amount of the product could make the flavor appealing.  This is just my opinion, and perhaps for others the taste is just fine.  Related to the taste was the lingering aftertaste from the use of sucralose.  This hardly makes it unique among non-sugar drinks, but I thought it worth mentioning.<br /><br />2) Amount to use - The side of the container says, annoyingly, that one squeeze per 8 ounces of water is what should be used.  However, we don't all have the same squeeze so better directions would be useful (eg. two teaspoons).  Or even better, how about something that limits the amount coming out per squeeze?  It may not seem like a huge deal, but I found it frustrating.<br /><br />I doubt I'll use this product much, given that there isn't anything to really separate it from all of the similar products already on the market.  Others may find it useful, though, and I certainly wouldn't pan it as a bad drink additive.

review/summary: Don't fall for "nutritious" label claims -- artificial sweeteners and preservatives
review/text: I'm not sure what the target audience for this product is, but it left me confused.. Health-conscious individuals would probably stay away from this item due to the caffeine and artificial ingredients. To say that it is "nutritious and delicious" is a bit of a disingenuous marketing stretch. Eating a multi-grain piece of bread is nutritious. This product is fortified with several B vitamins (3, 5, 6, 12) and while vitamins are good for you, drinking a cocktail of caffeine, sucralose (artificial sweetener), sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (preservatives) and Red #40 (an artificial dye, missing from Amazon's product description) probably isn't what most people would consider "nutritious". The label says "all natural favors", which might lead some consumers to believe this is an all-natural product. It certainly is not. It contains no juices of any kind -- just something mysteriously listed as "natural flavor".<br /><br />Vitamin C is very easy to get from fruit and certain vegetables, so you don't need an artificial source of it. Vitamin C is everywhere and deficiency hasn't been a problem for about 100 years. The fruit punch taste is fine. It's on the same level as Kool-Aid, but the sucralose left an unpleasant lingering aftertaste. Going down, it tasted good, but afterwards, it left a strange sensation in the back of my throat. I would certainly not recommend this as a "healthy" beverage because of the artificial ingredients and caffeine. Call me a health nut if you wish, but I recommend getting vitamins from whole, unprocessed foods and fruit whenever possible, not from a bottle. The label warns not to serve this to children, or mix it with alcoholic or caffeinated beverages.<br /><br />If you don't mind sucralose and preservatives, this product may still have uses for you. It has zero calories and the squeeze bottle is handy and easy to use, once you get the inner seal off. It has a pull tab, but is glued on so tight that no amount of pulling would get it off. I had to use a knife to puncture the seal and remove it. Product makes 24 servings and the side has markings indicating how much to use, though it is a useless feature because the you can't see through the label to see how much of the product remains. The label is completely opaque.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:10 Mins<br /><br /></span>Using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQMC">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink</a> is simple. Grab a glass, give the bottle a squeeze and fill the glass with water. I did a quick video just for fun to show it being used and here's what I like about it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Easy to use and store. Since this bottle makes 24/8 ounce servings, that's 12-24 bottles of energy drinks not being stored in my fridge or pantry. Very convenient!<br />* Control the flavor intensity. Although more or less of the concentrate obviously changes what vitamins and caffeine you'll receive, I like that ability.<br />* Besides Fruit Punch which I like, there are several other flavor choices: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQP4">Peach Green Tea</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQDQ">Acai Grape Pomegranate</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQJU">Tropical Citrus</a>.<br />* Price. Currently an order comes with 4 bottles, which comes out to 96/8 ounce servings. Now even if your regular energy drink is 16 ounces that's still 48 servings at less than $.50 each.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* None that I have found so far.

review/summary: Tasty water enhancer!
review/text: First, let me start by saying that I am not a fan of water. I hate plain water -- and anything that will help me to be able to drink more is a good thing in my estimation. I have tried several different "squirt" additives (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4EBMG">MIO Mango Peach, 1.62 Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>) and found them to be OK but I like this better. At first it seemed that there was a bit of a medicinal taste to the water, but either I got used to it or it faded fast, because now I don't notice it anymore. It's important to shake the bottle well, however, before squeezing it into your drink. I usually fill a tumbler with ice and water (about 16 ounces) and then squeeze the bottle and, voila, my drink is ready. I sometimes stir the additive into the water, but it doesn't really seem to be necessary to do that.<br /><br />Any time you add an artificial flavoring to a product, opinions on whether it is good or bad are going to be entirely a personal reaction. The flavor I received was fruit punch, and I must confess it's not my favorite (I'd prefer cherry), but it goes down easy when I'm really thirsty. I don't consume a lot of fruit either, so I'm glad this product offers 120% of my vitamin C daily requirement per squeeze (serving). It also contains caffeine, taurine, 40% of the RDA for some of the B vitamins and a trace amount of some minerals. NO fat, NO carbohydrates, and NO calories!<br /><br />This is a good sized-bottle so it's not something you can carry everywhere, and it has to be refrigerated after opening. It offers 24 servings (at 15 mL = 1/2 ounce) per bottle so it's about 25� a serving. Anyway, I like it and would really like to try another flavor. Anything to increase my water intake!

review/summary: Enjoyable
review/text: There are many of these types of water additives on the market today and many of them offer the similar qualities - added vitamins, energy, etc.  Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is no different.  However, what is different is the size - at 12 oz it is much larger than many of the similar products out there.  The flavor is fairly good, however I do still notice that "strange" aftertaste which I think just goes with the artificial sweetener, sucralose.  I don't care much for that.  Otherwise the flavor is good - not like Hawaiian Punch to me, as some have mentioned, however that just may be in the tastebuds of the taster.  Does it give me a boost of energy?  None that I noticed, however I think I have some kind of built up tolerance to caffeine and energy drinks because they never seem to do anything for me in the way of wakefulness or energy.  I do have to say that I enjoy the flavor enough that it helps me drink more water.  Not one that is particularly fond of drinking the amount of water that I should each day, this added flavoring does help.  Keep in mind that, unlike other flavor additives, this one does need to be refrigerated and used within 30 days of opening for optimum freshness.  This is not an issue for me and actually makes me feel more assured of its quality by having it refrigerated.  All in all, a very good product and one that I will use and look forward to trying out the other flavors.

review/summary: Aesthetically Pleasing Design Ruined By Horrible Taste
review/text: Throughout the work day, I usually drink about 16 ounces of water just sitting at the desk. The past couple months I've been trying a variety of different energy drinks and supplements. When I had the opportunity to try the VITAMIN SQUEEZE FRUIT PUNCH ENERGY DRINK through Amazon's Vine Program, I decided to give it a try. I'm drinking a lot of water every day anyway, so I figured I might as well try to mix things up a little.<br /><br />The drink itself comes in a container that looks a little like one of those newer upside-down ketchup squeeze bottles. There's supposed to be enough product for 24 8-ounce servings. This water additive concoction contains vitamins B6, B5, B3, B12, C, as well as magnesium and chromium. It's also supposed to contain 40mg of caffeine (about the same as a can of regular soda).<br /><br />I liked the overall design of the bottle. It's aesthetically pleasing and the bottle is quite easy to use once it's opened. It also does seem to provide a very short burst of energy after use. However, I had several issues with the product.<br /><br />The first issue I had with VITAMIN SQUEEZE FRUIT PUNCH ENERGY DRINK is that it's a bit more difficult to open. In addition to removing the wrapping from around the edge, you have to poke open the squeeze hole. I tried just squeezing, but it didn't work. So, I ended up using an ice pick. You can probably use the tip of a knife or a prong of a fork, too.<br /><br />Beyond using a measuring cup, there's no real way to figure out exactly how much of a squeeze is required for an 8-ounce bottle of water (or a 16-once water bottle). So, the user is left to guestimate. It took about a 1/3rd of the bottle over several days before I was able to get close to what I think was the proper amount.<br /><br />The biggest issue I had with this energy drink was the flavor. Personally, I think it tastes horrible. It's supposed to be a fruit punch-flavored additive. However, it tastes more like liquid Sweet Tarts; it has a very strong acidic aftertaste that completely eradicates the initial sweetness that one tastes. After I got down to less than � a bottle, I tried drinking the Vitamin Squeeze directly from the bottle. I thought it might help with the flavor. I was completely wrong. The horrible Sweet Tart-taste just became even more pungent.<br /><br />So, though VITAMIN SQUEEZE FRUIT PUNCH ENERGY DRINK does seem to provide a short burst of energy and has lots of vitamins, the positives are almost wiped out by the horrible taste. Personally, I'd take a 5-hour energy drink or a can of NO FEAR over this energy drink.

The "nutrition" aspects aren't bad--they're not good, either--but the flavor is something that I can't live with. My wife described it as "watered-down [children's drink with a mascot that breaks through walls]", but adding more to the water just made the solution taste more "fake" and unpalatable.<br /><br />If you dig the flavor, though, you'll get some good B vitamins and caffeine, so I guess this would be good for someone on the go that needed a lift.

review/summary: Contains Vitamins, Caffeine and Electrolytes, as well as Red Dye and Sucralose
review/text: This product is called by the manufacturer: a "water enhancer" and boasts to give you vitamins and energy with "an extra dose of vigor" and with 0 calories, sugar and carbs, with a fruit punch flavor from "all natural flavors". I was curious, so gave it a try.<br /><br />You are supposed to use one squeeze per 8 ounces of water with this package holding 24 servings. Depending on your squeeze time the drink will be weak, just right or strong, so you have to figure out how you like it. It does taste like fruit punch and is sweet thanks to the sucralose.<br /><br />The product is red colored thanks to red dye #40 which some with dye allergies may like to know is present  in this product.<br /><br />As for vitamins, it says it has 120% of the RDA for vitamin C, and has 40 mg or less of Vitamin Bs and taurine. Additives give electrolytes also.<br /><br />The energy is thanks to the added natural caffeine, 40 mg per serving.<br /><br />This is good for covering up the bad taste of tap water or if you just hate the flavor of plain water. The best use of this for my family is to use it when my kids have no choice but to drink terrible tasting water while at Boy Scout camp. Add this to that awful hose water they use at camp, and the Scouts will drink the water provided and they will not only get hydrated but it adds some vitamins and electrolytes. However my family does try to avoid artificial sweeteners in our daily life.<br /><br />This product basically turns your water into an electrolyte and caffeine drink with flavor, not unlike buying the sports drinks pre-made except this is convenient to put into your own water in whatever container you use (water bottle for bike ride or whatever). You will save money by purchasing this instead of premixed energy drinks, too.<br /><br />I think this product has its place although there is still debate over the necessity of drinking electrolyte drinks while doing non-extreme exercising vs. drinking just plain water, and some people will continue to debate whether sucralose should be a part of our daily diets and others seek to avoid food dyes. I will stay out of the debate for my review...the purpose of my review is to tell you what is in this product and how it tastes. I'll let you decide if this is something you want or need to use.

review/summary: Great idea but taste is off
review/text: As a mother of 7, I am always looking for healthy alternatives to sodas, Kool-aid, and energy drinks my kids seem to pine for. The fact that this is not a powder (which can be really messy for a child to use) and contains a respectable number of vitamins made me excited to try it.<br /><br />The squeeze bottle is just the right size for even small hands. Also, the liquid mixes instantly in water so a spoon isn't even needed to stir! Less things to wash for me.<br /><br />All of my kids were eager to try it but sadly, the taste is so off that no one even finished their glass. That's saying a lot since my kids will drink stuff I don't even want to smell. 7 people tried it, including myself, and everyone described it the same way. The first swallow was OK, but it is immediately followed by a strong aftertaste that can only be described as "medicine-like". It is a seriously bad taste.<br /><br />Also, everyone needed 3 squirts for it to taste like anything except watered down cough syrup. But then, it just tasted like Kool-aid and cough syrup mixed together.<br /><br />I hope the manufacturers read these reviews and work on the flavor because if it tasted good, I'd buy it by the case. This is exactly the kind of product I've been looking for - if I could only "swallow" the awful taste.

review/summary: Convenient package, flavor less than appealing
review/text: Like so many low or no-calorie, water flavoring drinks, the Vitamin Squeeze has a cloying artificial sweetener taste, sucralose in this instance.  The Fruit Punch flavor is more reminiscent of Kool Aid than any naturally occurring fruits.  Indeed the ingredients list ambiguously "natural flavor".  The shtick on this drink is that it has a few added vitamins (A, C, E, B complex) to give you the illusion of healthfulness.  If this is how you are getting your vitamins, you seriously need to reassess your diet.  Finally, the coup de grace is caffeine.  My favorite drug of choice and peak-me up. There is 40 mg per squeeze.  Roughly 1/3 to 1/2 of a cup of coffee, or half of a 9.5 ounce Red Bull.  Because of the caffeine, this is not a kids drink!<br />The list of ingredients is a series of chemicals (vitamins, artificial sweetener, caffeine, etc.), so how they get away with the "All Natural" label is a wonder of modern marketing.  As is the "natural caffeine".  As opposed to what?  Artificial caffeine?<br /><br />I am impressed by the packaging genius of this container.  The one squeeze per 8 ounces of water (24 squeezes in the bottle) is super convenient and brilliant means of delivery.  No messy measuring.  If it works for ketchup and mayonnaise, why not for concentrated energy drinks.

review/summary: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink: OK, but this flavor won't be reordered
review/text: I drink a lot of water, and it can range from the bottled variety to basic tap water, depending on where I am at the time. I also like freshly-squeezed lemonade, which is about as basic a water additive as can be found. Iced tea is also a good basic water changer, as is iced coffee. Am not super picky about the amount of sweetener that is added, as long as it's with some form or real sugar, and not some chemical additive; for some reason they don't seem to agree with me. But lemonade, iced tea and iced coffee all take time to prepare.<br /><br />This <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQMC">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink</a> in the Fruit Punch flavor presents an interesting and convenient way to alter the flavor of plain tap water for those who like it that way. It's convenient enough: refrigerate it, and then just add one squeeze for each eight ounces of water, as it says on the container. The container also notes that each squeeze adds more flavor and nutrition, and that one container makes 24 servings. It's hard to get more convenient than that.<br /><br />Looking at the container, it proclaims that there are zero calories, zero sugar and zero carbs. It also says:<br /><br />"Vitamin Squeeze(tm) adds Vitamins, Nutrition, and Delicious ALL NATURAL flavor to your drinking water."<br /><br />And although there are various vitamin additives, there are some small problems, the first being that this bright red drink that resembles <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZRZNMA">Hawaiian Punch</a> in the Fruit Juicy Red flavor, it really doesn't taste that good, but that's a subjective opinion. And though sometimes one can learn to adapt to a new taste, this product has an aftertaste that lingers, and it's a distinctive taste that seems to dwell in the mouth, the kind that reminds one of an artificial sweetener. And according to the label, that's precisely why that aftertaste is there.<br /><br />The ingredients are listed on the product label and the information page here: water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12.  It's not apparent at first, as no brand name jumps out, but there's an ingredient that is probably responsible for the aftertaste: sucralose.<br /><br />Some may not know this, but sucralose is an FDA-approved artificial sweetener which goes by the trade name of Splenda, and most sources agree that it's around 600 times sweeter than sugar, so manufacturers need to use only a small amount. Sucralose shouldn't be confused with sucrose, which is basically table sugar.  While is derived from sugar, sucrose is not a component in this sweetener. Sucralose is made by adding chlorine to sucrose, yet the sucrose itself goes away during the complex manufacturing process.<br /><br />On its positive side, sucralose is found in thousands of food and beverage products.  It's used because it is a no-calorie sweetener, and does not promote dental cavities.  It's also safe for consumption by diabetics, as it doesn't affect insulin levels, and for some can be a good thing.  Did some checking and the safety of sucralose appears to be well documented in more than 100 scientific studies conducted over a 20-year period.  Sucralose has been reviewed by the FDA, as well as by international health authorities such as the World Health Organization.  It is said to be safe for use by all consumers.<br /><br />But iced tea without sweeteners has no calories, and the same goes for iced coffee.  And above all, plain water, be it from a bottle or from the tap is exempt as well.  I'm no health fanatic, and as a cyclist do often indulge in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UYCZN8">Gatorade</a> sports drinks, which are said to have a small amount of sucralose, depending on the flavor.  As a personal taste, and this is highly subjective, this one didn't work for me, but I'm not ruling this product family out, as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQJU">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Tropical Citrus</a> may be an improvement in taste.<br /><br />6/21/2012

review/text: Vitamin Squeeze is a good means to improve nutrition and liven up the taste of plain, boring H2O. Just a small squeeze is all it takes to add vitamins and flavor to a glass of water, encouraging better nutrition and more frequent water consumption- two things we could all use more of in our diet.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze is a great idea in concept and it is more economical than purchasing vitamin- enhanced water. It does add some good amounts of key nutrients to your water; namely, Vitamin C, four different B vitamins, chromium, and zinc. It doesn't add any sugar, carbs, fat, or calories so it does have many things going for it from a purely nutritional standpoint and some would be wise to consider it for this reason alone.<br /><br />So, with so much going for it, are there any drawbacks to this beverage enhancement? Yes, there are exactly two and the one that will concern most is the taste. It is fruit punch flavored, but the taste is not very natural and it isn't very appealing. And since it is made with sucrolose, there is a slight aftertaste.<br /><br />The other thing that annoyed me about this beverage is that it doesn't define exactly how much you need to use for a standard serving. The instructions just tell you that one squeeze will do the trick, but it doesn't say how large a squeeze actually is. When you consider there are 12 ounces per bottle and that one bottle is good for 24 servings, you then figure out that a squeeze equals one- half ounce. Also, if you look at the nutrition label, you will see a serving size indicated. Thus, you will eventually figure it out, but it would have been nice if the manufaturer was clearer in this regard.<br /><br />In summary, Vitamin Squeeze isn't the greatest tasting beverage additive, but it doesn't taste terrible and it is still better than a glass of plain water. With the added nutrition and lack of fat, carbs, sugar, or calories, it has enough going for it to recommend and it does make a nice alternative to wasting so much money on individual bottles of vitamin- enhanced water.

review/summary: Good, not great
review/text: This product is good but not great. There are no instructions, so you have to just kind of try it and adjust to taste. The bottle does say, "One squeeze is all you need", but they don't define how much a squeeze is...a tiny squeeze or a great long one, etc. For what it's worth, I'd suggest doing a LONG squeeze. That said, once you get it "dialed in", it doesn't taste bad at all. Just like regular fruit punch. I'm not a big fruit punch fan, so it is what it is. But as far as fruit punch goes, it tastes pretty good. I can't speak to the vitamin aspects of it, but I have no reason to doubt what they say is in it. Overall, easily recommended if you like fruit punch. If not, probably not for you.

review/text: I hadn't tried Vitamin Squeezw or Mio  when I decided to give this a shot. I really liked it and used most of the bottle until I decided to pick up a few Mios  at Target for comparison. I found I really preferred Mio due to their flavors and ultra portability. Vitamin Squeeze has the same amount of servings as Mio but requires refrigeration and is very large.

review/summary: Better Than Mio, But Not Very Tasty
review/text: I personally love plain water, and normally would have no problem drinking it plain.  However, the added energy and vitamin C would sometimes be a handy timesaver for me.  I probably won't be purchasing this product for myself, because I hated the taste.  As another reviewer noted, it has a medicine type taste, not to mention a rather long lasting aftertaste.  It may just be an acquired taste, as I tend to dislike artificial sweetener type tastes, though many other people are not bothered by them.<br /><br />I tried with little success to vary the amount used, thinking perhaps a smaller squirt would be better.  However, it's tough to squirt from this bottle, and it tended to be a large serving each time.  I do have arthritis in my hands, and that may have affected my use of the bottle.<br /><br />I'll stick to my plain old water.  Seems like just another way to part the consumer with his dollar.  `

review/summary: It's Okay
review/text: I really wanted to like this product.  I though it might be a nice alternative to the iced-coffee I drink during the summer; and I REALLY liked the idea that it had vitamins.<br /><br />LIKES<br />--Two squirts in a cup of cold water produced a refreshing drink.  It tasted 'fruit punchy' and crisp.<br />--Bottle was easy to use and didn't leak.<br /><br />DISLIKES<br />--After five minutes I suddenly discovered an after-taste that persisted for more than fifteen minutes.  Meh.<br /><br />WISHFUL THINKING<br />--Wish they had used another sweetner.<br />--Wish they'd come out with a kid's version without caffeine.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I think this product is well priced.  I think the initial flavor is really nice, but the after taste popped up after awhile which sort of detracted from the overall experience.  You might try this in iced tea.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/summary: Room for improvement.
review/text: The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is a drink that I wanted to work so much. I have been dieting and I wanted the drink to provide me with energy, but that didn't happen. I thought that if I increase the amount that I was putting in my water that I would then see and increase of energy but even this didn't give me much energy at all. The concentrated liquid quickly dissovlves in the water but that is the only positive about this mix.<br /><br />I squeezed the Fruit punch into a bottle of water and when I finished I had a big mess the cap of the bottle leaks everywhere. There was a bitter aftertaste and I had to mix it with my crystal Light fruit punch in order to tolerate the taste. I continued to use Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink but I have yet to benefit from the mix. I think that if the taste is fixed and they increase the B vitamins from 40% to about 60% then this will be a good product.

I can also see it being a desirable additive to your water that you take on a bike ride or to the gym.

review/summary: Not Really Worth It
review/text: As someone who loves coffee and orange juice, I didn't really see the point in this "energy drink." I'm not exactly nuts about the energy drink fad either as I prefer to get my nutrition naturally. But this Vitamin Squeeze looked like it could be pretty good so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />There are a few problems off the bat. There's no real way of measuring how much to put in your cup. I guess you could use a measuring cup, but that seems like a hassle just to put something in your water. Beyond that, there's no way of fixing it if you put too much in. This drink requires a fair amount of finesse as there's no real margin for error.<br /><br />Beyond that, it tastes really fake. Like watered down kool aid infused with one of those vitamins that's not supposed to have an after taste but does. This drink is supposed to be an easier way to get your vitamins, but it certainly is not.<br /><br />I don't recommend this drink to anyone. It's possible that some people may enjoy this taste. But for the price and what you're getting, it's just not worth it. Drink a cup of coffee and some OJ instead.

review/summary: Value of this water enhancer is limited
review/text: There's 40 mg of caffeine in an 8 ounce serving of this drink, which is about half-way between the amount in 8 ounces of green and black tea.  If you're watching your intake of caffeine, there is a problem with that amount.  Consider this perspective:  An 8 oz. cup of tea is an average serving for a morning or afternoon "cuppa".  But 8 oz. of water mixed with this water enhancer is NOT going to be an average serving.  You or your child will be sucking down way more than 8 ounces at a time.  And that means you will be ingesting a good amount of caffeine (and Vitamin C).  If that works for your body, well then, fine.  But it doesn't work for children and it usually doesn't work for older people.  So consider that before hitting that "Add to Cart" button.  And, I may be wrong, but haven't I read somewhere that an over abundance of Vitamin C is not good for you?<br /><br />Other observations:  Good:  I liked the taste much better than I like Mio and I didn't detect an unpleasant aftertaste.  Bad:  The fact that the bottle is 12 ounces big and you have to store it in the frig after opening will prevent me from carrying it around in my purse, briefcase or the console of my vehicle.<br /><br />I think there are much better ways to get my Vitamin C and if I need a waker-upper, I'll have a cup of tea.  I can buy some very expensive and wonderfully fulfilling and sensual teas for the same money....

review/text: I have a hard time imagining a big market for this product. While it sounded good in theory it has too many negatives to it to be worthwhile.My first complaint is that it tastes like weak koolaid plus leaves an aftertaste that is not thirst quenching at all. Also the size of the bottle combined with the fact that it needs to be refrigerated makes it inconvenient for on-the-go.

review/summary: Nasty
review/text: Well what was I expecting, fine dining? This is so far from fine liquid refreshment it is sad. The fruit punch flavor is so artificial it makes Hawaiian Punch taste like organically grown all natural juice. The vitamin flavor is impossible to mask. And it is sickeningly sweet.<br /><br />The positive aspects of this product, the bottle is kind of pretty and easy to squeeze. The food coloring isn't overly intense to stain your teeth, but it does turn your tongue a darker shade of red.<br /><br />What is Vitamin Squeeze? A diluted knock off of Mio with added vitamins. Add a few squeezes to water and a fruit punch drink with vitamins is born.<br /><br />The instructions are not exactly super intuitive, how much is a squeeze? I'm kind of a measure carefully person and a squeeze didn't cut it. First try, the drink was way too weak. This drink doesn't taste very good to begin with, and really diluted it is super nasty. After a few more tries one squeeze was easier to understand.<br /><br />The bottle is like a French's Mustard or Heinz Ketchup bottle with a one way nozzle in the cap. Squeeze the bottle "upside down" hard enough and liquid will squirt out.<br /><br />The instructions say to keep the bottle refrigerated after opening for best results and use within 30 days. The sweetener is sucralose, with citric acid as a flavor and preservative agent. It does contain caffeine (no listing on how much, except that it is high on the ingredient list). This is heavy on the Vitamin C, and contains Vitamins B6, B5, B3, B12, Zinc, and Chromium. No this isn't an all natural product.<br /><br />Where Mio is a simple flavor / color product, Vitamin Squeeze tries to take that idea to add energy. I'm not a big fan of Mio, and I like this even less.

review/summary: Good flavor and easy to mix
review/text: Vitamin squeeze offers you a nice refreshing beverage, that you mix yourself.  Easy to mix, great tasting, blends well in water or bottle water and is very portable for those on the go.  True the vitamin content can be easily;y derived from other key food groups but it is nice to have the addition in bottle form if needed.<br /><br />Nice flavor that you can adjust by adding in a little more or less according to your taste.  Pick up a bottle and give it a try, it may not be for everyone, but with the market flooding with expensive energy drinks this product offers you a better cost saving alternative to those high priced canned drinks.

review/summary: Here's what to expect:
review/text: This product is not:<br /><br />A organic energy drink<br /><br />A replacement for your Centrum Silver<br /><br />A replacement for Flinstone Vitamins<br /><br />This product (IMHO) is more like a way to turn your bottled water into an energy drink. Another example of a product in this category is ZipFizz.<br /><br />After reading all the negative reviews of this product I had really low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. It tasted decent (no better or worse than most energy drinks). The mixture I made gave me heaps of caffeine-induced energy and alertness.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that it's hard to measure what a "squeeze" is. After I did my "squeeze" into my water, I looked at the lines on the side of the bottle and saw that I had actually "squeezed" four servings into my glass. At this rate, the bottle that is supposed to have 24 servings is only going to last me about 6 servings. What is odd is that my drink seemed to have just enough flavor for what I squirted in. Perhaps I used more water that the recommended amount.<br /><br />Just as a heads-up, one serving of this product has 40mg of caffeine, or roughly that of a diet Coke. Two servings would be about the same as a Red Bull, and my four-serving dose is about the same as a Medium Starbucks drip coffee.

review/summary: I'd rather take a pill
review/text: This fruit punch vitamin supplement for water says on the bottle one serving size is � oz., which you can measure if you have a small shot glass type measuring cup. On the bottle it gives no indication of what amount of water you should put it in. On the advertising page it says 8 oz., but then just says one squeeze.<br /><br />The taste itself- in an 8 oz. glass of water is like an extremely weak children's drink; and added to that it somehow tastes powdery. Even adding it to a glass of already made crystal light punch, you could taste a grainy after taste. There are 24 servings in a bottle and it advises to keep for only 30 days - refrigerated after you open it. Personally I'd rather get my vitamin supplements by taking a pill - it's done with and I do not have to struggle with the taste of this.

review/summary: Tastes okay and is very convenient
review/text: Out of the various water enhancers I've tried, this is my favorite flavor to date.<br /><br />I appreciate the fact it's high in vitamin C and the B vitamins. The caffeine is about half that of a 10 ounce cup of tea so if you're looking for a jolt of energy, this may not be enough caffeine for you. It's more a nutritional supplement than an energy drink.<br /><br />The flavor reminds me quite a bit of Tropical Punch Kool-Aid, mixed a little weak, and the chemical sweetener is balanced by the acidity to not be quite as strongly flavored as it can be in other water enhancers. It's easy to use, although not very portable. I'd recommend pre-mixing it into your bottled water at home if you're going to use it that way.

review/summary: Contains Sucralose - artificial sweetener & 40mg natural caffeine per serving
review/text: Drinking 6 to 8 12oz bottles of water a day I always look forward to something that might spice it up without adding calories or sugar to the mix, but I also know that if it does, it usually has an artificial sweetener in it.  Vitamin s Squeeze Energy Drink is no exception.  It contains sucralose - an artificial sweetener 600x's sweeter than sucrose (granulated sugar), per Wikipedia's info.  While no serious health risks are associated with sucralose, it does contain fillers.  It is found in Splenda and other artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Studies on rats being given doses of sucralose did note a 50% drop in good bacteria in their intestines.  What does that mean for humans?  No studies have been done, but like with most things, moderate intake of this sweetener should have no negative affects.  Just be aware it's part of the deal, and if you prefer natural sweeteners like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q4SW36">Stevia Spoonable-50pkts - 50 ct - Packet</a>, you may want to avoid this product.<br /><br />Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is a water enhancer (sort of a funny way of saying 'flavor changer'), does it, but the 'energy' jolt that others speak of is something I've yet to experience with this product.  'Natural' caffeine... not sure whether that's different than the good 'ol generic variety, but if it is, it may be the 'light' version.<br /><br />The product's label indicates that you get 120% of your daily Vitamin C intake in one serving (a squirt in 8 ounces of water). Each bottle provides enough Vitamin Squeeze for 24, 8oz. glasses of water.  The resulting drink has 120% of your daily recommendation of vitamin C, 40% of your daily recommendation of 'B' vitamins including B3, B5, B6 and B12. 40mg of natural caffeine per serving, 10mg of Taurine, with electrolytes and Potassium to help you recover from excessive sweating. (Like most sports drinks - Gatorade for one.)<br /><br />Adding more 'C' and 'B' to your system is never a bad thing, particularly if you exercise, it's hot out and you're sweating a lot, or you just want to boost your immune system. (Bear in mind these are water-based vitamins and you'll pee them out of your system rapidly, so a dose of 120% of your daily recommended isn't really all that much over the course of your day.)<br /><br />The 'natural' caffeine at 40mg should be similar to drinking a cup and a half of coffee.  If you are like me and drink a lot of caffeine on a regular basis, you probably won't notice a boost from this product.  However, if you don't usually drink caffeinated drinks, you may get this pick-me-up.  I didn't notice a thing.<br /><br />No calories. How? Artificial sweetener Sucralose.  In higher doses (like one too many Vitamin Squeezes...) you'll feel it in your upset tummy and colon.  The B and C vitamins would add to that affect.<br /><br />No sugar = no carbs.  Sugar in any form is a carbohydrate.  They are synonymous.  This makes this product good for those on low carb diets or for diabetics - in theory, but be aware that artificial sweeteners have their own negatives.<br /><br />The squeeze package is easy to use, and better than most for not making a mess, however if you are using a bottle larger than 8 ounces, you may want to give it two squeezes to get any flavor.<br /><br />The sniff test on this one made me think of Hawaiian Punch.  However the flavor isn't strong, and for me, barely perceptible with 2 squeezes in a 12 ounce bottle of water.  Definitely not sugary or sweet in any way, but not bad tasting either.  It changes the flavor, but again, it was such a minor change I wondered 'Why bother?'.<br /><br />Some will really like this product.  It's definitely not going to harm you if you have a couple of these drinks a day, and might actually assist some in their weight loss efforts with the caffeine, Chromium and Taurine in it.  For me though, it's not enough of anything special for me to want to buy it and keep using it.

review/text: I liked this.  Depending on price, I would buy it again.  It smells great---just like the Hawaiian punch I had so often as a child.  A little hard to assess how much a serving is (one squeeze?), so I just experimented for the  amount of flavor I wanted.  A smidge...or more.  Depending on my mood.  Flexible flavoring. If you (as I often might) just want a smidge of flavor (akin to the level of a lemon in your water) this will last much longer than the 24 servings that are predicted on the label.  Although it's less portable (bc of it's size, it's more than I personally want to carry in a purse) I like this better than the Crystal Light type water flavorings.  Loved the smell!  :)  Enjoy!

review/text: I like that this easy to use product adds vitamins to water without adding calories or anything else I don't want too much of in my body.  The taste is OK if a little bit like the flavors used in childrens' medicines.  In fact this fruit punch flavor kind of reminded me of the taste of a classic children's cherry asprin if it was dissolved in water.  The big draw back to me is it did nothing to quench my thirst and actually made me thirstier so I had to chase it with a couple of glasses of plain water.  I guess drinking more water is a good thing too........

review/summary: Convenient flavored sugar free hydration works for me
review/text: I drink sugar free beverages exclusively. What this means is that I'm pretty immune to typical aftertastes for such products so take that in to account when considering my review.<br /><br />I hydrate regularly throughout the day by filling up a coffee mug with water from our refrigerated drinking fountain. One squirt of this gives me a touch of flavor and a boost of nutrition, or so says the marketing literature on this and I'm not arguing. It tastes like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019MMQXM">Kool Aid</a> to me, i.e., pleasantly sweet but not overpowering. If you add an extra squirt or use less water you'll get a stronger and (artificially) sweeter flavor.<br /><br />As a reviewer who received this as a sample I always ask, "would I buy this with my own money?" Probably not. Still, it's pleasant enough and if slightly flavored beverage water is something you like, this is a very convenient way to use it. I keep this in the mini-fridge at work, and when I fill up my mug with icy drinking fountain water (I love our drinking fountain) I occasionally throw in a squirt of this Fruit Punch flavored package as a change of pace from, um, just water.<br /><br />I might suggest if  you are a Kool Aid household, that this is a much more convenient mechanism of flavor delivery than powder. Not a big deal, but there you have it.

review/summary: Good alternative to buying cases of Vitiman Water but has artificial sweetner taste.
review/text: I think this is a great idea to make a concentrate because you buy this one small bottle and just add one squirt it to an entire glass of water over and over again for 24 glasses!.  I really thought the flavor is perfect and strong enough with one squirt in each glass.  Any more than that and it is really too strong and too much.  So this really does make 24 servings and I like that it has four B vitimans-40% of earch of these (B5 B6 B3 and B12) , Vitamin C 120% and 10% of both Chromium and Zinc.  I do not love the artificial sweetner taste but if you like punch this is just what you are probably used to. Also it really beats the hastle of buying a case of Vitiman waters and lugging it all over.  No more heavy lifting so you decide!

review/text: I imagined Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink would taste like watered down gatorade or koolaid without sugar, but this stuff is fairly sweet. I think the directions are a bit vague but one squeeze per 8 oz of fluid was right on for flavoring. I enjoy this in place of a soda or juice as it has vitamins C, B6 B12, B6 and A and still manages to taste great.<br /><br />I am not a fan of other water additives (or I should say THE OTHER water additive) but I really do like this Vitamin Squeeze. My only complaint is for the packaging, the plastic around the lid was brittle and actually ripped up the side of the bottle, and the disc sealing the fluid inside did not want to come off, I eventually cut it off.

I like the flavor but I'm not too excited about how it lingers. The label shows orange, cherry, pineapple and raspberries, but the mixed drink's color resembles that of watermelon juice. It's very tasty and it certainly doesn't get much easier to make than to stir it into some water and be done with it.<br /><br />I've got a bit of the caffeine and vitamin B buzz going already...that's quite effective! With the main purpose of this mix being another option in the energy drink market, then it does its job well.<br /><br />I noticed a couple of drops got onto my shirt. Despite my efforts, I now have two stain spots that do not want to come out. I guess be careful when your stirring not to have any splash over the glass rim - it's my fault, but still.

review/summary: Enjoyable
review/text: Lately my family has really been enjoying the powdered single serve additives to make water into lemonade or punch or other flavors so I knew that they'd like this one. They do and I like that I don't have to open those little packets. Just one squeeze from this bottle sweetens the water and there are 24 servings per package. And extra bonus? Instead of just sugar like the other drink additives my family has tried in the past, this one has 120%  Vitamin C per serving, as well as other vitamins and minerals. (the only downside to giving this to kids is that it DOES contain caffeine but that's one of the reasons it is labelled an "energy" drink)<br /><br />All in all, it's easy to use, tastes good and even infuses the water with some vitamins that are good for you. As a diet coke "addict", I am hoping to cut down on the amount of Diet Coke I consumer and switch it out for more water. It is much easier and tasty to choose water when this drink mix is added and 0 calories, sugar, or carbs are added!

review/summary: Great Tasting and healthy!
review/text: When I first got this I was thinking it would be loaded with Sugar and calories, and then I was very happy to see that it had no Calories, Fat, Sugar, Carbs, just vitamins!  So I then started to think that this will mean it will not have much taste, and then yet again, super surprised!  With just a little squeeze the water had an amazing berry taste!  It was delicious!  It tasted better than most fruit drinks!  It has a load of vitamins and taste great and has nothing bad in it (calories, fat or sugar)!  It also has a nice spout on it that makes the liquid only come out when you squeeze (you can hold it upside down and nothing will come out until you squeeze)!!!<br /><br />I was extremely surprised at how great this tastes and that it has no calories, sugar, or fat!  I love the ease of squeezing a little (a little goes a long way) and then drinking it (no stirring or shaking), it has a great taste and gives you a great does of vitamins (mainly C) in an easy and convenient manner!  Highly recommend!!!

review/summary: I Like It.......
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I received this product and got ready to try it.  The instructions were to squeeze the bottle once for 8 ounces of water.  I had a 16 ounce bottle and added two squeezes, unfortunately I squeezed to hard.  The bottle doesn't indicate how hard to squeeze so you need to just give it a quick squeeze.<br />After the initial try of putting in too much I was able to get the correct amount in and it tastes great to me.  I am used to diet drinks so the "after taste" doesn't bother me, I'm used to it.<br /><br />I purchase Vitamin Water and drink occasionally and this is right up there with it in taste.  For me the vitamins and Energy are an added benefit and the tropical punch tastes great.  It definitely helps me get my daily required amount of water.  I Like it.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I do not drink "energy" drinks on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them while outside exercising.  Energy drinks usually have sugars and caffeine in order to claim to be "energy" drinks, and this stuff also has taurine in it.  One can also taste the sucralose.  It also contains Vitamin C,B3, B5, B6, B12 and electrolytes.<br /><br />The taste is a citrusy punch delight, and the fact that this comes out of a squeeze bottle that is measured to yield 24 servings means it's easier to allow for more or less liquid according to taste.  I prefer my drinks on the weak side because I drink more of it and strong red drinks tend to leave a red "moustache" on my upper lip.  The red dye in this mixture can stain countertops, so be careful when pouring this!<br /><br />Liquid easily comes out of the bottle and returned to the frig afterwards.  For the occassional drinker who would need a month to finish off the contents, this isn't a bad-tasting mixture.  I haven't felt a "zing" after drinking this, though.

The dose is low enough I can drink it more than once a day. And at 12 oz, there is plenty to get through a week or two.<br /><br />Enjoying it & I will be getting this again.

review/summary: Convenient but Flavor is So-so
review/text: Vitamin squeeze is a water enhancer like Mio. I tried this in the Fruit Punch flavor which isn't my favorite flavor. You add one squeeze for each 8-oz of water. I had a large glass of water and added several squeezes and it still seemed weak.<br /><br />I like that it has zero calories, sugar and carbs and the added vitamins. It does have caffeine; combined with the B vitamins is the reason for the Energy claim so be aware of this if drinking later in the afternoon or giving to children.<br /><br />Another note: make sure the lid is on tight. You have to remove it to take the safety seal off and when I replaced it, it wasn't completely tight so when I squeezed it into my water, it went everywhere and stained everything it touched.<br /><br />Overall, it's great for convenience but the flavor and strength was so-so.

review/text: First, at 12oz per bottle, you've got plenty of wow per squeeze. It works out to be about $6 a bottle, which is really a great deal. The vitamin C and just enough caffeine (40) really gives you a `gentle' boost instead of the wall-climbing-overdose followed by a big crash. It still tastes great even with zero calories.<br />I seriously like this a lot. Can't wait to try the others, esp. peach.

review/summary: Love the idea, but haven't warmed up to the flavor
review/text: The many different water flavor enhancers coming out these days have become a staple in my family's cupboard, and it's always a pleasure to try new ones. Unfortunately I'm a bit torn on this one, as it has all the added vitamins I love, but the flavor is a bit lacking.<br /><br />This particular Vitamin Squeeze has a very light fruit punch flavor, and it isn't nearly as strong as regular Kool-Aid or even Crystal Light. I found that even putting three or four squeezes into a glass of water still ended up with a very bland taste that isn't particularly exciting.  On the upside, there's a lot more liquid than in the smaller Mio bottles, and this Vitamin Squeeze flavor is completely sugar free.<br /><br />What sets Vitamin Squeeze apart is that it has both Vitamin C (meaning it can take the place of EmergenC or similar powders) and good deal of B vitamins, a standard of energy drinks. You can essentially create your own energy water by upping just how many "squeezes" you feel like using in any given glass. If you hate the taste of energy drinks and are looking for something a bit healthier, this is a great alternative, and since there's no sugar and only a small amount of caffeine it doesn't create that jittery feeling.<br /><br />This is definitely worth trying if you want a new way to add some flavor to regular tap water, but overall I didn't like it nearly as much as Mio the tried and true Crystal Light.

It's got a much better flavor than other similar offerings (such as the MIO product line) and it doesn't taste overwhelmingly of artificial sweetners.  The flavor is comparable to most other "fruit punch" flavors on the market.  It mixes well with cold water and blends well with little stirring.  I'd recommend it as an alternative to water.  I will caution that it is on the sweet side, but it can be diluted to taste.

review/summary: Delicious but "good for you" is debatable
review/text: The vitamin line-up on this is pretty good.  120% of Vitamin C is something of a waste, since the body does not store Vit C - it excretes what it doesn't need/use right away.  Still, I'd rather know I'm getting more than I need than not enough.  40% of most of the B vitamins is pretty decent, since B should also be obtained throughout the day as part of the daily diet.<br /><br />The pros:  I gave this to my kids to try and they pronounce it "delicious" and "you should get some more".<br />The cons:  A "squeeze" is too non-specific for me.  One person's "squeeze" is a few drops while another's is half the bottle.  This renders the nutritional info pretty worthless - who really knows what percent of the daily allowance is consumed each time my kids "squeeze" the bottle?  The other con is that this is chock-a-block FULL of food coloring.  I avoid coloring in my own diet and have attempted to minimize my kids' consumption of it too, but here is this product designed to add vitamins to the diet and that can't be accomplished without adding a bunch of food coloring?  For shame!

review/summary: makes my water more enjoyable!
review/text: I have been drinking vitamin water and sobe Lifewater for awhile but that can get expensive so I started drinking just plain water, filtered from my fridge's water dispenser.  Plain water is so boring so when I saw this I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />First of all, remember that this is concentrated!  so you MUST mix it with water.  When I got it I wasn't really sure how big of a "squeeze" to put in.  It says on the label "one squeeze per 8 oz water"  - well, my first 'squeeze' I just did a full grip and squeezed until I couldn't squeen anymore.  For me that was a bit too much flavor and it tasted like Hawaiian Punch.  So the next time I backed off a bit and after a few uses I found a "squeeze" level that works for me tastes.<br /><br />I also like to add it to small bottles of water that I occasionally get from the store.  I just drink a little out of a 16.9oz water bottle then put in a squeeze of the Vitamin squeeze, shake it a bit and I've got a nice, flavorful and vitamin-enhanced drink.  I'm not too sure there are 24 servings in one bottle, maybe my squeeze is too much, but I've probably had at least a dozen water drinks with this one bottle and still have some left.  I'll try keeping tabs with the next bottle I open and update this review.<br /><br />Oh, I enjoyed the fruit punch so much that I decided to try the Acai Grape Pomegranate and the Tropical Citrus.  The Acai Grape Pomegranate is okay, but I think the Tropical Citrus and the Fruit punch are my favorites thus far.  The Tropical Citrus is a bit like "Sunny Delight" - if you've ever tried that.<br /><br />As for the claim of "Specially designed cap delivers the right amount in one squeeze with no drips or mess" - I would say again that you have to determine what "one squeeze" is to suit your taste and it definitely is no drips or mess!  A lot better than pouring those powder packets in to a bottle and getting the powder on your counter top or desk.

review/summary: Be prepared to wear it!
review/text: Oh heck no, not happy at all.  I have used the similar MIO water enhancers, and enjoy them.  They are only 1.6 oz bottles, and this is 12 ounces.  Obviously you need to shake this, then though for some reason they want you to store it upside down, you turn it up and flip open the cap.  On my first attempt, the bright red liquid shot out freely, spilled all over the place and stained everything it touched, including my now ruined shirt.  I wiped it off the floor, counter and walls, cleaned, and then took the closed bottle and washed it under water.  I blamed it on user error, and was more cautious on my next attempt. But, before you even turn it over it starts coming out.  Dare to actually squeeze it, you get too much, and some of it might end up in the glass if you're lucky.<br /><br />So, once you are out of energy after cleaning the mess, once again, you take a sip and now can't describe what you are drinking.  It just tastes like plastic to me.  Reading the ingredients, I have no idea what is causing the plastic taste, so it must be the plastic bottle.  The taste is eventually tolerable, but not so much.  The MIO bottle is ten times smaller and lasts longer, with better taste.  But honestly, this is the stupidest bottle I have ever seen.  Do not store on it's lid as it will spill all over your fridge. I have it upright in a can holder. If you have kids, forget it. You will be cleaning this up endlessly.

review/text: Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce<br /><br />In my opinion, as far as taste, less is more with this product.<br />I drink only water or tea during the day so I was looking forward to adding a nutritional drink to my diet.<br />The first time I tried it, I added too much and it tasted like medicine; more like cherry than fruit punch.<br />As far as packaging, I like having this in a bottle instead of packets however the squeeze part in the cap just did not work for me. I was using a mug to drink from and even though I had this totally upside down it managed to go everywhere! I think just a tiny hole would make it easier and less messy to use. I didn't try this with a water bottle so I assume that would be easier to dispense. Also, with water in my mug I could add more water if I added too much of the drink.<br />I didn't feel energized at any time after drinking this product. The added vitamins can only enhance my diet so I like this aspect. The vitamin content is only 40% for the B (3, 5, 6, 12) and 120% for Vitamin C and 10% for Chromium and Zinc. No sugar or sodium!<br />Since I like the liquid form I will probably buy this in a different flavor.

In reality, it became one of my all-time favorite items from Amazon Vine. I liked it so much that I decided to order a  four pack.<br /><br />What I like -<br /><br />- Offers about the same amount of caffeine as a soda<br />- Not a bad flavor - it reminds me of a watered down High C... which isn't a bad thing.<br />-  Plenty of vitamins... again similar to High C - but with an energy kick.<br />- Someone else mentioned it - this is a great space saver compared to a couple of gallons of High C or a case of Gatorade.<br />- What I like is that I can stick this on my desk and it is like I have a full case of gatorade within reach.<br /><br />A reality check<br /><br />- Not quite the potency of Red Bull so don't expect a huge kick<br /><br />FInal Verdict - I am very impressed by the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink - it also a great combination of flavor and caffeine within easy reach. My next experiment is to mix it with 7-Up or Sprite... As for me - this is a very easy recommendation .<br /><br />5 Stars

review/summary: Great alternative to sugary drinks
review/text: The Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer is a really great alternative to sweet, sugary drinks. It comes in a plastic squeeze bottle, and all you do is give a single squeeze into each 8 oz. of water. Be sure to shake well before each squeeze, and in my experience even when I had the cap open (I did this right over a sink to avoid any accidents) and shook it vigorously, none of the liquid came out. It actually has to be squeezed to come out, or at least mine did. The fruit punch tastes fine, and depending on how much you are actually putting in the flavor can be very, very subtle or fairly detectable. What it basically comes down to is about the level of Vitamin Water or Gatorade in terms of how prominent the taste is. In my opinion it tastes a little sweeter and a little tastier than those. Because you're squeezing it into water, that's a pretty good analogy to think of how it tastes: this is just a slightly sweeter version of Vitamin Water. With each serving (single squeeze) you'll get 120% of your daily Vitamin C and 40% each of Vitamins B3, B5, B6, and B12. The great thing is that it also has 0 Calories and 0 grams of sugar. That's right...no sugar. You also get 40 mg of natural caffeine, 10 mg of taurine, and electrolytes. Compare that to Gatorade or Vitamin Water and suddenly this is looking really good if you want to cut down on your sugar intake; take a look at one of those bottles next time, I was shocked to see how much sugar is in them. Personally I do not get any extra noticeable energy from the caffeine, but I am notoriously resistant to energy stuff. I don't drink tea or coffee, although I do have roughly a one-can-per-day cream soda habit, and I'm guessing that my relative lack of daily caffeine is what makes it so hard for any energy supplements to work on me...or maybe that's just me. Anyway, take a look at a can of cream soda and you'll find that unfortunately one can exceeds the daily recommendation of sugar intake. I'm happy and proud to say that over the last week or so that I've had this squeeze bottle, I have only had one can of soda and have opted instead the other times to get a glass of water and squeeze some of this enhancer into it when I'm craving a sweet beverage. Will it get me off cream soda? No, I don't want it to. I love cream soda and I do still wan to have a delicious can from time to time. But will it help me lower my average daily sugar intake big-time? Yes, and that makes it something that I can very much recommend to you.

review/text: For a water drink enhancer, I think the taste is great.  The fruit punch flavor tastes like pop cycles to me.  There's 120% of the vitamin C  that's required, 4 of the vitamins B's, electrolytes, and Taurine.  I've been reading about all the benefits of Taurine, so many good reasons to have that in your diet.  With the electrolytes, it's like a sports drink too.<br />What I learned the hard way, was to not drink it close to bedtime.  Big mistake, if you want to go to sleep.  The drink is much milder than many of the poplar energy drinks, but still gives me an added boost without the jitters that I get from those other energy drinks.  For the taste and cost, you get a lot of bang for your buck, so I give it 5 stars.

It did not have the signature "crash" that comes with other energy drinks, nor did it make me jittery.<br /><br />What's in this? 120% Vitamin C, 40% B3 (B5, B5, B12) vitamins, 40 mg of natural caffeine, 10 mg of Taurine, and "electrolytes."<br /><br />I tried it warm out of the box when it first arrived but it does seem better (marginally) cold out of the refrigerator.  So if you have cold water, you can probably tote it anywhere and be satisfied with the product.<br /><br />Yes, you want to shake it well before using it (as directed).<br /><br />The only thing I noticed that might be unpleasant was that it has a "dry" aftertaste.

review/text: I've tried MIO and Crystal Lite. I like Crystal Lite when making gallons, can't stand MIO. I wanted something affordable and tasty for my water bottles - those pouches are costly - so a quirt bottle would be the ideal solution - that's why I tried several flavors of MIO. I decided to give this a try - mainly for the flavor - energy and vitamins are just a plus. This tastes like sugary cool-aid - without the calories. One squirt flavors 8oz strongly - since it's a liquid you flavor to your liking, and experiment with the strength. My girlfriend is pickier than I am, and does not like overly sweet drinks  - but she liked it as well.<br /><br />So this gets a definite thumbs-up. It's also larger than expected. I pictured a MIO bottle - this is closer to a Red Bull in size. In other words you get a lot of it! They advertise that it can flavor 22 drinks. If you like it less sweet, this would be closer to 30! The liquid resembles V8.

review/summary: Tastes pretty good, watch the caffeine content!
review/text: This is a nice idea. Squirt some liquid into regular water and get some good vitamins. The taste of the drink is pretty good and doesn't taste like liquid vitamins, which normally have a metallic taste.  It is much better if you make sure your water has ice in it. I found that if I put 2 squirts or perhaps 3 into an 8 ounce glass, the taste improved and became richer in flavor. The problem with this is that you're adding more caffeine to the drink, which I realized at midnight when I still couldn't sleep several hours after drinking this. The lack of precise measurement is a bit frustrating too. The instructions say "just a squirt", but the bottle doesn't stop the flow of concentrate and you could literally empty the bottle in one squeeze. I wish the bottle required an additional squeeze for each additional portion but it does not. Overall, I like the idea of adding vitamins to my diet, and the flavor of the drink is quite good. But use with caution.

review/summary: Vitamin Taste
review/text: This product is like other products in several ways. Let me explain. Let's start with the bottle. It is larger than Mio, but it operates in the same way. You squeeze it and it flavors your water. However, this has to be refrigerated after opening and used within 30 days, and as far as I know, Mio does not. As far as the flavor goes, it is comparable to Emergen-C, which is nasty to me. It tastes way too much like vitamins. I'd rather swallow a pill. I was not impressed with the "natural caffine" because I have not felt any improvement in my energy from drinking this. Overall, this is not a product I would purchase.

review/summary: Product works fine -- but do you need it?
review/text: I drink a lot of water every day and there are times when I have to spike it with a shot of cranberry or orange juice or sugarfree lemonade to give it some taste.  This product offers the same kind of solution with a squirt recommended for 8 oz of plain water.  The taste that results is pleasant and sweet, kind of like cherry KoolAid crossed with a berry flavored Emergency C powder.  This squeeze bottle is portable and offers a good dose of Vitamin C.  Do you need the product?  Well, I don't really and wouldn't purchase it, preferring my method of adding a bit of juice.  Another downside to Vitamin Squeeze is the caffeine content.  Why that's necessary I don't know.  If you need caffeine to do what you have to do, then do something else.  Another real disadvantage of the product is its packaging.  Very hard to open.  For portability it makes more sense to get a single serving Crystal Light.  Better taste, no caffeine.

review/summary: My kids liked it
review/text: I love having something to get some Vitamin C into my kids during cold season especially.  This contains not only Vitamin C, but also a bunch of B vitamins, and caffeine.  I'm not excited about giving my kids caffeine, but early enough in the day I can certainly make that work.<br /><br />The taste?  It got two thumbs up from everyone, basically tasting like any other "fruit punch" beverage out there.<br /><br />It was super-easy to make -- just squeeze (one squeeze for 8 oz of water) and the force of the liquid coming out pretty well mixed the beverage.  No additional stirring was necessary.<br /><br />Once the bottle has been opened, it needs to be stored in the fridge and should be used within 30 days.  With 5 kids, I know I won't have a problem using it.<br /><br />The kids voted that I should purchase more, and maybe try some other flavors.

review/text: I opened the package and found that the squirt nozzle (for use of a better word) was slightly blocked by plastic, which I had to remove.  That was most likely a manufacturing error from incomplete plastic molding.<br /><br />Shot a couple of squirts into cold water and drank.  The taste is a bit too sweet, slight metallic taste.  However I feel pretty good once taking it; not in an energy sort of way but just a good feeling.  I usually take this with my morning vitamins so it's hard to tell whether it's the beverage or the vitamin.<br /><br />This product is not taken straight!  Must dilute it.<br /><br />Recommended.

I'm not sure I felt extra energy the way I do with an energy drink, but as a drink it's pretty good. The one word of warning, the first time I squirted it, I put it in a glass with ice, and the concentrate hit an ice cube and splashed off the cube and onto me. So just be careful when squirting.

review/summary: Fruity Taste, Not Artificial Like Others.
review/text: I am NOT a plain water drinker.  Even bottled water needs some enhancement for me.  While the best and most natural way to enhance the flavor of plain water is by squeezing fresh lemon or lime or orange into it, that tends to get boring AND expensive.  I received my 12 oz bottle of Fruit Punch flavored Vitamin Squeeze Energy a couple of days ago.  This product is housed in the upside down type bottles that are currently popular.  The top of the bottle features a snap lid that allows you to squeeze the product out slowly or quickly and it also allows you to turn the cap so it is removed entirely if you prefer to pour the product in a larger pitcher of water.<br /><br />I have tried other water enhancer products such as the one that is spelled with a certain 3 letters.  I did not care for those as they had left a weird chemical taste in my mouth.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Vitamin Squeeze.  This did not taste in any way to me like a no cal product.  I squeezed about 1/2 of a tablespoon into a 12 oz glass of filtered water and I thought I was drinking a watered down version of Hi-C fruit punch. All I tasted was fruit.  I didn't taste any diet sweetener at all.<br /><br />I looked at the differences in the ingredient labels of Vitamin Squeeze and that other enhancer brand I mentioned above.  Vitamin Squeeze does not have any ingredients I cannot pronounce nor any that I am not familiar with.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients listed in order on the bottle:<br /><br />Water<br />Citric Acid (not Malic Acid like in other enhancers)<br />Vitamin C<br />Natural Flavor<br />Sucralose<br />Natural Caffeine<br />Sodium Benzoate<br />Potassium Sorbate<br />Magnesium Lactate (Electrolyte)<br />Vitamin B3<br />Taurine (ingredient in an energy drink known to give you "wings")<br />Vitamin B5<br />Calcium Lactate<br />Potassium Phosphate<br />Gum Ascacia<br />Glyceryl Abietate<br />Red 40<br />Vitamin B6<br /><br />Now, the ingredients that are giving you energy are the Taurine, the natural caffeine (but I don't know the source of the "natural" caffeine) and the B Vitamins.  The Electrolytes I understand as well.  The only ingredient problem I have with this product is the Red #40.  WHY do we have to have this product colored?  Is it a psychological thing?  I would be happy to drink my water CLEAR.  As long as there is some flavor in it I do not need to psych myself into thinking I am drinking something other than water by making it a different color.<br /><br />When I first opened this bottle and started squeezing I found leaks around the bottom edge of the screw on cap.  I was getting irritated and was going to blast the design in my review.  Then I started to think about it and unscrewed the cap.  When I first opened the protective paper opening I had only torn a triangle around 1/3 of the paper.  This was what was causing the leakage.  Remove the ENTIRE opening protector and you won't have the problem I had.  However, that said, when you are squeezing the bottle into a glass hold the bottle completely vertical because you will get a surprise squirt rebound if you don't.  LOL.  This product will stain your clothing and counter and floor.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this product.  Have I noticed an energy boost?  I don't know really but at least I am not getting a crash like after drinking other well known canned energy drinks.  I will keep using it and update this review if I have any issues with it.  I would give it 5 stars but I don't like the coloring and the fact that it stains everything so 4 stars it is.<br /><br />EDIT 3/23/12:  The lid STILL leaks even with the paper protection completely removed.  I guess I just won't store the bottle upside down in the fridge but be wary if you are going to transport it in a purse or tote!

review/summary: A shoddy bottle design and meh taste kill off its appeal
review/text: I like stuff that you can add to water, so I was a bit excited to taste this. It boasted a lot of positives: vitamins, caffeine (yay!), and electrolytes. I like feeling like I'm getting more than just a flavoring, so the idea behind this sounded pretty good.<br /><br />Then I actually got the product.<br /><br />First the taste. It's meh. It's hard to mess up fruit punch, but this is just sort of bland. There's no *punch* to this punch and it has that strange aftertaste that you get when you use certain sweeteners or add vitamins to it. I was expecting this to a degree, but when it's mixed in with the lack of pow in the fruit punch it's very noticeable.<br /><br />Now for the packaging. This is just horribly designed overall. The first thing is that this is HUGE, about the size of a small bottle of soda. It's not very easy to carry with you and when it comes to exercise and such, you need portability and this bottle doesn't have it. It's good in a way since you have a lot of the product if you're really into it, but if you're hoping to have something small like a Mio bottle or a packet of Crystal Light that you can slip into your purse or bag, this isn't that item. Then there's getting into the darned thing. The pull tab under the cap is as easy as "pull and peel" as it claims to be. I had to use my nails to claw this off, which was just a little irritating. This in itself isn't a deal breaker like the bottle's size might be for some people, but it is aggravating.<br /><br />In the end this just didn't wow me enough to where I'd really want to buy this when the current bottle runs out. I can see where it could be good for someone who is dying to have the electrolytes and such, but there's got to be something better out drink-wise there that's sugar-free and low/no calorie. Flavor-wise, stick to your Crystal Light and Mio bottles. I'm giving it an additional star for the vitamins and stuff that it has with it, but otherwise this is just sort of a flop for me.

review/summary: It's OK...
review/text: I made a New Year's resolution, this year, to not drink any pop. I'm about three months in, and have had no failings up to this point. I drink lots of water, and good old H2O is just about perfect. Still, there are some times I want a little more flavor, so I reach for the juice or some Crystal Light packets (the ones that are sized for water bottles). This Vitamin Squeeze product gives me another drink choice that is on the healthy side of the equation.<br /><br />The drink, itself, tastes quite a bit like Crystal Light drinks. So, if you enjoy those, you should enjoy this product as well. The price tag on this product is kind of high, but you do get (supposedly) 24 servings out of this squeeze bottle, as it only takes one squeeze to make a single serving. I have my doubts that it will stretch that far, but we'll see. I could be wrong.<br /><br />I found this product to be fine. It's nothing fantastic, but I wasn't disappointed with it, either. If you're into these sorts of beverage options, you'll probably like it. If you are more into pop or other carbonated beverages, you probably won't like it so much.

review/summary: Between plain water and soda
review/text: The idea of this product is good.  It offers a no-calorie alternative to sugar or diet sodas as well as bottled or tap water.  The product is designed to turn water into a more flavorful beverage.  It is cleverly designed so that one squeeze of the bottle injects just the right amount of enhancer to flavor an 8-ounce glass of water.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor is extremely sweet, so I'd suggest adding a half squeeze first to see how it tastes before committing to a full squeeze.  The liquid is fortified with Vitamin C, four B vitamins, natural caffeine, and electrolytes.  The caffeine is intended to give you the same shot that coffee or cola provides.<br /><br />For those who are trying to wean themselves from soda or calorie-rich fruit juices, Vitamin Squeeze is an alternative worth investigating.  The 12-ounce container has enough liquid for 24 servings.  You can eke out more servings if you don't want too sweet a drink.<br /><br />Be careful opening the container.  It has an inner seal.  If you don't remove it VERY carefully, you'll spill some of the liquid and it is VERY sticky.  Take your time, and open it over the sink.  Don't risk staining a tablecloth.<br /><br />I'm a longtime fan of diet soda, so I would not abandon diet soda for this beverage.  I like carbonation, and this drink has none. The taste resembles Kool Aid and has an unpleasant after taste.

review/text: I use Mio water enhancer and that interested me in trying Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. I am trying to drink less soda and thought this might be a fun addition to my day.  It is certainly a better value than Mio.<br /><br />First, it was a pain to open.  It took two of us to peel of the seal under the cap.  I was afraid we were going to spill red juice everywhere.  We finally got it open and added it to the water.  Sure enough, it tastes just like fruit punch.  There is a slight nasty aftertaste.  My palate is not sophisticated enough to tell what it is.  I do drink other diet drinks and found the aftertaste much more pronounced with this one.  As usual, "energy" means caffeine and taurine so you'd want to pay attention to that.<br /><br />Overall this might be something I use again.

review/summary: Delicious and much better value than a $2 bottle of Vitamin Water!
review/text: 8 ounces of water. 1 squeeze of Vitamin Squeeze. That's pretty much it. That's already easier to do than most powder mixes. I'm not sure how much a "squeeze" is exactly, but this stuff shoots out in jet stream so stirring is almost optional.<br /><br />One squeeze gives you 120% of your daily vitamin C; 40% of vitamins B3, B5, B6 and B12; 40mg of caffeine and 10mg of Taurine for energy; and electrolytes to boot. Zero calories, zero sugar, and zero carbs, and all natural flavor. I can't vouch for all the flavors, but the fruit punch flavor is absolutely delicious. I do hope that more flavors become available, though, for even more variety.<br /><br />The best part is the value: There are 24 servings (squeezes) per container. That's 24 glasses. The four packs are selling for just under $24, which means you're paying about $0.25 per serving. That's a heck of a lot cheaper than $2 bottles of Vitamin Water, and no doubt you're getting a healthier drink!<br /><br />The bottles (12 fl oz) are roughly the size of a bottle of sunscreen, which means small enough to toss in a backpack, day bag, or "bugout" bag for an infusion of vitamins and small pick-me-up while on the go. The only downside is that it's recommended that you refrigerate it after opening (-1 star). If you've got a cooler, great. Otherwise it might be a challenge to make that happen if you're trekking through the woods or running from a horde of zombies (in which case refrigeration is the least of your concerns anyway).

review/text: I have pretty much kicked my coke/diet coke habit and its thanks to products like this. I wanted to drink more water and less canned soda. I have a hard time getting excited to drink water so I needed something to spice it up. I've tried other products and liked them but not many offer a great taste with low/no calorie, while being enhanced with vitamins.<br /><br />I've tried zipfizz and loved them but at more than a dollar a pop it was getting expensive. I ran across this while looking at the Mio products and thought it was cheaper while also containing vitamins so I'll give it a try first. I have been pleasantly surprised by how good it tastes. It has a little bit of a vitamin'y taste (cant think of a better way to describe it) but not bad at all. You can meter however much you want into your water so your tastes may be different than mine. All in all the taste is very close to Hawaiian Punch. I don't get the same energy buzz I got from ZipFizz but it does give you a small kick to help you out. This costs ~$0.20 a shot for me, I take about 2 full shots in my water bottle and I'm done.<br /><br />I think I've found my new favorite water enhancer and only wish I had the option of "Subscribe and Save" so I don't have to worry about running out.

review/text: This is not a product I would ever consider buying. I'm the only person left who leaves the house without a bottle of water clutched in my fist, as if I were Sanders of the Desert setting out to find the source of the Nile. I will not, on principle, eat an eggwhite omelet, and usually consider any salads other than tunafish the stuff you push away from the real food.  But I have a healthy friend, a hiker/jogger type who goes to the gym every morning and can do that dog kick thing that led to my killing an aerobics instructor.  I was acquitted. The jury all had expired gym memberships.<br /><br />Anyway, Healthy Friend came over one morning to make nasty comments about my drinking coffee and huddling on the sofa when I could be exercising and hiking and drinking water out of a bottle.  After lecturing me until I pulled my bathrobe over my head, she left...but she left her bottle of Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink drops behind.  This, by the way, is the new water drinkers trend. Adding flavos and "energy boosting vitamins." It turns water into something like diet coke, only with vitamins and without the bubbles and not as good tasting.<br /><br />Now me, I don't want my energy boosted because then I might start doing stuff, and I'm happy sitting right here, thank you.  So I called Healthy Friend and said "You left those trendy vitamin drops behind," and she told me to keep them.  Obviously this was ploy by the incidiously healthy to ensnare yet another unwilling victim into their web. But boy, did they misunderestimate me.<br /><br />I tried the drops. The taste is sweet, kinda like the Kool-Ade I didn't like much when I was a kid. Maybe little tangier, but not much.  I waited for the big energy boost.  Nada.  This will not replace my morning cups of coffee. However, the taste is not bad, the drops are chockful of Vitamics from one end of the alphabet to the other, and for people who do this sort of thing, I'm sure it makes them feel even more smug and complacent.  Anyway, I did not waste the rest of the bottle. I poured it into a big 1.5 liter bottle of club soda. With some lime wedges, this is going to be one killer mixer when I add the gin.

Adults didn't think it was THAT bad, but didn't like it either.  Net result is that after everyone tried it once, it sat untouched on the shelf in the pantry for months.  Nobody wanted a second glass.<br /><br />It can't deliver the vitamins if nobody drinks it.

review/summary: Tastes OK
review/text: I tried the product in the recommended dosage and felt mixed about the concoction.  Using less water for the same amount of syrup got better results.  When a few friends came over for dinner, I decided to get a little creative and used the product with carbonated as well as mineral water, with a dash of mint, lime and rum.  While my friends were down on the non-alcohol version of my creation, they were positively ecstatic about my twist on rum punch.

review/summary: Vitamin C Plus Caffeine, but Weird Taste
review/text: This adds Vitamin C and caffeine to your water, which is great for people who are looking for that.  Caffeine may boost your workouts, and is the daily drug of choice for many of us, but watch out for side effects and don't over do it.<br /><br />The deal breaker for me on this one was taste.  It tastes sort of like sweet fruit punch Kool-Aid, with a pronounced aftertaste.  I strongly prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X5FYJQ">Optimum Nutrition Essential Amino Energy, Fruit Fusion</a>, a powdered caffeine add-on, or some of the Mio products.

review/summary: It's ok, but I'm into the powdered products
review/text: 1.  I'm definitely a fan of the powdered drinks and recently noticed the craze surrounding the concetrated liquid formula.  Bottomline, the taste is fine and I can see the benefit of being able to fine tune the taste for varying sizes of cups / H20.  But, in the end I was put off by the fact that you have to keep this stuff in the fridge and depending on how you squeeze it, it's inevitable that you're going to make a mess here or there.  I think it's much more versatile to utilize the powdered form (at least for me).

review/summary: Water flavorizer with vitamin C
review/text: My SO just doesn't like water and as a result doesn't drink enough liquids throughout the day.  This water flavorizer is much more convenient than powdered drink mixes and much cheaper than buying drinks from the vending machine at his workplace.  The vitamin C is an added bonus.<br /><br />As far as flavors go, each person tastes things differently and while my SO loves the fruit punch flavour, I find the one squeeze measurement either too sweet if it's a big squeeze or too watery if it's a medium squeeze.  I also find the flavor a bit too artificial for my tastes.<br /><br />The best way is to squeeze the product into your water bottle and then add the water to taste rather than the other way around.<br /><br />Overall recommended for those that don't like plain water and that like fruit punch in all its forms.

review/summary: Good but not great.
review/text: This isn't bad but it is a bit sweet for my taste. I have tried using less and that did help but then you are not getting the vitamins you are looking for. I really like the mio better.

review/summary: Definitely Not Mio
review/text: My kids (and husband) LOVE Mio, but it's so expensive that I was hoping that this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink would be a better alternative.<br /><br />It's not.<br /><br />From the moment they all took a sip I could see that it was going to go into the garbage pretty quickly. All of them said it tasted "kinda like Kool-Aid", but then they all grimaced and got went for the water. They all said it had a weird aftertaste (the 8 year old said her mouth tasted "funny"), and that they didn't want any more of it, or to finish the glass they had! So, yeah, Mio this is definitely not.

review/summary: I love it
review/text: This is a great product I am sure I'll buy many times.<br /><br />It's an easy way to get a small amount of caffeine easily.  The vitamins are also a great touch.  I feel better throughout the day when my water bottle has a little squirt of this in i.  The concentrated fluid is handy and lasts quite a long time, making this a strong value.<br /><br />It does use artificial sweeteners, and you can definitely taste that, but it's not bad tasting at all if you find artificial sweeteners tolerable (I do).  It's actually pretty good.<br /><br />It's a convenient way to spruce up water, stay alert, and get some nutrients.  An excellent value.

review/summary: Not half bad
review/text: Vitamin Squeeze flavors water and purports to give you vitamins and energy. I have tried a few of these water "enhancers" and I don't really like them that much. But I actually liked the Vitamin Squeeze. It's not my favorite thing, but it is not that bad. The flavor is fruit punch-like. It has a bit of a chemical aftertaste but it doesn't linger. I do not feel any noticeable burst of energy (not even a little bit). But, as water enhancers go, it is not that bad.
