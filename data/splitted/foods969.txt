review/summary: TERRIBLE TASTE
review/text: I was excited about receiving decaf tea, but it tastes absolutely horrible!  I can't even drink a full cup of it, I tried making it several different ways, but it is not good at all.  Just donated the unopened boxes of it to a food kitchen, I hope someone there enjoys it.  I love all different kinds of tea, but this was the worst I've ever had!

review/summary: Smooth not Bitter
review/text: Best chamomile on the mainstream supermarket shelves. Other chamomile teas have had a bitter aftertaste, but this one by Stash is really smooth and fresh. It's neither strong nor bland, just floral and pleasant. Reminds me slightly of chrysanthemum. It doesn't make me sleepy or keep me up, for what it's worth. I had some primo stuff at a local coffeeshop that tasted much like the Stash brand, but had an awesome citrusy floral aroma; been wanting to find something like that for a while, and so far this Stash Chamomile comes closest.

review/summary: Tatsteh Tea
review/text: This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!

review/summary: The freshest, fights edema!
review/text: This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc.. To give a specific example of this tea's well-preserved qualities: it really helps us get rid of extra water in our bodies, nearly as good as "water pills"  doctors recommend. One packet in a small cup does great.. And can be repeated if you need.  We have subscribed to receive it from Amazon on a regular basis - the price is better then in a supermarket.

review/summary: Absolutely the best tea I've ever had
review/text: I'm not a big tea drinker. I keep buying different types of tea convinced I'll like them, and each one turns out to be completely different than I anticipated. In other words, I think all teas taste generally the same: like hot water. Even with sugar - then they taste like hot water with sugar. But this tea is completely different.<br /><br />I love licorice. This tastes exactly like licorice. It smells like licorice (clearly from the anise, since licorice root basically smells like cooked bark). It doesn't need sugar. It's sweet. It has an 'aftertaste' of licorice. In other words, it's perfect.<br /><br />Unfortunately no store I've ever been to has carried it, although I look EVERY TIME I walk down the tea aisle. Even if they did, it wouldn't be that awesome, since this is pretty much the same exact price it would go for in, say, Target. Unfortunately it is 6 boxes...but I really don't think you can have enough of this stuff.<br /><br />After some trial-and-error, I can now say that, of the few other licorice teas that do exist, nothing really comes close to Stash. I've tried a weird Celestial tea  mix of  licorice root + 3 other things (tastes like hot water), Batavia Anise tea (hot water with a licorice aroma), and store brand Albrecht Heijn Zoethout tea (from the Netherlands - smells like hot bark but tastes exactly like this tea. Unfortunately it's completely nonexistent here.) What I've discovered on my quest fs that only a few brands even attempt to make JUST licorice tea (it's not popular here, and it baffles me that people don't appreciate the taste), and of those only Stash is successful.<br /><br />Buy it. Amazon is a good deal and it's soooo good.

review/summary: Too much of a licorice smell and taste
review/text: Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell. I am using it in a tea pot mixing with other teas then it is working better.

review/text: We first came across the Licorice flavored tea from Stash at a local Gourmet Market. The market has several locations locally but none close to home.<br />We loved the taste of this tea specially in the cold Michigan winters. It gives a calming effect and does help sooth your throat if you are coming up with a cold or something. A great product and I am happy with the fact that we can buy it on Amazon in bulk at a very good price.<br />If you love Herbal tea do try this product from Stash it is good. Thank you for carrying this tea and thank you Stash!

review/summary: Different and Tasty
review/text: I am a tea drinker from way back and Stash is an excellent tea.  This flavor has a smooth strawberry/pomegranate taste and is delicious.  It is a red tea (red in colour) and red because its primary ingredient is Rooibos, which is red tea and is slightly sweet.  Also included (in this order) are rosehips, hibiscus flowers, raspberry leaves, citric acid, and strawberry flavour and pomegranate flavour.<br /><br />I did some research on the health benefits of some of these ingredients.  This info is what I found reported in a few different sources:<br /><br />Rooibus tea:<br />Rooibus tea is rich in antioxidants and flavonoids and is reported to have 50 times more antioxidant power than green tea. It also has other antioxidants not found in other teas.  The effect of free radicals in the process of aging and declining of the immune system is limited by the antioxidants in Rooibus tea.  Rooibus tea is completely pure and natural .  It contains no additives, preservatives or colorant.  It is strongly recommended for those suffering from irritability, headaches, disturbed sleeping patterns, insomnia, nervous tension, mild depression or hypertension.  It has no caffeine and so has a soothing effect on the central nervous system.  Rooibus tea is low in tannin and so it does not have a negative effect on the absorption of iron and proteins into the body.  It has anti-spasmodic properties, thus relieving stomach cramps and colic in infants.  It also relieves stomach and indigestive problems like nausea, vomiting, hearrtburn, stomach ulcers and constipation. It supplements the daily amounts of calcium, manganese and flouride, and it contains zinc and alpha-hydroxy acid. I was also told that red tea does not have ECOG, a healthful property that green tea does have. That is why I drink both red tea and green tea, to get the best of all worlds.<br /><br />Rosehips is supposed to be good for infections, bladder problems, and diarrhea and also a good source of vitamin C.<br />Hibiscus flowers is supposed to be a diuretic (fluid release) and reported to help lower high blood pressure in people with Type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />If I had only two words to describe the taste of this tea, they would be fruity and smooth.  It is also caffeine free.  It is a nice change of pace from standard flavors and a nice after-dinner comfort drink.  Stash makes a good full bodied tea, stronger than some of these cheapie teas, so I find I only need one bag per a 24 oz cup. (Of course, that all depends on your preference.)  These special Stash flavors are a little hard to find because many stores do not carry them unless they have a super large tea display.<br /><br />BTW--I am not a doctor--(my disclaimer)--just someone who has done a lot of reading on alternative health care.  As with any product, consult your health cae provider, especially if you are on medications.

review/text: Stash's Cinnamon Apple Chamomile is a comforting blend of apples, hibiscus, chamomile and cinnamon. I use two teabags per cup as it gives the tea a much more full-bodied flavor. I've tasted quite a few cinnamon-apple teas and this one is my favorite. There is not too much cinnamon and just enough apple flavor. It is even more delicious when sweetened with a huckleberry honey. You will want to drink this tea while decorating for Christmas or while eating a piece of cake. This tea is especially good with the Butter Rum Cake from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811867811">All Cakes Considered</a>.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Hibiscus and Raspberry Delight
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?
review/text: I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor "blossomed" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea "dances around the sides of your tongue."  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the "flavor burst", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The "flavor burst" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil.

review/summary: Stashed Premium Chamomile Herbash
review/text: After a lengthy trek in the Himalayan Range, the Himalayas, or Himalayalabalyakamonkatonka for short, in Tibetan, (a mountain range in Asia, separating the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau), I was in bad shape.  First of all, my scrotum shrunk from the extended lack of healthy oxygen.  Secondly, I had all sorts of intestinal problems due to my diet of yak meat only.  Thirdly, I had plenty of holes in my socks and underpants.<br /><br />I eventually made it to a small town in China where I visited the local Apothecary.  A man, if I recall correctly, by the name of Ying Yang Ping Pong Luke, recommended Chamomile Herbal Tea.  I had often heard of the healing properties of it in old and ancient Zulu scripts (pictographic and ideographic) but had never tried it since I despised teas.<br /><br />Well, after a few months on a Chamomile Herbal Tea only diet plus brown rice, I was fixed up.  Chamomiles are medicinal plants.  They are  emmenagogues, stomachics, carminatives, diaphoretics, antispasmodics, and sedatives.<br /><br />In my case, Chamomile Herbal Tea fought intestinal gas and stimulated my gastric juices and encouraged my appetite.<br /><br />Stash Premium Chamomile Herbal Tea is very weak so some won't like it.  I do because you can drink a nice hot cup before bed and it helps you.  It has no flavor aside from a bitter taste of weed but again, I think of it more as a comfort Tea than something pleasurable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013HFBMQ">Neti Pot Starter Kit with 1.5 Oz Aromatic Salt Original Neti Pot Salt</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I21K18">Adagio Teas PersonaliTea 21-Ounce Ceramic Teapot with Infuser Basket</a><br /><br />Nature's Way - Chamomile Flowers, 350 mg, 100 capsules

review/summary: Great for colds/flu
review/text: This tea is a lifesaver during cold and flu season.  The ginger helps with an upset stomach, the lemon is uplifting and calming at the same time, and when you add some honey it's a great sore throat soother.  I love it and always keep some in my pantry.  I haven't tried it as an iced tea but it's great hot.

review/summary: quite good
review/text: I like this tea a lot.  We buy it in bulk.  I have found that you shouldn't leave the bag in the water too long; it acquires and odd taste then.  Otherwise it is flavorful and helps to clear out the phlegm.  Licorice is a natural expectorant.  I also use another product called: "Sanderson's Throat Specific Mixture" to help clear my throat.  It is an amazing product.

review/text: I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.

review/text: I had a hard time finding the tea I had purchased in the past at my local market.  They had stopped carring the flavor of tea I like eventhough they still carried Stash Tea products.  So I went on the internet and was directed to Amazon and found it right away.  Not only that, the pricing was very competitive and I received delivery including freight and handleing cheaper than I could purchase the tea at the market.  By the way Wild Rasberry Hibiscus is a very good flavor if anyone wants to be adventersome and try it.

review/text: I love the taste of this herbal tea, but twice now I noticed I have a rasping (breathing discomfort) that may or may not be triggered by it. I bought 4 boxes after trying a sampler but now I'm starting to think I may have a food sensitivity to one of the licorice spice ingredients. Damn shame, but I wanted to put it out there in case I wasn't the only one.

review/summary: The absolute best herbal tea
review/text: My sister suggested this tea to me.  I was looking for a good herbal tea to limit my caffeine, and one I could have in the evening.  Most herbal teas seem very weak to me.  I'm not a big licorice fan, but this doesn't taste strongly of licorice.  As one of the other reviewers said, it just gives you a slightly sweet, slightly licorice aftertaste, which is delightful.  It's great in the evening when I'm craving something sweet - and no calories or caffeine!

review/text: There are plenty of lemon flavored teas especially among well known brands.  I've bought most of them, used only a few tea bags and just didn't like them due to their artificial flavoring. Stash's Meyer Lemon is truly a good, natural tasting lemon.  I love it and have shared a couple of the extra boxes with friends.

review/summary: I'm Wild for this Wild Raspberry Tea
review/text: Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea makes great-tasting, refreshing iced tea at a fraction of the price, and a fraction of the footprint, of bottled beverages.<br /><br />Portland-based Stash Tea Company says that this tea is 100% natural.  The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings.

review/summary: fav Lemon Ginger tea so far...
review/text: I tried this tea for the first time at a restaurant - 1st time iced - cool & refreshing, 2nd time hot - mmmm. The taste leans more to the ginger side and not the lemon. I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

The tea has a very pleasant aroma, doesn't need sweetners or extra stuff of any kind, and has a very "smooth" taste. There is an aftertaste that lingers for just a moment that really makes this an excellent choice for black licorice lovers.

review/text: This is the herbal remedy of choice for those times when I something gross, such as anything from McNasty's or Nasty King. I mix it double-strength in a tall clear glass with 12 ounces of water. I like to watch it change color for five minutes, then I sip it and enjoy the sweet relief. The flavor is lemony, but not overly so, with a good ginger kick. Caffeine free. Excellent. I'd recommend this over Tums or Nasty Bismo any day, and it works better too. Peppermint tea and licorice tea are also good choices for indigestion. Also look into digestive enzymes.

review/summary: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea
review/text: Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.

review/summary: STOP, Read my review before consuming this product
review/text: Ask a Chinese friend about "forbidden rice" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  "Forbidden rice?"<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as "forbidden rice" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.

review/text: This syrup is perfect for adding a touch of chocolate flavor to something that already has a relatively strong flavor, like coffee.  I've also used it, along with low-carb chocolate chunks, to make tasty meringue cookies.<br />If you're expecting thick chocolate-y syrup, you need to lower your expectations, but if you'd like a sweetener with a chocolate kick to it and you're avoiding carbs, I recommend this and any of the other Torani sugar free flavors (my faves are caramel, peach, and strawberry).

The sugar-free syrups are every bit as sweet as the regular syrups, but without all the calories - and no after-taste that you can get with some sugar-free products.  Torani is half the cost of Starbucks syrups, and taste every bit as good.  Plus, Starbucks doesn't offer a sugar-free chocolate!  We have purchased Torani syrups several times - and always happy with the products.

It doesn't have a strong chocolate flavor, but it is pleasantly sweet.  I couldn't taste any strong chemical after taste, like I can with some other SF chocolate products.  Not enough to satisfy a real chocoholic, but not bad, either.  I'm gonna keep looking for a really tasty SF chocolate syrup.

review/summary: Well, I like the flavor!
review/text: I'm kind of surprised at some of the reviews about this particular flavor...maybe it depends on what you use it in? I use the chocolate flavor in my morning smoothie to make "Chocolate Covered Strawberries" smoothies and it works super....love the deep flavor of the chocolate.  So for smoothies, I definitely recommend this flavor, as well as the vanilla, black cherry, and raspberry.

review/summary: One of our favorite flavors for coffee.
review/text: We bought the sugar free variety pack in order to get a feel for a few flavors.  Out of 6 flavors, we find ourselves grabbing the chocolate & vanilla most frequently.<br /><br />I will say that I have only used this in coffee mixed with almond milk.  I have not used it in any recipes or added to anything else, but to use in coffee was the sole reason I purchased the syrups.<br /><br />The chocolate is not overpowering for coffee, but gives it a very nice flavor.  I heat some almond milk on the stove & froth 1/8 cup syrup with the heated milk (I bought a cheap no frills <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013VALOK">Norpro 89 Glass Cappuccino Frother - Boxed</a>frother here on Amazon around the same time) & add it to my hot coffee.<br />Not exactly Starbucks but pretty darned good.  I like knowing I'm cutting calories & sugar without adding the extra 'stuff' found in the ingredient list of the sf/ff non-dairy creamers found at the grocery store.<br /><br />We don't have any problems with Splenda, so we don't notice any after tastes or weird flavors.  Just mild chocolate complimenting our coffee.<br /><br />We do like to mix & match the flavors and just in case you're interested - the chocolate goes well with both the caramel & the hazelnut!

review/summary: Very bland, but priced OK, and taste just OK
review/text: I have bought cases and cases of this stuff over the years.  I am really shocked at how watered-down this product has become.  I thought it was me just getting used to it, but it is not.  I have become very frustrated with Torani's tampering with and reformulating their syrups.  Even compared to their "sugar-ful" syrup, I find that I have to use almost twice as much of this product.  I have found a similar story with other Torani Sugar-Free syrups.  It seems they are making up for the trivial cost of the artificial sweetener and giving you less.<br /><br />As a result, I have been trying many other sugar-free (and sugar-ful) syrups -- and spending a lot, too.  In comparison, Monin O'Free chocolate syrup is roughly 2X as flavorful/concentrated, but sadly, it is about 2X as much cost.  Plus, you may have to pay S/H.  While the Torani flavor is pretty good (slight chemical taste), the Monin is a bit malty, so I would give the Torani the edge.  I have also tried DaVinci's sugar-free chocolate syrup.  It probably has the best taste, but like Torani, it is watered down.  DaVinci's is a bit more on the bittersweet side.  At twice the cost, however, it is hard to justify when a bottle only lasts about a week (> $1 per big mug of coffee).<br /><br />Hopefully, others can post what good sugar-free syrups they find.  I hope my review and comparison was helpful.

review/summary: Perfect for coffee
review/text: I needed something to improve my morning brew.  Since chocolate is my favorite flavor, I tried this.  At first I was disappointed.  It certainly wasn't like any syrup I'd encountered before.  I soon learned to get a real chocolaty flavor you had to add a tablespoon, rather than a teaspoon of flavoring.  More for a supersized mug.  But, it's a big bottle and lasts quite a while.  Works in coffee.  Does not work as a substitute for Hersey's (or anyone else's) syrup.  I'm hooked.  It is, what it is--sugar free syrup to flavor your coffee.  Have already reordered this product.

review/summary: Very Unpleasant Aftertaste
review/text: I recently purchased a bottle each of the Sugar Free Chocolate and the regular Vanilla because I had two $1.00 coupons for this product, and I thought why not try it, as I love coffee and thought this product may be a nice treat to add to my coffee. After drinking two or three cups of coffee with either the regular Vanilla or the Sugar Free Chocolate, I can tell you that the regular Vanilla is okay but nothing to get excited about, and the Sugar Free Chocolate leaves everything to be desired.  After trying two flavours, I certainly would not rush to send emails to friends and family to tell them of a great find for their coffee.<br /><br />The sugar free leaves behind a very, very unpleasant aftertaste in my opinion, even though I am used to diet soda, etc. The aftertaste is so strong and so unpleasant that the only way I am able to get rid of the aftertaste is to brush my teeth!  Something that is delicious does not make you want to brush your teeth after drinking it.  The regular Vanilla was better than the Sugar Free Chocolate, but of course, it has a whopping 20 sugars per serving, which is more than a can of regular soda. Twenty sugars is a very high sugar count, and it is very fattening, so the sugared varieties are not something one would want to use regularly unless one was intentionally trying to put on weight.<br /><br />Also, I have noticed that these syrups tend NOT to remain well mixed in my coffee despite the fact that I stir well.  I plan to offer the bottle of Sugar Free Chocolate to a friend (albeit with a warning) because the aftertaste is just too unpleasant for me.  The Sugar Free Chocolate should be called Bitter Chocolate in my opinion.  I even added real sugar to my coffee with the Sugar Free Chocolate, and not even real sugar helped!  The Sugar Free version is simply a waste of money in my opinion.  If adding real sugar does not improve the taste, you know there is something in this product which is not very good, and I think it is the Splenda sugar substitute.  Personally, I have always found Equal to be the best sugar substitute.  I have never used Splenda or products containing Splenda before, but I think Equal would have been a much, much better choice for sugar substitution here.<br /><br />My advice is not to purchase the sugar free varieties because they are just not very tasty and leave such an unpleasant aftertaste. Buy the regular varieties, if you must, and use them once in a while as a treat in your coffee or your soda instead of having a dessert for example.  Also, be prepared to keep your spoon in cup in order to keep stirring your coffee before each sip to keep the syrup mixed in the coffee, otherwise, it separates and can be seen to sort of float on the top in a very unappealing way. I cannot understand why it will not stay well mixed in coffee. There is a lot of room for improvement of this product.

review/text: The liquid, not syrup, has very little chocolate flavor. The liquid has a unusal and unpleasing after taste. Chocolate or any form of chocolate  are not in the ingredient list on the bottle. None of the recipes from the TORANI web site uses their chocolate syrups, they use real chocolate. The liquid made with SPLENDA, not syurp which is made with sugar, has a slite sweet taste. The final conclusion that it was a waste of money. It will most likely end up in the trash.

review/summary: Good heat and good flavor
review/text: This sauce has a good delicately balanced flavor, I can understand why it is a favorite sauce among it's fans.  The flavor is balanced with no one particular one ingredient taking over.  It is a farily simple hot sauce flavor profile with vinegar, garlic and onion boosted with citrus to make it interesting.<br /><br />I have to admit, it was not quite as hot as I was expecting after seeing it had both habaneros and pepper extract in the ingredients, and from the many warnings on the label about how dangerously hot it was.  Don't be fooled though, this is still a very, very hot sauce.  I have had other sauces without extracts that were as hot as this which is the only reason I bring this up.  I suppose it could be possible the batch I got was weak for some reason and I did not get a typical sample.<br /><br />This is a good sauce, I would recommend it to others.

My only gripe is I pay $7.95+tax in the store but here I see the price is much more when you add in shipping. In fact, the shipping of this 5 fl. oz bottle, almost doubles the price of the actual product.

review/text: I have yet to encouter a dog that doesn't enjoy Dingos. From the youngest puppy to the oldest senior, they all have loved the various Dingo bones and treat.<br /><br />The biggest challenge is buying a size big enough to prevent the dog from eating it rather than chewing it.  This is not true of all dogs, but if the dog has food or treat issues it can be a consideration.  They really lovethese treats and seem to not want to be patient or risk not getting the entire bone. And most of the dogs I have given these to also tend to want to chew them from start to finish, so I do have to take the treat away from a dog occasionally.<br /><br />There are Dingo imitators out there that cost less, but I have yet to find one that is of similar quality. I have tried a couple and will continue to sample others, but so far there is not a generic Dingo equivalent.

review/summary: Happy dog
review/text: My dog loves these bones. She isn't interested in pure rawhide anymore, but somehow the red flavored whatever wrapped in this bone makes her happy. Dog drugs? :)

review/summary: Dog loves them, chews on the little pieces for weeks!
review/text: I used to order the small ones for my chihuahua, but now she can demolish those in a day. This medium sized one lasts her longer and she ends up chewing on the little pieces she has left over for weeks. I imagine they must taste good because she sure does go at them!

review/summary: The Dogs Love 'em !
review/text: All my dogs love these bones. They won't touch regular rawhide.I have three small dogs and I get these big dingo bones because only the largest one (a cockapoo) can actually make any noticeable headway in chewing them. So she starts them and the other two finish them over the course of a few weeks. This way, they are not so pricey and they are large enough that the choking concern is diminished. But because of other reviews, I still am in the room when they are chewing them.

review/summary: My Favorite Mass-Market Jerky
review/text: Sugar Ray's Honey Chipotle is my absolute favorite jerky available in average/common stores.  Its not too soft or too hard. Just enough density to give a satisfying chew without overworking my jaw muscles. And the flavor is fantastic! A little sweet with a gentle kick of spice. You say "gentle kick", what is that? Enough spice to warm my mouth, but not tear me up or make my nose run. Also enough spice to keep the vultures (my kids) from wanting more than just a taste.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price.  This jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products...I just can't resist the flavor! Haha.  So if you don't like the price, don't try it.  Like me, you might not be able to go back to your old jerky.

review/summary: Tastes Great, Completely Fat Free!
review/text: I was looking for a snack that was high in protein but low in fat so I started looking at Beef Jerky, but all the other brands have at least some sort of fat in them, usually a minimum of 1g, which may not sound like much, but when you're dieting, every gram counts. So when I found this brand I was very pleased. It tastes great and did I mention it has zero fat? Oh yeah, I did. But each service (28 oz) only has 50 calories, no carbs and some good protein. Switch to this brand/style. You won't be displeased.
