review/summary: One more time
review/text: This is a second time purchase for me, first time from Amazon.  I used up all the lovely blooming teas and cherished the glass teapot that I used for microwaving water for beverages.  When it took a tumble after Christmas, I knew I had to replace it.<br /><br />What a delight to find that Amazon had the set in stock!<br /><br />These teas are to die for - so BEAUTIFUL and tasty and not easily obtained.  The teapot is a keeper and shows the lovely blooms in all their glory and even the packaging, two separate bamboo storage boxes no less, will survive long after the thrill of the tea is gone.<br /><br />This makes and AWESOME gift - as evidenced by my gifting myself twice now with it!

review/summary: Flowering tea
review/text: Sale price was excellent. Tea flowers are awesome and fun to watch. After the tea is poured, more water can be added just to display the flower for a day if you like.  Flavor is not the focus.  It was hard to see in the ad that the glass teapot does not actually have a classic spout.  It simply has a lip like a small pitcher.  The good thing about that is that the pot can be filled very full for good flower display.  But I still like spouted pots better.

review/summary: Nice tasting, pretty looking tea!
review/text: I have seen Numi teas around at my local coffee and tea shops. I found this on a Gold Box Deal and decided to try it out. I like how the tea bud blossoms and looks so nice when the tea is steeped. The only negative is the small teapot. I have this at work, and have to bring hot water to my desk, then pour in the teapot otherwise the teapot gets extremely hot, too hot to the touch. Even pouring it into a cup when the tea is steeped needs to be done with caution. Otherwise for the price, its a nice variety of special teas, for any occasions!

review/summary: TEArrific (sorry...couldn't help myself)
review/text: This is one of the loveliest presentations of a product that I have ever received.  And then you get to drink it! The "bamboo trunk" container with the glass pot at center surrounded by the teas is just gorgeous.<br /><br />However, I will say that as for re-using the tea flower more than once, I personally have not.  To me it is such an enchanting (and delicious) pleasure that I do not mind consuming the tea and then discarding the flower. And then just preparing a new flower when I want another cup of tea at a later time. It makes the moment extra special.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, I enjoyed this product so much so that I went ahead and purchased two more to give as holiday gifts.  Can't think of a stronger recommendation then that.

review/summary: Unique gift box, hides a drinkable work of art!
review/text: My wife had some serious doubts about this as a gift, but after she opened it up and watch the flowering tea blossom and then tried the tea she has been converted.  It really is a nice item to give to a friend who enjoys teas... as this gift gets you to relax.  It is pretty much true what a previous reviewer listed as far as what you can get out of this tea flower, three is really pushing it.  Each of the flowering teas was a winner, no complaints.  The box is a good size, but the pot is on the smaller euro scale rather than your American 42 oz big gulp.

review/text: Numi teas are a real treasure. For starters, watching the tea leaf flowers open up is so calming. One opened, the flowers are simply beautiful.  Each sip is delicious and knowing the amount of work and love that went into each cup you drink makes this tea truly special.  For the tea drinker on your list, this is truly a little bit of luxury in a bamboo box.

review/text: I think this product is fun.  The presentation of the tea blooming in the clear pot is so beautiful and the tea has a great flavor.  I just wish they made some blooming teas that were decafinated.  The only reason it did not get 5 stars is some of the tea fell apart in the water as the sewing came apart so it never bloomed.  It is definately worth the purchase though.

review/summary: expensive and disappointing
review/text: I bought this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day.  I was very excited for her to receive the Numi flowering tea set with bamboo basket because she is an avid tea drinker.  _After_ ordering I was informed that this item was on backorder and would not arrive until the week following Mother's Day (May 13).  It did not arrive until May 25th.  I saw it this weekend and was very disappointed with the quality of the tea flowers (a big mushy ugly mess in the tiny teapot provided) and with the bamboo box it was sent in (very cheap).  This was surprising to me considering how much I paid and the quality I associate with the Numi brand normally.  Don't buy this if you're expecting a beautiful and lavish gift set.  It's not.

review/summary: A Beautiful Christmas Gift for my Daughter
review/text: My daughter loves organic tea. I bought this for Christmas. It came already gift wrapped in white tissue paper (I didn't request wrapping, so I think the company provides it for free).<br /><br />There was a pretty glass teapot and 6 certified organic tea flowers inside of a gorgeous keepsake box. My daughter made a pot on Christmas morning. It was delicious and the flower was gorgeous. What a luxury! We got about 4 cups of delicious tea from one tea flower. This would be great to bring out when you have a guest over.<br /><br />The kit was of exceptional quality and the presentation was beautiful. This would make a great gift for yourself or anyone who loves tea. I wish I would have bought two of them and now it appears that Amazon is temporarily sold out.

review/text: I received a set of blooming tea for Christmas.Most of the teas are really good but they are all just so interesting. One way to enjoy the set longer is that when the tea flavor is done if you just want to look at the creation(flower or grass or whatever just drain it off and put cold water in the pot.I have the drogon one in water for 4 days now. It sits right beside me. I just change the water when it gets too yellow.I wish I would of thought to do this sooner because this is my last one of the ones that came w/the set. It would have given me even more joy....

I was told it was the best gift they've gotten in years (over and over again), and everyone at the party I went to was "oooooing and ahhhhing" over the beautiful blooms.  As a bonus, the tea was great!  I don't understand the bland reviews.  Definitely worth the cost, thanks Numi and amazon.<br /><br />Again addressing the scary negative reviews, there was absolutely no dirt/mud in or around the box and packaging.  I took the gift out of the amazon box and wrapped a red ribbon around it (the bamboo box comes wrapped in nice white paper), and it was good to go.

review/summary: High Mountain Magic. Food of the Gods
review/text: I consider Quinoa to be one of the most versatile and valuable foods available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, "nutrition" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of "yummy.").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to "gourmet it" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As "rice" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with "noodle heaven"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As "oatmeal" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, cream, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />-- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid (water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa (Note that some brands vary this ratio slightly; check their instructions on the product package).<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12 15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl (use a large one with lots of room above the grain and water to avoid the mess of boiling over) then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Depending on power levels and volume of food, a microwave sometimes cooks 4 times faster than "outside the waves" cooking.  As an example of time variance with larger amounts of food: 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8  16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (�) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate lid; zap it for another minute or half, then let it steep in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate lid I can just place it on the table for family style digging in.<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />Recently, Health Best Quinoa, Alter Eco Fair Trade, Arrowhead Mills, Berry Farm, Eden, Now Foods, and Angelina's have been added to my list of purveyors of Quinoa.<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm also very confident in ordering their Quinoa as well.<br /><br />The reviews on Quinoa Red were helpful. In addition to the most common golden grain, I've only seen black Quinoa, which is also appealing, and is reportedly the oldest variety. Well, actually all the reviews I've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I've already gathered.<br /><br />*** Though I would happily purchase any of the available Quinoa offerings on Amazon, currently I'm favoring HEALTH BEST QUINOA and ALTER ECO FAIR TRADE for my personal use. The extra details of info on the Alter Eco Fair Trade buying pages were appreciated, and Health Best has an economical packaging proportioning to pricing. I feel that these two purveyors provide a grain close enough to what the original seeds were intended to be.  I usually look at the proportion of water to 1 cup Quinoa called for in the purveyor's recipe.  I look for the recipe to call for 2 cups water to 1 cup Quinoa.  Any different proportion, in my opinion, means something may have been altered with the grain or packaging.  I also prefer to rinse the Quinoa myself, but at times Bob's Red Mill's pre-rinsed option is a blessing. ***<br /><br />(I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store, which is no longer open; I spend all my time writing now, with a little cooking on the side.)<br /><br />Quinoa has an interesting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />-- The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varmints, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the "naked" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise old grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eon's younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000 foot elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of "health"?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had lived and evolved long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several KINDLE books including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026MT02E">The DAYS of COFFEE & DONUTS: Non Toxic Soapbox Satire: Who or What is De-Kindling Life?

review/summary: A Great Addition to Our Diet
review/text: Quinoa!!  Where has this been all my life?  What a great grain.  I've put it in muffins and mixed it together with rice and made fried rice.  I've also added cooked quinoa to pancakes and I've popped it for an extra kick.  All the recipes I've seen mentions rinsing the quinoa first.  Some brands of quinoa are sold pre-rinsed and it says this on those bags.  However, nothing is mentioned on this brand about whether it is pre-rinsed.  I rinsed the quinoa the first time I used it, but, after losing half of it down the drain, I decided to forego the rinsing process.  I taste no bitterness; the quinoa tastes great. The grain is small and round, but not as small as the amaranth grain.  Quinoa is as easy to work with as rice.  The Aztecs were on to something!  The packages arrived from Amazon intact.  There were no stray grains rolling around in the box.  You might be able to find this amazing grain near you if you live in a big city, but we are in a rural area.  It's nice that this food is offered through Amazon and free shipping is available.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6GPO">Health Best Quinoa, 14-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Miracle-gro for the garden
review/text: I've only been gardening for a few years, and this is the first fertilizer I ever used.  A few days after applying this product, all of my "struggling" garden plants seemed to get over their iffy stage and just took off.  I have a very finicky ivy geranium in particular that was struggling for a year and now it's gorgeous.  I went to the nursery recently for more fertilizer advice and they told me not to use miracle gro because it's full of unnatural chemicals, and gave my an organic dry fertilizer instead.  I've definitely noticed that my plants had fewer blooms and growth with the new fertilizer, so I switched back and couldn't be happier.  But minus one star for it's chemically-ness.

review/summary: Lush Plants Originate Here
review/text: I used to use fish emulsion on my garden. I got that tip from working at a garden center when I was in college. People used to buy the stuff like crazy and my mother became a fish emulsion lover because the stuff worked.<br />Fish emulsion is stinky and messy. The stuff is so bad that it can induce vomiting. However, that was then and Miracle-Gro is now.<br />This product works like a charm, is every big as effective a fish emulsion, but without the negatives.<br />Follow the directions as stated on the label, water, and then bask in the compliments. It is just that easy. I prefer the liquid Miracle-Gro because it disperses quickly and is easy to use. There is no mess or unpleasant odor. It works quickly and within the matter of 1 to 2 weeks the results are very noticeable. This is the best plant food ever.

review/summary: Dilution Required = Mixing Required
review/text: The directions on the bottle state that one should mix 1/3 captul of product with 2 gallons of water.  The cap does not have any markings, inside or out, to show 1/3 capful.  Two gallons of water weigh about 16 lbs, so it's a very heavy watering can with one batch of the mix.  I've made a guess as to how much product to mix into a 2-gallon watering can, and will apply that to my plants and see if it was close to being the right amount.<br /><br />Amazon's description should not say "no mixing required."  It would be helpful if Amazon would determine how many Tbsps are in 1/3 cap and include that information.

That makes Miracle-Gro among the first public companies to act on the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v.

This action is clearly fertilizer, but of the more traditional kind.  Traditional, natural fertilizer from bulls, chickens or other sources is a far better choice for your plants.

Compare General Mills' Frosted Cheerios with Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, for instance, or Tricks with Fruit Loops.<br />My only complaint is Tricks and Lucky Charms.

review/text: Ginger candy is one of my favorite things to eat (besides chocolate and cinammon!) If you drink Ginger Beer (a strong Jamaican-style Ginger ale) then you know that Reed's is one of the best ones around. That being said, their crystallized candy is tasty, but absolutely looks terrible. The hot, spicy, sugary pieces are extremely small, jagged and look like rubber plugs. Some even look unappetizing  -- although the taste is fantastic. And I know, if you're a ginger candy fanatic -- like myself -- the price is right. (Most know that ginger candy is expensive, so this buy 12 bags in bulk is a steal).<br /><br />I know that you aren't supposed to judge a book by its cover, and if ginger candy is your thing, you won't be disappointed with Reed's Candy in spite of its looks. And yes, I would definitely buy this package again simply for taste alone.<br /><br />One side note I thought I'd throw in: Ginger's great for medicinal purposes for calming your tummy -- if you've got constant stomach upsets, nausea, etc;.

They charged my credit card and I generously allowed time for  shipping. Finally after two months, I emailed the Chief Operating Officer that I have not received my order. I was told they do not ship to APO (military address) and yet charged my credit card two months prior. I then asked for a refund as it was too late for charge reversal by the  credit card company. I never heard back (and never got the refund) even after a repeat email and phone message. So much for customer service.

review/summary: Easy To Recommend, Hard To Put Down
review/text: I have to say that it was an easy call buying Reed's ginger, because I love their ginger ale. I'd say if you enjoy their ginger ale, you'll LOVE this, because I'm pretty sure it's the same ginger! The pieces are fairly uniform and a good size, cubed, and not overly sugared. The flavor is hot, not like overly mature ginger, but on the hot end. Don't get me wrong, it's a heat I love, but compared to my other favorite (The Ginger People) it's the spicy end of the spectrum.<br /><br />This ginger has a unique flavor and color; more of a deep orange color with a complex flavor that is... again... reminiscent of Reed's ginger ale and I love it! I'm not entirely sure what kind of ginger it is, because it's different from most that I've eaten, but not in anything like a bad way. Still, it should be noted that it DOES have that full and complex ginger flavor, and a strong one. If you want some sweet confection with light ginger flavor... this is not it. If you want a bold ginger that still has the smooth texture and taste of baby ginger, this is definitely it.<br /><br />That's the other wonderful thing about Reed's... this is clearly BABY ginger, and that means when you bite into a chunk you won't have fiber strands in your teeth. Too much crystallized ginger is made from fully mature ginger (which is great) and ends up prejudicing people... they believe crystallized ginger = blazing heat and a tough chew. This is hot, but not that, "ow my mouth!" experience of mature ginger. I give it four stars only because of my personal preference, and while I love this ginger, the unique taste of whatever type it is ranks second in my book. I want to be clear however, that it's purely a matter of preference, and I suspect many people will prefer this ginger.<br /><br />Finally, this ginger would make some amazing tea, and while baking with it would take some chopping, I would definitely make the effort. All I can say that I love this crystallized ginger, and anyone who enjoys it should give this a try. You may find that you have a new favorite type of ginger, and if not, you're still almost certainly going to enjoy it like crazy.<br /><br />I know that a lot of people eat ginger for health purposes, but I can't speak to that. I CAN attest that of all the gingers I've tried for motion sickness, this wins hands down. Maybe it's the variety of ginger, or the contrast between the strong ginger, but not painful or rough that does it... I don't know. I'm a skeptical person, so of course this is just anecdotal evidence, but I can only say that it's STRONG anecdotal evidence.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a tasty, hot and sweet, perfectly textured ginger that has a unique taste that is hard to put down.

review/summary: GOOD TO HAVE HANDY
review/text: I think of this product more as a first aid tool--motion sickness, digestive troubles. An alternative to over-the-counter medications.  The science behind it is strong. Do not listen to medical people who dismiss it as "quackery".<br /><br />I would keep it in my glove compartment and cupboard. Strong ginger taste (either you love or you don't) balanced by the cane sugar, which ensures rapid assimilation.

review/summary: Nice!
review/text: I became addicted to crystalized ginger from eating The Ginger People's Organic baby ginger. That one is my favorite. This one is a very close second. The difference between the two? This one is a mite tougher and out of 5 bags, I've found about 3 pieces that are just too fibrous to swallow. The ginger people's organic is as soft as gumdrops. The Reed's are spicier also so if you like them spicy, you would prefer these. I see nothing wrong with their look or color as one reviewer stated. They look like what they are. They're delicious!

The flavor it very good.  My son (who is 2) also enjoys them.  They have a good, strong ginger flavor, but it's not too much.  I'm glad we got so many little bags of them cause they will stay fresh longer.  The texture is good.  The pieces are firm to hold but soft to chew.  I'd recommend this product to someone dealing with morning sickness, or any ginger fan.  I'm both, and quite pleased!

review/text: I bought these for my wife for her morning sickness. Those "Preggie Pops" are expensive, and I thought since they are essentially ginger candies, and since it's the ginger that helps with the nausia that I could find a cheaper alternative.<br /><br />Well the verdict is that the crystalized ginger is too spicy. My wife doesn't like raw ginger anyway, but she drinks Gigner Ale soda, so I thought that this product would be similar to that, but it was too spicy for her, and now I'm stuck with a bunch of crystalized ginger that nobody is going to eat.

review/summary: Great Stuff!!
review/text: Looking at all the different light mayos available in my local grocery store, the Hellmans Light is the lowest in calories - 35/tbs. - as compared to Kraft at 45, and Duke's at 50. I've tasted the Kraft, which I don't like as much, and didn't even bother with the Duke's since the calorie count was so much higher. The Hellmans tastes great, and there's only 1 gram of carbs, so they haven't replaced the fat with sugar. The only drawback would be the squeeze bottle, because you can't really get all the mayo out, and when there's less in the bottle it's harder to squeeze it out and I end up using a knife anyway. But I get it through Subscribe-and-Save, so the price just can't be beat.

review/summary: Better than cream of wheat!
review/text: I ordered this & am very happy with my purchase. It tastes great & I'm happy I don't have to worry about eating pesticides and gunk for breakfast, and neither does my family. I'm especially happy, since winter's coming up. A nice, hot bowl of this cereal in the morning will really hit the spot! I'm glad that the cereal is not fortified with synthetic vitamins. I go through a great deal of trouble to make sure my vitamins are the best quality & easily assimilated into my system. I don't even use lotion that uses fake vitamin e oil.. So this is a great thing for me. I don't have to worry about man-made synthetic stuff clogging up my system & not being able to be absorbed by my body & if it does get absorbed, I don't have to worry about any consequences.<br /><br />One other thing that I really like about Bob's Red Mill products is that they're stone ground. I prefer stone-ground over using metal. People have lived for thousands of years, before the time of Pharaohs using stone ground grains. If it was good enough for them, it's good enough for me! Farina is also less processed than "cream of wheat".. Less processed is a good thing in my book!<br /><br />The only thing that I could complain about is the packaging. I would rather it come in a resealable bag, but it doesn't. That would make it more convenient to use and to store, but you can put it in a ziploc bag or in some sort of canister, so it's not that big of an issue. You just have to remember when it expires and use it before then.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say about this product.. It tastes as good, if not better than cream of wheat, doesn't have pesticides and synthetic vitamins, it's inexpensive & with free shipping for a whole case of it, you really can't go wrong.. Unless you're allergic to wheat. lol In which case I doubt you'd be looking to purchase this anyway! My recommendation is to go for it. :) This item also has a decent shelf life (around 2-3 years), so it would be great to stock up on as a food source if your power went out or something like that. Just be sure to store water, so you can hydrate it (and yourself).

I picked up a bag the other day on a whim to help my sweet craving while on a diet - one piece a day.  I forgot how lovely this chocolate is! One piece can be savored for 15 minutes because the flavor of each small nibble can last for several minutes.  The experience is super smooth on the tongue (not grainy at all as someone mentioned. If that happens, the chocolate must have been in a batch that wasn't temp controlled and it "bloomed.") With this chocolate you'll experience a tangy, fruity flavor that floods the mouth leaving your chocolate craving fully satisfied.  Delightful!

review/summary: Symphony in Chocolate
review/text: My new favorite chocolate is Ghirardelli Intense Dark Twilight Delight, 72% cacao. It's not as sweet as milk chocolate, and not as one-dimensional as, say, Dove's dark chocolate. The pieces melt in your mouth, starting out with a burst of dark chocolate but as they melt and flow onto your tongue, you get a very distinct cocoa bean effect. Slightly acidic, even a hint of bitterness. You sense a graininess, even though there are no particles in the candy, just smooth liquid chocolate. After it is done melting on your tongue, an aftertaste remains in your mouth which is sweet but not sugary, almost like the dryness remaining after a good Merlot. This sensation lasts for a good half hour or more.<br /><br />It's a symphony for the taste buds.

review/summary: A TASTY TREAT
review/text: I have always been a big fan of macadamia nuts  but the Mauna Loa brand is by far the best around.  They are always fresh, buttery tasting and salty..but not too much.  They possess that little crunch that turns into a melt in your mouth flavor and leads you to reach for one after another!  Beware..they are high in calories and they do cost somewhat dearly.  I have found that buying these 3 packs is quite cost effective and seem to last quite a while as I keep them hidden away.  For those of you that like to keep these lovely tasting nuts on hand, please know that placing them in freezer proof bags and storing them in the freezer will keep them fresh for at least a year if you wish to hold onto them for that long.  ( All nuts can go bad if left in cupboards for long periods of time.)

review/summary: The best nuts, a little pricey
review/text: I am addicted to Mauna Loa Macadamia nuts.  I normally buy them from Costco where they are very reasonable in price.  Because of the shortage, I gave in to looking on the internet and came across these from Amazon.  They are smaller and only halves, but just as good.  I would give them 5 stars, but the price keeps it from getting there when you can buy them locally.  (They have become available again at some Costco stores.)  I have tried several brands and packages from other suppliers.  Mauna Loa is the best by far.

review/summary: Good nuts
review/text: One of our office workers went to Hawaii, so I broke these out to share while he was gone.  It was a hit, I was asked for more - so I pulled out the pistachio's that I also purchased.

review/summary: My  favorite personal treat
review/text: For some reason Mauna Loa Macadamias are nt available at our local grocery stores any longer.  Thank goodness I can always depend on Amazon!  They arrived within days of placing the order, and were just what I needed.  Great service, great product.

review/summary: Hawaiian grown Macadamia nut is awesome.
review/text: Just recently our local Costco (formerly Price Club) discount store discontinued carrying item in their stock inventory. I'm not going to find out the reason why, but my craving for the Mac nut stays. Ordering online is a little bit pricey (s/h included) and the only source. There are also  local nut store that carries Macadamia nut but not Hawaiian grown. I guess I will just have to re-acquire my old taste for less expensive peanuts or perhaps almond or cashews.

review/summary: Best Macadamia Nuts available
review/text: These are the best Macadamia nuts available.  I prefer the larger bags like this as the nuts are usually larger and more often whole as compared to the small cans.  A smooth buttery taste and a sizable helping of "good" fats make these a great treat for everyone.

review/summary: Great Value! Excellent Product!
review/text: After searching for quite some time, I came across this 3 pack of Macadamia Nuts at a great price. They shipped quickly, they were very fresh. Finally I can enjoy Macadamia Nuts again. I was so happy with the price and the product, I had them put on an automatic shipment. BUT, my Only complaint is they are out-of-stock and don't know when they will be shipped again.
