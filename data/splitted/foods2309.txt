review/summary: I can have cookies, and be gluten free! YAY!
review/text: I actually bought these at a local natural/health food market. They were insanely expensive and I wish I would have tried amazon first! Still, I LOVE these cookies, I got the EXTREME chocolate mini cookies and they're delicious! Even my kids like them and they can be fairly picky. They're loving getting to try all of my "new gluten-free things!", and I may be moving them gluten-free as well.<br /><br />These cookies have a wonderful flavor, texture, and crunch. I find myself happy with just 2-4 of them, instead of just wanting to devour the entire package considering the small size of the cookies. Size wise they remind me of the chocolate chip cookies you can get in that mixed pack of grandma cookies? I think that's what they are, they have the frosted animal cookies, and those chocolate chip ones. Anyway, they're smaller cookies, good flavor, good crunch, gluten-free and great price here at amazon. What more can you really ask for anymore? ;)

review/text: Our whole family loves these ginger snap cookies.  We have tried all 3 varieties, and they are all great.  I last ordered the ginger snaps in December, and they were about $3 per bag.  When I went to reorder, the price had gone up significantly ( to about $5).  I noticed the other 2 varieties were available through Amazon and are still reasonably priced, and this one is available through Nutricity.  Please make this variety available again through Amazon. Pamela's makes awesome bread mix and pancake mix, too.

review/summary: The adventure begins!
review/text: Now that my doctor & I have decided that a gluten-free diet would be a help with some GI difficulties, the adventure to find healthy snacks that won't cause any  problems has begun. The first item I've added to my list of new favorite treats are these Pamela's mini ginger snaps (or should I say snapz!) There really crunchy, just the way I like a cookie and very flavorful. They're great with a coffee or the traditional cold glass of milk. These are, indeed, among the best ginger snaps of any sort, gluten-free or otherwise, that you are likely to find. Delicious anytime!

review/summary: Pamela's Ginger Snapz - 4 out of 5.
review/text: I am allergic to wheat, soy, corn, and peanuts. I like the fact that this product wheat free, soy free, corn free, gluten free peanut free and to top everything off it's certified kosher. In my opinion the ginger snapz tasted good ... very 'snappy' - for lack of a better word. When you are allergic to the things I am allergic to you read the labels/ingredients of foods/snacks and you notice that pretty much everything contains SOMETHING that you are allergic to. So I am grateful for this product being made. I've read several reviews and I've noticed that most of the people who gave the ginger snapz a low rating kept saying they had a sandy taste. FYI: Look at the ingredients, it contains rice flour. Rice flour has a sandy/grainy type of feeling when eaten/felt. With that being said, I let my mom and my brother taste the ginger snapz. (Both of them aren't allergic to anything whatsoever). They said that it tasted good but it left a grainy/sandy after taste in their mouths. Once again, this product does contain rice flour. With that being said, remember people - this product has no wheat, soy, corn, or peanuts. I give credit where credit is due, they stripped some of the most common ingredients that people are allergic to and still ended up with an excellent tasting snack. 4 out of 5 because after I ate about 6 snapz and got over the actual feeling of me actually eating something that I wasn't allergic to *smiles* .. I did taste the sandy/grainy-ness that people were talking about. No complains though. I can make ice cream sandwiches now, no complains at all.

review/summary: If You're Watching Your Weight, Beware !
review/text: Don't panic..........they won't make you fat unless you eat too many which is easy because they are so yummy !<br /><br />Somehow, these cookies are a tiny bit chewy but not soft AND they have a slight crunch when you bite into one.  They are just right as far as I'm concerned and hard to put down.  In addition, there are a ton of chocolate chips in these cookies.  They would remind you a bit of Famous Amos' tiny chocolate chip cookies, although not as crunchy.  It's hard to believe that these cookies are gluten-free.  I looked at the ingredients a couple of times to make sure.<br /><br />I keep the bags of cookies in the freezer(summer heat) and they are just as good after thawing as they were right out of the shipping box, so don't worry about a chocolatey mess in the heat.<br /><br />These are hard to find in the stores AND the price here on Amazon is really low when compared with the local health food store. Hard to beat this deal.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: When the Chips Are Down....
review/text: ...this is a darn good product!<br /><br />Pamela has long been known for her excellent gluten/wheat and dairy free products.  Her baking mixes are nonpareil.  So are these cookies.  I attended an Autism Fair on July 24, 2010 and these cookies were being passed out as free samples.  People descended on those cookies like a flock of falcons and I felt lucky to be able to snag one.  Even so, they were a BIG hit and I ended up getting a bag for guests.  Within minutes those cookies were gone.<br /><br />Hats off to Pamela!  (You will also want to check her website for more good recipes and products).

review/summary: Pamela's Simplebites Chocolate Chip Mini Cookies
review/text: OMG! So the kids say these days. We just ordered these a week ago because my wife LOVES to bake, but can't eat wheat products anymore. I ordered these for her to try and BINGO she ate almost the whole bag at one sitting! She never eats that many cookies at a time...I tried them and of course I finished off the bag. These products on Amazon.com are wonderful and very helpful for people who are allergic to wheat. My wife can enjoy eating similar meals with me now without fear of a reaction. She's tried the Ener-G bread, the Bob's Gluten Free flour and the cereal w/berries.  She's in heaven, (NOT physically) and is enjoying eating again. This week we're going to try the gluten free, wheat free pasta with homemade tomatoe sauce and hamburger meatballs. I'm excited to sit down to dinner with her and I'm trying these products also.  Anyway, these cookies are wonderful and taste just like regular flour made products. Would recommend any of these gluten free, wheat free products on Amazon.com. We rate this product a 10 and will continue to purchase them.

review/summary: Unsatisfying- *unless* heated
review/text: edited- These cookies are quite good! But *only* if you microwave them. I put them in usually about 30 secs, butyou just have to do it till you can tell its softened. If you dont heat it, then you can't taste the chocolate chips at all and as a result is really unsatisfying. Although, in my opinion w a really good snack you shouldnt have to do anything to it. But, w.e.<br />In conclusion- these r realli good and youll get your $ worth, subscribe its only like $2.30 for each 7 oz packet. But, dont eat these unless you have a microwave at hand, or it really isnt good otherwise.

review/text: These cookies are so good that its a bit difficult to stop eating them ... and though "gluten free," they are not dietetic, so beware.  One other caution ... I had purchased some at Whole Foods, and then decided to buy more through Amazon. I think the ones that arrived via Amazon were not as good ... like maybe they were from a different cooking date/lot that had been baked a little too long. They were still good enough to eat, but I noticed a slight difference. However, the convenience of being able to shop online and the fact that even those cookies from the "bad lot" were very enjoyable, somehow makes it worth giving a second chance( with the hope that it was just one time they were overdone).

review/text: These cookies have a very similar taste and texture to Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies, if you remember those from your gluten-eating days. There is a slight caramel-like aftertaste and a bit of a gritty finish from the rice flour, but I doubt that anyone would be able to tell they're not "normal" cookies. If you prefer your cookies crunchy, get these. If you prefer softer cookies, the WOW Baking brand is excellent.

review/text: These cookies are really good and remind me a little of McDs cookies from when I was young, but these are better. Probably the best tasting GF choco chip cookies around. These cookies are more of a dry style, and a little crunchy.

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: I wanted these for a crust for pumpkin cheesecake, but they didn't quite make it in time. No matter, we enjoyed them right out of the box. They are packed full of flavor. The big question, as with all GF baked goods, is texture. These cookies are excellent, very crunchy without being at all crumbly or sandy. If you've ever enjoyed Ppefferneuse, these will take you there. They are exactly like that, right down to the possibility of a cracked tooth. And that's not a negative, it's part of the charm. Really, they're good cookies, with outstanding ginger flavor. Mom says these are every bit as good as the Ppefferneuse she made for Christmas every year, and that's high praise.

review/text: Being a fan of Pamela's products, I had no hesitation in trying the chocolate chip mini cookies. These remind me of any store-bought, traditional gluten-filled chocolate chip cookie in that they taste normal and are not chalky and dry like so many other gluten free cookies out there. I like the size of these cookies because you feel like you are getting more out of your snack than one signle larger cookie. They are the perfect size for my children (who also love them) and the chocolate doesn't melt too fast and make a big mess. Yum!

review/summary: Hard to find a crispy gluten free cookie
review/text: But this one hits the mark. One of the hardest things to replicate in gluten free items is texture. I do not like soft cookies so I am delighted with this product. When non-celiac friends are over, I make sure I have a couple bags because if they get into them, they disappear pronto. Nice ginger "bite" to the flavor profile too. I have yet to not be thrilled by any of the Pamela's products that I have purchased! Buy these cookies by the case from Amazon; this will save you money, insure freshness, and they are delivered right to your door if your total order is over $25.

review/summary: Warning! Watch expiration date.
review/text: Both of my children are on a gluten free diet. We eat a lot of these cookies and highly recommend them. I am not a fan of all gluten free options.<br /><br />The only thing to watch is the expiration date. We bought a clearance listing of the chocolate chip cookies from amazon (from amazon but not the full price item). The cookies were close to the expiration date and tasted old and stale - but we know the cookies taste amazing - so I'm sure it was because they were near the expiration. My kids didn't care so they still ate them.<br /><br />We buy these monthly through amazon and we have only had that happen the one time we bought the discounted cookies. My tip is if you do get a stale pack, contact amazon immediately. Amazon will back their products but get a replacement because these cookies are worth trying!<br /><br />This review is specifically about the chocolate chip cookies but we also love the chocolate cookies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T348UW">Pamela's Products Simple Bites Wheat-Free Gluten-Free Mini Cookies Extreme Chocolate -- 7 oz</a> and ginger snaps <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILILM0">Pamela's Products Simplebites Ginger Mini Snapz, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>(I HATE ginger snap cookies but love these).

review/text: The first shipment we got was delicious.  The second and third was too.  Then with the fourth shipment I noticed they were crumblier and drier. The next shipment was dull in flavor.  I began realize they were taking out some of the molasses and most of the ginger, which are the main ingredients that make a ginger snap cookie.  Now it's like putting a half cup of  brown sugar in your mouth and good luck trying to swallow it.  Pathetic.  Never  buying again.  I'll find a way to make my own.

review/text: These cookies are amazing! I am on a gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, and soy-free diet, which makes it almost impossible to find desserts, candy, or baked goods I can eat. These cookies are free from all these allergens, but more importantly: they are delicious. The Extreme Chocolate ones are crunchy at first, but then they get chewy and melty in your mouth. They feel rich and even buttery, and have a satisfying chocolate taste. Reminded me of brownies. I was very impressed and I would have enjoyed this product equally even if I weren't on a restricted diet. Superthumbs up and THANK YOU for this product!

I didn't eat so many of them because they taste too sweet for me. They also have a strong spicy taste probably because of the ginger.

review/summary: Great cookies, great price, and they're delicious!!!
review/text: Going gluten free is overwhelming, especially when you have trouble finding food that tastes good. All of my experienced friends told me not to eat any prepackaged gluten free stuff until I had been off gluten for at least a week or two. I saw these cookies on sale right before I started, so I bought them planning to wait a week or so, then eat them. Well, I couldn't wait! I was too curious. I tried one, and it was delicious!<br /><br />They are about the same size, and very similar in taste to Famous Amos, only better. They are not as dry. The texture is great, not exactly crunchy, but not quite chewy. They have an initial crunch, a good chew, and sort of melt in your mouth, and are perfect for dunking in milk (taste fantastic with almond milk). There's no funny textures or aftertastes like with some gluten free sweets. I know a lot of people say they can eat a whole bag in one sitting, and I probably could, but I find them to be satisfying enough to just eat the serving size of 4 when I have a sweet craving.<br /><br />The price here is better than in the store, if you get free shipping. At my health food store, they are $3.69/bag. I paid about $16.50 with tax for 6 bags here, and they arrived in 2 days!!! At that price, they don't cost any more than mainstream packaged cookies, which not common with gluten free stuff.<br /><br />The kids love them, the husband (who is not gluten free) loves them, and I love them. What more could you ask for!

review/text: The price point of this product makes it immediately attractive. It's only detractor, the labeling, fails to mention the various qualities that a health concious consumer needs to know when comparing the more expensive alternatives. After some research, a manager at the Trader Joe's-Bollinger helped unravel this dilemma by providing the following information. Trader Joe's Coconut Oil is: non-hydrogenated, cold pressed--no heat is used at any time during the processing, raw filtered, unpasturized, and is strained. Hope this helps!

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I happened to pick a jar of this up at Trader Joe's and when I went to the check out to buy it, one of the ladies began to tell me some of the many benefits of coconut oil. I bought it to try on my dry skin. What I didn't know was that it has many benefits. She told me her mother in-law suffers from Alzheimer's and she takes it and it helps her memory. She also told me it's good in coffee, on toast, scrambled eggs and can be used instead of normal cooking oil.<br /><br />When I put it on my face, the very next day, amazingly, the pores on my nose were smaller and almost invisible and I have large pores on my nose! I don't know how it did that, but it did. It also helped on my dry skin areas. I put in on my hair and just rubbed it in and left it and the next day when I took a shower, my hair was very soft.<br /><br />There are many uses for coconut oil and using it on your skin is only one of the things. The average daily recommendation is three tablespoons, but you should work your way up to that and not start with three because your body won't be used to it. Coconut oil helps aid good cholestrol and can help with memory loss and it has a lot of other amazing properties. Using this simple, inexpensive oil can really help with a lot of common problems and it tastes and smells really good.

review/text: I've been wanting to try coconut oil for awhile now because so many people swear by it. I kept forgetting to pick some up when I went to Trader Joe's but one day they had a whole display of it for only $5.99. I was looking for a more natural alternative to lotion for myself and my baby. I am so pleased to have found this. It makes my skin so soft and smells so sweet. Today I doused my hair with quite a bit of it and pulled it back into a bun, after a couple of hours I showered like normal and my hair is so soft! Another great thing about it is that about once a day I give my toddler a spoonful to make sure he is getting enough healthy fat for his brain development! Can't believe I can feed it to him and use it as a moisturizer. If you go online you can find so many different uses for coconut oil it really is amazing.

It doesn't leave my skin as greasy (I have really dry skin), and it smells fantastic! I couldn't stop touching my face.<br /><br />Eating is was good too. I added a tsp of coconut oil in lime water with stevia and blended it with ice like a slushie. The coconut oil solidified but it was fun to chew. Very good for your digestive system!

review/summary: Not real wasabi, but so what? Still great on sushi!
review/text: Several reviewers point out that this product is made with horseradish, not real wasabi, and gave it a low rating because they perceive it to be "fake". Yes, horseradish is much inferior to real wasabi in taste qualities, but I think that is missing the point. Very few people outside of Japan know what real wasabi tastes or even looks like, so the point is moot. If you are looking at any kind of prepared "wasabi" product, chances are almost 100% that it will be Western horseradish (seiyo wasabi) and not Japanese wasabi. Don't expect to find 100% pure wasabi in a tube.<br /><br />Japanese routinely eat sushi with "fake" wasabi, so there is no stigma against it. Real wasabi is too prized and scarce to grind up in large batches and let sit around. Once grated, real wasabi loses its pungency very quickly in the presence of oxygen (within 15-20 minutes). When presented to diners, wasabi is offered as a small root placed on top of a grater so you can grind the paste yourself.<br /><br />Few Japanese people expect real wasabi except at fine sushi restaurants. Everywhere else, it's this horseradish stuff dyed an unnatural shade of green, either offered as a tube or a ball of "wasabi clay" made from powdered horseradish. Real wasabi is notoriously finicky about its growing conditions and difficult to cultivate. What quantities not quickly snapped up by restaurants are sold to end consumers fresh as thumb shaped roots. Availability was sporadic and unpredictable in my supermarkets when I lived in Japan, and most people are happy with buying prepared wasabi substitutes like this for everyday use. S&B tube wasabi is commonly found in Japanese grocery stores and homes. It is also included as little squeeze packets in supermarket sushi sets.<br /><br />If you ever have the chance to try real wasabi, do it! The taste is so different and hard to describe.. it has a sort of sweetness and pleasant pungency that horseradish cannot reproduce. Horseradish just gives you that powerful nasal burn. Real wasabi doesn't.<br /><br />That having been said, S&B is an excellent sushi condiment when real wasabi isn't practical or available. I have used it for many years and will continue to use it. The paste easily dilutes into the soy sauce and coats sushi and sashimi well.

review/text: I know, it's not wasabi and it's not supposed to be. I get that.<br /><br />However this tastes LITERALLY like horseradish mixed with mayo. There are wasabi alternatives that actually taste somewhat  close to natural wasabi. This stuff is horrible, I picked some up today at Kroger's and am thinking about taking it back (I've never done that before in my life).

review/summary: Wow, that's hot.
review/text: I would like to start off by saying I'm no expert on food - especially sushi.  But I know I like sushi so much so that I learned to make it at home rather than go out to an expensive restaurant to get it.  So I bought some wasabi because you can't really have sushi without it in my opinion.<br /><br />Some reviewers don't like this because they claim it isn't real wasabi.  That may be true - I don't know quite honestly.  I just know that although the texture was a little creamier than what I got in a restaurant, it still did the trick.  It was very hot and I really liked it.  But use VERY sparingly.  I made the mistake of putting too much on, I thought it wouldn't pack a punch and wow was I wrong.<br /><br />This tube will last me quite awhile.  I have made three batches of sushi and I haven't hardly put a dent in the bottle yet.

review/summary: I second the other "Terrible" review
review/text: When I went to my local QFC in Seattle, I was pressed for time to get to a memorial function, so when I found they only had this product and no powdered wasabi, I gave it a try.  I was bringing a smoked fish plate, and I wanted to make a wasabi mayonnaise to accompany the other usual sides for this appetizer.<br /><br />Interesting that the other "terrible" review said it tasted like it was blended with mayonnaise. Obviously, I WANTED it to taste like wasabi mayo, which I've made many times with excellent results, and why not? It's just wasabi and mayo!!!<br /><br />When I whipped this batch up at the function, it tasted excessively salty, almost like baking soda, which rendered it unservable. Lucky I had other condiments so no huge deal.<br /><br />I know I've used pre-made in the tube in the past, but this brand was truly awful. So, people, learn from my mistake: buy powder, add hot water, you're done-enjoy!

review/text: I have a mild addiction to Dove Promises Dark Chocolate candies - but I had run out and couldn't find more at the store, so I got the closest match I could find, which where these Hershey's Bliss candies.<br /><br />Sadly, there's really no comparison. Whereas the Dove chocolates have a deep and satisfying chocolaty flavor and silky mouth feel, the Hershey's seem comparatively bland and waxy - almost not like chocolate at all, but instead some kind of cheap ersatz copy.<br /><br />My guess - and this is only a guess - is that this might be due to Hershey's recent switch to using vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter. If so, it was not a good move. Maybe it lets them keep their costs down, but true chocoholics don't mind paying more for quality!

I had stuck with Dove but recently thought I'd give "Bliss" a try. I found that the texture was almost waxy and when it started melting there was a gritty quality to it that was rather unpleasant. To top it off the actually chocolate flavor was just okay. Normally, I have 1/2 a serving and nibble slowly on the pieces. With "Bliss" I found myself trying to hurry up and just finish the three pieces. I'm watching my weight and I want my 'treats' to feel like TREATS, something to savior, not something I need to get through. I'm taking the rest of the bag to work tomorrow and buying a bag of Dove on the way home.

review/summary: This works on my cat
review/text: I have a very interesting type of cat; he's a Siberian, sort of like a Norwegian Forest cat, and rather rare. We got him as a rescue from the dumpster cat rescue volunteers in our area; my husband saw this cat in a cage and absolutely just had to adopt him. (And we already had a cat. And were living, temporarily in 2 rooms. So you can imagine, it was SOME cat.  One characteristic of the Siberian is that they molt or shed fur in great quantities twice a year. It just COMES off--there is a downy undercoat that stays put and some guard hairs, but the main coat, thick and lustrous, just flies off. You should see the pile outside my office door at home--he sits there. Insane. So the cat gets hairballs. How can he help it? And he prefers to disgorge those hairballs on the BEST decorative rug we own OF COURSE; not on the linoleum in the laundry room, the wood in the entrance, or the regular wall-to-wall carpeting either, no, right smack in the center of the BEST rug.<br /><br />So something had to be done. Anyway, he needs to get rid of the hairballs and merely arfing them up isn't sufficient; cats can get a lot more hair stuck in their gut. So I got a tube of Laxatone on the vet's recommendation. While you can use Vaseline, the problem with vaseline or mineral oil is that the lubricating agent also pulls some nutrients out of the cat, and that is not healthy for them. Laxatone is rather like thick, gooey petroleum jelly, but it is fortified with  linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and peptonized iron to prevent some depletion of nutrients. It's flavored (in this case) with malt. It would seem some cats enjoy the taste of malt. (It's known some cats will lap up beer.) I think it may be that cats eat rodents, and in eating the mouse, they eat what the mouse ate, including perhaps grains that have malted in the gut of the mouse. So perhaps this is, naturally, a flavor cats are inclined to enjoy. In any case, MY cat, LOVES this. He gets the recommended dosage for his larger size, over three days, then gets a maintenance dose once a week or so. The result is a reduction in hairball expulsion and better elimination.<br /><br />If you cat doesn't like malt flavor (there is no pleasing some cats) there is a tuna flavored variety. My previous cat, an equally hairy furball of a Maine Coon, was persnickety about food and was not a snacker. She would eat the malt Laxatone to some extent, then she'd refuse it. This cat eats practically anything, so he's no trouble, and he enjoys his medicine. I enjoy the improved health of my kitty.
