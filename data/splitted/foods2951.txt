review/summary: No Other Sprouted Wheat Flour Can Compare In My Book
review/text: I tried this a few years ago.  I loved it.  The price and shipping were high, but was willing to use this sparingly, just in order to have a healthier alternative.<br />I did find some "sprouted" flour in my local health food stores, but the quality was not the same.<br />This is high quality, made to order (as I recall).<br />I now order the sprouted wheat berries and grind at home...I don't think I did this initially because I was afraid to burn the motor or something on my grinder...I attempted to sprout my own wheat berries, but they still had too much moisture in them and messed up my grinder.<br />I am glad to say that the sprouted wheat berries are not a problem for my grinder.  Very pleased and it does bring the cost down for me to have it in this form...plus I can store it longer if I buy bulk.<br />Thank you.<br />UPDATE  7/2012<br />I DON'T ADD ANY GLUTEN TO MY BREAD AND I USE 2 TSP OF YEAST INSTEAD OF 1 TBSP OF YEAST ON RAPID CYCLE OF MY BREAD MACHINE AND I GET BEAUTIFUL LOAVES.

review/summary: Sprouted Wheat Flour Review
review/text: Great product, a little pricey, but considering the price of Ezekial bread products, you still come out ahead purchasing the flour and making your own bread/rolls/biscuits.  Be careful when you open the box, though.  I used a knife and sliced right through the plastic bag that contained the ten pounds of wheat flour.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I purchased this flour because I was searching for a more digestible organic version of flour to use in cooking and baking at home for my family. Love it! Have used it a lot in my everyday cooking in such things as pancakes, waffles, breads, pizza crusts, soups and sauces. Also, it came with a packet full of recipes and ideas in how to use the flour which was really useful and much appreciated. Great high quality product, would purchase again, and would love to try some of their other products such as organic sprouted spelt, organic sprouted millet and organic sprouted long grain brown rice, etc.

review/text: I was very surprised to get my variety sampler of k- cups in a brown paper lunch bag with a  Staple on top and a sticker that said 24 count k-cup sampler - New.  Clearly they are not new because the ones that are labeled with a expiration date are either expired already or about to in 2 weeks.  This is the first time Ordering from this vendor. These k cups are not in the actual sample variety boxes like in the store.<br /><br />I will be returning these as soon as I can figure out the contact .  Very disappointed!

review/summary: Repeat Customer
review/text: I've gotten this sampler twice now and I love it. One of the reasons why I love my Keurig is the variety it brings me. I don't have to be tied down to one bag of one flavor of coffee. Maybe this morning I need an extra-bold, because I hate mornings. Or maybe I want to sip something light and flavorful all afternoon.<br /><br />I think this sampler does an excellent job of variety. There's regular coffees and flavored ones, light, medium and extra-bold. There are occasionally a few repeats, but that's bound to happen and I don't hold it against them. There is also a good representation of many of the brands as well. Van Houtte, Gloria Jean, Green Mountain, Wolfgang Puck and Donut House coffees are the ones that spring immediately to mind. It's also really good if you're new to owning a Keurig and want to know what kind of coffees are out there and finding which ones you like. (And don't like; in any variety pack, there's going to be some flavors you don't agree with.)<br /><br />Yes, this does come in a brown paper sack. It's maybe not the classiest-looking thing, but I'm not here for the aesthetics, I just want some coffee.

review/summary: Seasoned with Chili Powder and Not Much Else...
review/text: As someone who eats soup almost every night during the fall and winter, I was pleased to see our local grocer carrying several of the new Progresso World Recipes Soup.  Unfortunately, the two varieties I have tried have been a real disappointment.  Like the Black Bean Jalapenos, the Tortilla y Pollo's seasoning is heavy on the chili powder and not much else.  Although a bit milder than the Black Bean Jalapenos, the Tortilla soup's broth is really little different in taste or consistency.<br /><br />There is little in the way of meat or vegetables in this particular soup which caused me to rate the product as deserving only two stars.  The can I opened had about six pieces of chicken, each measuring about 3/4" X 1/4" X 1/4"; a handful of black beans, a few corn kernals, and a piece or two of pepper.  I found this soup to be a significant departure from Progresso's usual quality ingredients and flavor combinations.<br /><br />In producing this soup, Progresso has committed a common error - assuming the flavors of Mexico and Tex-Mex foods are limited to chili powder; in the case of the Tortilla soup, there were not even pieces of jalapeno pepper thrown in to lend "authenticity" to the product.  I suggest Progresso review "Los Barrios Family Cookbook: Tex-Mex Recipes from the Heart of San Antonio" by Diana Barrios Trevino for the true flavors of Tex-Mex cooking. If attempting to produce a soup which reflects only Mexico's flavors, then Rick Bayless' "Authentic Mexican: 20th Anniversary Edition: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico" would be an excellent resource for Progresso to use.<br /><br />If you are looking for a soup that combines interesting layers of flavor and multiple ingredients, you would do well to look elsewhere. This soup reflects neither the flavors of Tex-Mex cooking or Mexican cooking.  If Progresso's other World Recipes Soups are as disappointing as the two I have already sampled, I may be changing my brand loyalty when it comes to soup.

review/text: This tortilla and chicken soup has no tortilla in it.  It's also mostly broth.  Disappointing.

I enjoyed Campbell's version much more, which has more solid ingredients in it including tortillas.

review/summary: Liked it!
review/text: Whenever I get a product to review. One of the first things I look at is it's value in relation to what you get. The Freezy Pups Kit I believe is an excellent gift product for a good price.<br /><br />When you run out of treat mix you can make your own to freeze in the tray or purchase refill kits. I think I'll do both because my dogs love the flavors that come in the kit, but I'd also like to try making my own, I'm think watered down baby food would work well in the tray.<br /><br />As for the treats, the pups love them. It's over a 100 degrees right now in the summer where I live and neither puppy enjoys the heat inside. If they're running in the grass in the sun, that's one thing, if they're inside on the couch, they want to be cool!<br /><br />They love it when I break out a frozen treat for them. Fortunately my dogs are small, one treat is enough for several bites for my littlest one, my medium size munches it down in one to two bites. If you had a big dog, these would be a great size for training treats in the summer.

review/text: These are great organic treats and our dog loves them, especially on hot days! It's quick and easy to make. My only complaint would be that I expected the Freezy Pups Tray to work like an ice cube tray, meaning that you can sort of twist it to pop a treat out but that doesn't seem to work. You have to let them thaw for a few minutes in order to remove them. Not a huge deal since you can just dump them into a freezer bag but worth noting. As far as the flavors, our pup seems to enjoy the Juicy Apple the most. We've also used the tray for frozen yogurt and smashed bananas. It works well.

review/text: Our pup loves ice cubes but they get lost under furniture or the refrigerator.  Because these treats are smaller, Callie can pick them up and chew them.  I have tried the apple juice flavor (which I ordered extra of) and she wags her tail when I get one out.  I freeze them into batches and pop them into a gallon-size plastic freezer storage bag so I have plenty on hand when our desert heat arrives.  If your pup likes ice cubes then it will probably love these frozen flavor treats!

review/text: I bought these after they were featured on a popular new product website. They interested me because my one dog loves ice as a treat for rewards. When I received the product I was very happy with the size of the bone treats, and the ease of making the treats make the product even better. They only take a few hours to freeze and my pups gulp them down. You do have to be a little cautious of where the pups lay the bones while enjoying, because some of the treats have a bit of a sticky texture (especially after drool). I will continue to purchase the refill kits, and hopefully will even buy the kit for friends.

Sweet Potato Maple was something my dogs never had, it didn't look good or smell good when I mixed it up, but all three of mine seem to love having them as a treat outside.<br /><br />I was thinking I could try a jar of baby food mixed with water to see if they like that as a treat.<br /><br />Mold is very well made and should last forever.

review/summary: Ya want a Mellow Mood? Try this!
review/text: My son surprised me with a can of the berry Mellow Mood the other day.  I read through the ingredients list and liked what I saw.  It is a natural product.  Period.  Then understanding exactly what those ingredients do to a body, I waited until about an hour or so before bedtime before I tried it.  In a word the effect is *amazing.* I was definitely mellowed out!  Not drowsy or out of it; simply mellow.<br /><br />The taste was very enjoyable. The flavor of the berry reminded me of the sorrel drinks I'd had while visiting Jamaica. Although carbonated, it was only slightly so.  Nothing like soda pop, just a little gas to give it some zing.<br /><br />Words of caution: Do NOT drink this before operating a vehicle or heavy machinery.  I would not recommend drinking this if you need to focus on anything like your JOB.<br /><br />Have a drink, watch some tube, listen to some music, or simply just chill out. That said, expect to relax to the max and not feel sorry for it in the morning!<br /><br />Irie and one love!

review/summary: It's delicious and it works for us!
review/text: OK, We drink this a couple times a week, and after reading several of these reviews I would like to point out that this drink does not claim to put you to sleep, it says it releases stress & relieves tension. So giving it a low rating because you can't sleep is like giving Diet Coke a low rating because you can't lose weight. Like all things we imbibe, not everything will work for everybody. The drink is delicious, We like the berry flavor the best but we've had the citrus too and they both relax us just fine. There is a warning on the label not to drink more then 2 a day and not to drive or operate heavy machinery, I suggest you adhere to that advice. Other then that ENJOY it, It's delicious, it's not overly carbonated, and the berry flavor is the most beautiful dark pink color.

review/text: This drink is the best if you need to go to sleep early for a night or you just want to relax.  Taste like a mix of a Sprite with a light touch of ginger ale.  I could chug the thing if I had to...<br />It is a must try... Local stores in the metro Detroit area are finally starting to carry it for about $1.89.

review/summary: Tasty drinks
review/text: The Mellow Mood drinks are very tasty and a great way to end the night. The only draw back is that not only do they calm you down but they also put you to sleep. That is nice unless you're not ready for bed. But to be honest, I didn't crash out real quick every time I drank a Mellow Mood. If I was already a little tired, then yes, bed time came soon. Again, they are a very tasty drink. I'm pretty bummed that I'm out, actually.

review/text: I am extremely pleased with these drinks. I had used them as a method of calming down near the end of the day. I'd crack one open, put it in a class with some ice, pound it down, and chill out. It would put me out in about half an hours time, if I just relaxed and laid back. This drink is also delicious. I had my doubts about what it would taste like, but I was pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: At a local gas station that I go to everyday, I seen a bottle and some cans with Bob Marley on it so I picked it up and my natural and first instinct was "Theres gotta be drugs in here" the clerk convinced me to buy the Half and Half and I was abouy yo ho yo work so I kept it in the fridge at work all day, 30 min before I had to leave, a couple of coworkers and I decided to give it a try I only drank about less than a cup but 20 min later I was calmer and I felt that it worked. Now when I get home from work I usually don't go to sleep till around 3, 4 in the morning, I was out by 12. And I didn't drink a whole bottle. Last night I tried the carbonated citrus one and I drank almost 65% of it and went straight to sleep. This stuff is absolutely amazing, not only does it help me go to sleep but it is something that tastes really good, without having a disgusting medicine taste. Its all natural, and I can't wait to get more, my coworkers have been hounding me for it also! Give it a try, but if your going to drink a whole one, don't drink it when you first get to work wait till your about to leave so that if your like me and breed help sleeping, you can do so at a decent time.

review/summary: great drink
review/text: I didn't have this flavor specifically, but this drink is great. It really does relax your mind & body and any stress will melt away. If you're trying to get a marijuana "buzz" from it though, it's not like that so don't expect it. It's great because it's all natural too! I drank about 1/4 of the can and waited a little bit just to see how it would effect me the first time. It did relax me, and it also made me pretty sleepy. Not like "falling asleep while doing something" sleepy, but "as soon as my head hit the pillow, I'd be asleep" sleepy and that was just with a 1/4 of a can! I drank the rest the next night and the "sleepiness" wasn't nearly as prominent as the night before, but it definitely relaxed me. I don't know if this would be a great thing to drink just to relieve stress, like during the day, because of the melatonin in it. I found this in a local natural food store and only bought one can..now I'm wishing I bought the whole shelf! I will definitely drink this nightly once I get more. If you're looking to unwind at the end of a long day, without drugs, alcohol or harsh chemicals then this is definitely for you. I was skeptical at first because at $1.75 a can, (& I didn't even know if it would be worth it), to me, that's money I could be using toward gas, lol! Anyway, it was worth it and I can't wait to get more!

review/summary: Now That's Better!
review/text: I use this to help me sleep on occasion when I have a big day and have to get plenty of sleep. The reason I use it is not because it actually makes me sleepy, which it does. The reason I use it is because it calms my mind and I am not tossing and turning in bed thinking about the things that I have to do the next day. I go to bed with a clear head and am able to fall asleep easily and fast, and I feel good the next day. Keep a few bottles on hand because it starts to work in about ten minutes and you could drink it late without feeling bad the next day. Also try the black tea because it tastes incredibly delicious!

review/summary: Delicious and relaxing
review/text: I love this stuff.  When I have troubles going to sleep it will put me to bed.  I haven't had it during the day, but if I drink a can in the evening, I seem to get naturally tired and sleep a nice, natural sleep.  That's much unlike artificial sleeping pills (ambien, etc...) which will knock me straight out but give me the weirdest dreams and don't really give me good, restful sleep.  Also, this drink actually tastes good- it's not some stupid collection of things with favoring added.  I could totally see myself drinking this regularly if it didn't knock me out. (FYI, the berry isn't all that good- for carbonated, citrus is the way to go)<br /><br />The price is a bit steep (if you can find it locally, go there and save a bit), but it's a good relaxation drink and worth every penny.  I swear it tastes better if you listen to "Mellow Mood" or "One Love" by Marley.  No idea why :)

review/text: Yes, this drink will relax you...but can and often make you sleepy. I've tried this drink on two different occasions, definitely made me sleepy. In the future I won't drink one of these unless my mind is racing and I can't relax. I think drinking it while in a normal mood will just make you sleep. A cheaper alternative to this drink may just be melatonin supplement. It seemed to have a similar effect.

review/summary: great taste but 39 grams of sugar, really?
review/text: Drink 1 can and you getting nearly the same amount of sugar you get by drinking mountain dew, therefore I imagine some of the "calming" effect one might get on this is counter acted by the amount of sugar in 1 can. The taste is great and the whole bob marley branding is great too, but the blend of herbs with valerian root and lemon balm extract etc.. is all 82grams only for everything in there. Of course they don't tell you exactly how much of each herb is in there though. The problem with this drink is you can achieve the same effect with Now Foods TRUE CALM AMINO RELAXER or Anxiety Control 24� Hour products which are oral pill based herbel supplements that essentially will do the same thing, without the sugar Not to mention you get much more valerian root and other neurotransmitters such as gaba. With those you get a much greater dose thus potentially being much more affective to people who actually do have anxiety or other issues that would need them to medicate with something.<br /><br />Despite the sugar content, the drink itself tastes great and I did experience a minor relaxation feeling. This is great for the occasional drink but if you are looking at buying this product for any medical related issues/need then I do not recommend this at all due to the level of sugar content, you would be much better off taking supplements separately. I imagine this is a great drink though if you want to chill out at a party, but after noting one reviewer who apparently uses this drink to help him fall asleep, drinking nearly 40grams of sugar before bedtime I assure you is not good for you. You'd be better off drinking diet coke with a pill based supplement. Still, cut out the sugar.

review/text: I love Marley Mellow Mood. I have full body pain and have to take lots of prescription pain medication. One day I tried a can of Citrus and to my surprise the pain went away. It tastes great but the online price is just too expensive. I buy it in the grocery store for $1.76 a can which equals $21.12 for 12 cans. Here the price is $29.99 for 12 cans. Much too expensive. Checkout Smith's Grocery they have it for $1.76 a can.

review/text: I bought this after reading the reviews hoping it would help me get to sleep better.  It simply does not work for me.  I've tried drinking it slow maybe an hour before bed, I've tried guzzling it down.  I'm still lying in bed for hours.  I gave it two stars because regardless of its inability to work for me, it tastes pretty good (almost like a mello yello if you're from the south) so I'll still be able to drink it and it wont be a complete waste of money.  Buying them here, I'm paying about 2.60 a can which is definitely not worth it to me.

review/summary: Unpredictable
review/text: Since Neuro Bliss screwed up their formula, I tried this out as a replacement.  One man's meat is another man's poison, so I suppose you can never tell if something like this will work for you unless you try it.  In my case, though, I've been getting different results.  The first 3 or 4 times I tried it, I almost fell asleep (so, as it says on the can, don't drink before driving).  Other times, it would just relax me.  Once or twice, it even made me agitated, and a few times it barely seemed to have any effect at all.  All these attempts were usually a couple of days and sometimes a couple of weeks apart, so I don't think I'm building up a tolerance to it.  A 12 ounce can contains 43.5 grams of pure cane sugar, so you probably don't want to drink it before you go to bed.

To doll it up I add 3/4cup of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL288">Eden Organic Dried Montmorency Cherries, 4-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> and 3/4cup pecans chopped which tastes great but still not decadent like Authentic Foods Brownie Mix.  I am surprised I don't like this mix more as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SARYZG">The Cravings Place Double Chocolate Chunk Cookie & Muffin Mix, 22-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> makes my FAVORITE muffins.  The muffins are great! They freeze well and then you can pop them in the microwave for 22 seconds so the chocolate chunks turn ooey gooey!

review/summary: Ooey Gooey Chocalatey Chew Brownie Mix
review/text: I bought this mix because my 6 year old son is allergic to eggs, dairy and nuts.  For convenience, give it 4 stars.  For taste and texture, 3 stars; it's more cakelike than brownie-like, and tastes okay, but my homemade cake blows it away.  The chocolate chunks in the OGCCB mix definitely helped, and my son enjoyed the brownies.  So if you don't have time to make your own "safe" cake/brownies, this'll do.

review/text: These are impressive brownies, but you have to nuke them slightly before eating. The chocolate chunks melt and create a lovely lava cake type of experience. Cold, they're a little weird. There's a slightly acrid aftertaste that's more noticeable when cold. And the big chocolate chunks aren't particularly palatable when crunchy.  All in all though I am quite pleased with the mix.  It's easy to prepare, hypo-allergenic, and I like that they aren't as sickeningly sweet as regular brownie mixes; perhaps that accounts for the accusation of 'blandness' in one review, but I consider it a positive.

review/summary: The best brownies ever
review/text: I was thoroughly surprised how good these brownies are.  I added nuts which my family loves and melted chocolate chips on top.  They are moist and a little chewy (again which my family loves). I love the fact that they use brown rice flour, red beet sugar and non-aluminum baking powder. And if you compare these brownies to other brands, they are lower in sugar. They are a big hit with family and friends.

review/summary: Our favorite brownies
review/text: I tend to doctor the recipe a bit, either adding sunflower butter as part of the fat, or using almond milk and almond extract, adding pecans, or what have you, but we use this in lieu of cake for some birthdays. It makes great cupcakes (I just made some tonight.)<br /><br />I will say that this is a high price for the mix compared to what I pay in the grocery store.<br /><br />But taste-wise, these are excellent. Don't expect that batter to be identical to brownies made with eggs and butter, but the end result is very good, and it adapts well to additions.<br /><br />We've made it with coconut oil, coconut milk and shredded coconut in the past. Also, amaretto and cherry extract, with almond chunks. So many options, and everyone in the family can eat it, which with our dairy, soy, egg, peanut, and wheat allergies, is a small miracle.<br /><br />All the Cravings Place mixes whip up incredibly quickly, easier in a lot of cases than standard, conventional mixes.

review/summary: Best multi-allergy free brownie
review/text: I have dairy, egg, wheat, and nut allergies/intolerances.  Finding pre-mixed anything is a challenge.  Especially a mix with chocolate.  Before I was diagnosed with the allergies/intolerances, I was not a fan of brownies or any baked chocolate product.  These brownies I love!<br /><br />The chocolate chunks are good enough to eat straight out of the bag (I must confess I have done this on a few occasions).  The brownies are not dense like "normal" brownies, but I like the lighter texture.  They are not overly sweet; a dark chocolate lover would be more impressed with the taste.  However, there's nothing wrong with adding more sweetener to the mix or a frosting to the final product if you like it sweeter.<br /><br />My husband (who has no food restrictions) loves these brownies, too.<br /><br />Very easy to make.

review/summary: Best Brownies Ever...Vegan or Not!
review/text: Since I became a vegan about a year ago I (surprisingly enough) I haven't had too much trouble finding great tasting desserts. However, brownies seemed to be the one exception to this experience. I have made and tried brownies that were okay, but they were more like cake than anything. I couldn't seem to find that perfect chewy brownie I so loved before! Since I found these, problem solved! Another great thing about them is that they are quite light. You will not feel sick after eating one. The only thing I would change (and this is hardly an issue) about these is to make the chocolate chunks that come inside smaller. They are a bit large for my taste and I always chop them up to spread them around a bit. Also, while they are delicious without frosting, I often top them with the frosting recipe from Alicia Silverstone's "The Kind Diet". The final result is the most flawlessly chewy, fudgy brownie I've ever had, even before I became a vegan! My advice is: try them just to try them. Then, especially in my case, enjoy devouring one after you have regained consciousness from the wonderful, sweep you off your feet, greatness of the first bite!

This mix fits the bill - these brownies are absolutely delicious! An added bonus is that you only have to add water and oil. Too many times, we have purchased items that you have to add egg replacer or an alternative milk (rice, soy, almond, etc) to the recipe. These brownies taste ever bit as good as "traditional" brownies and I would highly recommend them!

review/text: I found this stuff in our local market a few years ago. Recently they quit carrying it. So<br />I turned to the internet and found it on Amazon. This is a blend of the traditional Lawrys<br />seasoning with a couple of twists. First, traditional Lawrys is very fine and easy to over<br />apply to your food. This product is course and is an excellent compliement to steak, burgers,<br />chops, chicken and even veggies! The second thing that I like about this product is it contains<br />cracked pepper. So I have an all purpose seasoning in one container.

review/summary: similar to Runts but better
review/text: I picked these up in a bulk grocery department while out-of-town.  I was looking for a pressed dextrose candy that was hard enough not to melt immediately but that would soften fairly shortly in the mouth.  These have fit the bill perfectly.  Similar in flavor to Runts (especially the yellow fish, which are banana-flavored) but easier to bite due to their shape.  The coating has a good texture and dissolves without becoming grainy, which can be rough on tender mouths.  Each candy remains smooth until completely dissolved, which is a sign of a fine, high-quality dextrose inside and a coating that is not glopped on in the production.<br /><br />Each color has its own flavor, with the green being the tartest and the yellow being the least.  As someone who is not a fan of tart candy, I did not find the green to be too tart.  If you're looking for sour candies, try one of the other lines from Oak Leaf for something with the same quality.  I look forward to trying some of their other pressed dextrose products, especially the Banana Heads, and would highly recommend these Aquarium Fish to anyone.  As a bonus for those of us with allergies, they are produced in a peanut- and tree nut-free facility and are OU Kosher certified.

review/text: After chewing one piece of Spry peppermint gum you may notice your teeth and gums feeling more healthy. Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar as an ingredient, this item caught my attention.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It can be commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. Some Xylitol products are also made from corn.<br /><br />This product is made with a Xylitol, gum base, natural flavors, glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin and beesewax.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br /><br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br /><br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br /><br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br /><br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />What more could we ask for from a gum? This gum is a natural defense system and you will start to notice the results. Unlike other sugary gums, this will reduce cavities and it is just as flavorful, if not more so than most gums.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

You know that feeling when you REALLY need to brush your teeth, because your teeth are kinda aching? Well, this gum eliminates this feeling altogether! One downside is that the sweetness/flavor of the gum runs out pretty quick, much faster than gum made with artificial sweeteners. But, it is fantastic for what it is, a dental gum!

review/text: I have tried all the flavors of Spry and this one is my favorite flavor. The flavor lasts really long! I love that Spry uses ONLY xylitol for their sweetener and it's why I only chew Spry gum. I also like the texture of their gum, as opposed to gums such as "Extra" brand gum. Spry doesn't make your jaw ache like those other gums do because it doesn't get stiffer or more rubbery as you're chewing it, such as other sugarless gums tend to do.

review/summary: Best All Natural Gum-NO ASPARTAME
review/text: I love gum, it helps me stay awake during boring meetings or long hours at the computer and keeps me from snacking, problem is almost every type of gum made now has aspartame which tends to give me a headache. So I love this gum as it has none, plus the calories in each piece are even lower.  The peppermint and spearmint are my favorites and last the longest, the fruit is a little sweet for me and does not last as long.  None of them last as long as your standard commercial gum, but for me, it is definately worth it.

review/text: I love this gum! I'm not a gum person - normally I never chew gum. This, however, is a proxy for brushing at work or when I don't have time, and was recommended by my dentist. Though that's why I bought it originally, I really love the taste! It's a very natural mint taste. I really couldn't be happier.

review/summary: Love this gum, and its great for your teeth.
review/text: I have tried all their flavors and not one has disappointed me.  While it may not last as long as "normal" gum, lasts for around 30-45 minutes, it is far more healthy for you and does not contain aspartame.

review/text: Very expensive for gum and the flavor only lasts for literally two minutes, but if you do not want to poison yourself with aspartame, then this is the only option.
