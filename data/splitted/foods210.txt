review/summary: Best Stuff Ever
review/text: We've used Swheat for at least 10 years, and have never had a 'bug' problem with it. We've lived in the east and now in the desert southwest, and no problems in either climate.  There has been virtually no smell - even when we come back from vacations and the clumping action is remarkable.  We've also disposed of the clumps in the toilet and have never had a plumbing problem.  If it sticks to the bottom of the litter pan, chances are you don't have enough in the pan. We use a pan with a sifter insert (same pan for 10 years too!)and they seem to be made for each-other.

review/summary: Best Litter EVER
review/text: I have been using Swheat Scoop for 6 years and absolutely love it. I have one cat (that uses a litter box, the other uses the tub and had for years before I got her.)  Not only does it control odors very well (I don't add anything to it to help) but it clumps nicely for scooping. The best parts are that I don't get a face full of choking clay dust when I change the litter and it is flushable! My second litter box is a Cat Genie (which I also love) so I only have to clean the upstairs box every 3 to 5 days (at the first whiff of an odor) but I just flush it away (it takes about 5 flushes for one whole litter box worth because you have to do it in small increments.) I see in other reviews that some have had bug issues, in 6 years I have not seen one bug of any kind.  They also have a rewards program that is great... buy 12 bags and get one free, plus they send you a few coupons for a $1 off at the same time.

review/summary: Better than other natural litters AND clay litters.
review/text: I'm a two-cat mom and have been a clumping clay litter user for decades. I came a bit late to the natural litter party, because I was afraid natural litters would clump poorly/smell bad etc. Swheat Scoop is the second natural litter I've tried, and I had planned to try them all but this stuff is so great that I've decided there's no need to look further.<br /><br />There is no such thing as a cat litter that never smells bad, has no dust, never tracks at all, and produces clumps so perfect that they neither stick to the side/bottom of the box nor crumble apart a bit. That said, Swheat Scoop is the closest to perfect I've ever found, in ALL of these respects.<br /><br />Smell: Slightly "barnyard"-like (it is wheat, after all), but I only notice it when I'm scooping out the box; if you scoop daily, you will not have an ambient smell. (We live in a 1-BR condo and the litter box is in the bathroom, so I would notice if there was a lingering smell.)<br /><br />Dust: Hands down, the least dusty litter (clay or natural) I've ever tried.<br /><br />Tracking: Minimal, on par with the lowest-tracking clay litters I've used, and superior to the lightweight (pine/cedar) natural litters. Swheat Scoop's consistency is quite like Grape Nuts cereal (sorry to gross out anyone who eats Grape Nuts), so because the granules are on the heavier side they tend not to track.<br /><br />Clumps: Not perfectly tight, but they can be scooped easily enough. With a high volume of urine, the clumps do stick to the bottom/sides a bit, but in my experience the tighter-clumping clay litters adhere MUCH more to the bottom and sides. (One of our cats pees a ton and the side-sticking drove me nuts with clay litter.) And as another reviewer mentioned, keeping the litter level high enough definitely mitigates this problem.<br /><br />I haven't experienced the bug problem others mentioned, but I'm willing to risk it considering how great this stuff is.

review/text: Good chips but I bought them because I was looking for chocolate chips with no soy. After reading the product ingredients on Amazon and assuming they were soy free since soy was not listed I was very disappointed to find soy listed on the package when I got my order. I have 3 bags of chips that I can't use. Again, they are good chips but they are NOT soy free.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: On my "rest days" (am a shift worker) I like to enjoy a nice mug or two of coffee.  Whilst browsing the different coffees for my new percolater, I came across this ready brew by starbucks, and thought I like starbucks lets try it.<br />Not at all disappointed, gave one to each of the girls that work with me in the office and they each said that they liked it too.<br /><br />Generally I dont like to add sugars to my hot drinks, and from the smell of the coffee after the water was added I thought the drink was going to be terribly sweet.  But no - I used a non-sweetened creamer and my travel mug from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060VJO82">Starbucks Ground Coffee, Travel Mug & Ceramic Mug</a>  and had a perfect mug of coffee, infact when I finished the first one I had a second.  So I totally recommend this.<br />Tho be warn there are only 7 servings in the packet which currently works out to be $2.19 per serving.<br />Didnt matter at the time cos I got the packet as a taster, but now that I am considering re-ordering, seems a tad on the expensive.  :-)

review/summary: Good value & my Dogs Love it
review/text: I do not know a whole lot about dog food, but I try to avoid corn because I noticed it makes my dogs stink.<br /><br />This very much looks like a quality dog food in its texture, from the ingredients listed, and the fact that it's not bone dry like some of the cheaper dry foods. It reminds me of some of the premium brands in its color, texture, and....this is a bit gross, but the compactness & darker color of what came out of the dogs after they started eating it...!<br /><br />I like it, the dogs are eating it and doing well on it. I will definitely be buying it as their regular dog food from now on. The price is probably better than the other store premium brands because there is no advertising.<br /><br />I recommend it.

review/summary: Great for the dogs coats
review/text: I had to switch my dog's food after the price on their previous food doubled. After doing some research and talking to our vet I bought this brand. One of our dogs has wire hair, so I was suprised after awhile when I noticed his coat was getting shiney and he feels soo soft. The other dog we have is part poodle and she even softer. Which she likes because she likes to be hugged and cuddled. We have had alot of people comment on their nice soft and shiney coats.

review/text: This has been great dog food.  We have been feeding our very stomach sensitive pooch this for over a year and notice an incredible difference.  Not to be too descriptive, but the stomach gurgling and smells have totally ceased.  We are no longer kicking our pooch out of the living room because we can't breath.<br /><br />My only concern is Amazon's packing on this product which often comes broken open and taped.  I have responded several times regarding a change being needed.  However with Amazon's customer satisfaction team they have always made the wrong righted very quickly if needed.

review/summary: Lovely color, great to work with
review/text: The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for "highlighting" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra.

review/summary: Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.
review/text: First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!

review/summary: Good gum, tastier then you would have thought
review/text: I bought this to hopefully help with acid reflux (chewing gum = more saliva, supposed to help neutralize excess acid + real mastic gum is supposed to be helpful with getting rid of some of the "bad" bacteria).<br /><br />I'm not really sure if there are any health benefits yet, but it does taste different+ good. Somewhat like the scent of pine trees, but muted/not strong.<br /><br />The ingredients in order are:<br />Gum Base, glucose, Sugar, corn starch, natural identical flavor (mastic), glazing agent (carnauba wax), permitted color (e171).<br /><br />So I'm not sure how much natural mastic is in there, but it's probably more than regular gum ;)

review/text: I was buying Mastic supplements for my stomach and came across this gum; it said it was a product of Lebanon so I was intrigued but when the gum arrived, the box says it's from Jordan. Also, it doesn't actually say it's got real mastic in it - the words natural identical flavor (mastic)does not convince me it actually has mastic in it... plus, the glucose and stuff has me suspicious that it's not really healthful...but the taste is good enough to chew, different, interesting and I will chew it daily to see if it helps me...still, I'm very disappointed that it's not from Lebanon. I love Lebanon.

They're bland on their own, but with some mushrooms, Parmesan cheese, a little seasoning and a good sauce, they taste as perfect as anything I ever got at an Italian restaurant. De Boles gluten free products have played a huge role in how easily I've been able to give up my favorite wheat-y foods and acquire a taste for their gluten-free substitutions. These noodles took me a few tries to become accustomed to, and playing around a bit to get the right sauce and seasoning, but now I absolutely love them! SO happy to have these!

Well, I decided to go ahead and try them, and am so glad I did! They are as fresh, maybe fresher than the ones I have purchased local. I notice now, as I am leaving this review, they are no longer free shipping, and with the price of shipping, makes them about what I pay locally...so, I hope they go back to offer free shipping, as I love these candies, and buy them quite often. Bring back free shipping, keep the freshness!!!

review/summary: I love Blue
review/text: I am a blue buffalo fanatic.  I have a 16 year old teacup poodle and a 1 year old mini-weiner and I have both of them on Blue food and treats.<br /><br />I like the health bars because I do not feel guilty to give them multiple every day.  I have bacon egg and cheese, apples and yogurt, and chicken liver.  The poodle prefers the chicken liver, while the Daschund goes crazy over all 3.<br /><br />I use Blue dry food for 2 meals a day, and canned food for 1.  I feel like this has played a part in Deek living to be 16, and I will never feed either of my dogs anything else.<br /><br />These are pretty big treats for both of my dogs, they eat what they want and then hide the rest for later normally.<br /><br />If you are thinking about this, you might also want to look into Blue Bites, and Blue Bones.

review/text: I purchased this blend in a local market in Philadelphia for my foodie husband. He loves to grill and is an immensely talented cook. I often try to find him different spices and rubs to cook with and this has been a knockout win. He said it is the favorite gift he has received from me in that this is a delicious and unique salt rub. Keep in mind we have been together for 8 years and this is not the first time I have ever bought him something to cook with. He was amazed at the moistness (spelling?) of it and can use the rub for anything. Now, he is trying to order more and I just saw that Amazon sells it online. Score!

review/text: My major gripe with the product is that there is too much oil. It can be fixed by using a colander or something else to drain the oil. Also, keep in mind that the size of the can is 4lbs 6oz. You can keep the can stored in your cupboard for months if it isn't opened, but you need to consume it relatively quickly once it is opened (just something to keep in mind for people who are single or who have small families).

review/text: I have not had many brands of grape leaves - big grocery store chain deli (I think they have the Divina brand), and a couple others.  I liked the Roland brand especially for the price.  At around 2$/lb. that beats the 5-7$/lb. anywhere local, and the taste is fairly close (a little less).  But, I do like to add fresh lemon juice as the directions recommend.  They are fairly soft and a few came apart while serving (not a big deal), but as far as texture is concerned, I'd prefer them with more leafy texture.  Overall, I can't complain - a little less flavor/texture, but a lot better value.

review/summary: Stuffed Grape Leaves
review/text: I thought these were good.  They are not as good as homemade, but I didn't expect them to be.  I haven't had the other canned brands to compare them with, but I was surprised at how good they actually were.  It's true they are on the mushy side, possibly because they are sitting in oil, I assume to keep from drying out.  And some of the leaves were torn, but none were falling apart and I had no trouble getting them out of the can intact.  They were wrapped very tightly.  The directions say to drain the oil, and that's good advice.  They tasted even better after doing that and refrigerating them.  They have a lemony taste, but not too strong.  Couldn't even taste the mint.  They use sunflower oil, which I don't think is as good as olive oil, but most of the canned stuffed grape leaves seem to do the same, probably because it's cheaper.  The recipe I prefer has a lot of dill and onions and lemon and uses extra-virgin olive oil (a Greek recipe), and the Roland  has no dill.  But for the price I thought these were definitely worth buying.  I certainly won't have a problem eating them in a few days.  I've never frozen grape leaves before, but I don't see why it couldn't be done.  I doubt these are the best canned stuffed grape leaves out there (the Al-Wadi and Divina have better ratings), but they are good enough for me, especially for the price.  And they are vegetarian.

Consequently, unless you are using these as a dish that is shared at a meal for several folks it is almost impossible to get through the entire tin in any kind of reasonable time. It would be great if the same product, which tastes wonderful, were available in a smaller size tin.

The size of the meat and carrots and green beans are perfect for a toddler to pick up with tiny fingers or a spoon and put in their mouth.  No "choking" incidents to date.

Eaten from the can with beet greens, fresh oregano and a bit of Himalayan sea salt, they make an entree that dirties exactly one fork!<br /><br />Besides being delicious, these sardines were a bargain at $1.37 per can. With a Prime subscription like I have (in order to stream Prime TV and video to my TV via my Roku) the $1.37 per can includes shipping.

Not at all to my liking and I have been eating sardines for a couple of years. I even believe a few cans are either spoiled or off? Hard to prove but somehow I taste it?? Haha- and I ordered 2 cases, suppose I could return them-but then I have to pay shipping back- ate them at first-out of stubborness- but then just gave up hoping maybe I just hit a bad can or two. Lesson learned- don't jump too deeply into that online case deal- try an individual one first unless you have alot of experience with the products at hand. I will stick to Nordiac/Brisling sardines for now on- have never had a bad can or off taste with these in water or olive oil.

review/text: Let me start by saying I am NOT a tea drinker!  I love my hot chocolate.  However, when I have a sore throat, I tend to sip on tea (I've heard it's soothing for your throat).  My boyfriend kept giving me all these different kinds to try & I couldn't stand any of them (White Tea with Pear, Mandrian Vanilla Red, etc).  Finally I went to the fod store & saw this on the shelf.  Seeing how I am crazy for anything mint, i thought I'd give this a shot.  First cup I made was absolutely wonderful!!<br /><br />This tea has a very light taste at first sip & a cool, lingering peppermint taste at the end.  It's perfect any time of year, hot or cold, alone or with dessert (even a main course!).<br /><br />If you like mint, you'll love this!  Most mint tea's I've tried inthe past were disappointing, I couldn't even taste the mint & felt it was a waste of my money, & I never even finished the first cup.  This one is the best by far & will be a perm add to my pantry!

review/summary: A Visit to the Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/summary: Refreshing and wholesome!
review/text: This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart."  Kahlil Gibran

review/text: Like peppermint?  Like tea?  Look no more, Celestial Seasonings is here!<br /><br />This tea is super potent and intense, delivering a powerful mintiness that isn't sweet, and slightly bitter.<br /><br />I use this tea to help settle an upset tummy, which it does do.  It soothes it and can help control mild nausea.<br /><br />This is a tea you sip slowly, because it is just too intense to drink fast.  Though it is hot, it tends to create a cooling sensation from the mint as it slides down my throat, which is nice.  It can help clear sinuses, too!<br /><br />This tea does not taste like a sweet candy cane, unless you load it up with sweeteners.  On its own, which is how I drink it, it is just minty.<br /><br />I like that the only ingredient is peppermint.  Nothing else which is fabulous!<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I drink a giant mug of this almost nightly. Peppermint is very soothing and relaxing, and it's great for settling an upset stomach. It's up there with ginger for homemade remedies. The aroma is too good to resist and the taste is just as good. It's minty and a little sweet, but not too sweet. It's much healthier than soda (barely different from warm water), so if you're trying to break a soda habit this tea is a must. It's a great thing to drink any time of day. Great for settling out a large meal, relaxing/calming down during a hectic day, and great for unwinding before bed. Celestial Seasonings always has the best teas, and this is no exception. It's great to find it at such a bargain online.

review/text: It's a wonderful product-great peppermint taste and very fresh. My son was amazed when he smelled it brewing this afternoon! "It must really be fresh because it smells a lot more 'pepperminty' than what you buy in the stores, Mom."  He's right - it does! It's also great cold as iced tea - my grandchildren love it. A friend & myself enjoy getting together for hot tea and quiet conversation - this tea is one of our favorites.<br />I have purchased this tea thru Amazon's "subscribe & save."  I save on the cost of the tea by purchasing it this way; t arrives right on schedule; and with the subscription option, it's delivered right to my front door. I love the convenience of being able to change the amount when I want more boxes or changing the delivery date when I'm going to be away and won't need it that month.  I highly recommend this product!

But, by current supermarket doesn't carry Bigelow's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be..after all the ingredients on both is "Peppermint".  I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting.  I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor.  Also, there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas.  Bigelow's brand has a slightly sweeter taste, which I enjoy.  In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea.

It is very concentrated allowing you to use less, however I never do because I'm a vanilla freak. When you use this product, you will first understand what vanilla tastes like. If you're of the opinion that vanilla is bland, your world is about to be rocked!

We occasionally mix in some raw frozen foods or other premium dog food for nutritional variety, but only every now and then to prevent him from getting an upset stomach.

I called the local distributor in our state, and his recommendation was adding yogurt or lactobacillus...some dog foods just don't work for certain dogs, and I don't think you should have to add supplements just so your dog can tolerate the diet.

THE LUCKY BISON ARE CONSIDERATELY NOT  CASTRATED, BRANDED, OR DEHORNED BEFORE BEING TURNED INTO DOG FOOD.<br /><br />Blueberries help support a healthy urinary tract.<br /><br />Yucca Schidigera Extract - helps to lessen stool odor and is an aid to the joints. As long as our dogs do it outside, I don't care how their stools smell.<br /><br />Millet, Brown Rice, Cracked Pearled Barley are complex carbohydrates that, according to Solid Gold, are good sources of fiber. The non-allergic grains are certified organic and free of pesticides.<br /><br />Just a Wee Bit is intended to be a good alternative for those dogs who can't tolerate lamb, beef, or chicken in their diets.<br />Solid Gold uses only wild caught fish, not fish from fish farms.<br />Nutritionally complete and balanced.  This is true. The bag did not tip over when I stood it up.<br /><br />Made in the USA<br /><br />Each bag is specially sealed for freshness hermetically. I don't know where they find all the hermets to do this though.<br />As of this writing, a four-pound bag of Just a Wee Bit is a shade under 13 dollars at PETCO.<br /><br />Bella's Experience -<br /><br />In an impulsive frenzy, the Spudette fed Bella the new food right out of the bag with a little bit of Solid Gold canned food. Bad move. When introducing a new food, one should add a small amount of the new to the old and then gradually increase the percentage of new food in the mix until you reach 100% of the new stuff. Not surprisingly Bella got a bout of runny stools after this rude introduction to Just a Wee Bit.<br /><br />Within a week, however, Bella had adjusted to her new food and seems to be doing well on this new diet. I haven't smelled her stools to see if they are less odiferous and have no intentions of conducting such a test. As an added test, I put less than an tablespoon of the Solid Gold kibble on the plates of Evie and Piper. They actually seemed to like this new food quite a bit, even the ever-fussy Piper.<br /><br />Just a Wee Bit is the smallest dog kibble I have ever seen, and I've seen quite a few brands. Ever look at the little paper circles inside a whole puncher? Individual pieces of this kibble are almost as big as those paper cut outs and about as thick as a nickel. Be careful pouring this food because it's easy to drop a few pieces and almost impossible to find them. You'll have to rely on your dog's sense of smell to recover any dropped kibble. Occasionally Bella gets bits of this micro kibble caught in her throat making us think the tiny size of the pieces is too extreme.<br /><br />Finally-  I must admit that, based on the inclusion of wholesome ingredients and the exclusion of junk, this is an excellent dog food. Most dogs should thrive on such a recipe. One on a budget will probably prefer to find an alternate quality food that isn't so expensive. Since this formula is intended for dogs that have allergic reactions to some common ingredients in other foods, the extra expense really isn't necessary for dogs that have no such allergy problems. For hypersensitive Evie, this is a terrific choice. For dogs that can eat anything, it might be considered extreme.

review/summary: Great for dogs with small mouths
review/text: My Chihuahua has always had problems with the larger sized dry dog food, because he has a very small mouth that is over crowded with teeth. I picked up Solid Gold at my local PetCo after searching for a replacement for his normal dry food (Iams, I know, I know! But I had tried another high quality food a few years ago, and he developed a bladder infection). I didn't realize how small the pieces were until I opened it, I had purchased it based on the breed size on the bag.<br /><br />He loves it - the small pieces are perfect for his little mouth and he finishes his serving at once, unlike anything he's eaten before. His coat his healthier, with less shedding and I have noticed less drainage around his eyes.<br /><br />This is a great product, I highly recommend you try it for your dogs if you're looking for a healthy alternative to the more mainstream commercial dog foods, especially if they are a small toy breed.

review/summary: This food was too good - dog went on a diet!
review/text: Our Yorkie was on Canidae since the day she came home from the rescue, but recently Canidae switched their formula and the new formula did not agree with her.  The Solid Gold Wee Bit came highly recommended from several trusted sources, so we switched.<br /><br />Because the new formula of Canidae wasn't working for her, we switched her cold turkey to the Solid Gold.  Normally I like to switch gradually, mixing in a larger percentage of the new food with the old each day until they are completely switched over.  This normally prevents upset stomach and loose stools but we were unfortunately already there.  :-(<br /><br />Our Yorkie took to the new food immediately, and the loose stools stopped within one day.  She loves this food, so much she was eating too much and had to be put on a restricted diet.<br /><br />There have been no negative affects from this food (aside from some weight gain).  Her coat looks great and her energy level is high.  5 stars!

I reluctantly shared it with four others who were really taken back about how good the fudge was so it's not just me - it was a hit all the way around :).<br />One thing to note is the fudge ( I bought 1/2lb of each) came in a lovely decorative box totally suitable for gift giving so you could purchase and have it sent directly as a gift knowing that it will be arrive wrapped nicely and professionally.<br />In my reviews I like to include the "cons" but there simply are none for Mo's Fudge - I will never buy any other fudge again and doubt you will either after you give theirs a try.

review/summary: Pink Lemonade: possibly best flavored Emergen-C yet
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:11 Mins<br /><br /></span>Emergen-C<br />Pros-best priced Vitamin drink mix which includes Vitamin B as well as 1000mg's of Vitamin C.<br />Emergen-C Pink Lemonade flavor has a nice tart kick.<br />Cons-taste can't compete with Super C or Zip Fizz.<br /><br />RDA-Recommended Daily Allowance-my mistake.

review/summary: fight that cold!
review/text: I either got lucky twice or this stuff staves off an oncoming cold. My three grandkids are with me all the time and are all under three years old. That means a lot of colds. I got sick of being sick and decided to try this product. So far it worked. It is easy to take and tastes fine. I will be taking some tonight since all three are little snot factories again. Keeping my fingers crossed.

review/summary: Yum!!
review/text: I have no idea what all that vitamin C is doing in my gut, but Emergen-C sure is tasty! In fact, I didn't feel any different after drinking this stuff. Its yumminess and the fun of watching it fizz up in a glass of water is enough to make me happy, though.

review/summary: Works better than Airborne
review/text: After having not so good results with taking Airborne to prevent catching colds and flus, I started taking Emergen-C. Each time during the past 2 years when a family member has caught something, I immediately started taking Emergen-C and have successfully not caught anything they had.<br /><br />Before, I managed to always get at least one cold or flu each season. But since I started taking Emergen-C, I have not suffered from any. It works great, and since it comes in so many flavors, it's easy to find a flavor that's right for you.

review/summary: Pretty good flavor
review/text: I'm new to this Emergen-C and I just love them.  I'm not normally a fan of lemonade or pink lemonade but I bought these for my son originally and have no problem taking them.  They really help with my sore throat big time.  Good stuff.

review/summary: I Love this Stuff
review/text: I love this stuff. I take it when I am going ton a trio, and while on the trip. have never gotten sick before or after, (even in Cuba). When I AM ill I take 3 packets during the day and am over it within 2 days. I don't like all of the flavours, none of them are fantastic, so i only put abut 2oz of water in a glass, add this and shoot it down.
