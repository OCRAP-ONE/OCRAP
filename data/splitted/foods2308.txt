review/summary: My Dog Loves These Treats!
review/text: We've got a really picky eater of a dog.  Actually "picky" doesn't adequately describe him.  But when these treats come by mail, he rushes to open the package himself.  These treats are his favorite by far.  His other choice is another treat by Pet 'n Shape (the sweet potatoes).  I doubt there is any dog alive that doesn't gulp these down.

review/summary: Excellent, nutritious dog treat
review/text: This dog treat is one that my dog went crazy over.  Whenever she smelled it she was in her nice sitting positon trying to go into the up position or sticking out her paws to shake....basically all the tricks she knew. High in protein and low in moisture, a treat that was also good for her. I would sometimes cut up some with her food, which guaranteed an empty bowl. All in all a great treat in my left pocket the had all the neighbourhood dogs hanging around me. Great cost to value.

review/summary: Too acidic
review/text: I wrote reviews for the Cafe Altura whole roasted beans as well.  In the case of the whole beans I was really disappointed because some of the beans were badly burned (to the point of carbonization) and it ruined the flavor of the cup.<br /><br />I this case my review is not nearly as negative.  The roast of the beans that went into this ground coffee looks even.  However, the acidity comes across very strong and registers as an unpleasant sourness.  The aroma is balanced and if that were the only measure I was going by then I may give 4 or even 5 stars.  The true flavor of this coffee is overwhelmed by the acidity.  They may be able to improve the situation by darkening the roast a bit.<br /><br />I will probably continue to give Cafe Altura another chance when it goes on sale.  If I notice they are getting it right I'll edit my reviews accordingly.

review/summary: One of the best tasting coffees you can feel good about!
review/text: I must say for the price of the coffee I was a bit nervous about what I might receive, but all I can say is that I am very pleased.  I would compare the flavor to a Maragoya, but a little lighter. It is a light roast so the flavor makes for an exceptional pairing to a simple breakfast of a croissant or other light bread, the flavor is by no means intense but it is there.  As for the acidic nature of the coffee I would place it is on par with most coffee house light blends and a below a Italian roast.  Overall a good coffee and if you do not like it, the tins are nice enough to make a present of or as a donatation to the church for after service coffee.

review/summary: Very, very close to what I'm looking for.
review/text: (4.5 stars)  I'm always on the search for a good-tasting, satisfying, fragrant coffee with a price that's within my budget.  The closest I've ever come is Dunkin Donuts medium roast but even that has gone up more than 50% in price in the last year or so.<br /><br />I was just given the opportunity in the Vine program on Amazon to test Puroast low-acid coffee.  Sounded like a good thing, but it turned out to taste like burnt mud.  So I went looking for another alternative on Amazon and am so glad I found this organic medium roast.  It's pretty darn good for the price.  Relatively fragrant, nicely strong but not burnt or bitter in flavor and not acid producing.  And the price is great.  Once I figure out how often I'll be needing a new 3-pack we're probably going to go for the Subscribe and Save program.

review/text: This coffee is very good tasting.  I'm trying to go more organic and I like this coffee more than others I've tried.  I only wish it was in a more air tight container (the flavor tends to change after a week or so of opening).  The regular roast is smooth and mild.  It doesn't have a jolt of caffeine that makes me jittery, just a gentle effect (but I don't brew it strong).  I like that I'm not getting chemicals and pesticides (which are readily absorbed into coffee beans).

review/summary: Like Strong Tea
review/text: We like a good tasting regular or breakfast blend in our house. Nothing so strong that it leaves you with an upset stomach. Lately, we've been trying a variety of the organic coffees offered on Amazon. Unfortunately, this on was a major disappointment. It's more like strong tea. Our standard measure, with a fine grind, is 6 standard tablespoon sized scoops for a 12 cup drip coffee maker. This coffee was so weak that it didn't even taste like coffee. The second pot, I used 10 scoops, which was a little better, but still had no distinctive coffee aftertaste. If I have to do that, it's a poor value. Our baseline is the Dunkin Donuts regular ground coffee, which smells and tastes like a good cup of Joe. Since coffee cannot be returned, I have to purchase something to mix with this at home, or give it away (I don't know anyone that would want it if I don't like it).

I read the label and it sounded good so we bought all they had and took it to our hotel room.<br /><br />With the very first bottle, i could taste a difference in this water versus any brand i have ever had. I have been a bottled water drinker for many, many years. This water makes a difference.<br /><br />I have been ordering this from the company and from Amazon and have asked for Whole Foods to carry it but for some reason they have not chosen to do so. I am so glad that Amazon is carrying this water.<br /><br />I feel better drinking this. I am hoping to lose some weight and get even healthier  on this water, but so far have only lost a small amount.

The shipping company even called to confirm my address for delivery. Cooked the first package today and served with drawn butter. I chose the boiling water method. Bring the water to a boil and insert the langostinos and only cook 2-3 minutes if thawed; 5 minutes if frozen. Don't overcook or they will be tough and dry. I have a bad habit of overcooking fish thinking that it must need more time. It is so worth the money and I will be ordering these again.

review/text: The coffee beans that I normally order from Amazon are different varieties of  Eight O'Clock coffees. But I did add this Copper Moon Hazelnut coffee last week to my regular order of  Eight O'Clock coffee just to try it out.<br /><br />The Copper Moon Hazelnut coffee arrived well sealed in a plastic bag, but was lacking that smell of fresh coffee beans when the bag is first opened, and after they are ground. The coffee beans are a light brown with no sign of any oily sheen on them. They also lack the stronger coffee taste of the regular Eight O'Clock beans that I have ordered.<br /><br />It is a smooth light roast, not a medium roast, with no hint of a chemical or burnt taste, compared to some other flavored coffee beans that I've tried, and is a good sipping coffee.  The Hazelnut flavoring is slight, but you are aware that it is there. My wife prefers it to the stronger medium roast taste of the Eight O'Clock coffees I buy, but for me it is a bit too bland.<br /><br />If you wish to have a smooth tasting morning cup of light bodied coffee without any annoying aftertaste, then this might be the coffee for you, but I prefer a stronger coffee taste from my coffee beans.

review/text: We love this cat food. When we first got our cat (he was a stray Siamese kitten), I got him a bag of Special Kitty just until I could figure out which food was best. We switched immediately to By Nature Kitten formula, and after one bag of that, switched again to the By Nature Adult food. He took to it instantly. His fur is beautiful - even though he's an outdoor cat, full of energy, slender, and not an ounce too much fat on him at all. Sadly the stores here don't carry it anymore, so I've resorted to buying it online - which saves on gasoline for my car, at least! I've used both Amazon and Wag dot com. I think I prefer Wag (a bit cheaper). An excellent food!

Iams , and Science Diet, these all have fillers .Blue Buffalo made them fat and lazy and anything you buy at the stores like Walmart, grocery, even some of the feed stores are the worst food you can feed your cats they all have corn one of the worst things for you or you cat , think about it they fatten pigs with it, fillers and not at all healthy for them . People just don't get it , they wouldn't eat just foods that contain fat and sugars and junk as a staple why do you give your animals crap! Yes, it costs more but our cats only go to the vet for shots. they have healthy teeth no hairballs they maintain a good safe weight and they are older cats but they play all the time still.So, take good care of your pets we are all they have and they depend on us.

review/text: Happened to try these out at a local event. Bill Aossey(Midamar foods) had got a few cases just for giving away(bless him)...<br />I'm usually skeptical about trying out cereal/protein bars due to the amount of refined sugar/fat/processed stuff in it. But these were unusually good. I usually have this for dessert though, well thats just me I guess being the low carb person I am, but these bars were really good, they tasted great, and had healthy stuff in it. My other favorite is the Almond milk chocolate flavor. The Almond cranberry protein bar seems to be pretty good too, but beware of the coconut bars (mango-coconut, dark chocolate-coconut, etc) not only do they taste bad but they're full of sugars and loaded with saturated fats. The date-walnut bar was good but too sweet, understandably with the amount of dates in it(the whole bar was mostly made of dates) but a good snack for diabetics with hypoglycemic tendencies.<br />My only complain is the pricing...they're so expensive.

review/summary: These cookies make going gluten free a bit easier.
review/text: I am at the beginning of my gluten free journey and have largely been dismayed by the taste of most gluten free foods purchased to date. But these cookies are AWESOME!  I love the strong gingery flavor and while they feel quite hard to the touch, once you put them  in your mouth and chew, they break apart very easily and practically melt in your mouth. I wanted to eat the whole bag during the first sitting and enjoyed them so much that I nibbled on them throughout the day until the bag was empty.  YUMMY!<br /><br />I didn't order these through Amazon, I purchased them at my local supermarket.  I always worry about the age of mail-ordered food and the conditions in which they were stored.  Plus, I can see that given the hardness of these cookies, if shipped they probably would be mostly crumbs upon arrival.

review/text: I know allowances need to be made for being gluten free, since it's hard to get good texture and taste from gluten-free, but these chocolate chip cookies don't compare at all well with their namesakes.  There's a weird flavor that overwhelms everything else--not sure if it's the rice syrup or what, but whatever it is, that plus the texture which is pretty gritty and chalky at the end makes these cookies a one-time purchase.  They're so bad I'm throwing them out instead of eating them.  The gingersnaps are tolerable.  Not great, but definitely more edible than the chocolate chips.

review/summary: Pamela's Products Ginger Mini Snapz
review/text: I use Pamela's pancake mix and my family loves it, so I was eager to try her ready-made cookies as well. Have to be honest and say that I don't really care much for the Simplebites Ginger Mini Snapz. They are so HARD! Way beyond "crispy". I think part of the problem is they're just too thick. A thinner, wider cookie would have been better. On the plus side, though, they are very gingery.<br /><br />I'm going to try to soften them up a bit. And perhaps they'll be good as a pie or cheesecake crust, but just for snacking, no, I wouldn't recommend them. Now to think of what to do with the other 5 bags. :/

I wouldn't buy these for .25 cents a bag.

review/summary: IT is okay but I like the chocolate chip better
review/text: This is coming from a chocolate lover.  I ordered the "extreme chocolate" cookies thinking I was up for a challenge.  Well, they are good but not great.  I can't believe I'm saying this but the chocolate is actually overwhelming.  I'm saving the rest of the bags to make a chocolate crust for my cheesecake but I won't order this type again.  I do agree that it almost tastes like the top part of an oreo but with more intense taste.  My husband hated them and my 3 year old wasn't fond of it.  On the other hand, I have been ordering the chocolate chip flavored ones.  They are awesome!  It has a perfect balance and a hint of vanilla.  My family loves it and even my co-workers too!

review/summary: Tasty for a "cookie-free" cookie
review/text: I've been struggling with food intolerance lately, and by far the worst offender is sugar. Be that as it may, for some reason I don't have a problem with these cookies although they do contain sugar in the form of evaporated cane. They taste wonderful with just the right amount of spice and taste great dipped in coffee or milk if you can have that. I'd never know I was eating wheat-free gluten-free, or as my husband calls it, a "cookie-free cookie," had I not read the package first. I like ginger snaps to begin with, and these taste great. They are a bit larger than a quarter, are crisp rather than soft, and have 130 calories per 4-cookie serving. No trans fats; 10g sugar.

review/text: I have recently been put on a gluten free diet and have been nosing around at my local health food store for cookies that I could eat which did not contain wheat/gluten nor nuts/seeds.  I happened upon this bag of ginger snaps and was leary - I have not had much success in finding comparable substitutes for the real thing.<br /><br />These cookies blew me away!  They are crunchy, spicy, sweet and all around as close to "the real thing" as I have encountered in a long while!  I would recommend that you try just one bag first from your local health food store to see if it will work for you before committing to a case - but I LOVE them!

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Cookies So Far
review/text: I recently began a gluten-free diet and have tried about 10 different types of cookies and bars, i even attempted to make some from scratch which ended in the garbage leaving me very frustrated. I couldn't handle the texture and taste of the rice flour or the mixes i purchased. I was about to give up on finding a good wheat cookie substitute and decided to try these, even though the packaging did not make them look appetizing at all.  To my surprise these cookies tasted like the real thing.  I am very happy and will continue purchasing these from now on whenever i feel like i need a treat and will not feel sorry for myself any more. Thanks Pamela!!

review/summary: INCREDIBLE FLAVOR, BUT.....
review/text: I purchased these along with Pamela's gingersnaps. The ginger snaps were not that great to me: too sweet and sandy tasting. The extreme chocolate mini cookies were delicious! The flavor was extra-chocolately (I love dark, slightly bitter chocolate, so for me, I was in chocolate heaven) and I COULD NOT STOP EATING THEM: ate one entire bag in less than an hour....YIKES....:-) With this said, I could not give this product a 5-star rating, because I noticed the next day that my stomach was burning very much.  I don't know for certain if the culprit are the cookies, but my diet was not different aside from the cookies, which admittedly was an overindulgence on my part, so perhaps this is why my stomach was on fire. I have eaten overindulged in other foods which have not given me the same result as these. Also, they were a little too crumbly and dry,(sandy) but the taste was so spectacular that these cookies earned additional points; otherwise, I would have rated them 2 stars. So, for those with sensitive stomaches be forewarned, you may experience burning, esp. if eaten in excess. After nearing the end of the bag of these cookies, I noticed that I became satieted with the flavor/taste. I don't know if this means that I won't feel the need to eat the entire bag of the next bag. If I do, I will try my best not to eat more than 10/12 cookies a day. And, finally, these cookies also stuck to my teeth. I had to rinse with an anti-cavity rinse (twice), floss, and brush my teeth (twice) with toothpaste.

review/summary: The best gluten-free chocolate chip cookies on the market
review/text: I feel like I have tried all of the gluten-free chocolate chip cookies on the market, and these are the clear front-runners for me.  Njoy Life usually has wonderful stuff, but their chocolate chip cookies don't hold a candle to these.  These are also better than Pamela's shortbread chocolate chip cookies and her chocolate chocolate chip cookies.  I saw someone compared them to Chips Ahoy, and I would agree with that.  Whoever said that you can't taste the chocolate chips must not have tried many other GF chocolate chip cookies, because there are many worse tasting ones out there.

review/text: I guess I'm weird.  This is the only Pamela's product that I did not like.  I love the full-size dark chocolate-chocolate chunk cookie, but the Simplebites had a bitterness I just did not care for.  My husband (who eats gluten) liked them much better than I did.<br /><br />I'll let all you 5-star folks have these; I'll have the Simplebites regular chocolate chip mini cookies, or the aforementioned dark chocolate chocolate chip cookies, thank you very much.

review/text: Excellent cookies!<br /><br />They require milk, however. They are not sickly sweet like a lot of cookies tend to be, they are truly cocoa flavored cookies.<br /><br />I recommend them for chocolate therapy to get through tax season. You need very few to get maximum effect.

review/summary: Better from the store
review/text: I first purchased these cookies at our local health-food store and fell in love with them. They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside--heaven. I decided to purchase them on Amazon since it was more cost-effective, and I was pretty disappointed with them. They tasted old and crumbly. My advice is find a store that carries them and pay the extra money. It's worth it.

review/summary: Finally, a GF ginger snap!
review/text: Okay, so they aren't as chewy as the wheat version of a ginger molasses cookie.  They don't quite *snap* like the wheat version of ginger snaps.  Like a lot of gluten-free cookies, they're more crumbly than chewy.  On the other hand, they do give a good kick of that ginger taste I have missed since I have began avoiding wheat years ago.  I also like that these don't have corn in the ingredients list- just rice and tapioca for flour.  So many of the GF alternatives use corn flour, which might work for Celiacs but doesn't always work for those of us who have intolerances that include corn.  I am pretty keen on the idea that I could pulverize these in the food processor and use them for a graham cracker crust.  I think they'd be phenomenal in a trifle or as a pressed crumb layer of a layered cookie.  I've been pretty happy with the Pamela's line of GF products, and this one did not let me down.  This product is going on my permanent Amazon shopping list.

review/summary: NOT MY FAVORITE
review/text: I was expecting something a little more snappy and a little less sandy. The flavor was okay (I personally love strong ginger flavors, which I am yet to find) however, they were too sweet for my tastes. I don't know, but it seems like Americans have a strong taste for excess sugar. It would have been better if there was less sugar and more spice, as well as less sandiness and more snappiness, imho. For those who like chocolate, try the extreme chocolate cookies, but be careful as they may cause burning of the stomache; esp. if many are eaten. Not my favorite Pamela's product.

review/text: This Ginger Snap would be my favorite cookie even if I weren't gluten intolerant and could eat<br />any type of cookie I wanted. The perfect amount of crunch...better than the Pamela's full sized<br />ginger snap which is a bit soggy, but more gingery...<br /><br />Crumbled it's great for a pie crust..but generally I just eat a few after dinner with coffee or tea.<br /><br />I've made mini ice cream sandwiches for my grandkids..I put<br />softened ice cream between two cookies, roll sides in mini chocolate chips, then put the little sandwiches back in the freezer. Good for adults who want portion control or tiny treats without going overboard.. I've made mini s'mores with them too... Once the package of cookies has been opened, I keep them in my refrigerator.  Keeps them crunchy and fresh tasting.

I tried the ginger snap crust and it was a little too much ginger for the delicate tasting filling.  Next time I'll try using less crumbs and sprinkle a little for topping. Haven't tried the chocolate cookies for a dessert crust yet - I ate my 6-bag case too fast!

review/summary: Autism Diet Cookie
review/text: Medical studies have demonstrated that autistic children are more receptive to their therapy when on a strict gluten free diet.  The problem is that children love to eat tasty chocolaty 'junk' food things.  So how to satisfy their taste buds and maintain a gluten free diet?  Alot of the gluten free stuff out there is non-palatable.<br /><br />After MUCH trial and error we discovered this delicious chocolate chip cookie.  We performed a blind taste test with all the Dream Factory tribe and this cookie stood at the top of the cookie heap.  Flavorful crunchy.  Microwaving for about 20 sec softens them up and brings out their chocolate flavor even more.  Their small size (2" dia) is perfect for little hands.<br /><br />Did you notice on the bags cover;  the cookie on top to the right.  The configuration of the chips makes a sad face.. . .  Look.<br /><br />Pamelas also makes a great pancack mix.
