review/summary: energy drink that tastes good
review/text: This is the perfect energy drink: it's not too sweet,it's not too sour or taste like medicine and best of all it's 8 oz ( instead of having to force down a 12-16 oz energy drink. It really is the best tasting drink out there.

review/summary: Cost is too High on Amazon
review/text: I have been using this product for ten years. It was my alternative to coffee in the morning. I would purchase a 36 count case at smart and final for around 28.00. Now you cant find it locally. I even live in the same city as the factory, so I called and the rep said that they are still selling it to the stores and I should ask the manangers to order it for me, which I have done several times at several stores. It never comes in on the truck. Hansen is flooded with calls complaining that it is no longer available locally. The rep said that she is going to talk to the owner and call me back after their March meeting. We will see what happens. I was willing to drive to the factory 20 mins from me but they would not sell it to me. Hmmm was it part of the contract with amazon to pull it from the local stores so we would have to buy it online for a higher price? I noticed that now they offer a subscription to have it delivered on a monthly basis! One sec let me take a sip of this 5 hr energy drink...ahhhh okay. So like I was saying this kinda sounds like a exclusive distribution contract with amazon to me.

review/summary: Average At Best In My Opinion
review/text: Took a chance on this product after reading all the positive reviews.  I'm not really a fan of this product.  It was effective in terms of providing energy, but the taste wasn't quite right.  Since most energy drinks have similar ingredients, I think the problem might be too much Ginseng and/or Ginkgo Biloba or maybe something with the citrus aftertaste.  I will try something else next time since there are so many other energy drink choices out there.

review/summary: Best Energy Drink Ever
review/text: For me this is the best energy drink ever.  Doesn't have the jolt of some of the others, it just gives that nice boost that I need sometimes, especially before a workout.  Only draw back is I have to order it so that I have it all the time.  The outlets I used to purchase this from (Sam's Club, Smart & Final) don't consistently carry it.  I hope Amazon keeps it available.

review/summary: Hansens's Natural Pro Energy Drink
review/text: I decided to give Hansen's Energy Pro (sold at the local 7-Eleven) a try, because it was a dollar cheaper than Red Bull. Wow, what an amazing difference. First, it tastes way better than Red Bull. Secondly, it gives you sustained energy for hours with no crash and burn like other energy drinks. The only problem drinking Hansen's is sometimes forgetting it's 7 pm or after, because at 3 a.m. I'm still wide awake and full of energy. Whatever Hansen's did, their scientists came up with a formula that beats other energy drinks hands down, including Sobe and many others. And do not be fooled by the cheaper price. Hansen's Energy Pro is the best energy drink on the market, like you've drank some magic elixir that transforms you from being lifeless to full of life. The energy boost lasts many hours at an even level, void of rapid heart beat or fidgety nerves. I have experienced no side effects other than feeling great. So, stellar job Hansen's.

review/text: I purchased this product at the end of July 2010 because I have been looking all over for these energy drinks.  I use to buy them at Sam's Club but one day they just stop carrying them in the store, so I started looking on line for someone that sold them for about the same price.  I was to excited when I found them on Amazon.com.  I love these drinks because of the taste and I have not seen these on TV referring to side effects like the other energy drinks have.  I would recommend this product if you need some extra energy.

review/summary: Don't Know What The Hype Is About
review/text: Honestly, I got these drinks and all I can say is that I was underwhelmed.  I thought, "Did my body just respond differently to this magical elixir than everyone else's...?"<br /><br />Packaging: First off, the plastic that was supposed to envelop the drinks had stretched and ripped, the cans were quite dirty (had to wash them all off), and they all kind of fell and rattled around the box.<br /><br />Taste: "Eh".  These taste like most other energy drinks, but perhaps a bit fruitier?  I actually prefer the taste of Red Bull to these.<br /><br />Energy: Here's where I was mainly concerned.  When I drink a Red Bull, about 30 minutes after I finish it, I feel more energized.  I actually don't like the "jittery" energy Red Bull provides so I was hoping Hansen could come to the rescue.  Instead, I felt like I drank a fruit juice box because I felt only slightly more alert - and I am not convinced that wasn't just me looking for it.<br /><br />Health: Come on people, this still isn't healthy, it's just healthier.  But if I don't get energy out of it, I think I'll just stick to drinking healthy fruit juices.<br /><br />Try it for yourself, but I would recommend getting 1 at a local store to try it before you buy it (I now have 10 of these babies that are probably going to feed my lawn - I hope that the grass will feel energized and grow).

review/summary: Great drink at a bad price!!!
review/text: I live in Southern Oregon and can get these cans for $1.19 each for a daily price or I can get an additional 10% off for buying it by the case. $25 for 12 cans is NOT a good deal and if you contact the company directly to find out who sells it near you your bound to get it cheaper than this... I buy mine from Market of Choice in Ashland Oregon and absolutely love it!!! It gets me moving in a much smoother way than caffeine/high fructose corn syrup based drinks. Working construction its important for me to NOT fight the drink Im using. Taste is somewhere between Mountain Dew and Sprite. Lightly carbonated and best when ice cold. Love the drink but would NEVER buy it at this price!!!

review/summary: Best crunchy peanut butter on the market
review/text: Go to your grocery store's peanut butter aisle and look at the crunchy varieties available.  With one exception, each brand will sell creamy, or SUPER ULTRA SO-CRUNCHY-YOU'LL-CRY-ABOUT-IT CRUNCHY.  Peter Pan is that exception.  It's not extra crunchy, or super chunky.  It's not a jar of whole peanuts with some peanut butter filling in the gaps to hold it together.  It's peanut butter, with some crunchy peanut bits in it.  It's that simple.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the 18-oz. jars I've been buying have been hit by the grocery shrink ray, and are now only 16.3 oz., so I may need to order this 3x40 oz. package instead.  Hopefully, my current stock will last long enough for me to psychologically prepare myself for buying 7 1/2 pounds of peanut butter off of the internet.

review/text: PETER PAN is my favorite peanut butter in the whole wide world and PETER PAN's Crunchy Peanut Butter is my favorite crunchy peanut butter and I'd love to buy this peanut butter crunchy and I've always preferred PETER PAN to SKIPPY and JIFF, but for some reason stores stopped carrying 28 OZ jars and 40 OZ jars of PETER PAN Peanut Butter years ago and will only sell PETER PAN in the 16 OZ size only which was perhaps due to JIFF and SKIPPY outselling PETER PAN since stores still carry both SKIPPY and JIFF in the 28 Ounce and 40 Ounce size as opposed to PETER PAN.<br /><br />In addition to that; the only reason I dont buy PETER PAN Crunchy Peanut Butter online is because Amazon only sells it to you in this 40 OZ sized jar in a pack of 3 and wont let you buy it individually just like they wont let you do with PETER PAN's Creamy Peanut Butter either, but hopefully Amazon will start allowing people to buy any sized PETER PAN Peanut Butter in a 28 Ounce or 40 Ounce sized jar eventually to help us waste less money and products.

review/text: I'm on a special diet because of my allergies.  We live in a small town in the rural mid-west, and it is very difficult to find barley flour.  When I do find it -- it is about $4 to $5 a pound!  This product is great -- around a $1 a pound -- with free shipping to boot.  Thank you so much!!

review/summary: Best Bread Ever!!
review/text: This flour is amazing for making bread! The flavor is fantastic.  My family loves it more than white or wheat bread now.  I just use about 60% barley to 40% bread flour and it adds so much more nutrition to our bread.  Barley is loaded with protein, fiber, antioxidants, pytochemicals and lots of great flavor!  I'm so thankful for Amazon and Great River Organic for carrying this 25 lb package! It is great for pancakes too (even using 100% barley flour without adding white)!

review/summary: Delicious fall treat!
review/text: We discovered this pie crust (and the Walnut) at a local craft fair a few years back...since then the Pecan or Walnut pie crust coupled with the Pumpkin Spread filling has made our favorite dessert for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners every year.  Both the pie and spread are SUPER easy to make (from someone who does not cook/bake at all) and make the most delicious fall dessert! I'd highly recommend this product - our whole family loves it!<br /><br />Our only dislike is that we've had trouble getting the Village Mix products locally as retailers never seem to have them in stock...I'm thankful that they are now offering online purchasing through Amazon and their own website so that we can avoid our holiday clamoring for the mixes!

As for the product itself, it's extremely good, especially in this quick recipe:  take slices of bread, spread lightly with miracle whip or mayo, layer on your favorite lunchmeats and cheeses and pour this gravy over the whole thing. Make sure it's on an ovenproof dish/pan/plate.  BROIL for about 3-5 mins until cheese is bubbly and the edges of the meat are slightly carmelized. DELISH, cheap, easy and soooooo obviously bad for you but oh so worth it.

review/summary: Not the real thing
review/text: I am originally from Europe (Germany) and love Italian Cooking. After moving to the States, I have a hard time finding the ingredients that I was used to get easily there in the american grocery stores. If I can find them, they are overpriced and of inferior quality (parmigiano reggiano anyone ?). I often feel that people are knowingly tricked by the industry by product names which resemble the "real product", the best example would be olive oil.<br /><br />Happy of at least finding one of my favorite pasta brands ("deCecco"), I was looking for the San Marzano tomatoes which I was used to get at my local italian grocery store for 1.50 Euros (about 1.80 USD) a can (the acidity of most american canned tomatoes is too high, in my opinion).<br /><br />So far, I have only found this brand at the local grocery stores, and after reading the label, I was very suspicious about it - a San Marzano tomato, produced in USA ? I gave it a chance anyways, at last, they have a high price and they are still on the market, so they might have something going for them.<br /><br />After opening the can, I instantly saw that these can not be real San Marzano tomatoes - San Marzanos are long and thin and bittersweet (once you tried them, you will be able to tell), these are spherical and sweet and sour.<br /><br />I have used them in soup and pasta sauces so far, at least they seem to be a little better than the regular canned tomatoes in the grocery store, but it can not justify the price tag - in Europe I can get this quality for about a dollar.<br /><br />So if you are searching for a good canned tomato, keep on searching - these here might not taste all that bad, but they are not San Marzanos and they are expensive as well.

review/text: Although I'm not a former disgruntled employee, I have developed some reservations about "San Marzano" brand tomatoes.  When I bought my first can of these tomoatoes at my local grocery store, I thought, great San Marzano plum tomatoes stright from Italy for under $3 for a 28oz can!  Then when I got the can home and opened it, the tomatoes inside didn't look like the ones on the can.  They were round, and didn't look like plum tomatoes, which resemble little eggplants.  Further, after reading the label, I realized these tomatoes are from California, and have nothing to do with the San Marzano reigon of Italy at all.  What a dissapointment!  Buyer beware: these tomatoes are not from San Marzano, and probably aren't even plum tomatoes!  As for taste, it was OK, but definately I was left wondering 'where's the great, sweet, fresh flavor people say San Marzano tomatoes should have?'  If you are looking for an average tomato this brand should suffice, but if you want the real San Marzano tomatoes, please save youself the dissapointment and keep looking.

review/text: These tomatoes are domestically grown in CA. To the person who said that they didn't know how anyone can tell where they're from, read the product description written by the manufacturer. It says "these are domestically grown tomatoes...", it also says "grown in California" right on the label.<br /><br />To the person who said he had tasted them, and referred to another reviewers comments and said that person had not tasted them, please reread the review. He clearly states that he had tasted them.<br /><br />As for me, I have cooked with these many times, because they were on sale at my local Safeway. They are definitely NOT the real deal! They do not look like, nor taste like real San Marzano tomatoes grown in Italy- which I have tasted and cooked with many times. They taste like any other run of the mill American grocery store brand. I agree with the 1st reviewer that their labels are false advertising, and the price they charge on Amazon is highway robbery! $4.50 + shipping- ouch! I paid about $1 per 28 oz. can (on sale) at my local market. Save your time and money- if you are looking for the real deal, this is not it. There are websites that sell nothing but real Italian products, grown in Italy, and stamped with the official Italian DOP seal.<br /><br />Nancy

There's been a lot of interest in San Marzano tomatoes lately, and this is just one of the products that's attempting to cash in on that interest.  Fortunately, I always read labels, so i wasn't fooled by this product, still, I bought a can just to see what they were like.  Terrible!  Don't waste your money on these tomatoes.  There are many other canned tomatoes on the market, real San Marzanos as well as other types that are more flavorful and sometimes even less expensive.<br /><br />I wanted to rate this product with zero stars, but the posting format requires that it get at least one.

Just like from our garden, when the squirrels actually let us have some of our own tomatoes (rarely).  We search these out and will pay extra for them.  The taste dances on your tongue.  Use them as a sauce, no other ingreditnets necessary.<br /><br />These are the only canned tomatoes we eat in our house, and I grew up with Hunts (sugary) and Centano (salty) in my Italian-American home.

review/summary: Alright people...You want the truth?  Read on...
review/text: Ok, I've read a lot of people COMPLAIN about this product, not knowing what the heck they're talking about.  I have the truth (with proof) about this particular brand of canned tomato.<br /><br />First off, if you know how strict the laws are about wine in France, then the same applies with Italians and their tomatoes.  If they are not "DOP" certified, and GROWN in San Marzano sul Sarno, Italy, then by law they are not allowed to be called San Marzano Tomatoes.<br /><br />Which now brings me to this product.  Yes, the BRAND NAME is actually San Marzano, however, they are not grown nor imported in/from Italy.  BUT (and it's a HUGE but), they are actually San Marzano tomatoes.  "How can this be??" you ask?  Well, they are GROWN from San Marzano tomato SEEDS!  AHH HAAA!  They are locally grown in the US, in the same conditions as San Marzano sul Sarno, Italy with San Marzano tomato seeds.  Probably the closest thing you will find to the real thing, without the cost.<br /><br />I found a website that backs up my info, and also rates EVERY kind of canned San Marzano tomato.  Here is an excerpt of this brand:<br /><br />"This Domestic San Marzano product has been cultivated in the USA using the same variety of seed used in San Marzano, Italy, which produces a tomato that is deep red, firm and meaty, and with very few seeds."<br /><br />If you want to find the website I'm talking about, do a search for: San Marzano tomatoes brands & companies, and click on the first link (sorry, Amazon won't let me link to them directly). You might learn something about this great product!<br /><br />There you have it.  They never lied, they didn't mislead, they are true to there brand (literally! HA!).<br /><br />You're welcome.

review/summary: If these tomatoes are wrong, I don't wanna be right
review/text: This was the first brand of San Marzanos I tried when I first heard of these tomatoes. I made the famed "butter sauce" and nearly fainted with amazement as they truly lived up to the hype.  Then I read that these weren't the "real" thing I tried two different brands (Cento and Bella Terra) thinking, "wow, these will surely be mind blowing!"  And while yes, they were good, I'm going back to these.  I'm cooking up another pot right now and instantly I can tell the difference (and it's not even done).  These interact with the butter SO well, there is a velvety creaminess that is out of this world.  The other brands didn't quite achieve that same level and I found myself wanting to add more butter.  With these tomatoes, I think I can get away with LESS (but wouldn't want to).  I don't know what they do to them, maybe it's the California soil.  I know some people are upset because the label is misleading but, did they try this sauce? THIS sauce?  If they did, they might pardon the error.  Maybe they should just rename these San Calzanos or Marzifornias so that the sticklers can relax. Or not. More for me.<br /><br />Marzifornia Butter Sauce: 1 28-oz. can of bogus, counterfeit deliciousness, 5 tbsp. butter, one medium yellow onion peeled and halved.  That's IT! Put all three ingredients in a pan, bring to a simmer on medium heat, then lower heat to maintain a continuous low bubbling simmer for 45 min.  Stir occasionally while crushing the tomatoes against the side of the pot.  Discard onion (or don't).  Serve on your choice of pasta and go to heaven.

review/summary: Not great, not San Marzano either...
review/text: Everyone knows now that the brand name is San Marzano, but these tomatoes are not grown in this region of Italy nor are they from San Marzano seed. All in all, the product is a round, domestic tomato with added preservatives. What I don't understand is how they can say these are grown from San Marzano seed. If they were from San Marzano seed wouldn't they have an elongated shape rather than a round one? I'm also surprised at how many people think the DOP stamp on other Italian tomatoes are some sort of guarantee of quality. The fact is there are more cans of DOP Italian tomatoes being sold than DOP tomatoes being grown in Italy. You do the math. Most DOP products also have added preservatives and basil. I personally look for natural brands at my local Italian deli for the best luck with tomatoes. The best thing is to try several brands and decide for  yourself.

review/summary: Ok, so they're not grown in Italy...
review/text: I've tried this brand as well as the "Cento"  DOP certified 'grown in Italy" San Marzano, and I'm sorry to say, I do NOT see any difference in flavor. San Marzano is identified as much a type of tomato as where it is grown.<br />Just as I don't consider a 'beefsteak' tomato as being cut from a cow because it has the word 'beef' as part of its name.<br />Frankly, I almost prefer this brand over the Cento brand because these tomatoes come pre-crushed. This means I don't have to get my hands or a potato masher in there and start tearing up the tomatoes to make them  blend in<br />with the sauce.<br /><br />I'm also not cooking my pizza in a wood fired oven. Shame on me.<br /><br />Maybe if someone is a purist and can honestly distinguish these from San Marzano tomatoes that have been imported from Italy, then they can keep buying the more expensive 'imported' tomatoes.<br />But I just don't see the point in spending $1.50 or more per can to buy 'the real thing' when there's no discernible difference in flavor or taste.<br />Sorry, I just don't feel like belly-aching over something so trivial. I"m baking the pizza for myself and my family, not running a restaurant or trying to satisfy Italian quality laws.<br /><br />These tomatoes are just as good as any others. I didn't give them five stars because while I don't see them as being inferior to 'the real thing', I also feel that I can make my own tomato sauce that tastes every bit<br />as good as the san marzano canned tomatoes. So, while these tomatoes aren't bad, they're aren't perfect either. I've yet to find any that are.

review/text: These are not San Marzano tomatoes at all. Someone was clever enough to name their company San Marzano knowing that naive consumers would be aware of the cache that real DOP San Marzano tomatoes carry and mistakenly think that they were getting a great deal. What they are getting is just a domestic plum tomato. And frankly, these tomatoes are even weak for a domestic whole peeled tomato.

review/summary: Fake San Marzano in a Can
review/text: I bought this brand at a grocery store and by chance am cooking side by side with a can of DOP San Marzano tomatoes from Dani Coop.  Major difference is this San Marzano brand apparently (from what I read on internet) is San Marzano variety of plum tomatoe that they grow in Italy except it is grown in California under different conditions.  The San Marzano brand is much lighter, almost watery flavor and it does not immediately breakdown i.e. still alot of chunks after slow cooking for 30 minutes.  The Dani Coop had intense flavor, a bit on the acidic side and immediately brokedown into a sauce once I put it on the burner.  There is a major difference in price as the Dani Coop is around the same price as the SM brand except it is 14.1 oz instead of 28 oz.  I would not buy the SM brand again given I was deceived on the San Marzano label (and the expensive price!).  I will try other San Marzano brands.

review/summary: These are grown in California.
review/text: I bought them at a local foodie-palace, but I don't think the proprietess had really looked at the label. It's a clever way to repackage standard variety tomatoes with an expensive-sounding name. San Marzanos form Italy can be wonderful, and expensive. Canned tomatoes from California might be, but these are not. Stay Away.

review/summary: Zero Stars?
review/text: These are a can full of nasty.  Yes, more of a scam than anything.  I'm very sorry for the positive reviewers - as there are simply certain things in the culinary world that are a complete 180 degree shift when you have quality and sub-par - tomatoes are one of those things.  Tomatoes aren't like pizza - when even the bad ones are pretty good.  For a tomato to be good, you need bright &pure tasting fruit, proper acidity, and lack of detracting flavors.  These have none of these traits.  They taste metallic, processed and bland.  So, no offense (ok maybe a little) meant to the positive reviews, but buy and DOC tomatoes and taste next to these.  If you can't tell the difference, you probably shouldn't be writing food reviews on Amazon.

review/summary: the best "san marzano" tomatoes
review/text: I've been buying these San Marzano style tomatoes for at least ten years now.  The can (I've got one in front of me as I'm writing) actually gives no information at all on where they come from, so I don't know on what basis one reviewer claims they are grown in California.  (Also, the picture on the label is a not a photograph, but a stylized drawing of a tomato, and I think the contents do in fact look like the picture.)  It would be nice if they were more up front about the provenance of the product, but...<br /><br />But all that's really irrelevant.  I've tried a dozen canned versions of San Marzano tomatoes, mostly pricier and actually imported from the San Marzano region outside of Naples, and these are the tastiest:  sharp, tart, depth of flavor, and very meaty.  Individual tastes will vary, but if you put olive oil in a pan, cook some garlic, and simmer these bad boys for about 30 minutes, you'll have an amazing sauce, especially with a basil leaf or two.  For that matter, these are as good as the tomatoes I've had actually in Naples, so I'm really not going to complain about where they are grown.<br /><br />Lastly, the crushed variety of these--which admits openly on the label that the tomatoes are grown domestically--is even better, producing amazing pasta sauces, pizza sauce, and the like.  Amazon should carry that as well.

review/summary: It was a good deal but not likely to buy again
review/text: I am from the Philippines, a country where there is an abundance of coconuts. I miss drinking coconut water which is something that you can easily get in my country by buying fresh coconut. So, I decided to try this product hoping to get the same satisfying taste that one would get from fresh coconut water. It turned out to be a disappointment. I do not doubt that this is indeed pure coconut water but it does have a sort of artificial flavor and smell to it. It might be just due to the plastic bottle itself.

review/summary: You couldn't pay me to drink this!
review/text: I recently started researching the benefits of drinking coconut water and consuming coconut oil daily because I have been trying to change my lifestyle from one of total nutricious abandon to healthy yet happy.  I absolutely love cooking with coconut oil, adding it to my morning coffee, using it as a skin moisturizer, anything and everything I possibly can use it for, and have been telling all of my friends and family.  I never really liked coconut so it did take a little bit to get used to the coconut taste with the oil.  The coconut water, however, was a little trickier.  I knew it would be very beneficial to hydrate myself with it after a hard workout so this is what I decided to do: I bought the Zico 14-ounce bottle of natural coconut water from my local supermarket and also bought a can of Goya's coconut water with pulp to see which one I would be able to drink.  I tried the Zico first thinking that since it's in a plastic bottle and so much more expensive it would be the natural winner.  I had chilled the coconut water in the fridge all day and when I opened the bottle and poured it into a glass I noticed a funny odor immediately.  After my first taste I was horrified at how terrible it was.  It's hard to describe, kind of plastic(y), bitter, and just nasty!  I've had coconut water/milk straight from a coconut before and it was delightful, Zico's does not taste a THING like that.  I know that this has no added sugar whereas Goya adds a little and Zico is "supposedly" pure but from concentrate.  I tried another sip thinking that it would grow on me, but no, not one little bit.  I then decided to open up the Goya, cautiously I tried it and I LOVED the coconut pulp and the taste immediately.  I know everyone has different tastes and I will admit that I was never a coconut lover before, but I figured since I have grown to love coconut oil I would be okay, but again, it may be an acquired taste.  My suggestion would be to try a can/bottle of different brands before you give up on drinking coconut water.  I am so glad that I didn't just buy the Zico because I would have signed off on even trying if I hadn't had the Goya right there to redeem itself.

review/summary: Almost Undrinkable
review/text: After hearing good things about coconut water from friends, my wife and I bought a case of Zico from the warehouse club.  We were pretty excited to try it and let it chill in the refrigerator for several hours.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this beverage is truly disgusting.  It has a musty smell and it's difficult to even take a drink, something just seems off.  There's a foul flavor almost immediately while taking a drink which is followed by a deplorable aftertaste that is still wreaking havoc on my taste buds almost an hour later. My wife was able to take about two drinks and I struggled to drink half the bottle and could not stomach any more.<br /><br />We were very disappointed and will be returning this awful product.

By the way, it is also awesome as a mixer (or so i hear).

Taste.<br /><br />In-depth Review:<br />I have been drinking Zico on and off for several years.  I thought it was the best of the Vita/ONE/etc varieties.  This was back before they were bought by Coca Cola and I was also buying the boxed version.<br /><br />I bought this new bottled version without reading the details and did not realize that this new form was from concentrate.  I did not pick up on a 'plastic" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!<br /><br />Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this.

review/text: I drink a lot of coconut water.  The three best tasting brands were ONE, Vita Coco, and Zico.  Recently Zico has sold out to Coca Cola and changed it's formula.  It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again.

We have tried Zico, VitaCoco, and O.N.E. coconut water.  Zico is my favorite in terms of flavor diversity, and O.N.E. is my favorite in terms of packaging because each drinking box includes a small extendable straw to poke through the foil and use like a juice box- a VERY NICE non-spill feature for kids.

review/summary: Worst coconut water EVER
review/text: I've tried a lot of brands of coconut water, and have found that I like Zico pure coconut water the best. It has a clean refreshing taste that's not too overpowering. The 11oz boxes are what I normally drink.<br /><br />This product(14oz bottles) cannot compare to the box. The tast is absolutely horrible. Way too thick and sugary. It's almost as if they drained a bunch of old coconuts that had been sitting too long. I would advise anybody who enjoys the 11oz box to stick with that and stay away from this joke of a product. Nasty.

review/summary: What have they done????
review/text: I'm from the Caribbean and now live in the United States.  Since I can't get fresh coconut water where I live I order it from Amazon all the time...every few weeks or so.  My wife thought I was crazy at first, but she came to acquire a taste for coconut water and so I order some for her as well.  I loved the zico in the 11oz cartons.  I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their "new" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.  Hope you don't make the same mistake that I did.

review/summary: very very very disappointed
review/text: I was sooo initially excited about pre-ordering on amazon.com before it was available.  Then someone posted a not so good review from this same product in store and I was concerned.  Customer service said non-returnable item once shipped because it is considered perishable item.  My order just came, and boy am I ssooooooo DISAPPOINTED.  Smells funny, tastes salty.  Not same formulation.  Zico should have disclosed new formulation.  Before stumbling on Zico, me and my girlfriend did numerous taste tastes with the other brands.  I will try to hunt down Harvest Bay Coconut Water.  That brand was very comparable to the old Zico.<br /><br />I was a ZICO fan, but this new formulation just is grossly disappointing.

review/summary: hated it
review/text: worst coconut water ever, period.<br /><br />I saw them in my local BJs and thought of trying it, the taste was horrible, had an artificial flavor to it which remains in ur breath for some time. I thought of trying after my 6 mile run, and even then I couldnt drink it. had to return it and then bought some good coconut water from a local asian store (realcocowater) and it tastes much better and doesnt have any artificial flavor like this.<br />I would not even give it a one star if possible.<br />Dont buy this, its a waste of money

review/summary: So disappointed
review/text: I love the Zico coconut water in the little Tetra Pak boxes. It's my favorite drink. I should have read the reviews for the Zico in the plastic bottles, but it never occurred to me that the same brand could be so different. This isn't even close to the same taste. It's disgusting. I can't even describe how bad it is. Something like liquid plastic flavor with slight fermentation. AWFUL! Please do not order this product if you think you like Zico coconut water in the Tetra Paks. If anyone tried this they would think coconut water is the most vile substance on earth.

review/text: Love coconut water, really don't like this brand, kind of tastes like plastic.  Vita Coco and Naked is much better!  Will never buy it again!

review/summary: Tastes like plastic
review/text: I have bought the version in the boxes before, but thought the plastic bottles would be more convenient.  Unfortunately it makes the drink taste like plastic.  The plastic taste is very strong, and awful.  Stick to the boxed type.

review/summary: Never again
review/text: My husband loves coconut water. We were ordering via "subscribe and save" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the "from concentrate" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying "top dollar" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the "liquid" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our "subscribe and save" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will "subscribe and save" to another brand that uses the real stuff!
