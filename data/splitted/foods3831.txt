review/summary: Recommended by herbalist--love it.
review/text: We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Leaf Tea
review/text: I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.

review/summary: I use this tea for menstral cramps
review/text: I use this tea for menstral cramps.  I drink a lot of it and it works fantasticly on cramps and mood.  Here is the catch - you can't expect to drink one cup and feel better.  I make big containers of ice tea - and I start drinking it all the time about two days before my period even starts.  Also, once my period starts, I try to make sure I have a cup every two hours- sometimes I have even more.  So again, it works but drink alot.

review/summary: Birthing Miracle Tea
review/text: I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery.

It is full of aroma and tastes much better than the usual herbal teas that i have tasted in the past. The Rose flavour is the best.

review/text: This tea really works. Drink a big cup before bed and in the morning you will have to use the bathroom. Sometimes I have to eat just a little something before it kicks in, but it always works within 1-2 hours after waking up. It does not really taste that great, but it is okay. Definitely helps me keep my weight even.<br /><br />Personally I like Kleritea better (more gentle, tastes better) but that costs almost 4 times as much. So I stick to Alvita Senna Leaf Tea now.

review/text: I purchased these tea bags in hope for a good night sleep. The first night I drank it, I slept great.  I have continued to drink this every night and I still sleep well but I find myself waking up in the middle of the night once in a while.  I do find myself urinating more often so maybe it is cleaning me out.  No bad side effects, tastes good alone, no sugar or honey needed.  I recommended this to my family and co workers and they all love it.  I discovered this from Dr. Oz.  Hoping to continue to sleep well.

review/summary: Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me
review/text: I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box. Still, it was worth a try because it was nice at first.

I usually put some honey in it and it goes down great.<br /><br />As for the rest, I've only been using it (3 times a day) for the past 7 days and haven't gone a full cycle yet, so I don't know if it really does work for PMS yet or not.

review/summary: A great product, you must try!
review/text: I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.  Often times I have treated many of my friends with it to help them get back to feeling well.  This particular brand is high quality and good medicine.  I highly recommend buying this tea as we all need to get away from Western medicine as much as we can when other opportunities are out there.  The idea is to stay in balance and not get extremely sick by using products like this early on when symptoms first start developing.  I think you will find this product very useful and effective.<br /><br />*  Please note: Do not mix to many herbs and or prescriptions medicines as they can counteract and amplify the strength or effect of the meds or herbs.

Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells.

review/text: I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know.

review/summary: Best tasting/effective
review/text: After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.

review/summary: Please get past the taste.
review/text: You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/summary: Great Taste!
review/text: I've been searching for a good-tasting protein drink since I had a gastric bypass 3 years ago. I saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try. You can drink it warm (unlike most other protein drinks) or cold and it mixes quite easily if you use a container with a blender ball. I thought it was a bit too thick when I mixed it according to the directions (2 scoops in 12-14 oz. of water) so the next time I used more water. Others might prefer the thicker version, though. I also added crushed ice after I mixed it which kept it cold longer and made it more like an iced coffee drink. When I travel, I take my empty blender ball container in my carryon bag, stuffed with ziploc bags filled with protein shake powders but on my next trip will be taking these packets instead.

review/summary: Metallic Taste is the Deal Breaker
review/text: Purchased this to use for travel as it's difficult to find iced coffee in most hotels & using water to mix makes it the perfect travel drink. I so wanted to love this. You have to shake vigorously - preferably using a shaker with a stirring ball or filter - as it's VERY grainy & takes about 2 minutes of solid shaking. Grainy I can live with, but the taste is the deal breaker. It has an incredibly strong metallic taste. The only way to soften the taste is to add lots of milk, which defeats my purpose of bringing a water mixing drink to travel. It's expensive for the convenience and would have been worth it - if only I could drink it. Oh well, the search for a traveling, water mixing iced coffee continues.

review/summary: good, but...
review/text: If you've never tried this chocolate before, you'll be surprised how good the unlikely combination of chocolate with a bit of grainy sea salt can taste. It is considered dark chocolate but its 47% cocoa content is less than most darks - so it might be overly sweet if you're a fan of really dark chocolate. It has a bit of a milk toffee flavor. It's good enough that it's still one of my favorites. In comparison, Ghirardelli Intense Dark Sea Salt Soiree is similar but even better in my opinion...it uses more fully-flavored chocolate as well as almond bits.

review/summary: Uses artificial ingredients
review/text: I have long been a fan of Lindt bars, and this one was no exception, although I do agree with another reviewer that most of the flavoring of this particular bar comes from sugar (19 grams, or about 1.5 tablespoons per serving!) and milk.  I was especially disappointed, though, to discover that this bar contains "artificial flavoring".  Read the label.  Apparently, some of their other products do as well.  Such a disappointment from what I thought was a gourmet chocolatier.

review/summary: Lindt: A touch of sea salt
review/text: This is an amazing chocolate bar. It has just enough salt to enhance the dark chocolate. It is not salty at all. Even my husband who is a milk chocolate fan enjoys it and steals some of it.  One bar lasts about 2.5 servings. It's great to satisfy your sweet tooth. I always keep a few bars on hand in the fridge. The bars can get pretty pricey in the stores ranging to almost $4 to the lowest price of $2.

review/summary: Not the Best, But Really Good
review/text: If you adore really really dark chocolate, then this bar might not be the best one for you.  It's very good, but the cocoa count is not the highest around.  That being said, the sea salt really brings out the flavor of the dark chocolate in this candy bar.<br /><br />The first time I heard of salt being mixed with chocolate, I thought it must be an awful thing...but, thankfully, I was proved wrong and this is now a favorite blend of mine.  Lindt does it really well, as I've also had some chocolates where the added salt was definitely too strong.<br /><br />Even my relatives--who had also never heard of such a thing--found themselves really enjoying these Lindt bars when I bought them some bars for the holidays.  Now, they ask me to bring some along every time I visit.

You've gotta at least try it for yourself.  If you don't want to go for the case, they sometimes sell these individually at stores like TJ Maxx for like $2.

review/text: This is not health food, but it sure does taste good. My favorite chocolate to eat out of hand, a small amount is highly satisfying. Sweeter than some dark chocolate (a bonus for me, but I'm a milk chocolate fan) but still not overwhelmingly sweet. The best part, for me, is a little goes a long way. You can (or at least I can) fully satiate my sweet tooth with about a 1/4 of a bar, which is a calorie save over, say, a candy bar or slice of cake. Always good to have on hand.

review/text: The principal ingredient of this bar is sugar. It also contains milk.  The cocoa content is less than 50% .  If you are looking for a semi-sweet dark milk chocolate this could be very satisfying.  If, like me, you prefer a high cocoa content without milk and all that sugar you will be disappointed and resent the misleading labeling.

review/summary: Nutritional value is "meh," but my kid loves these things
review/text: Like the title of my review says, these little puffs aren't much different from run-of-the-mill Cheerios in terms of their healthiness--though they are somewhat better--but our little man (15 months old as of this date) absolutely loves them.  They are pretty unsubstantial, so he can snack away on them without fear of ruining his dinner appetite.  Other things that I like:<br /><br />  1) They're organic.  I don't know how many pesticide molecules are finding their way into a box of Cheerios, but my guess is not many!  Still, I like that these are organic.  Every little bit helps, right?<br /><br />  2) They dissolve very quickly so there's never any fear of choking no matter how many he stuffs in at once.<br /><br />  3) The container is more convenient that a box of cereal.<br /><br />  4) Like I said before, my son really enjoys these.<br /><br />In terms of health value, I find them to be similar to Cheerios.  If you adjust for the weight or volume differences, comparing the nutritional information shows that the Cheerios have more vitamins and fiber, but also more sugar and sodium.  Though none of these amounts are really significant concerns to me. For example, a half cup of Cheerios has .7g of Sugar while the HB Puffs have 0.<br /><br />Now for the one negative--the real kicker--and the reason why I am giving this very good product just 4 stars.  Purchasing these from Amazon (6-pack, as of July 20, 2011) will cost you about $1.47/ounce.  Purchasing a 14oz box of Cheerios from Amazon on the other hand is just 21 cents/oz.  The HB Organic puffs are 7X more expensive! (And of course, getting a 19lb box at Costco changes the equation further). But unless you're giving your kid a ton of these, or you're feeding multiple kids, the price difference probably isn't a deal breaker.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'd try them both and see which your little sprout goes for.  Can't really go wrong in either case.

review/text: I want to say THANK YOU to happybaby for making the organic sweet potato puffs that are gluten free.  My son has severe milk, egg, and oat food allergies.  The irony is that these are labeled as a "gluten free" food, but it is also free of the other allergens. It is very hard to find a product that satisfies his allergy needs.  Everything is either milk free and has oats/wheat... or gluten free and has milk protein.<br />We buy this product in bulk from Amazon and will continue to do so as long as they continue to be milk, egg, gluten, and oat free!<br />I'd give this product ten stars if I could.<br />THANKS again to happybaby and thanks to Amazon for making them available in bulk at an affordable price!!!<br />(PS. If your child has food allergies, please read the label and don't take my word on it!  They could always change the ingredients.)

review/text: My wife and I really wanted to get our baby some hard food for her to work on dexterity without introducing any gut irritants like gluten to her. Kids don't need the cereals, they add no needed nutrients they can't get from veggies/fruits and meat, but it is a good tool for teaching them coordination, plus it's fun. My little girl absolutely loves these. When she sees the bottle, or just hears us shake it, she smiles from ear to ear and starts kicking her little feet with delight. They dissolve quickly and taste just fine. She has never choked on them, so that's a big plus. They are a bit more than your standard puffs, but the low sugar, and no gluten is well worth the price. Buy these puffs!

review/text: Ordered these for our 14 mth-old twin daughters. They eat a vege gluten-free diet, due to family food allergy history. We are expats living in Riyadh, it seems there are no gluten-free baby products available here. Puffs were well received and because they are small, they require good hand-eye coordination in order to pick up and eat. Which means Mummy and Daddy get time to plate/heat (and sometimes eat our own) food. Other reviewers stated the container was easy to open and consequently led to spillages etc. We haven't found this to be the case, containers pop shut easily and stay shut until we open. Babies go through one container of puffs a week roughly, and no problems with softness or spoilage of product. Will definitely be buying again.
