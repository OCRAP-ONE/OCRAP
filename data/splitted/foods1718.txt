review/summary: Living protein ruined good cereal
review/text: I had nearly finished the first box of Amy's Honey-Almond Protein Cereal and thought it was great until I noticed the little black specks and white secretions stuck to the inside of the paper liner.  I checked all the other boxes and there were bugs and white stuff inside all of the unopened bags.  I was truly disappointed with the living "protein" in the cereal.  The shipment number is 2012OCT08, purchased last month.  Should I return the boxes or will Amazon please reimburse me for the problem?  I have never had the problem with the other gluten free cereals from Amazon.  Thank you.

review/text: I love Brach's regular Lemon Drops, but, needed to cut back on calories and sugar. I came by the Brach's Sugar-Free Lemon Drops at our local drug store advertised as "new" and gave them a try. They are just about as good as the regular, sugar lemon drops only with a cleaner, fresher, lemon flavor and a textured, rather than, sugar coating. Each drop is individually wrapped and easy to drop a few in my pocket to enjoy throughout the day. I also did not notice any problems with my stomach after eating about 4-5 of these. I really have to thank the Brach's folks for making these!

review/summary: Best Sugar Free Lemon Drops around!
review/text: Ok, my Dental Hygienist told me that I should try sucking on sugar-free lemon drops to help keep my mouth moist (I get dry mouth frequently).  So, I started a search for the best tasting, most convenient Sugar Free Lemon drops on the market.  I searched online, found out the various brands currently available (Brachs, Go-Lightly, Atkins & Crystal Light, and Walgreen's brands).  I then tried them all, and have determined that the Brach's are my favorite.  I like how they're individually packaged in air-tight wrappers, so I can pop a few in my pocket to always have some on hand.  I also like how they're fairly large in size, so they last a while in your mouth.  Finally, I like how they're dry & hard, as opposed to other brands that are sticky/gooey.<br /><br />In any event, save yourself the trouble and try these Brach's sugar free lemon drops, they're available at many Walgreen's drugstores, and for less money, order them on Amazon!  They're as good tasting as the real thing!  Oh, and they're sweetened with Splenda.

They were in my freezer and I used them just recently.<br /><br />The Shahi Polou Persian Pilaf Meal contained a one-inch long, very hard thorn (I found it while chewing). Had I swallowed it, I'm sure it would have caused problems.<br /><br />This is a heads up! Maybe I was the only person who got one (let's hope so).<br /><br />(I still have the thorn and the package it came in.)

If you've been eating commercial peanut butter, it may seem bland at first.  It's like eating non salted peanuts, the flavor is pure peanut butter and blends easily with other flavors.  This is my peanut butter of choice, I would not buy any other.

review/text: Our 8 month old kitten loves this food. He used to act like he was ravenous with the Iams hard food, and canned Fancy Feast. Now he does not growl any more and eats more like a normal cat. Also, my other cats are on the adult version of this food, and what used to be a fast meal time, I have noticed is much more relaxed and slower. All I can figure is ,it's like teenagers and a box of sugared cereal. They have to keep eating to get filled up. I believe this food has much better ingredients and fills them up and they are satisfied.

review/summary: wonderful and good value
review/text: Purchased this along with the villaware crepe maker.  Have made two batches of crepes so far per the recipe (using 1 cup of mix) attached.  I'd estimate each box would make 4 batches, and each batch makes ~12 crepes (will vary depending on size of course), which's enough to feed two adults.  As I paid $24 for 4 boxes, that comes out to ~12.5 cents of mix/crepe, pretty good value :)<br /><br />In terms of taste, they were very very good.  My gf said she thought they were delicious, and she's a french girl who grew up on crepes :)  The recipe attached was easy--two eggs, a little butter, 1 cup water + 1 cup mix.  Main thing to make sure is you mix the batter thoroughly so there're no clumps, but that was easy enough to do even with just a plastic fork--no mixing appliances needed.<br /><br />Definitely recommend, along with the villaware crepe maker :)

review/summary: Love Teeccino products!
review/text: Went looking for an alternative to coffee and Postum a year ago. At that time I was delighted to discover the Teeccino products. We also use the Java, Maya Caffe, and Mocha flavors. Husband was a die-hard coffee addict but for health reasons needed to cut back on caffeine; I liked coffee-flavored Postum, but it was no longer available. This 'herbal coffee' has been an excellent find for us both. Very tasty. (though the ex-coffee addict says it's NOT coffee, so don't go into this thinking it's going to BE coffee minus the caffeine! He suggests adding more chicory from a separate source to help that factor. I think it DOES taste like brewed coffee.. so there ya go!)<br /><br />I like to add a little Torani's sugar free French Vanilla, Irish Cream, or Classic (must be the 'Classic'!) Hazelnut syrup, and/or sugar free cocoa, stevia, and milk/cream; he simply prefers stevia and a little milk. A little goes a long way ~ one rounded tablespoon per small coffee maker (though husband likes to make his a little stronger using 1.5 TB).

review/summary: Different than coffee, but a better alternative than tea...
review/text: I have tried 9 different flavors of Teeccino, and I find that I gravitate towards this one the most, although I agree with some other reviewers that the Maya French Roast is probably most similar to coffee in taste. I like Sweet and Low and A LOT of half and half in my coffee, and I am also the type of person that if you told me that I could give up coffee or die two years younger, I would choose earlier death. But after reading some of the things about adrenal exhaustion and cortisol, on top of the fact that that much half and half in 3-4 mugs of half caffeinated half decaffeinated coffee is a lot of calories, I decided to try Teeccino. I find that with this particular flavor I need the least amount of sugar and half and half, in fact, I can drink it without the "alloted one tablespoon of half and half." These are not coffee substitutes in the sense that they taste identical to coffee, and yet all of these things are an acquired taste, including coffee. In actuality, this is much better tasting than coffee, (think back to drinking a sip of black coffee as a kid, you probably thought, "horrible." If these 2 things had been side by side, you probably wouldn't have liked either, but you would have more likely chosen this one.) All this to say, I have acquired a taste for Teeccino, and it did not take weeks, but rather days. I also like the fact that it is actually healthy and with each cup you're drinking vitamins, inulin which is a prebiotic, potassium (a good amount), etc. The Teeccino website is not only well designed, it has a lot of information which is helpful:[...]. I use a percolator with a paper filter, (a number 4 cone which is what I had on hand, unbleached, dampened and easily made to fit by tearing a tiny hole in the bottom), to make it which has become my preferred method of making it. I have also used a drip with a paper filter which is fine, and a french press which leaves too many grains in it. (If you are looking for "gluten-free" you have to use a paper filter either with a drip or a percolator.) So if you are looking for a "coffee replacement," which is not tea, (I like tea, but it wasn't getting it for me in the morning, too weak and insipid compared to coffee, and not what I was "used too"), then I would recommend going to Teeccino's website and ordering the $[..] sample packets (free shipping USPS), and trying them before you buy an 11 oz. bag. It is an acquired taste, but one worth acquiring I think.

In addition to this being a great coffee substitute Amazon offers it for a reasonable price verses the cost at a health food store ....and it's shipped right to your home.  How convenient!

review/summary: Teecino
review/text: I love TEECCINO.  A truly different beverage experience.  Yummy. No acid & no caffine.<br />It actually tastes so rich it seems like it should be fattening.<br />A real teat.  Teeccino is an unfortunate name for the product though, in my<br />opinion.  Hard to remember.  Doesn't reflect the beverage.  Awkward.<br />It's more like  CoffeeISH  -  C's premium blend non-bean beverage.

review/summary: Suprisingly Good!
review/text: I bought the sampler pack from Teeccino's website so I could try all their flavors before buying it in bulk on Amazon. The package arrived today and I brewed up a pot of the original flavor, once it was done brewing I made up a cup like I used to make my coffee, cream and sugar. It tasted just like coffee to me, and I grew up drinking coffee so I should know what coffee tastes like by now. It won't taste like many of the standard grocery store brands of coffee, it's taste a little more "exotic" is the best way to describe it. On a couple sips I did taste individual flavors like date or fig but it was not overpowering and it did not make that sip taste bad just a little more "exotic".<br /><br />Once I'm able to drink coffee again (I'm pregnant and decided all caffeine was out of my diet until done breast feeding) I don't think I'll go back to coffee. I think I will just stick with Teeccino for a tasty and healthy alternative.

review/summary: Great Herbal Coffee
review/text: Teeccino is a great way to enjoy a hot beverage in the morning without all the acid and caffeine you get with coffee.  I also use a natural sweetener like rice syrup or honey in it.  If you are a coffee diehard, switch over by blending half coffee and half teeccino in your coffee maker....it brews like regular coffee, except for one thing....it only takes half as much per cup, so it's relatively inexpensive, especially with Amazon subscribe & save pricing, which gives you free shipping as well.  How can you beat that?<br />PS.  I also add a touch of cinnamon (like I do with my regular coffee) for added flavor.

review/summary: Simple, beautiful, heartfelt bachata
review/text: As my friends will all tell you, I'm not a big bachata fan. In my opinion, a lot of modern club bachata is treacly, cloying, and overproduced. Bachata is, at its heart, country music, and it can suffer from the same problems as country music in America - once it is exposed to big money and fancy recording studios, it loses something. Joan Soriano still has that something. His songs are simple and joyful, and seem to be more closely tied to the tradition of Juan Luis Guerra, which combines the native rhythms of the Dominican Republic with a wider Afro-Carribean musical idiom (amid the bachatas and merengues, Joan even makes a brief venture into Cuban music on the seventh track,  "Popuri de Son"). There is bittersweet earnestness in Joan's music which comes through very clearly and makes him a real joy to listen to. I recommend him very highly!<br /><br />For a great sample of Joan's music, check out NPR Music's Tiny Desk Concert with him on YouTube, or for a deeper look, try Adam Taub's documentary "El Duque de la Bachata", in which Joan stars.

review/summary: Good but no Mayimbe.
review/text: Yoan Soriano is a very underrated bachatero. he did the soundtrack for the recent documentary "Los tigeres de la bachata" or in English "Santo Domingo blues." the movie focues primarily on the way more popular Luis Vargas however. I wonder why Soriano was chosen to do the music and not Vargas himself but it's all good. Soriano is a very good guitarist and songwriter, but like many bachata singers he falls into the trap of sounding like 50% of every other bachatero out there. True, this is an album of crisp guitar work and upbeat songs, but it is not up to par with the TRUE king of bachata, undisputibly, that would be EL MAYIMBE Antony Santos. Even Luis Vargas has a wider repotoire, but then again, this is the only album I've heard by Soriano. I appreciate this album and want to give it 4 stars, but it really deserves less. The songs are very good and he has a bright future as a bachatero, I like that he is one of the lesser known bachata singers/songwriters. Many Dominican friends of mine have never even heard of him, including my wife who is Dominiana. But alot of people had never heard Juan Luis Guerra before "Bachata Rosa." This is not Soriano's "Bachata Rosa" however. Antony Santos may be "El Rey"( The King of Bachata ) but if Yoan keeps up the good songwriting and fluid guitar pickings, we may see a new contender. Santos is known for being a monster guitar plucker in the bachata style. True Soriano sounds like alot of other bachata out there, but he also is BETTER than the other 50% out there. I'd try to invest in the actual movie "Santo domingo blues" first, being that Soriano is included in the movie, but i don't see it being released on dvd anytime soon. And that is truly a shame.

review/text: This extract doesn't smell like roses at all.  It has a very herbal smell, something like lavender but not as pleasant.  I'm very disappointed.  Small bottles of rose essence I bought at an Indian grocery smell much more like roses than this product does.  I don't know if there's a chance that the bottle was mislabeled and really is some other extract, but I won't be able to use this product to flavor things with a rose flavor.  I'll have to stick with rose water and the rose essence I bought at the Indian market.

review/summary: Oh, Beautiful Sweetness!
review/text: I did not purchase La Chinata's Sweet Smoked Paprika from Amazon, but I have tried this product.  In short, I can only say it is beautiful.  It's like a soft silk caressing the tongue.  It imparts a smokey flavor that is enhanced by the unique flavor of Paprika, only this paprika is one of the best I have ever tried.  There is more depth to it as it hits every surface of your tongue.  Goes well on many things, though in my household we prefer it on fish with color, such as salmon.  This also goes well on white-meat chicken, adding flavor to an otherwise rather flavorless meat (just a side note: organic, free-range chicken is always more flavorful than prepackaged, frozen, "housed" chicken).  Though this paprika is sweet, it is great for savory dishes.  I highly recommend trying it!

I was not aware what paprika was capable of on the palette, until now. I added about a quarter teaspoon to a small pot of fresh picked Lima beans, quartered tomatoes, a hock bone and a tablespoon of Grey Poupon mustard. I can only say that I wish I had made more for next day leftovers!!<br /><br />Smoky, slightly sweet and sooo delicious. Can't wait to try it in other dishes. Also looking forward to trying the other paprikas in this line.

If you enjoy a strong cup of coffee, you cannot go wrong here. Never heard of Boyd's before this, it is an average price for "middle class" types of coffee, but in my opinion better than almost anything that big corporate machine in the Northwest is turning out. Hope this helps....thank you Boyds

No matter how much I seemed to spend on what passes for "regular" cat foods she looked terrible.<br /><br />It is definitely a dense food, but that just means I fill up the bowl less often - usually once a day, down from two or more when my younger cat was eating constantly because the food I gave them had so little real food in it!  From the way my cats' condition has improved, it appears to be a very healthy food as well.  I saw the difference in my Siamese mix's coat less than a week after switching from what was basically fish flavored corn cereal to this - her coat is shiny again and she has definitely gained back some weight on Blue Wilderness.  My cats will push each other out of the way to have the first bite after their bowl is empty.  My picky eater even eats Blue Wilderness kibble straight from the floor if it's given as a treat.<br /><br />I have tried several other "holistic" and "real food" cat foods, but this one is definitely the most preferred by me (Amazon.com makes it very affordable compared to my local pet stores) and my two cats.  I am happy to have found a somewhat reasonably priced, nutritious cat food - most cat foods belong in the cereal aisle or are so expensive that I would probably have to sell my car to afford them.  Blue Wilderness strikes a nice balance.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />When I got my new kitten recently (that makes three cats total now), I noticed that Blue Wilderness is now making a kitten formula of this food (not yet available on Amazon.)  I picked some up at a local Petsmart for the new arrival.  This food must have a good reputation outside of my own opinion, because when I told my vet what I was feeding my kitten, he put away a free sample of a lesser quality "vet recommended" food he had offered me without another word.<br /><br />I have tried many other grain free foods over the last year or so and Blue Wilderness is still my go-to food.  I've never had any issues and my cats enjoy both the bagged and canned varieties.  It's nice that it has a lot of flavors to rotate through so that they don't get bored.

review/summary: Great food for active cats!
review/text: I have three very active ferals that I tamed as kittens.  They are indoor/outdoor cats and very active.  One of them was throwing up his food a lot and the vet suggested it might be the grain products in the food I was feeding them.  I switched to Wilderness "Duck" flavor and they loved it - and no more sick kitty!  The only thing is it has a very strong smell for a dry cat food.  Not too bad, but you might try a small bag to see if you can live with the smell.  I also tried the salmon flavor - One thing I noticed about the Blue Buffalo "Wilderness" salmon flavor is that it did not have the same pungent smell as the duck flavor "Wilderness" food.  So I liked that!  However, the kitties did not attack the salmon variety with the same gusto that they dug into the duck flavor "Wilderness" dry food.  All in all, this is a good dry food that is great if your kitty has a sensitive stomach.

review/summary: My cats love this food
review/text: I first purchased this food because I really try to avoid buying cat food products that have a lot of carbohydrate filler or use low grade animal byproducts and it seems the ingredients of the food are really healthy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the extent to which my cats LOVE this food. If I leave an unopened bag around, they will even try to eat through the bag to get at it. They are indoor cats, but this food really seems to agree with them. My cats don't really get hairballs anymore, their coats are shiny, and they seem to have more energy (are more playful) since I switched to this food. For whatever reason, they like this duck flavor (green bag) of food better than the blue bag formula, when given the choice.

review/summary: Great food for my senior kitty
review/text: I have a 15 year old American Short Hair who a few years ago spent 3 days at the vet b/c he could not stop vomiting. Every test was run and he was sent home - but still throwing up!  I decided to hit the internet and realized his diet was probably making him sick.  All those years, I thought I was feeding him a healthy diet.  I really think as he aged he could no longer tolerate the grain in his kibble.  I switched him to Wellness Core, and I noticed an immediate improvement in his stomach sensitivity.  Recently, I decided to try Blue Buffalo Grain Free mainly for my convenience (I had to drive across town to find Wellness Core) not really expecting to find something my cat liked better just something comparable.  Wow!  He loves the BB Wilderness!  He doesn't have any stomach sensitivity and he looks leaner and spryer!  I hear him crunching on it right now!  Another plus - it doesn't stink to high heaven like the Wellness Core - the fish smell was enough to knock you over.  I am grateful to have found the Wellness Core and it definitely improved my cat's health, but Blue Buffalo is a great product as well.  If your kitty is vomiting a lot, try changing him to a grain free high quality food.  It made a world of difference in my ol' kitty's life.  Why isn't diet the first thing vets tell you to try?  In hindsight, I feel bad it never occurred to me b/c really why are we feeding our animals food made out of corn?

review/summary: It's all about the Ingredients
review/text: The first three ingredients of any kibble pet food should be meat, and meat that is relevant to the animal eating it.  And this food delivers that, with no repeats:  Deboned Duck, Chicken Meal, and Turkey Meal.  While the last two products are "Meal" meaning that they may contain bones, feathers, feet, or egg shells, however a whole pressure cooked chicken is much better than the corn and gluten based food that most out there are.  Right now we have six cats in the house ranging from 3 months to ten years old (four are fosters), and all of them eat and love the Blue Wilderness Duck cat food. And another plus; for all six of our cats it has almost eliminated cat box odor created by fecal matter.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food.

review/summary: It's curing my diabetic cat
review/text: My cat was recently diagnosed with diabetes. I searched everywhere and talked to everyone about food. This food stood out from all the rest. So, I bought it. He loves it and has gained about two pounds - a good thing as he'd gotten too skinny. But, the good news is, he's coming off the insulin. Today the vet took him from three units to two and said he's probably going to be able to come off because of this diet.<br /><br />So I can and do highly recommend this to you for your cat. If you're lucky enough to have a non-diabetic cat, do feed it to your fur babies. Diabetes is a horrible thing and expensive to treat as well as frustrating and hard on the pet parent and the pet. If you feed this food, it's likely your pet will never get diabetes.<br /><br />I generally buy it at PetSmart of PetCo. You can get a coupon for $5 off on the Blue Buffalo website. But wherever you get it, get it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today my vet said I could take the cat off insulin. And I thank this great food for that. Hopefully he won't get it again. Be sure and tell your vet if your cat is on this food and it has diabetes because it may change the amount of insulin it is given and how its monitored.<br /><br />-- Susanna K. Hutcheson

review/summary: Excellent food. Highly recommended!
review/text: I have two cats.  One cat has been overgrooming for a few years resulting in a bald stomach and legs, not to mention hairballs.  The vet thought it might be a food allergy or anxiety and suggested that I experiment with different foods.  The other cat has a sensitive stomach and would throw up a couple times a week.  None of the foods I've tried over the past year seemed to make any difference. It never occured to me to try grain free food until it was mentioned in a Tidy Cat Breeze review I was reading (another highly recommended product - I love it!).  I purchased this food a couple weeks ago and not only has the puking stopped, but my cat's hair is already starting to grow back. This food is definately worth the price!

But my cat keeps not eating the small kibble part of the food, it's suppose to be the antioxident part. It just got to wasteful and I finally switched to another brand. I tried the dog food too and my dog does the same thing or he drops the small pieces all around his bowl. I wish they would just mix the small pieces in with the other larger ones. Jenny

review/summary: EXCELLENT BUT
review/text: This product is indeed excellent.  I talked to a rep at the store, and she said this product helps keep the the digestive tract clean by quickly sending impurities out of the body.  It has real duck and some blueberries and cranberries--not just pumace of these fruits like some other brands.  This product contains lots of good things.  I have bought it several times and my kitty really loves it.  My only gripe are the lifebites that she has a tendency to spit out.  These lifebites contain vitamins & antioxidents--they are a wonderful source of extra nutrition--the reason I buy this food.  Your cat might have some problem getting used to eating these.  I only wish they would incorporate the whole nutrition package into one single morsel--not have these separate from the rest of the food.  I don't know if this is a business decision (for taste reasons or nutrition reasons--they are in fact cold-pressed). (I have no idea if all the other morsels are cold-pressed.)  I don't know the true wisdom behind this decision to keep what are in the lifebites separate from the other morsels.  Maybe there is a good reason, maybe not.  I tried to e-mail the company and have gotten responses, but they seem to be avoiding my main question--besides the vitamins--what is in these lifebites that my cat may be missing?  Are there blueberries & cranberries--the color is darker than the rest of the food.  I would love for my cat to eat blueberries or whatever extra they put in these lifebites--besides the vitamins.  Where are the blueberries or cranberries?  Are they in the regular morsels or in the lifebites?<br /><br />(Note: dated 3/30/11:  The total list of lifebits ingredients are listed on their website.  My frustration remains the same.  I only wish they would make these lifebits even MORE tasty than the rest of the food.  The idea is very good, but the reality is frustrating.  It seems that the Chicken package rather than the Duck package has more lifebits.  This has been my experience only and may not be totally accurate.)<br /><br />You can try mixing a tad of warm water into the food to make some good broth & help bring out the aroma. Try warming up cold water in a pan. (Warm water straight from the tap might have lead if your pipes are prior 1978 & warm water has much more lead than cold water.)  Try mixing the lifebites with some tantalizing food.  These are suggestions to make your cat get the full nutrition package.

review/text: A friend advised me to get Wysong food, but the packaging was pretty inconvenient and I didn't seem to notice any difference in my cat's behavior. She also threw up from the dried pheasant stuff. I did try the blue bag of Blue Buffalo Wilderness before and didn't really notice anything either (btw I think having a sales rep in the store is kinda rude). But now having tried the duck formula after reading reviews on different foods, Shaneekwa definitely seems to be more active. She never used to run around jumping and playing like this. I'll be sticking with this one.

review/summary: Definitely worth the price!
review/text: I must say, I've tried every kind of cat food in the book. Previously feeding my cats cheaper brands, such as Kitty Caboodle/ Friskies/ etc, I would alternate to other brands such as Iams and Purina Beyond. I have two cats, (a 4 year old tuxedo "Bud" that I adopted as a kitten from the NE Humane Society, and an 8 year old orange/white tiger "Sally"  that I adopted from my sister in law). My tuxedo can eat anything & everything and it never seemed to matter, I could literally change his food every single day to a different brand and he would eat it without a problem, it was only after I adopted my tiger I noticed she wouldn't stomach any of the brands I would buy. Figuring she had a sensitive stomach, I switched foods more gradually & stuck to what I thought were higher quality brands. Nothing worked. I did some research and was horrified that I had been feeding my cats basically nothing but fillers with minor meat ingredients. I'd seen Blue on the market, but due to my financial situation at the time I couldn't manage to continuously buy it and stay within my means. Recently I've been able to afford Blue and purchased a small bag to give it a trial run with my kitties. Boy am I glad that I did. This is the only food both of my cats have been able to accept without any issues. I was also kind of worried about the Lifesource bits, thinking Sally wouldn't eat them, but she did. :) Both of my cats fur is so much shinier and they have a lot more energy. I've also noticed that they don't eat nearly as much of this in their shared food bowl over the course of the day, which I'm assuming is due to it being grain free/ no fillers. I definitely recommend this product 100%. I've given my cats both the Chicken & Salmon flavors and they've liked both. They will also eat the wet canned food as well. (Which rocks because I try to feed them both wet & dry, and it's usually hit or miss with canned food) My cats are worth the price of this food if it keeps them healthy & happy. :)

review/summary: Happy Cat, Happy Owner
review/text: I adopted a young cat and was feeding Purina Cat Chow. My cat would eat and eat and EAT and then beg to eat more. She was eating the dog's food. She had a lot of gas and freakishly large bowel movements for a 7lb cat. After doing some research I decided to switch her to a higher quality food and see how she adjusted. We are at the end of our second bag of Blue Buffalo Duck recipe cat food. My cat has more energy (oh joy :P), her gas is non-existent now and her poo looks like it came from a cat not an elephant. On top of that her coat is glossier, she doesn't eat the dog food anymore and I feed her much less than I used to. This food costs an arm and a leg, but you get what you pay for. Good nutrition isn't cheap. McDonald's vs Whole Foods.

review/text: I switched to this from wellness since it is a bit cheaper.  The wellness was a little more moist out of the package and kept my cats full with slightly smaller servings.  This may be due to the lack of filler and more protein in the blue buffalo wilderness.  I'm guessing the bag sitting in amazon's warehouse probably isn't quite as fresh as the one in a high volume pet store, thus this was just a little more dry.  Mixed with water or cod liver oil this is wonderful in treating my cat's dandruff.

She isn't a picky eater, doesn't care what I put in her bowl, but I wanted to give her something a little closer to her natural diet.  She absolutely loves this stuff!  And, beause it's such high quality food, I only buy an 11 lb bag every 3 1/2 months.  So, sure, it's a little more up front, but ends up evening out when you compare how oftenn I would have to buy cheaper bags of lesser quality, and end up feeding her more.  Alot of people say that their cats won't eat the lifebits, but I find that I have no problem with that at all, at the end of the day, only a few pieces are left.

review/text: My cat has allergies and I buy blue buffalo because it's grain free and all my cats will eat it. I live in a rural area so I have to order it online. (because no one here carries it). I previously ordered from petco but they went up $5 a bag so I switched to amazon. The only thing is amazon ships through the usps and it's 3 to 5 days slower than petco. Petco uses ups to ship which is usually much quicker. With my budget I can't afford to buy more or more often because it's $36 a bag. So I may have to switch back to petco. But the product it's self it awsome! I still have to give her meds for allergies, but the food keeps her from pulling bald spots which she does on regular food even with her medication.

review/summary: My cat is worth it.
review/text: Just ordered my second bag. My cat was/is a puker. :) I say is/was because it's summer and beings I feed her outside; I'm not sure if she still is or not. When I do feed her in the house I feed her small amounts. The reason I bought a second bag is I decided even if she still is puking, she likes the food, it looks like it's good food and she is worth the price, even if it's a little pricy.

review/summary: it's ok but...
review/text: My 5 cats loved it from day one, but day two a couple of them turned up their noses & I went back to the Friskies they were getting. Whoda thunk it but cats are cats. Won't be buying this again, too expensive anyway lol.

review/summary: A warm orangey bitter to help you digest
review/text: Herbalist David Winston maintained that the three things that would resolve 85% of clients' problems was to clean up their diet, to really listen to them and to give them bitters before meals.  Bitters tell the liver, stomach and gut to prepare for food.  Digestive juices are secreted,stomach acid is normalized, peristalsis begins and food can be properly broken down.  The bitters should be warming bitters if they are to be taken regularly (gentian based bitters like Swedish bitters are too cold for long term use.)  And you don't need very much.  Client compliance in a mobile world can be difficult though since people tend not to want to carry their bitters bottles around.  Urban Moonshine has made a portable, refillable bitter formula that won't harm your digestion.  I prescribe it to my clients and use it myself.  Five stars.

review/summary: Best Bitters!
review/text: These are the best bitters I've ever used.  They do for the digestion what we use bitters for; they also leave a clean 'taste' on the tongue.  I put taste in quotes because it isn't really the word - it's more just a cleanness with a slight, very slight, citrus note.  I'm very pleased with this product.<br /><br />I bought the spray bottle for convenience and bought a large bottle of these bitters to refill the spray bottle.  The spray bottle is convenient and easy to use - 4 quick sprays in the mouth.  Hey - this is a lot better than using a dropper and a small glass of water.  Which was fine before, but someone thought of this better way to use the product & I'm pleased.

review/summary: Cat Butt is Delicious!
review/text: I absolutely love this Cat Butt Gum.  When I chew it I instantly feel warm and fuzzy!  At first I was a litte reluctant to try it because of the name but after opening the box and trying a piece out, I realized that I love the taste and smell of Cat Butt.  The cute box is just a plus!

review/summary: A great way to get your cookie fix.
review/text: A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of "snack packs" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie "fix" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off.
