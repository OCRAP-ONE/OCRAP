review/text: Got a 12 pack of these on sale from amazon warehouse and figured it was worth trying for cheap. My girlfriend who loves most things pizza flavored was the first to try and she said they are crap. Very little flavor at all and what is there really can't be related to pizza. Not worth going for at any price.

review/summary: Acceptable taste, Made IN CHINA
review/text: I bought 5 different brands & assorted dehydrated fruits. (Why so many? I send boxes to servicemen overseas). The taste of this product is ok but not good.<br /><br />It is dehydrated so the texture is... well a dehydrated texture. The fruit taste mildly like the fruit they are suppose to be.<br /><br />If real fruit flavor is what you seek & fresh fruit is not an option, buy DRIED fruit instead of dehydrated.<br /><br />My concerns: I am reluctant to buy or eat any food product made in China. In 2008 all baby formula made in China was recalled due to dangerous contamination with poison chemicals, this was just a few years after a similar formula recall when it was discovered that Chinese made formula had substitued a chemical for the protein in formula & 10s of thousands or more babies were found to be sick or died from malnutrition.<br /><br />In 2007 all or nearly all Chinese manufactured Pet Food was recalled for the same reasons.<br /><br />Therefore I don't trust any food product made in China. If you like this product then eat it as junk food. In my opinion, no one should assume it is a healthy snack or a better choice than a candy bar or cookie.

review/summary: Yum!  My kids & I love these!
review/text: After reading that dried apples, when eaten daily, can help lower cholesterol levels, I've been on the lookout for good dried apples.  I've tried different brands, and when we bought a variety pack of Brothers dried fruit crisps at a local store, we found our winner.  I just got on Amazon to see if I could find a better price here.<br /><br />My two year old and four year old have been devouring the pear and peach crisps.  I've been eating the apple ones...and my 9 month old baby has even been enjoying the broken bits of the apple ones.  These are an excellent, healthy snack.  They have the "crunch" you'd expect from a potato chip, so they have that snack-y appeal. Knowing they're all fruit, I love feeding them to my kids...and I love eating these, too!

review/summary: Maybe not that filling, but healthy - variety pack
review/text: If your child is picky take note:  the apple and pear look the same but the strawberry & banana are in tiny pieces and are red colored.  For some reason, my 2 1/2 year old did not eat those.  I'm not giving up, don't get me wrong, I think he will eventually eat them, but I'm just letting everyone know.  I think these are a GREAT travel snack especially if you don't want to be cutting fruit.  They kind of melt in your  mouth which is cool.  I would not say these will fill you up, even for a busy boy toddler, so you may want to add a protein or fat with this as a snack.  That said, it will curb any minor munchies in a healthy way and on the go.

review/summary: YUM!!  Great for kids with sensory issues...but they are from China
review/text: I have a 2-year-old daughter with some sensory issues which have greatly affected her eating.  She will not eat anything that doesn't feel or look right to her.  The only fruits she will eat is a whole apple (with half of the skin peeled off so that she can hold it from the side with the peel on, and eat from the peeled side!), and these freeze dried strawberries.  One package is just the right size...there is enough for her in the bag, but not so much that there are leftovers which get soggy.  I am so glad to have found another fruit for her to eat!  She will not touch real strawberries.<br /><br />My 4-year-old can't stay away from these strawberries and loves all of the other flavors we've tried, too.  She will down 3-4 bags a day if I let her.  And my husband, who is thrilled when he actually gets in one serving of fruit per day, will eat a bag if I put it in front of him or it ends up in his lunchbag.<br /><br />I love that I don't have to worry about strawberries getting moldy the day after I buy them, so I can stock up!<br /><br />EDIT:  Just found out these are from China.  Wouldn't buy them again...

review/summary: Great Fruit Snacks - Highly Recommended!
review/text: A friend recommended these Brothers Crisps and I am very pleased that we took her advice! Being a type 2 diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories, these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels. The real test with any "good for you" snacks is if my teens will eat them, and they also love them!<br /><br />These are made from real fruit (and nothing else) that has been sliced and freeze dried, making them crispy (exactly like "Astronaut Ice Cream") but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough. This process also makes them very flavorful.<br /><br />This variety pack has an assortment of 3 different types, Fuji Apple, Strawberry Banana, and Asian Pear.<br /><br />Fuji Apple:<br />About 1 1/2 Apples per pack<br />39 Calories<br />7 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)<br /><br />Strawberry Banana:<br />About 1 Banana and 4 Strawberries per pack<br />45 Calories<br />8 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)<br /><br />Asian Pear:<br />About 1 1/2 Pears per pack<br />40 Calories<br />8 NET Carbs (7 from sugar)<br /><br />I like the Asian Pears the best, but all of the flavors are really good. The Strawberries can be a little tart which is different and not displeasing to me.<br /><br />These are a good tasting healthy snack alternative that, if it wasn't for the fairly high cost, I would keep on hand all of the time!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Note: These are made in China<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Tastes Great but concerned about manufacturing processes
review/text: To be completely and 100% fair, I have tried this product before and enjoyed it.  The only part that concerns me is that this product is manufactured in China, with no information on the sources of the fruits. On their website they say they "source fresh fruit" and that " We are not concerned about issues surrounding where our product is produced because we take great care to ensure the quality and food safety of our products."  I'm not suggesting that this product is bad (which is why I gave it 5 stars) but I share more of a concern than evidently the company does, as to where they are getting this fruit, processing it and shipping it.  With the history China has had with kid's toys/formula/etc in the past, let's just say we don't feed these products to our child.  I would love it if the company would provide a tour and exact explanation of the process and sources, rather than discounting that information all together.

review/summary: A great Trio of Flavors ...
review/text: I really love the Brothers Crisps simply because they are preservative free, and I have preservative allergies! To be specific, these are sulfite-free, not to mention: gluten-free, vegan, nut/tree-nut safe, dairy free, Non GMO, and even Kosher.<br /><br />This particular variety contains three of my faves, so instead of ending up with 72 bags to get the entire assortment - I ordered the variety and got 24, a much more manageable number!<br /><br />Here's the rundown on what's in the package<br /><br />Strawberry/Banana - contains 1 banana and about 4 strawberries. These are an interesting combination of tart and sweet, and are my personal favorites. I've occasionally even used these on my oatmeal, although I enjoy them straight out of the pack. (45 Calories)<br /><br />Fuji Apple - most kid friendly. Strong and sweet apple taste, nice large pieces that look like apple slices. The package contains 1 1/2 apples and really would make a good substitute for potato chips in a lunch. In fact, most kids would consider it a treat. My sister's grand-kids raid her cupboard for these. (39 Calories)<br /><br />Asian Pear - about the same sweetness of the Fuji apple but without the apple (or strong pear) taste. Once again, this contains 1 1/2 pears, so it really gets you going on your fruit requirements. (40 Calories)<br /><br />The highest nutritional level is the Strawberry/Banana Combo since the strawberries are such a great source of vitamin C, but all of the packs are great choices.<br /><br />Because these are freeze-dried instead of dehydrated, there is no sticky residue to worry about. They are perfect for carrying in the car, sitting at a desk, hiking, backpacking, wherever you want an easy-to-grab healthy fruit snack.

review/summary: Tasty, no vitamins, made in China, deceptive packaging
review/text: While these are tasty snacks, there is virtually no nutritional value in them.  A quick check of the label shows insignificant amounts of and vitamins, even vitamin C, in any of the varieties.  By insignificant, I mean less than 10% RDA.  That is far below what one might find in the claimed 1-1/2 apples or pears per package.  I will add that under ingredients, the only thing listed is the freeze-dried fruit on the label; there appear to be no additives, not even sugar, of any kind.  While they are not strictly bad for you, this snack certainly qualifies as empty calories.  Frankly you get more vitamins from a bag of potato chips.<br /><br />In addition, these are made in China, this is stated on each envelope.  Draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />Finally, the package counts are deceptive.  The subtexts often says "24 count".  Then in Amazon inset says "2 pack".  This leads a reasonable person to believe they are getting 2 24 packs for a total of 48 individual snack envelopes.  In fact these are sold in packs of 12 (TWELVE) and you get two of them for a total of 24.  I find this deceptive, or at best, confusing.<br /><br />[Update, May 2012:  It appears that the description of the item has been changed to avoid the confusion as to how many you are actually getting.]<br /><br />To conclude, these are tasty, the texture is good, there seems to be no odd ingredients, refined sugar or artificial stuff and the serving size is reasonable.  However, the utter absence of any nutritional value tells me that the process used to "freeze-dry" these seems different from other freeze-dry methods in that it is particularly destructive to nutrients.  I find the fact that they are made in China troubling.  Finally, the deceptive package counts found here in the product descriptions lead me not to purchase this again.  [Note my previous acknowledgement of the improved product count description.]

review/summary: These strawberry crisps taste like they've gone bad
review/text: My daughter loves this product and often purchases it from a local specialty market.  But they are very pricey and this seemed a better way to purchase them.  But what we got was something that looked the same, but the product inside was much different.  The crisps in the store are nice slices that taste like strawberries.  These are mangled pink bits that taste like strawberries that went bad.  Maybe this is just a bad batch, but as you cannot return the items, I am not going too waste anymore money from this seller or on this item from him.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Ultra light weight and real live fruit, a great combination. The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.<br /><br />The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.<br /><br />The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.<br /><br />I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.<br /><br />The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.<br /><br />I like these a lot. They make a great snack.

review/text: my baby eats these snacks frequently. They dissolve in the mouth easily. I like them too.  If you have to worry about food allergies, these are great b/c it is in a nut/peanut free facility.<br /><br />The apples & pears are the best. The peaches are ok...not as sweet, kind of bitter.  They also make potato chips which aren't fried or baked! They aren't as good though as regular chips, but a much better alternative.<br /><br />I love these products & glad to see Amazon is finally carrying them

Thought there'd be 4 of each flavor...Only 2 pears and 2 strawberries - rest were apples.  Taste is very good but never would have bought if I'd known the origin. Not sure where packaging failed but broken tiny pieces aren't what my 1-year old grandson wants. USA doesn't have fruit???  Won't buy again.

They are a fun way to have fruit on the go when food spoilage could be an issue.  I definitely recommend them.  We do, however, choose fresh fruit when it is an option as it is a less expensive option.

My four year old ate three packages the first day we had them and my husband loved them so much he bought the Asian Pears, Bananas, and Peaches too.  Love them all but the strawberries are the best.  They are whole berries not sliced and they come in individual 1/2 cup serving bags so they don't absorb unwanted moisture like some tubs of berries do after opening.  They are not sweetened, so if it's sugar you are after you might be disappointed.  The real berry flavor is awesome.

review/text: The back of the bags state that they're 100% dried fruit, but they aren't like any dried fruit that I've had before.  Each chip feels like a rice cake or rice cracker, with a light, puffy texture.  This makes it really easy to eat a bag very quickly, which apparently contains 1.5 pears, 1.5 apples, or 1 banana and 4 strawberries, depending on which flavor you grab.  The strawberries are pretty similar to the ones that you find in Special K with Strawberries, but they're even lighter.<br /><br />I don't think they're terrible, but I can't say that I love them either.

My son is 1 1/2 years old and 1 packet isn't enough of a snack for him; I have to give him two. Secondly, the strawberry-banana ones are very messy, particularly the strawberries. The strawberries left red traces all over my sons hands, mouth, and clothes. So bad that his skin stayed "stained" until I bathed him (didn't come off with baby wipes). He likes the apples.

review/summary: Okay but small servings
review/text: I think fruit is generally a hassle to eat, but I love the taste. So I thought this product would be a good way to satisfy some of those sweet tooth cravings, in a semi-healthy way. They offer 3 sorts of flavors in this pack: asian pear, apples, and strawberry bananas.<br /><br />Asian pear: My favorite! Very authentic taste and not too sweet.<br /><br />Apples: Okay, slightly sweet and slightly tart. The texture wasn't that great though. Not that crisp and more like styrofoamy.<br /><br />Strawberry and banana: Banana crisps are great, sweet and crunchy and the strawberry is just tangy.<br /><br />The problem I had was not so much with the taste but the meager portion sizes in each bag. I'd say each contained literally only a handful of dried fruit and considering the packaging and cost, its not very environmentally or economically (for us anyways) friendly. I guess, for kids this would be a perfect but I need something with a little more substance.

review/summary: Best Snack for Toddlers
review/text: I can't say enough good things about this product.  We originally found individual bags of fruit crisps at our local supermarket, and were paying almost $2 a bag because my almost-two-year-old son loved them so much.  What a find on Amazon, a pack of 24 for so cheap!  We subscibed and saved.<br /><br />Less mess and more portablt than fresh fruit, better than a "fruit snack" or salty snack, and easy for little ones to chew.  Not enough strawberry and banana in the variety pack, we run out of them first, but my son loves all the flavors!!

review/text: I got these snacks when I was searching for the Veggie Straws.  They LOOKED tasty.  However, I didn't care for the consistency.  Since they are called "crisps" I assumed they would be crunchy...like chips.  But instead they dissolve in your mouth...kind of like party mints.  I cancelled my subscription and gave the packages that I had to someone else to try.  Lesson learned.

I have never had a problem with any orders from Amazon

review/summary: Stale
review/text: Based on the recommendation of my sister-in-law I ordered a couple of boxes of the Brothers-all-natural fruit crisps.  I also ordered the Kirkland brand as well.  I would have to say that I prefer the cheaper Kirkland brand over the more expensive Brothers brand.  I am not sure if the Brothers brand is supposed to taste stale or not but at least two of the packages that I have tried have tasted stale and not crisp as advertised.  The expiration date on the individual packages is 01-06-14 which leads me to believe that this brand either taste this way or I just got a bad batch.  Nonetheless, I will stick with the Kirkland brand and just chalk this one up as a loss.

review/text: I really enjoy the Fuji apple and Asian Pear and each pouch is the equivalent of 1.5 pieces of fruit. Some pieces do get crushed, but the majority are good size pieces.<br /><br />Personally, I do not like the strawberry/banana. The pieces are too small and there is an odd taste to them (The item lost its star for the strawberry/banana).<br /><br />You do pay a premium, as compared to most fresh fruit, but you don't have to worry about the fruit going bad.<br /><br />I recommend this pack to pick your favorite fruit and then order that one individually.

review/summary: Love these
review/text: These fruit snacks are an excellent way to get fruit into your diet.  I'm a diabetic and a one bag serving is about 8-10 grams of carbs and that is it.  Because the carb count is so low, I do not need insulin and the effect on my blood sugar is negligable.  I know a low of people are upset that these are made in China, but for my purposes, they could be made in Saskatchewan for all I care.  I need the health benefit that the fruit provdies without all the carbs and if this works, I'll take it.  I buy these from Costco for a slightly cheaper price than Amazon offers them for (but not much).

review/summary: Delicious, convenient and healthy snack!
review/text: I ordered these freeze-dried snacks after I found a similar product in the grocery store and loved them. Unfortunately, at nearly $2 a bag at the store, it quickly became a luxury expense. I decided to try these from Amazon because they were considerably less expensive than the in-store brand, and had great ratings. I was not disappointed! These are fantastic little snacks that are neat, convenient and healthy. So easy to throw into my lunch bag or stash in my car on long trips. I love the strawberry-banana and the apple flavors. You can really see and taste the quality of the fruits they use. These little 40-calorie bags will absolutely be replacing my afternoon potato chip habit, at a FRACTION of the calories.  If you're hesitant about trying these -- don't be! These are a new staple in my household.

For such few calories it is a nice snack, the apples and pears are really good. It is really difficult to find 100% natural dried fruit like this brand as most have added sugars or HFCS which seems crazy because these are plenty sweet on their own!

review/summary: Great snack when fresh fruit isn't an option
review/text: I can't stand the thought of feeding my daughter processed, sugary snacks that lack nutrients. I give her fresh fruit and vegetables as often as possible. These are perfect for stocking the diaper bag so she can have an impromptu snack. I try everything I give her because if I won't eat it, I won't make her eat it. I love these! The apple is probably my favorite. The banana does leave a strange after taste but that's to be expected.<br /><br />I saw a review that said they only received a 12 pack but I didn't have that problem. They\re packaged in a 12 pack but I was sent 2 of them. I received these very quickly too.<br /><br />Overall, a great product.

I had ordered these to send in soldier care packages, which I still intend to do, but I'm ordering several more boxes for personal use.  These will be great to add to my work lunch everyday, instead of those single-serving size potato chips.  You get 2 boxes of 12 packages with this product.

review/text: I usually don't care for freeze dried fruit, but these are in a class by themselves.  They are cored and PEALED, and melt in your mouth delicious.  The same company makes the same product in separately decorated bags.  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for Kids and Crisps for adults.  They are the exact same product, so if one is unavailable, you can purchase the other.  My favorite is Apple.  If you do purchase these, buy them through Amazon, as they sell them cheaper than the grocery store. These are really yummy and good for you too.  I am a grandmother, and this wonderful treat was introduced to me by my grand daughter.

When we ask her what she wants for a snack she says "Ap-ple"  It is great, she gets a full serving of fruit and there is nothing in them that is bad for her. I think that the prices here seem high, however when you take into account that each bag has one whole apple, you would pay that amount for fresh produce and end up throwing out some of it anyways.  My daughter easily finishes an entire bag and what she doesn't we can save for the next day.  WE LOVE these apples!

review/text: Purchased during a Friday Deal on a splurge with a Solofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, also on sale, to use with my Keurig.  The combination makes pretty good tasting coffee and doesn't have that bitterness or weakness so many of the Keurig brand K-cups have lately.  My only complaint is the short code date of August when it is now June, hence my 1-star deduction.  At any rate, I would be willing to try some of the other varieties in the future and will probably do so when my supply is running low.

review/text: Don't waste your hard earned cash on this, dare I say, coffee. It doesn't even taste like coffee. At $4 a bag I thought, I'll give it a try. I did and let me tell you, don't bother.
