review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: I purchased this food for my finicky chihuahua. I noticed that I was throwing away more of her Royal Canin Chihuahua food than she was eating, so I knew I needed to make a switch, and I wanted to try high-quality, grain-free foods.  At the recommendation of several friends, I decided to try Wellness Core and am so glad I did! The first day I mixed it with her previous food (Royal Canin Chihuahua) and she actually spit out the old food and only ate the Wellness Core!  She didn't have any stomach issues with it.  The next day she again gobbled down the Wellness Core.  My only complaint is that the pieces are a little big for her (a little smaller than a dime). She can still manage, but I wish there was a small dog version.  When I decided to make the switch to Wellness Core, I calculated how much it would cost in comparison to the Royal Canin Chihuahua I had been buying.  I was actually paying $14 for 2.5 lbs of Royal Canin at Petsmart, but got 12 lbs of Wellness Core, a higher-quality food for $29.99 with free shipping on Amazon- quite a savings!  I would recommend that anyone looking to go grain-free, or even just wanting a higher quality food try Wellness Core!

review/summary: Wellness Core
review/text: I have 2 dogs, ages 5 and 10, and we have tried numerous foods. My dogs had been on Blue Buffalo and my vet recently told me to switch because he had read some negative things about it. He wanted me to switch to Science Diet, Eukanuba or Iams and I knew I did not want to put my dogs on any of them. I started with Wellness Super Mix and then switched over the the Grain Free as I noticed my bassett hounds eyes were tearing up a lot and had a friend put her dogs on grain free food for the same reason. They tolerated both foods very well, however; I am going to try the Wellness for allergies as I still notice her eyes to be tearing up. Both of my dogs have a loooong history of bladder infections and have both been to the vet twice in the last 6 months to have their urine checked and have remained infection free. I feel that it's because of the switch to Wellness.

review/summary: Excellent quality food for your dog
review/text: My vet has long recommended I switch to a brand like Wellness, and despite the fact that it's a bit pricey, I decided my dogs' health is worth it. The ingredients are much better than Purina One, which they'd been eating for years, and I feel good that I'm giving them one of the best foods out there. It's a plus that I can get it shipped in two days using Amazon Prime.

review/summary: High quality food for dog with allergies
review/text: Our french bulldog has food allergies to the vegetarian dry dog food her brother and sister eat, but she does very well on this food. We're not sure what she's allergic to, but this grain-free meat-based food is excellent for her. She loves it (of course, she eats ANYTHING!), has shiny soft fur, nice stools, and is happy and full of energy. Strongly recommended for dogs with food allergies.

review/text: I love this product.  My dog does extremely well on it, and his itching has lessened since starting it.  He eats it without any need for additives - wet food, etc.  Even my cat tries to shove him out of the way for his food.<br /><br />The only con is cost.  It's several $$ more expensive on this website than it is in store.  Once the price falls a bit, I'll be more than happy to purchase it online.

review/summary: Don't get conned into buying this food!
review/text: I spent many hours on the internet studying and reviewing dog foods before I decided to start using this "premium" brand. They had this video of their state of the art facility where everything was hospital clean and everyone wore gloves and masks. Now I just found out via a salmonella recall notice that Wellness doesn't even make their own dog food! They outsource it to Diamond foods where several other brands are also produced in the same facility! It's the same food in a different fancy looking bag. I have just switched to a new company called "Life's Abundance". This food is produced and sold directly from the manufacturer to you with no middleman.

review/summary: Diamond Pet Foods RECALLED
review/text: Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

review/summary: Meh...
review/text: I was really looking forward to trying this product. I thought it was going to be something new and different, but in the end, it was very disappointing. This was a surprise since I really enjoy most of Kraft products.<br /><br />The pack includes: dry macaroni, a seasoning/thickener packet, dry bread crumbs and a soft Velveeta-like cheese product.<br /><br />You provide 1/2 cup 2% milk, 2 TBLS. unsalted butter, and 1/2 shredded cheddar for the optional "oven bake" method.<br /><br />The difference between Kraft Homestyle Macaroni and Kraft Deluxe is all the additional steps: make the white sauce, add the cheese packet, top with shredded cheddar, bread crumbs and bake it off for 10 minutes at 425. I followed the directions, but something was telling me it needed a lot of help (Dijon, a pinch of garlic and cayenne, a little more butter and maybe some Worcestershire)<br /><br />I should have followed my instincts, because the end result was bland and tasteless. Nothing like real home style macaroni and cheese. The best part of these types of dishes is always the crunchy crumb topping, but even that was flavorless and mediocre. The bread crumbs have a stale quality, but my product was far away from the expiration date.<br /><br />Basically, I could have taken the same amount of time made a better product with Kraft 2% sharp cheddar, my own white sauce, seasonings and bread crumbs.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but I really feel this product is pointless. The original Kraft Deluxe is such a good product on it's own, so creamy and delicious and comforting. This is just a strange mix of stove top and baked that doesn't really work.<br /><br />p.s. *Update*<br />Along with 4-cheese, I also got the "Classic Cheddar" flavor and finally made it a few days ago. I decided not to bake this one. Instead, I pan toasted the crumbs adding a little butter and 3 tsp of Parmesan/Romano mix. I made the cheese sauce as directed, but added a tiny drop of Dijon, black pepper and a dash of onion and garlic powders, then mixed it with the cooked macaroni and a sprinkle of sea salt (you may not need it, but I felt it was very bland). I topped one serving with 1/4 of  breadcrumbs and got a better finished product...more flavorful and creamy, but still not all that great of a product.

review/summary: Nothing New
review/text: I decided to give this product a try, thinking that it was an improvement over Kraft's Deluxe product.  It was not.  As other reveiwer said, the only difference is the extra steps, and the package of white powder (seasoning) did nothing to change the outcome.<br /><br />As I began to follow the directions in making this, I was relaxed by the typical technique of cooking the pasta by boiling the water and cooking them for the up to 8 minutes.  The similarity between this package and the regular Deluxe ends after you drain the water and set the pasta aside.  From there, I felt like a fool as I made a roux of the butter, white powder and milk.  I began to wonder why the cheese sauce needed a thickening agent and seasoning, and why it was not already a part of the cheese sauce.<br /><br />In the end, I ended up with something similar to the regular Deluxe dish that was a little less cheesier.  I had to add salt and pepper to it as I imagined Karft using long-term hospital patients used to bland food to perform its taste tests for this product.  The extra ingredients could have easily been combined into the cheese sauce package.  Preparing the regular Deluxe package would have saved time and resulted in a better dish, would have cost less, and would not have had me waste butter and milk.  The package also suggests adding real cheese and popping it into the oven.  Mind you, if you did that, why not make it homemade yourself?

review/summary: Save your money and time!
review/text: This is Kraft equivalent to the Ford "Edsel"! Whoever was involved in the decision to market this stuff, did nothing to preserve their job security. If I wanted to go through all the bother of making a white sauce, I'd be making my mac & cheese entirely from scratch. Total waste of time and extra money, with no benefit to taste. The end product was very bland with an unappealing texture. We didn't really like it at all. They use a thicker type of macaroni and even after cooking a few additional minutes it was still kind of tough and gummy. I'll stick with the Kraft Deluxe... taste better... easier to prepare... and cheaper.

review/text: Well, I can't say much, I'm a college student and this is about as homemade as it's going to get for me. Although I feel like I have a bit more credential considering I can cook rice and steaks and stuff but still. I LOVE the texture of this macaroni, for those who prefer it softer wait more, but for me, an al-dente soulmate I find this to be the very best and the 7 minutes was perfect timing and perfect texture for me. Overall I think this is the best Kraft Mac&Cheese I have ever experienced. (I bought the deluxe before, thought it sucked)

review/summary: It's just another v_lveeta substance
review/text: Home style, just like grandma used to make, right?<br /><br />No.  The central substance of this product is a bag full of that gel-like cheese goo, just like the V brand.  Adding 2 tablespoons of butter and a little milk (as per the directions) does not change the end product much.  It also includes a tiny bag of white powder.  I am not sure what that is, but it doesn't help any either.<br /><br />The normal box of dry Mac and Cheese is better than this stuff.  If you want to improve upon the classic Mac and Cheese box, just make it as per the directions and then stir in 3/4 cup of shredded real cheese and about 1/4 cup of extra milk.  Then let it sit on the stove at low heat for about 5 or 10 minutes, and you've got that oven-baked cheesiness.

review/summary: My kids love it, although it is not as good as homemade
review/text: If you are looking for homemade tasting mac and cheese, without actually making it from scratch, this is probably the closest you'll get. I was surprised at some of the other reviews--not sure what people were expecting. This is not going to compare with Grandmas Homemade mac and cheese, but this is definitely tastier than the kind in the blue box. The seasoning packet and the cheese packet do add a little flavor and creaminess, and if you add the breadcrumbs on top it gives it more of a homemade feel. I tried baking it in the oven once, but all it really did was dry it out a little and took extra time. The kids don't care! They really like this kind second only to moms homemade. If we are in a rush for dinner, this is the perfect thing.

review/summary: Excellent 80,s Metal. But You'll Have To Buy Their 2nd Cd Also
review/text: First I'd like to let everyone know that this cd is a mispressing. Everything on the cover, to the booklet to the actual disc is labled Burning Star. But when played it plays Remnants Of War. So If you want the first Burning Star cd , you will have to buy Remnants Of War.If You're Looking for Remnants Of War,Then you already have it with this disc. Very sad that Century Media has mispressed the whole run of both of these discs'and presumably has no quality control. If these cd's were listened to before they were packaged and sent off to the distributor this error never would have occured.For shame.Enough of the negative.<br />Now On to the music. When I first picked up the original album on Combat, back in the day, I was blown away at how tight and technical this Texas Metal band was. They have a few elements in their sound reminicent of Iron Maiden/Yngwie Malmsteen/Black Sabbath. With a wild screaming singer having a unique tone all his own.<br />It's difficult to pick a favorite song but. One that has always stood out for me is Run With The Pack. I discovered the band while playing my Hell Comes To Your House album with Run With The Pack being one of the many great cuts on this lp. So I had to buy the rest of the album after hearing that one tune.<br />Every cut on this cd is great in it's own right. You won't be disappointed with the purchase of this cd. Plus you'll be forced to get the next one as well. As far as the remastering goes it's top notch. Such clarity was never heard on my old vinyl platter. The demos are a bit rough to listen to at first. But once you get into the original album, you'll want to see how some of these songs came to fruition. Enjoy Loud

review/text: Delicious.  What more can one say?  The preparation directions are confusing since they are written in German.  But a call to a German friend cleared it up.  She said the  prep ingredients call for 3 TBS of water and 3 TBS of oil blended with the powder and then poured over the veggies - in my case cucumbers.  No vinegar needed although I add a tsp because I love vinegar.  One package easily prepares one large cucumber sliced paper thin.  To me, it contains vinegar powder, salt, powdered sugar and dill weed.

review/text: We started using this dressing when my SIL, who has relatives in Germany, would use it on her salads.  It was so good that we'd beg packets from her.  I was excited to find them on Amazon for such a good price.  Definitely recommend it if you like a nice, light flavored dressing that you can make yourself.

review/text: these are some of the best cookies i have ever tasted -- it's so hard to believe they are gluten-free. we have several family members who can't eat wheat (either allergic, intolerant, or with long-term celiac disease) and all agree that these cookies get TOP MARKS. they are chewy, very ginger-y, and the molasses is perfectly gooey. for us they are like a beacon, hailing a new era for gluten free foods!

review/summary: These are GREAT cookies
review/text: I was at a friend's recently who had some of these cookies and she asked me to try them and see if I could tell they were gluten free.  I couldn't.  Considering ginger / molasses is not even near the top of my list of favorite cookies, I was pretty surprised I liked them so much.  I found the taste to be very balanced and the texture of the cookies excellent.  For a fan of ginger molasses cookies I don't think you could go wrong with these.

review/text: Apple Jacks, one of Kellogg's troika of cereals that Moms hate but kids love! (The other two of the troika are Corn Pops and Froot Loops.)<br /><br />To me, Apple Jacks have the least intense flavor of the troika, I find the flavor of the apple and cinnamon mild compared to the corn and fruit flavor of the other two banned cereals. Moms hate them because of the sugar, but this cup serving only gives you 20g of sugar compared to 39g in a 12oz Coke, so at least it's not as bad as a can of Coke and fruit juices all have sugar so you can't really get away from it. And it does contain quite a bit of vitamins and minerals (see nutrition panel) so it's a lot better than a can of Coke in the morning!<br /><br />This individual pack is very handy. You can carry it anywhere with you and all you need is a small carton of milk to make it a meal or a snack. And this individual pack prevents you from overeating it (unless you decide to eat 2-3 of them at once.) This container is much better than the old small carton container which you had to find another bowl to pour into or dump into a carton of milk to eat.<br /><br />So:<br />Pros: Handy size. Convenient on the go. No bowl needed.<br />Cons: Moms don't like them.

review/summary: Great cereal but a few health issues...
review/text: Kellogg's Apple Jacks provide a delicious, sweet cereal to start anyone's day! Amazon correctly notes that this cereal is made from wheat and corn. It seems like Apple Jacks have been around forever; and it's not hard to see why. With their tasty, sweet flavor you can get your kids to chow down on something half-way nutritious before they go to school; and you can even treat yourself to a bowl of these in milk now and then. They can even be eaten dry as a snack.<br /><br />Apple Jacks does indeed contain no cholesterol and the fat content is almost zero--hooray! There aren't even trans-fats in this cereal. What a relief! Apple Jacks are kosher as well if that matters to you. They contain 25% of the recommended daily allowance of Iron, Niacin, B12, B6 and more.<br /><br />A major advantage to eating Apple Jacks within the individual cups is that you can keep the sealed cups in a child's lunch box, a backpack, your briefcase, pocketbook or anything similar you may be carrying. That way the sealed cup automatically serves a dual purpose--it prevents the cereal from spilling onto anything else someone may be carrying while keeping the cereal in a measured portion that goes easy on diets. The compact cup is also very easy and lightweight to carry. Once the cup is opened by tearing off the cover anyone can just add milk or eat them dry as a sugar boost snack.<br /><br />Unfortunately, every cereal has its drawbacks; and Apple Jacks cereal is no exception. Apple Jacks contains sugar which can turn into fat inside your body if you don't get enough exercise. Moreover, Apple Jacks contains carbohydrates. If any of this is a concern for you, ask your doctor if you should be eating this cereal.<br /><br />I would also recommend that you eat Apple Jacks cereal before the expiration date stamped on the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale cereal, now would you? SMILE<br /><br />Overall, Apple Jacks is a great way to get kids to eat something for breakfast before school without completely sacrificing nutrition. You can eat them as a snack or eat them as a sugar boost snack during the day if you are on the go and can't stop for something more substantial.<br /><br />I recommend this cereal for kids--and us grown-ups, too, who are able to eat Apple Jacks without going against any dietary restrictions your doctor may have given you.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: All the Apple Jacks you can eat!
review/text: I remember growing up in Brooklyn in the late 70's, happy and carefree--a perfect childhood in every way but one: my parents would not let me or my brother eat Kellogg's Apple Jacks.<br /><br />Saturday mornings were the happiest times for me any my brother. We woke early, rushed down to the living room to watch cartoons, and munched on our favorite cereals--but never Apple Jacks. Every time that commercial came on with its snappy, rhythmic jingle, my brother and I would sing along:<br /><br />"A is for apple,<br /><br />J is for jacks--<br /><br />cinnamon, toasty Apple Jacks.<br /><br />You need a good breakfast,<br /><br />that's a fact.<br /><br />Start it out with Apple Jacks!<br /><br />Apple Jacks! Apple Jacks!<br /><br />10 vitamins and minerals,<br /><br />that's what it packs!<br /><br />Apple-y, tasty, crunchy, too<br /><br />Kellogg's Apple Jacks!!"<br /><br />And always on those final words, "Kellogg's Apple Jacks!!" my brother and I would punch each other in the face and fall down on the floor, laughing our heads off.<br /><br />We begged our parents for Apple Jacks, but they never got them for us. We ate a bowl once, at a friend's house, and got so pumped up and full of apple-y goodness that we not only punched each other in the face, but we also punched our friend's mother in the face as well. She told our mother, and from then on, we were never again allowed to eat Apple Jacks.<br /><br />It's been a long time since then and I'd forgotten all about Apple Jacks until I saw an Apple Jacks commercial one day while my kids were watching cartoons. Suddenly the memory of my childhood hit me like a ton of bricks and I immediately put my mother in an old-folks home and then went out and bought some Apple Jacks. As soon as I paid for them I ripped open the box and began munching down great big handfuls of Apple Jacks in the supermarket. Some pimply-faced bagger mumbled something about not being allowed to eat in the store, but I punched him in the face and laughed. I was filled with apple-y goodness!<br /><br />Imagine my overflowing joy, then, when I found I could get an entire case of Apple Jacks, packaged into convenient, ready-to-eat individual cups, shipped right to my door! Now Apple Jacks are the only thing I eat, and even my pee smells like Apple Jacks! I called my brother, and he also got a case. We also put our father in a nursing home, but not the same one as our mother's.

review/summary: A really good genmaicha (roasted brown rice tea)
review/text: Genmaicha is green tea mixed with roasted brown rice (popped like popcorn). I had a sample of this at Mitsuwa, a large Japanese supermarket in NJ and loved it. It is flavorful and refreshing with a nice green color (from the added matcha powder).<br /><br />This makes a wonderfully healthy and exotic gift for friends and co-workers. It's an affordable tea that looks much more expensive than it really is. The box is attractive and the tea is delicious. The tea is grown in Shizuoka Prefecture, one of Japan's main tea-producing regions. Shizuoka is where Mt Fuji is, so the photo on the box is not just a marketing ploy. It's really where the tea is from.<br /><br />One side of the box is in Japanese and the other side is in English. Directions for brewing are on the side. Pour very hot (but not boiling) water on the tea bag and wait 2-3 minutes before serving. Genmaicha can be enjoyed hot or cold, depending on the seasons, or your preferences. You can make a few liters of it and refrigerate like I sometimes do. In Asia, green tea is almost always served unsweetened so don't put any honey or sugar in here. Sweetened genmaicha would taste funny anyway.<br /><br />The price offered by the seller is a reasonable premium for this tea if you cannot find it locally. Around me, where there is a sizable Chinese community, one box of this can be had for under $2.

review/summary: Fine so far...
review/text: I was looking for chews to keep my dog busy while he recovers from a minor paw injury (no walks or running for two weeks).  I saw the busy bone and thought I'd give it a try, mostly because it was on sale.  When I got home, I read some reviews about it and felt concerned, as some felt the bones were dangerous.  However, I am one to regularly give my dog rawhide, and have never had a problem with it before.  Following the same caution I do with his other bones (mainly, supervision), I went ahead and gave the busy bone a go.  I was actually more impressed than I thought I'd be.  Other reviewers laid claim that their dog was easily able to get large chunks off the bone and that it only lasted a few minutes, and this was not so for my dog; he gnawed away contently, only getting very small pieces off smaller than the size of a dime.  He chewed heavily for about 40 minutes before panting and needing to take a water break and then nap: half the bone is still there waiting to be chewed.  I was glad he was able to get a good workout during his recovery.<br /><br />I will say that the bone was more messy than I liked.  There are small crumbs scattered about where he was chewing it, and even got some small pieces stuck to his chin.  Yet, this would not stop me from purchasing the bone a second time.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'd probably not recommend the bone for very strong chewers.  My dog, a greyhound, I'd consider a moderate chewer who can do damage if he really wants to, but doesn't have a natural urge to demolish toys like other breeds (Labradors come to mind...and I mean this affectionately, as I have lived with several!).  Additionally, I don't know that I'd get any size other than the "ultimate" that was 15oz.  I could see where a smaller diameter of bone might be easier to snap, so regardless of your dog's size, I'd probably go with the biggest and thickest for safety.  And, of course, be at the ready to rescue your dog should they show signs of choking...not a toy for alone time.

We recently tried another Rogan Josh sauce in a jar, and it didn't compare.

Smelly Ellie no more. She had been on the Buffalo, but she is allergic to chicken and it contains chicken. She loved several of the Merrick canned foods though. They actually smell pretty dang good when you open up the can. I would recommend the canned indefinitely.

I asked my son to pick me up a bag of 'Gran Filtro' at a shop near his apartment, and he returned with the Dark Roast beans (Brown Stripe). I instantly loved the dark roast and when I found the coffee at Amazon, I ordered it as ground coffee. It just doesn't taste the same to me. Maybe it's the way I grind it, maybe it's just fresher when the beans are ground just before brewing. Whatever the reason, and I'm working on it, I prefer the beans to the ground coffee. It's not like it's bad coffee, it's just not as good as I'd hoped.

review/summary: Best Coffee Ever
review/text: After discovering this coffee I do not think I would brew anything else at home ever again.  Lavazza is excellent, and I should try more of their varieties.  So far out of the gold and gran filtro dark, this one is the best.<br />This coffee has a very subtle and smooth flavor, hints of chocolate and it is slightly sweet.  It is easy to drink without milk and should not be mixed with sugar.  Use a coffee press to make it and you can taste how delicate it is.  And, although its imported from Italy, buying it online is cheaper than buying most coffees in the store.<br />There's no reason not to buy this online if you like coffee, except if you have a problem with pre-ground coffee.  But, keep it in an airtight bag and it doesn't spoil too fast.

review/summary: Disappointment
review/text: I was so excited by the possibilities of ordering Lavazza via Amazon. Unfortunately the coffee doesn't measure up to what I'm used to in a Lavazza shop. Granted, this was typically espresso based drinks but this coffee is not accpetable to me even as every day coffee. I'm back to my local fresh roasted beans...most of my six bags will go into storage as emergency coffee for when I run out unexpectedly.

review/summary: The Best White Tea
review/text: I am no connoisseur of white tea but I use FOOJOY SHOUMEI as the standard to compare the rest. This tea has a naturalsweet undertone that makes it  a pleasure to partake. I like to just steep it to a golden yellow and savor it. Othe white teas I have tried have a slightly bitter taste,I have tried the much more expensive and similar priced ones and this beats them all hands down. White tea kills more bacteria on contact in lab studies (google it) than green so its part of my fight the flu season regime as well. Did I say the price was unbeatable?

review/text: If you're a flavored coffee lover then treat yourself to this delicious coffee . Use standard amount (3 coffee scoops ) so as not<br />to spoil the blending of each flavor ( chocolate , caramel , and nut).<br />Though this makes a terrific cup of hot coffee I find personally<br />that the flavors are even more distinct when iced . Other coffees<br />no longer even compare to Coffee Masters coffees . I've tried the<br />Creme Brulee , Almond Ameretto , Caramel kiss , and Winter Frost (winter frost may be harder to find and costs a little more but it's<br />worth it ) . As well as purchasing the decaf French Vanilla for my husband . Each one is yummy but the Turtle Sundae is my personal fav.<br />If you're in the market for a great tasting and reasonably priced coffee , give Coffee Master a try . You won't be disappointed .

review/summary: Smooth & Creamy
review/text: I had been drinking Cameron's coffee sold on Amazon and, well.....it was watery and bland.  Oh, it smelled great but that's about as far as it went.  So, I tried this brand instead.  It is rich, creamy and soooooooooooo much better than Cameron's.  Let me reiterate that again:  It is SO (I'd put "SO" in bold if I could) much better than Cameron's!!  The only reason I gave this particular flavor four stars is that it is quite good but I want to try their Caramel Kiss the next time as that is my favorite.  Being a chocoholic, though, I just had to try the Turtle Sundae.  I'm convinced that whatever your favorite flavor of coffee may be, this company will deliver the flavor, richness, creaminess, and robustness of the coffee that you desire.  In my humble opinion, any coffee from this company is WELL-WORTH THE MONEY.<br /><br />UPDATE: August 16, 2012<br />I've now tried their Caramel Kiss and am absolutely hooked!  Again, that rich creamy and smooth flavor that is well-beyond any coffee maker I have ever tried.  So, let me reiterate what I said in my original review:  It just doesn't matter which flavor you buy, you WON'T be disappointed and might find, like myself, that it's now your favorite coffee.

He finally was ok with venison and potato by Royal Canin but still had bouts of diahera and stomach pain.  We were very happy when we found Natural Balance venison and sweet potato.  Our lab no longer has any digestion issues and is doing great!  We also like the fact that they make a biscuit so he can also have a treat.  Amazon is great to order from.

review/summary: No Grain, No Brainer!
review/text: First of all let's address the subject of why dogs are increasingly sensitive to grain, beets and corn. Grain, beets and corn are used as fillers in many animal feeds. But the fundamental problem is that these three things are all genetically modified, with chemical insecticide spliced into the dna of the seed. You can look this up on Google, please do. Toxic grain. Animals and children are the first to show illness when the food or the environment is toxic.<br /><br />Now about my experience with this dog food- I have two dogs, both rescues. The Poodle had allergies to everything. The Italian greyhound/chihuahua was so starved you could see every rib and knuckle (severe neglect). This food is like 'good medicine' to these little friends of ours. I never have to coax them to eat. I feed them the "grain free" dry kibble, as well. They eat it slowly like they are enjoying every bite. Their weight stays level and they look shiny and beautiful. (I use the feed guide on the can and bag).<br />The Greyhound was blowing her coat for the first month of rescue but this food and fresh daily water and walks has made her stop shedding. It just stopped! No more hair all over us!!<br /><br />**If you are starting a sick, weak, or rescued "puppy mill" dog on this food; you must give it four to six weeks to see the full benefits. Like building blocks. The metabolism will renew and the blood will get stronger and you will see muscle tone and bright eyes. Then their minds sharpen and you see a personality, which is a real treat! I love dogs! There is something magical about them, don't you think?<br /><br />The cans are 13 ounces, with a 'ring and pull top' opening. (It smells like something you could eat on a cracker. When the poodle smells it he howls like wolf, only in a higher octave!!) There are twelve cans. They arrive in a cardboard flat, surrounded by heavy shrink wrap. Human food/grade, grain free, dog food.<br />5 stars it's all good. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009XPD64">Natural Balance Dry Dog Food, Grain Free Limited Ingredient Diet Fish and Sweet Potato Recipe, 28 Pound Bag</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3SJ8W">Natural Balance Canned Dog Food, Grain Free Limited Ingredient Diet Venison and Sweet Potato Recipe, 12 x 13 Ounce Pack</a><br /><br />Best wishes.

review/summary: Life Saver
review/text: We have an 11 year old Golden who suffered for two years with re-occuring ear infections. Nothing the vet prescribed touched it. When she started biting and licking all the fur from her paws and legs, I traveled 30 miles to see the vet that took care of my family's dog when I was a kid. He pulled her off of all commercial dog food and treats, recommending I find a Limited Ingredient Diet product for her. We brought a bag of the kibble and a can of this to show him, and he told us "this has a lot of good stuff in it" so we tried it. Seriously, within two weeks the ears had NO black discharge and the smell was gone. Her paws went from hot and red to cool and pink. This dog got to the point where she disliked being touched because her skin was so stressed, but after introducing her to this food.. she plays, and talks, and loves being a Golden again. Oh, and she snarfs the food. Kibble, can, mix together.. she makes it disappear. We highly recommend Natural Balance Duck and Potato, and Venison and Sweet Potato found in both dry and canned.

review/summary: Vet Recommended Food
review/text: Our Vet is very much into quality nutrition for our pets and recommended this dog food.  Right away you can see the difference from a good quality food as opposed to the bargin brand.  The food is so clean and doesn't stick to the can like the cheaper ones that are filled with grease and fat and all kinds of other horrors you need to know about.  Do you know that our dogs and cats have been eating diseased animals, in addition to eating the remains of their own species who have been euthanized.  Did you know that the makers of dry dog and cat food spray used grease on the food to make it more palatable?  Well, they do.  These things and more are what we've been unknowingly feeding our pets...food so dangerous that the incidents of cancer amoung our cats and dogs is running rampent.  Quality food may cost more, but I'd rather pay a little extra than have one more of my pets die from cancer.  Do yourselves and your beloved pets a favor, feed them a good quality food.  Others besides Natural Balance include Royal Canin and Blue Buffalo, plus more.  The higher priced foods in your grocery stores (Iams, Science Diet) are on the list of BAD foods.  Do a little research, you'll be shocked by what you discover. I highly recommend this food.

review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Regular pasta with 1/2 the carbs
review/text: We have tried soy pasta and wheat pasta as "healthy" alternatives to conventional pasta. Soy is horrible, horrible, horrible. Wheat is funky. This pasta is a wonderful alternative. It tastes like regular pasta but gives 19 grams of starches/sugars per serving as opposed to 41 grams with conventional pasta. Even without being on any special diet, we figure, "Why put all tha extra starch/sugar into our bodies, not to mention the bodies of our children and grandchildren?" Anywhere we can cut down on starch/sugar intake is, in my opinion, good.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good!
review/text: I have tried at least 25 types of low or lower carb pastas.  Some have been so bad that my family and I take one bite and throw the rest out.  This pasta is GOOD! And, I weigh myself every day, since I am on a very low carb diet and have lost 30 pounds.  I did not gain weight with this, eating one  1 & 1/2 cup portion, and I often do if I sneak in some regular pasta or bread.

review/summary: Great, but not low-calorie
review/text: I discovered Dreamfields when Trader Joe's discontinued their not-quite-as-good low-carb product about two years ago.  I like Dreamfields, and it's the closest "low carb" pasta to plain "high carb" pasta that I've ever encountered.  The picky eaters in my life have never turned up their noses at this.<br /><br />It's a bit pricier than the alternatives, but Amazon's current price is 12 cents less per (now 17% smaller!) box compared to my local grocery store, so I've just placed my first order here.<br /><br />Two things that might interest a person that hasn't ever tried it:<br /><br />* This is not a "low calorie" pasta.  The calorie count is almost identical to regular pasta.  If you're trying to lose weight, then you need to control your portion size, not just your carbohydrate intake.  However, I find that controlling the portion size is somehow easier with this pasta.<br /><br />* It seems to want a bit more water for boiling than regular pasta.  If you've perfected the art of boiling your pasta in the smallest possible pan, then this probably isn't going to work as well.  It seems to froth up and make a mess if I don't give it a more reasonable amount of water.

review/summary: As good as any pasta I've ever used
review/text: We love the Dreamfields pastas.  They taste as good as any of the other higher carb pastas, and they cook up just as well, too.  We've switched the whole family to these pastas, and they love them, too.  Even my husband, who is really sensitive to changes in tastes, agrees that they are great.  These also have the same texture as other, higher carb, pastas.  I use them in cold salads where taste and texture are important factors, and, so far, even our guests haven't been able to tell the difference between the Dreamfields pastas and any of the others I've used before.  My thanks go out to Dreamfields for providing us with a tasty alternative to high carb pastas the whole family likes!

review/summary: Pretty damn good!
review/text: I got a 6-pack of these in the mail yesterday and threw it on some of my air popped popcorn. It reminded me of s'mores. it also tasted good on some tcby :) but i do not recommend trying to sweeten up your eggs in the morning with it (cinnamon and truvia work wonders but not this!) it's better than i expected but not as natural of a flavor for 5 stars.

review/summary: Chocolate Marshmallow Awesomeness!
review/text: This is by far my favorite flavor of these popcorn seasonings and the hardest to find. I first stumbled upon it at a movie theater and have been in love with it ever since. Sure the salty and cheesy flavors are great, but for that ultimate sweet tooth, this is a must to try! It also works great for seasoning other things like oatmeal or cottage cheese or your hot drink, be brave. :-)<br /><br />It just increases the flavor if you dump it on movie theater popcorn though, if you are making popcorn at home I recommend spraying your popcorn with spray butter or Pam so there's something for the seasoning to stick to.

review/summary: Best Candy Ever.
review/text: Sour Patch kids are by far my favorite candy of all time! When I was a young Heidi Kakes my mother would buy me a 1 pound bag nearly everyday and less than 2 hours they'd be gone! Yes it was wrong and I'm suffering for it now with a toothache every now and again but you just can't deny how addictive these things are! So I recommend them to everyone but if you're parents interested in these for your children, get them a small bag every once and awhile, just don't go crazy like my mom did because these things are pure sugar!

review/summary: Broken
review/text: I have never received an item from Amazon and was disappointed. The item was poorly packed or they sent them broken up and to small to spread cheese or anything. I have most of it and thinking about throwing them out. Not happy at all. I was excited about getting the biscuit , but not happy at all.
