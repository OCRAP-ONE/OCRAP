review/summary: Kitties love them, and fewer messes to clean-up!
review/text: I didn't have very high expectations for these treats when I first bought them - we were just out of their other treats and I thought I'd give these a shot. Not only do our cats love them, but we've seen a huge difference in the amount of hairballs from our two furballs. We used to have hairball messes to deal with many times a week, and now it's down to just a few a month. I've now put these on our Subscribe & Save list to make sure we never run out. I love that I am giving them something they love that also happens to be so good for their insides. And as a huge bonus, we have a lot fewer messes to clean up/step in. We all win!

She has tried some of the other flavors of Whiskas Temptations as well and loves those as well.  She always gobbles these down real quick.  I am thinking about trying her on the tuna flavor next since she loves tuna so much.

review/summary: Kitty Crack
review/text: All three of my cats are crazy about these.  They like the salmon and tuna flavors best. They all beg for them in one way or another.  One cat will sit and stare at me and if that doesn't work, he'll curl up on my shoulder and purr as loud as he can. Another one of my cats just bops me with his paw to let me know he wants treats.  The more I ignore him, the harder he hits me.  I eventually have to tell him no, because I don't want to overdo it with the treats. Anyway, they all love them and I've noticed silkier coats since adding these to their diet.

I'm sure that giving them different flavors means more to me, than it does to my cats; they don't seem to chew them long enough to taste them.  But they insist on two or three each time they come in the house, I'm sure it's a form of addiction.  I'm buying these on the "Subscribe & Save" program, which save money and time compared to buying them locally.<br /><br />Cats love these things!

review/text: We have two cats (neutered males) and we feed them twice a day. Both have maintained proper weight, so they're getting what they need. Well, you'd never know it! They seem to always be hungry, day or night. What goes? I don't want to feed them again and get them to looking like Garfield. So, I got these Whiskas Temptations cat treats and I give them a few every now and them. Boy, do they go fast. The treats barely hit the dish and they're gone! Well, I notice they're only 2 calories per treat so they can't be doing much harm.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: These are the only brand of treats my cat will eat. She loves them! Prior to finding them on Amazon I would get them at local stores but it is so much cheaper to buy them through Amazon.<br />I always give my cat 4 or 5 treats every night before bed and sometimes during the day, so I can go through a bag of these pretty quick. For around $20 for 12-3oz packs is such a good deal, and the treats keep very well if you don't open them.

review/summary: Whiskas Temptations Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treats for Cat
review/text: With four cats in the household hairballs are a given. It got to be an almost daily routine to hear and see one or more of them gagging and coughing, trying to get rid of a build up of hair in their system. Why their digestive tracts haven't evolved to handle this problem over thousands of years mystifies me. Not only do they groom themselves, they also groom each other.<br /><br />We've tried several different products to try to alleviate this problem and nothing helped. Then we came across the Temptations treats. They have helped considerably. The cats seem to relish them, not knowing they're being given "medicine". Whilst the treats haven't completely ended the hairball issue they have been a great help. Now, it can be weeks if not months without any hairballs.<br /><br />If your cats have a problem with hairballs then give this product a try.<br /><br />Also, with Amazon's Subscribe and Save you'll save money.

review/text: We have two cats and one has very long hair and of course after cleaning themselves they get hairballs. We tried several hairball control treats and these are the one our cats seem to prefer. I purchase one case every six months,giving the long hair cat 10 each day and the short hair cat 5 each day, and they do help to control the frequency of the barfing. They always arrive quickly and we will continue to purchase them from amazon. The long hair cat likes them sooo much he greets me each morning and bugs me until he get his whiskas.

review/summary: a great black tea, very smooth for a "breakfast" tea
review/text: Of the Rishi black teas, this is probably my favorite so far. Rishi describes it as "malty and robust with accents of cocoa and dates" and that's about what it tastes like. I usually drink Twinings Earl Grey, but this has quickly become my staple when I'm not in the mood for Earl. That said, it's not your typical tea flavor, so some may appreciate its heavy flavor and some may not. In other words, it's not a light and fruity tea if that's what you're looking for, it has a very bold flavor.

review/text: I bought a cannister last month at Fresh Market, tried it, and was blown away. What a bold and wonderfully-flavored black tea. It's become my afternoon treat: one or two cups, with or without cream, always some sweetening. So good. Starbucks has seen way less of me. :)<br /><br />I ordered this 4-pack cause I am going through it rather fast. These are leaves (not bags), so have a strainer/infuser handy.<br /><br />A new staple for me. It's so rich tasting, I can cut back on sweeter treats with NO problem. This baby satisfies. If you want to, you can replace your morning java with this (strong and rich enough). I still have my coffee in the am, but this is what I drink in the PM now, rather than coffee.<br /><br />Organic. Delicious. Perfect!

review/text: As I am writing this I can see these seeds growing. Just kidding but it has been 4 days and each and every seed has sprouted and is over an inch tall. I cannot believe how fast these are growing. I am looking forward to juicing these seeds. I have 2 15x9 plastic containers sitting next to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016NUZP0">AeroGrow AeroGarden Pro 200 with Master Gardener 1-Season Kit and Gourmet Herb Seed Kit</a>. The light from this bleeds over onto the wheatgrass seeds. I dont know if its the lights, the soil or the seeds but these are amazingly fast growing seeds.<br /><br />I didnt even bother planting the seeds. I just sprinkled them on the surface (like in nature), of damp soil and covered it with a cellophane covering. They have all dug in and have jumped up.<br /><br />I will update this review after we try the first juice from these.<br /><br />Overall a fantastic product, performs better than advertised!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

review/text: I have the EZ Green Sprouter.  When I bought mine, I bought the seeds from the same company too.  The cost was a bit pricey so I checked Amazon's.  I went ahead and placed an order for one 5lb.  Granted, I'm not new to growing Wheatgrass, I followed the SAME simple steps but with these new seeds.  I am AMAZED!  Not only do these seeds produce green blades of lush grass, but there is NO mold!  Whereas in the seeds from the EZ Green Sprouter, their seeds grow skinny, light green and moldy wheatgrass.  I love my EZ Green Sprouter, but their seeds cannot even compare to this merchant's!  Normally once my wheatgrass starts to mold, I would have to start cutting them, separate the mold and then extract the juice.  With these seeds?  The grass is still growing even higher than my EZ Green Sprouter and with NO MOLD!  I am so thrilled to have found a product that is a great value and delivers excellent quality.  I am yours for life~!  Thank you!

review/summary: Seeds are good - packaging was bad
review/text: I ordered these seeds to grow for my animals.  The packaged arrived in terrible shape with seeds spilling out everywhere.  I am not sure how much volume was lost on the trip (I did not weigh it).<br /><br />I did germinate the seeds as directed - which was very easy.  The germination rate was good and the grass was very nice.<br /><br />My cats (and my dog) love it and I also gave some to the neighbor who also loved it.<br /><br />The product itself is good - they just need to have better packaging.  A thin plastic bag in a mail envelope is not the way to go.

review/text: The quality of these seeds is excellent. They begin to germinate for me in 24 hours and in 3 to 5 days they are ready to use. I've never sprouted seeds with results as good as this. I can easily recommend these to the sprouter, whether for human consumption or your four legged friends.

review/summary: Buy through Amazon - there web site. Seeds not so good
review/text: I bought these seeds through wheatgrasskit web site - it is not a secure web site. I was stupid  bought anyways though that site and had false credit card purchases made within 2 days of purchase.<br /><br />Also I grow my wheatgrass by hydroponic, and the seeds don't so so well. They are slow to spout, the roots are rotting quicker than the growth. So I'm not getting a tall grass to juice with plus I have to watch the mold. Also I thought all seeds would be equal, but even the taste seems different and my stomach has to have smaller amounts of juice. My biggest regret is purchased 20lbs because I juice ALOT, and regret buying from this vender.<br /><br />I hope other buyers have better succes. Mine was just not so good.

review/summary: TERRIBLE SEEDS THAT PRODUCE MOLD AND LOW QUALITY WHEATGRASS
review/text: I ordered these seeds hoping to save money by buying in bulk. I  ordered seeds with other companies and had no problems. Then, I ordered these seeds.<br /><br />The seeds in the bag look like they are 2-3 years old. Right away I noticed the grass was really MOLDY.<br /><br />The grass grows very SLOWLY and is very THIN.<br /><br />The grass never really produces enough for a satisfying amount of wheatgrass juice.<br /><br />I contacted the company hoping I could exchange the seeds for a different batch of seeds. The company never responded.<br /><br />I will avoid doing business with this company. Bad service and even worse product. These worst wheatgrass seeds I have ever bought.

review/summary: Re-review, Grows very well in soil, but mold present.
review/text: I had previously, somewhat negatively, reviewed this product as the germination rate was extremely low when growing hydroponically. This means the sea kelp soaked seeds were placed in a Master Sprouter tray or a tray from my old Fresh Life electric sprouter, covered with a the vented lid from the mesh I had bought at Jo-Ann's crafts, wetted with sea kelp spray, put in the dark, misted or lightly sprayed with tap water or sea kelp mixture 2 times a day until the green shoots appeared and then put on a kitchen shelf near a window to continue to grow to 7 inches and green up. Germination rate was so low, it was not worth repeating. Kitchen temperature is about 78 degrees.<br /><br />Since then I have switched to an organic soil, vermiculate, perlite mix. Using about 1 inch of soil in the Master Sprouter trays (Sproutpeople.com) and following the same process as above, the germination rate is excellent. Thick crop, very green. HIgh yield juice using a Healthy juicer.<br />I have now reduced the soil to 1/2 inch to see if I can get away using less organic soil. But at this point I am very please with this 5 pound bag of wheat berries, even though they are smaller than my previous order from Dogwood Farms.I was very please with Dogwood's product and phone help, but, when it was time to order I could not remember the name of the seed (Genisis) nor the company name so I bought from Amazon instead. In previous Genisis crops growing in a full 2 inches of soil I have gotten a second cutting. We will see if that is possible using less soil and this current source for the seeds.<br /><br />Con:<br />Either due to the extremely hot weather, or the seed source, I am getting a ton of mold on the seeds themselves, but not the grass. I did not have a mold problem with Genisis seeds. Once the weather cools down (Arizona desert, although the room is kept at 78 degrees,  we will see if the mold is still happening. If so, then the organic label of the seeds may be in question. In previous years, when I used non-organic wheat berries from Whole Foods Market on a whim, the white and green mold was fairly thick. When I switched to Genisis seeds from Dogwood Farms, there was NO mold. Same time of year. Only time will tell.

review/summary: Good Seed
review/text: I used the seeds for a Biology project where I had to grow a plant and test the effect of pH on growth rate, but I am a terrible with plants!! I can not grow anything or keep what plants i buy alive!  I am the opposite of a green thumb, a black thumb if you will.  These seeds came within three days of ordering them and in great condition.  they grew to max height for my project (about 12-15) inches in just twelve days. i was happy with the product and I would recommend it to anyone, whether for the sake of saying "I can grow something," or for the many benefits that this super food can provide.  I fed my resulting crop to my bunny and even my dogs and cat were interested in it.

review/summary: GREAT WHEATGRASS SEED AT AMAZON!
review/text: I am a first time wheatgrass grower, and this seed is fantastic!  It sprouts exactly as planned, and grew like crazy (with good attention to watering) with both soil and simply on a plastic plate.  The germination/grow rate is incredibly high and the grass is just as lush as you could want (and this is in OHIO sunlight -- meaning not a lot and weak).<br /><br />I highly recommend this seller and will buy myself again when my supply gets depleted.<br /><br />Also, just for the record, I've been making wheatgrass smoothies every day in my Vitamix, and this grass doesn't taste nearly as bad as everyone says -- and if you mix in fruit it's actually very tasty!  A word of warning, though - if you mix a red fruit (strawberries, grapes...) it does turn a revolting color when mixed with the green grass.  Solution:  Drink through a straw out of a colored plastic cup and don't peek!<br /><br />I even grow a special tray just for the dog and cat who both love to nibble.<br /><br />Great seed, great seller -- perfect for "newbies"!

It also looks VERY nice and I can see why people might grow it just for decoration.

review/summary: Good stuff.
review/text: Takes a few days to kick in but then it started growing like wildfire. A week from from germinating it we had full grown wheatgrass ready to be cultivated. Almost too much for our little pot to handle. Never really got a chance to juice it or drink it so can't comment on that part of it. Started growing in all different directions and overflowing the pot because we didn't cut any of it off for juicing.<br /><br />Still have a bunch of seeds left and maybe will plant more another time so I can make a comment on it more.

review/summary: great tasting whipped frosting
review/text: I am in love with Betty Crocker Whipped Frostings .. especially the Butter Cream and the Milk Chocolate.  I have tried all the other whipped varieties from other manufacturers, but none can compare to Betty Crocker.  I took the chance and ordered the Strawberry Whipped frostomg when I got a great discount price here on Amazon, and hoped I would like it, because I did try the Cherry Whipped and hated it, although I usually love anything cherry.  The Strawberry is really good, and I would buy it again, and I recommend it to others.  Thank You Betty Crocker for making my life easier with all the great food products you have available.

review/summary: Numi is the perfect tea experience!
review/text: The Numi organic tea chest was a wonderful experience in tasting tea. I loved all of the flavors except one.  This is a wonderful way to try before you buy a larger box or it would make a great gift because there are so many choices in this box and the box itself is reusable. I have tried many brands of tea and this one is the one I enjoyed the most in a variety pack. I really enjoy the fact that it is organic and that I can get the flavors I really enjoy in larger boxes. Thanks to Numi for making any part of the day flavorful and healthy.

review/summary: Laxative in deed
review/text: In fact, if you don't read the instructions, the laxative effect is true, painful and violent. When taking time to read the box, I discovered that they did talk about the laxative intended effect, and that you had to brew the tea very very lightly the first times you use it to avoid a too strong effect. Whether laxative products help you loose weight and not water has been a big debate. I take it after having been invited to a generous meal. It might help. Anyway, it's a nice after dinner herbal tea, provided you are ready to sustain the laxative effect (which comes 6h after the intake, can be 7 when you sleep)

Don't let the price keep you from checking out what Boylan's has to offer.  This ginger ale is fabulous, and everyone fights over who gets the last Cream Soda, too!  Maybe now I can stop having to run out to buy a 12-pack of Coke!

review/summary: High Ball
review/text: I've tried so many ginger ales over and over again for high balls.  What's a high ball?  It's a drink with ginger ale or soda.  Ginger ale is usually better than soda in a high ball.  Boylan's is better than any other ginger ale for a high ball or any other mixed drink.  It is not even close.  Bourbon high ball, bourbon with a little less Boylan's.  Tequila High Ball (touchy drink), but Herradura or Cabo Wabo at 1.5 tequila to 2.5 oz Boylan (slice of lemon).  I have never had anything compare to Boylan's and I've spend a lot of money trying.  All Boylan's soda is awesome. I've tried the cola in cuba libre type drinks and prefer Pepsi from a fountain and Pepsi throwback.  Boylan's Rootbeer, cream soda, and orange are fantastic.  Root beer has a nice zing to it.

review/summary: Best Ginger Ale I can find.
review/text: I worked in Phoenix for approximately a year a few years back, and found the Boylan's line of pop in the BevMo stores in the area. Then I moved back to the midwest and went several years without it. Now I'm in the northeast near Philadelphia for law school and found a place in Hoboken, Hoboken Beer and Soda Outlet that sells a 24 pack for $22, and needless to say... every 5 to 6 months I go and stock up on all my favorite flavors. Ginger Ale, Original and Creamy Red Birch Beers, Orange, Grape, Black Cherry... they're all great. I used to drink a lot of store bought canned pop... but those all are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup, and using cane sugar just makes it better. If you live in the NYC or are prepared to make the drive to Hoboken, look it up and stock up on Boylan's!

review/summary: Unsatisfactory
review/text: I am extremely dissatisfied with the product and customer service from this company (Barry Farm). It says on the page for this product "Usually ships within 6 to 10 days". I ordered this product over three and a half weeks ago and just received it. I was still charged over $8.00 for shipping (more than the item was worth). I took precautions for the product not to sit in the sun and melt, ordering it so it would be delivered on a day I was home. This effort failed; the shipping and delivery dates changed...twice. I got an email from Amazon stating that they had not received notification of shipping from the seller (Barry Farm). I emailed the seller, received no response. I then got an email from Amazon a day later with a delivery time frame. The product did not arrive during the stated time frame (late). When it finally arrived, I received a bag of melted goo. But the interesting thing was, it was evident that the product had melted before, re-hardened, and then began to melt again in my mailbox. Due care was not taken to package the product in a manner that MAY have helped prevent such damage. I will not be ordering from this company again.

review/summary: Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea! And Decaf, too!
review/text: *****<br /><br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Green Tea Decaf Kombucha uses the same delicious recipe as our Green Tea Kombucha but is naturally decaffeinated. Our organically certified CO2 decaffeination method removes only the caffeine while leaving all of the beneficial polyphenolic elements of Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) intact. This method also maintains the antioxidant properties and delicate flavor of our delicious, organically-grown Green Tea.* Unlike other green teas, this special organic Green Tea has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. This formula incorporates the natural antioxidant properties of Green Tea with a concentrated, purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm). This extract is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs and is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea. For centuries, practitioners of herbal medicine have used Kombucha to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach.* This convenient form of Kombucha can be taken daily for maximum health benefits."<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of "Kombucha-Pure", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a caffeinated version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea does include caffeine.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****
