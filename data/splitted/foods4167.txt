review/summary: Satisfies the potato chip craving
review/text: I love having these on hand to pack in lunches, or to satisfy the urge to crunch.  Probably not as healthy as a salad , but more nutritionally sound than regular potato chips.

review/text: I got these, thinking that they'd be a good healthy snack, and they do indeed taste pretty good. But they are way too oily. I expected them to be more like Veggie Chips, which I really like. But they aren't.<br /><br />Hey, they might be healthy but it doesn't matter. They leave a greasy residue in your mouth/throat after eating just a handful of them. Just as bad as french fries.

review/text: The belts were fresh and tasty, just like the candy store used to have. The cases were cracked when they arrived in the shipping box so it seems from some of the other review its pretty common, but didn't affect the quality. 1 order is 2 tubs, which last a long time.<br />I do not recommend vaccum sealing to keep some fresh as the vaccum smashes the belts together and makes them hard to peel apart. Ziplock bags work much better.

review/text: The classic strawberry belts that you find in those expensive candy stores at the mall. These are so good, the only downside to these which others have mentioned is that the boxes may have a crack in them when they arrive, there is a plastic wrapping that seals the two packs together but one of my boxes the candy is starting to get a little bit hard, it will not stop me from eating this delicious candy.

review/text: I bought these because they were all natural.  I've been trying to avoid eating foods containing artificial dyes and these were a great replacement for the popular candy that has dyes.  I find them to be a little less sweet but actually prefer that.  The candy shells are quite brittle and most of the candies came with cracked shells.  i.e. The bottom of the bag had quite a bit of chipped candy coating.  This didn't really bother me as I like these for the taste, not their appearance, but I could see how others may be turned off by this.  I'd buy these again.

Since I really like M&M's, these are a healthier alternative and I gobble them up quickly! On the other hand, I will say they are quite expensive ($1.99 at Whole foods) and they do not have the sweetness of an M&M. While I like to have sundrops for the "natural" aspect of things, I do like the taste of M&M's a little better but only because they add more sugar.<br /><br />Overall, a good product and one I would recommend, especially for children! I like to have these with a salty snack, preferably popcorn!

review/summary: Amazon is wrong- this jam DOES have added sugar
review/text: For those people who are looking for jam with NO ADDED SWEETENERS:<br />I bought this beautiful jam from Amazon, which states it as having "No added preservatives or sweeteners" which is why I purchased it.<br />Since we have stone-age speed dial-up, I was unable to ever get any label page to load (I tried for over 2 hours! with no success) to check on the truth of the Amazon statement before I ordered it. Amazon does have quite a legal disclaimer stating that the info they have on their website may be wrong. I wanted to see the jam's label and ingredients. I had no luck getting any more info than what Amazon had.<br /><br />However, I needed a gift in a hurry - one with no sugar added for a very special person, so I took a gamble that Amazon's statement "No added preservatives or sweeteners" was correct.  I lost the bet... my fault obviously (considering their disclaimer), but still very annoying.<br /><br />I am very much less inclined to order from Amazon in the future if their product info is what I am basing my order on.<br /><br />While the jam may well be wonderful for those who eat sugar, it is unfortunately typical of the kinds of sugared jam one can buy anywhere, except that this jam is wildly expensive. If you are looking for something special with no added sweetners - you need to keep looking beyond this Clearbrook Farms Oregon Red Raspberry Preserves- it has added sugar in it.

review/summary: Awesome jam!
review/text: I bought this jam on a whim for the first time at an upscale grocery store that specializes in gourmet items.  I was amazed when I tried it.  It packed more flavor than any raspberry jam I had ever eaten and I now look forward to breakfast because of it.  The grocery store where I bought it is an hour's drive from my house so whenever I was in the area, I would make a special stop to purchase more of Clearbrook Farms Oregon Red Raspberry Preserves.  Imagine my surprise last time when I found the store no longer carried it!  I was not to be stopped and found it through Amazon.  I bought two jars knowing that would last me a while since the jars are big and one needs less jam since the flavor is intense.  Delivery was timely; the jars were well packed; and I'm a happy camper.

review/text: I purchased these bones for my two large dogs.  I purchased the largest bones available, thinking this will keep my dogs busy for a while.<br /><br />Man, was I wrong.  My dogs went through a large bone each within thirty minutes.<br /><br />Now I have one very sick dog on my hands, which will probably end at the vets office.

review/text: First of all, the ingredients listed on Amazon are not nearly as complete as the ingredients listed on the actual bag. One of my dogs is allergic to peas and carrots, both of which are in the ingredient list on the bag, but not listed on the site.<br /><br />Secondly, one large "SmartBone" takes my large breed dog no more than 5 minutes to devour. At three dollars a bone, this is way too expensive.

review/summary: Not a great option
review/text: We bought a SmartBone from Petsmart (not Amazon) but were so disappointed that we wanted to warn as many people as possible. Our dog loved it, but within seconds the end of the bone popped off and she almost choked on it. Then she got really hyperactive and was breathing hard for a long time afterwards. There's a lot of sugar in this product and none in her regular food, so we think she had some sort of sugar rush. She's just now starting to calm down several hours later. All that aside, the bone didn't last nearly as long as it should (for the price), and the mental anguish just isn't worth it. Spend your money elsewhere.

It's a great reward for her as she'll do anything to get it - but it won't keep her busy.

review/summary: What I'd Been Searching For !!!!
review/text: I had dined at a great asian/fusion restaurant where sweet soy sauce was served as a dipping sauce, in addition to regular soy, and everyone at our table much preferred the sweet soy sauce. It so far surpassed the regular soy in flavor....I was astounded....much milder and not as harsh in taste as the regular soy. I got this here at Amazon from importfood and it was shipped super fast and packed very securely. It is somewhat thick, and in order to add it to rice etc., I mixed in about 3 parts water, and it makes a great dipping sauce in that consistency as well. I have also used it without diluting it in stirfrys, and it is never overpowering, just right. I am thrilled to have found this. I also ordered some of the ABC Sweet Soy, it is much thicker than this one[like molasses] and somehow seems stronger in taste than the Healthy Boy. I am however,still in the early stages of experimenting with these.  I went to my pantry and got out the supermarket brands of Kikko.... that I had, and gave them away. Never will I use those again. Do give this a try if you like Asian, Thai, or stirfries of any kind.

review/summary: Enjoy Life Sugar cookies
review/text: These cookies are great, great taste, healthy ingredients. I amm gluten and lactose intolerant and it is not too hard to find cookies made with out gluten, but finding cookies with no eggs, lactose and gluten is difficult. I have likes all of Enjoy Life Products and order through Amazon all of my cookies and breakfast foods. Comes right to the front door and I do not have to travel around trying to find what I want. Seems like the gourmet and specialty food stores are not consistant with their inventory and keep changing products, so you never know if the store will have the same products from week to week.

review/text: The sugar crisp cookies are delicious. I am gluten intolerant, but my husband is not and he loves them too. I like the chocolate chip almost as much.<br />They are better than anything I can make at home with a gluten free mix or gluten free flour. They remind me of what I used to make at Christmas before the gluten intolerance. I can't believe they can make these without allergens.<br />I also use them to make almost instant no bake cheesecakes.<br />You can use store bought cheesecake filling on top of a cookie or make your own.<br />I use 4 oz mascarpone, 1 t (or more) lemon juice, 1 T (or more) confectioners sugar 1 t vanilla.<br />I mix all of this and spread it on top of 2 cookies and top them with 1 crumbled cookie.

review/summary: Tasty Cookies!!!
review/text: My 2 yr old son has autism, sensory processing disorder, and multiple food allergies (wheat, dairy, and soy). He is a very picky eater and finding foods he can and will eat can be very challenging. These are by far his favorite cookies. I've always loved sugar cookies so I figured I would try them too, even though I can eat any foods I want. I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised at how delicious these are. I'm going to purchase several boxes so my son and I don't run out. I'm addicted to these cookies and my son always chooses these over all of the other Enjoy Life cookies and other brands (not many out there for him)including homemade cookies that we have tried. Thank You Enjoy Life for making products free of all 8 major allergens. You have made my life easier!!!

review/summary: A bit sandy...
review/text: I'm new to the food allergy world.  I stumbled across this brand's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDMUQ2">Enjoy Life Very Berry Chewy On The Go Bars, Gluten, Dairy & Nut Free, 5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> at my local Whole Foods so I went in search of other products in their line.<br /><br />I was hoping these cookies would provide a nice relief for my sweet tooth but the texture is a bit tough to get over.  The taste is fine (in that they are sweet) but these cookies are very sandy.  Imagine if you made a thin cookie out of mud, then let it dry in the sun.  Then after a few days, you took a bite.  That's how I described the texture to my husband (who does not have any FA).<br /><br />I'm glad to have these as a choice but frankly, I won't be ordering them again.<br /><br />Lastly, I wish the company would repackage their products so there's not so much wasted space.  The boxes are slightly smallish, which I expected, but when you open it and there are 7 cookies on each side, with a big spacer in the middle, makes you wonder if they do that on purpose to make the customer feel like they're getting more?  I'm fine with the price but there's no need to try to pretend to be something you're not.<br /><br />If you have a sweet tooth too, I would suggest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH568O">Enjoy Life Foods Chocolate Bar Boom CHOCO Boom Dark Chocolate 12 Bars</a>instead.  The Milk choc and the rice ones don't taste very good but the dark chocolate is pretty tasty (and I'm not even a big chocolate fan).

review/summary: My Favorite Chocolate Trifecta
review/text: In an effort to reform my omnipresent sweet tooth, I thankfully have acquired a taste for small, almost daily doses of dark chocolate.  I have tried numerous dark chocloate brands but the one I always come back to is Hershey's dark chocolate assortment.  I love the small thin, little wrapped squares and the smooth, rich taste. Alas, when my favorite squares with the blueberries and almonds are gone I long for them and I am tempted to buy another bag to replenish, but I resist and enjoy the others...almost as much (I sometimes eat them along with a few roasted almonds). I realize Hershey's makes the larger bars with the blueberries and nuts...but it's just not the same as those little thin squares which make it so much easier to constrain yourself. One suggestion for Hershey's:  please give your customers an option to customize the assortment, similar to what m&m's does with the personilized orders - it would make my day :)

review/summary: One of the Best Fish Sauce available in the US! Its STINKYlicious! :P
review/text: The Squid Brand have two kinds of Fish Sauce available in our local Asian store here in the Bay Area. I buy them both! I prefer the one in a brown bottle (premium) for dipping and making sauces, while I prefer the green bottle (the one Amazon is selling) for cooking. The green one is saltier so its good for cooking, while the brown one is less salty but more flavorful and smooth.<br /><br />The brown bottle Squid fish sauce (Premium) is around $3, while the green bottle is a little more than a dollar only. So its way overpriced here in Amazon. But if you live nowhere near an Asian Store, Amazon is the best source because they're safe, reliable and will ship fast. Fortunately, we have a lot of Asian Store in the Bay Area, for the price Amazon is asking for two bottles of my favorite fish sauce, I can buy a dozen in the store already. :P<br /><br />Three Crabs Brand Fish Sauce is very good too.<br />&lt;...>

I flash fry at 480F potatoes, egg-rolls, tempura, i even batter coat and fry sushi rolls, and everything comes out amazing - no heavy sticky smokey oil, and even cleanup seems easier with this rice bran oil.  if you google around you'll find a lot of medical studies that say to avoid canola oil vapors while frying, so rice bran oil is not just a cheap very high heat point oil, but may save your life if you tend to fry a lot.  I live near an Asian neighborhood and can get this locally $6 per liter, but having it shipped for $9 can be a real bargain for some who may live far from such ethnic food shopping.

I've gotten two orders of these and both packages have been fresh, with not too many bad seeds in the packages.  Also, the price is just about $1.50 per pound, which is GREAT, especially for jumbo sized seeds.  Given the choice, I cannot imagine opting to buy another brand of sunflower seeds as long as the price and quality of Jumbo brand sunflower remains consistent.  Also, I will NEVER again buy anything but the jumbo sized seeds.  After eating the larger seeds, I cannot imagine wasting my time eating those annoying little seeds which David sells in their regular sized seeds.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Our fat orange tabby had been on Science Diet all 9 years of his life. He started hurling on the carpet more then usual (usual being kitty revenge for some slight) so we contacted my boyfriend's sister who has been a vet for over 15 years. She said sometimes manufacturers just change the ratios or ingredients in a cat food and it doesn't set well with some consumers. Eukanuba was one of the recommended brands -- a kennel I worked at in college swore by it -- so we weaned him onto it and no issues since. I'd recommend it solely because he's picky ( hates treats, milk, cream, tuna fish oil ... Everything ) and because it settled his stomach.

review/summary: Bloody Stool and Vomiting.
review/text: I have a 12 year old female who is over 15 pounds and my vet recommended a lower fat dry food.  I switched to this food and for about 8 months did not notice any improvement in her weight.  What I did notice was at least 3 times a week blood outside her litter box after she had a bowel movement and a regular routine of vomiting. I became alarmed and brought her to my vet.  After a full "costly" check up, he asked me what food she was on.  When I told him he told me that it was not the first time he heard of problems with this brand.  I started giving her 1/2 and 1/2 wet food in the morning and Innova Cat and Kitten in the evening, problem totally solved!  It's been over a month and not only are the bloody stools gone, but no more throwing up.  Be very cautious with this food.

review/summary: Not worth the price
review/text: Eukanuba is a well-respected name in pet foods, and it's a bit pricier than some other big brands.  So when we wanted to switch our cat Caesar from Iam's and saw this on sale, I figured that I was getting quite a bargain.  Oh the folly...<br /><br />Chicken by-product meal, Corn grits and corn meal are three of the four top ingredients.  This is what the high cost buys - by-products and corn?  If we wanted to continue giving him crappy ingredients then we'd have kept buying Iams and saved the cash (not to mention the fact that Caesar actually liked it)!  I imagine the weight-loss claim is probably true, because my cat would eat just enough of this to get by...he hated it!  We decided to change to a new brand after half a bag, phasing the new food in with the Eukanuba  in growing proportions.  Throughout this short period, the kibble from the other brand was always gone first.<br /><br />If Caesar had liked it, I probably wouldn't stick with it on principle...I don't think I should pay top-dollar for substandard ingredients.  Luckily, Caesar came to that conclusion all by himself!

review/summary: Pretty Great Seeds!
review/text: I am a sunflower seed addict, and connoisseur.  I love the size of the bags, and the seeds themselves are great.  The hulls aren't super salty, and just about all of them are intact, so you're not getting a handful of empty shells.  My only complaints are that the hulls are on the softer side, so you can't really crunch them up and eat them too....I like to do that sometimes.  Also, the seeds could be roasted a Bit more...I love the flavor of well roasted seeds.  All in all they're still pretty good, and I will re-order.

review/summary: HAIRY, HAIRY TREATS!!
review/text: The 1st time with these treats, my experience was fine. My yorkie is amazingly picky about his food/treats, so I'm always thrilled when he likes anything.  He loved these treats! Just bought another bag and gave some to him over the past few days and noticed he'd hack after eating one. I figured they were dry Bc he never did this before. I was going to give him one this morning before our walk when I noticed coarse,  long hairs all crammed into the marrow!! I pulled 2 strands out of one marrow and examined them. They were thick, light brown/Blonde and about 1/4 in long. No wonder my poor dog was hacking! He just had a mouthful of hair! I checked more of them & found more hair. I contacted Pedigree and am no longer buying their products. It was disgusting.  Save your dog's stomach and spend a few extra bucks on something that's actually quality treats for your dog(s) and more nutritious and wholesome .... not chock full of hairs!<br /><br />(The only reason for having 2 stars is due to my dog loving them so much...!)

review/summary: Both of my dogs love these treats
review/text: I have a 16-year-old Australian Shepherd and a 1.5-year-old Border Collie - both love these treats. Due to the Australian Shepard's age, she's pretty particular about what she'll eat; these treats are not so hard that she has a hard time chewing them.<br /><br />I do disagree with the product description here - these are fairly large treats; I don't think that they're proper for "training". A much better choice for training is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006349WQ">Crazy Dog Train-Me! Training Treats Bacon</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006349W6">Crazy Dog Train-Me! Training Treats Chicken</a>.<br /><br />UPDATE: Very sadly, my Australian Shepherd passed away (she is sorely missed...). The newest member of our family - a Jack Russell Terrier - loves these treats too.

review/summary: GOT A GREAT PRICE - ARRIVED QUICKY - AND CHECKED EXP DATE - VERY VERY FRESH
review/text: I recently got a bad (expired) lot of another Pedigree product.  I didn't check the expiration date, and did not know why my dog suddenly didn't like those anymore.<br /><br />Well, thankfully another person saw my post, asked if I check the expiration date - and I was shocked, surprised and somewhat able to under stand why my dog thankfully would refuse them.<br /><br />ANYWAY - AS USUAL - AMAZON IS ALWAYS GREAT WHEN THERE IS THE RARE PROBLEM.  AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT, I CONTACTED THEM AND THEY REFUNDED MY PURCHASE.<br /><br />I almost let that scare me off, but THE PRICE CAN BE SUCH A GOOD DEAL AT TIMES, the convenience is great, and ALL OF MY EXPERIENCES SHOPPING HUNDREDS OF TIMES WITH AMAZON HAVE BEEN GOOD (the very few 'return' or other issues were always quickly handled with a very nice e-mail).<br /><br />THUS - YOU SHOULD CHECK EXPIRATION DATES ON ANYTHING YOU BUY ON-LINE, EVEN AMAZON.  Otherwise 5 stars for this purchase and the price I got (and my dog love's them .... but not nearly as much as I love my dog :)  )

review/text: My 45-pound border collie/Aussie mix dog loves these treats. They are the perfect size for her, and much more desirable than a plain, nasty milk bone. I do prefer to give her organic and high quality treats (Milo's Kitchen, Newman's Own treats, etc), and she loves those the most, but for the price, these treats are excellent. I am glad they are made in Canada, as I won't buy any food or treats imported from China. At PetsMart, he much smaller bag of MarroBones costs nearly as much as this six pound bag. This was well worth the price.

No big deal, I wasn't in a hurry to get cavities anyways... but boy was I surprised when I got a call from a delivery driver saying he has a package for me on 1-3-12.
