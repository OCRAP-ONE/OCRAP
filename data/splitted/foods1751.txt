review/summary: It's ok...
review/text: I am a big water drinker and have been wanting to try MiO for awhile. It is very easy to use but I really don't care for the taste. It definitely has a strong aritificial taste to it. If you are someone who drinks Diet drinks regularly this is probably something you will like. As for me, I will stick with plain old water with a fresh lemon slice.

review/summary: Tastes ok but..
review/text: So i bit the bullet and got the Mio Liqud. This flavor tastes.. ok. It has a funky fresh aspartame kinda taste to it. I dont like diet sodas at al because they give me head aches (allergy to the artificial sweeteners) and this had the same headache.<br /><br />I took out out just for some flavor to add when on some walks and or hikes etc..<br />I mean its nice to keep something portable in a bag and just add if you want for flavor in the water - but im not sure whats in it.. all i know is the taste n the headache.

review/summary: convenient, slight hospital taste, alcohol based sugars
review/text: To be honest, I was not expecting much. What can 1.62 ounces of tea really do? I expected to get about 4 or 5 teas, and not much else, despite the claim to many servings. However, this is a nice product and might be better for others.<br /><br />1. The taste reminds me too much of a hospital, maybe its just the peach flavor, but it reminded me of it (and I wasn't alone with this opinion)<br />2. You really can get a lot of servings out of it. The measure is very unscientific (they define a servings as a "squirt", which as you might guess varies quite a bit. A strong squirt? A quick squirt? A you-hold-for-a-second squirt? Who knows, but it falls somewhere in between. In general a strong squirt can give a bit of flavor to a 12 ounce glass of water.<br />3. Its convenient as it mixes very easy with water. If you are not picky, you don't even have to stir it. For a consistent taste, you can just stif for 2 seconds. If you want it sweeter, just keep adding squirts, (3 squirts on a 12 ounce glass makes for a very sweet tea, I wouldn't recommend more than that)<br /><br />Another positive in my book is the use of alcohol based/type sugars, as opposed to high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />However, at around $5 dollars per 1.6 ounce jar, it's quite expensive. I would say you get 20 decent size servings out of it, that comes out to 25 cents per strong squirt. Maybe the convenience is worth it.<br /><br />If it weren't for the hospital taste, I'd give it 4 stars.

review/summary: MIO Peach Tea Reminded Me of Olive Garden's Peach Bellini Iced Tea
review/text: I've been using the MIO products for approximately two years, ever since discovering them at a demonstration at my nearby Farm Fresh.  The tear-shaped bottles are convenient for carrying with me in my backpack; I use them at restaurants, church, work, etc., for flavoring my water.  Thanks to MIO, I've considerably decreased my intake of carbonated sodas.<br /><br />  I suffer from chronic sinusitis.  Sodas have a strong tendency to make me congested.  A few minutes after I begin consuming one, I notice that my nostrils start to feel clogged.  This doesn't happen when I drink tea, coffee or the MIO liquid water enhancers.  Indeed, I am living proof that MIO products are a healthier alternative to sodas.<br /><br />  The MIO Peach Tea liquid water enhancer reminds me of the delicious Peach Bellini Iced Tea I sometimes order at Olive Garden during the warm months.  Thanks to MIO, I can enjoy this delicious flavor anytime of the year.  All you need is cold water and ice.  Also, I can control the taste by varying the number of drops I squirt into a bottle, tumbler, glass, etc.<br /><br />  MIO offers a wide assortment of liquid water enhancers and I have indulged in all of them.  However, my favorite ones are the tea flavors.  They are more refreshing; they are also more suitable for quenching my thirst after exercising and for drinking with my meals.  Note:  I haven't tried any products from the line of MIO Energy Liquid Water Enhancers.<br /><br />  I recommend the MIO liquid water enhancers for those who want a healthier, more economic alternative to sodas.  I always carry a MIO product in my backpack inside a Ziploc bag to prevent spillage.  All the other products are kept in my refrigerator.  They don't need refrigeration but I believe the cold environment helps maintain freshness.  In this manner, one can enjoy a wide variety of flavors at the same time without worrying too much about expiration dates.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

review/summary: Too sickly sweet and loaded with chemicals
review/text: For the past few months, I have been hooked on the delicious glaceau vitamin water zero (acai blueberry in particular), but drinking 2-3 bottles per day has been costing me $25/week and resulted in the use of too many plastic bottles.<br /><br />So I decided to try MIO peach tea liquid water enhancer, which is not only less expensive and also calorie-free, it is also smaller and more portable. One easy-to-snap-closed container makes 24 servings, although those of us who use 3 or more "squirts" per glass of water may only have 15-16 servings available per bottle, at the cost of about 35 cents per glass. Still, not a bad deal, comparatively.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed. Although MIO peach does have a somewhat peachy taste that is not altogether unpleasant, it is a bit sickly sweet and altogether too chemically flavored. Whereas vitamin water zero contains mostly natural fruit ingredients and 100% of a day's requirements for vitamin C, B6 and B12, MIO water enhancer has no nutritional value and is loaded with more chemicals.<br /><br />Its label lists its ingredients as: malic acid, propylene glycol, citric acid, sucralose, acesulfame potassium, potassium citrate red 40, yellow 5, blue 1 (whatever that means), and potassium sorbate.<br /><br />Whereas vitamin water zero contains the no-calorie natural sweetener stevia, MIO peach's ingredients include the more questionable sucralose (also known as splenda), approved by the FDA but containing chlorine and believed by some medical authorities (such as Dr. Janet Hull) to be risky in regard to cancer, diseases of the thymus gland, and weight gain.<br /><br />A less expensive, also portable and more nutritious alternative to MIO water enhancers is to carry around wrapped sections of lemons which can easily flavor water, are tasty, natural and rich in vitamin c. Or at restaurants or cafes, simply ask for a slice of lemon with your drinking water. It will be more appealing to your taste buds and better for your body than artificial, chemically-based alternatives.

review/summary: not good
review/text: I like water but sometimes I need a little bit of flavor diversity.  I tend to turn to Crystal Light or my water infuser to vary my drink selection.  I was excited to try the MIO Liquid.  MIO seemed like an easy way to make a beverage that had the perfect amount of flavoring.  Unfortunately, I found this beverage to be lacking.<br /><br />Some notes on this product:<br /><br />Flavor: Do you like jello?  That is what I felt like I was drinking.  The liquefied version of some jello that I would not classify as peach or tea inspired. It tasted highly artificial and would not be a beverage that I would offer to a family member or friend to quench their thirst on a hot day.<br /><br />Color: The color was orange.  It did not resemble tea and had the appearance of jello.<br /><br />Ease of use:  I found this product to be burdensome.  It is messy and I would never let a young child use this product.  The product cannot be squirted at even a slight angle because it will splatter - clothes, the floor, hands - and stain.  I was so disgusted when I first used this product and some of the product splattered onto my white vinyl floor and left huge stains.  I had to scrub the floor multiple times for the MIO stains to fade.<br /><br />Health impact:  I tried drinking this stuff twice and on both occasions I developed headaches.  I do develop migraines after consumption of certain foods and beverages but usually the food/beverage culprits contain caffeine or chocolate.<br /><br />Packaging: MIO is packaged in a #7 plastic. #7 plastics are the most difficult type of plastic to recycle. Unless you live in a really progressive place that accepts #7 plastics, the product packaging will have to be pitched.<br /><br />In sum, I cannot recommend MIO.  The product stains flooring, does not taste like tea, possibly causes headaches, and is packaged in a plastic that is difficult to recycle.<br /><br />.000001 stars out of 5

review/summary: Good flavor
review/text: I've tried several of the MiO flavors now, and the peach and peach-mango are the two best.  I can only assume it's because the company got the peach flavor pretty close to right.  Either way, I'd recommend this if you're looking for a way to flavor your water sans calories.  It's a reasonably good, clean flavor and the artificial sweetener isn't overwhelming.<br /><br />MiO is a handly little product; you can carry it with you to sweeten and flavor water anywhere, and the price isn't bad considering how many servings you get.  All things considered, you could do far worse for yourself.

review/summary: My Favorite!
review/text: Of all the MIO flavors the Peach Tea has to be my favorite.  I have tried some of the other but this just has the wow factor to it for me at least.  A nice peachy tea flavor that you can make stronger of weaker according to how much you add to your water bottle.<br /><br />I love the small convient packaging so that it fits in my purse and I have it no matter where I go.  If a restaurant doesn't have what I want to drink then I just ask for cold water and add this to make my meal more enjoyable.  So so easy,<br /><br />The price is actually better than the powdered drink add ins and I swear they have a funny taste and don't mix as good as this does.  Just a few drops and your actually doing what the doctors would tell you most.  Drink lots of water.  That you cheat a bit with MIO great products doesn't hurt any.  I was ever so happy to see this and hopefully it will be around for quite some time.

review/summary: Perfect for my friend...
review/text: I think these little MIO guys are pretty great, but what I really wanna tell everyone about is why I got some of them for a friend.<br /><br />I have a buddy who's wife is always on him to drink water, since he's had issues with kidney stones in the past.  Problem is, he hates drinking straight water, he doesn't like the taste, and says it makes him gag when its too cold.  Hey, I don't get it either, but if that's how he feels then that's how he feels.<br /><br />So in the interest of keeping him from having to pee out any more gravel and to please his wife, I passed along a few of these to him.  He says its WAY better than drinking straight water, and due to their small size, keeps one in his coat pocket as well as in his car so they're always on hand.  I'm sure its not as great for his kidneys as just drinking straight water, but I'm very sure its a LOT better than him drinking coffee and soda all the time.  His wife likes them too.

review/text: I've tried two different flavors of Mio. Peach Tea, and Mango Peach. To be honest, they both taste almost identical to me, but I like them. This stuff is potent. After adjusting the amount used, I got it to where I really like it. Less is definitely better. The flavor isn't all that natural tasting, but it is very pleasant when you don't use too much. I highly recommend you start out with only a drop or two, until you reach your desired level of flavor. I like MIO Peach Tea, but I only recommend it if you're a fan of fruity diet drinks. If you're more of a juice drinker, and/or someone that does not like diet soft drinks, you may want to look elsewhere.

review/text: We have tried a few of the MIO liquids. So far, I have enjoyed them all. It has helped get the kids/teens to drink more water.  The Peach Tea is exactly what you would expect - Peach Tea.  It is not overly "peachy", so don't think that this is a very sweet flavor. Much easier to use than those packets of flavors that are hard to open, don't mix well with the water and leave a mess.  We enjoyed it!  The only downside there is to this product is that I feel it is expensive for what you get.

review/summary: Another good tasting MiO
review/text: Of the 3 MiO flavors that I've tried, Peach is my favorite. I'm generally not a big fan of peach flavored anything, but this is good. Not surpringly, it tastes a lot like their peach mango.<br /><br />As with all the MiO's, the biggest negative is that it is hard to get a consistent amount of mix. It is next to impossible to measure it with a spoon. Short of that, it is a matter of how hard you squirt. Two strong squirts is the best guess I have.

review/summary: Sweet but not overly so and easy to use!
review/text: The Peach Tea Mio has a great taste - very much similar to other low or no calorie beverages on the market. It is easy to get the amount right for the water and you can vary it depending on how you feel. I found I did not need as much of this particular type of Mio as I did of the Sweet Tea type to achieve the same result. I'm not sure why that is.<br /><br />I like this option better, in some ways, than the individual packets since they are a one size fits all. The Mio container is small enough to slip into a purse but I have not done it since I'm worried something will knock it and it will open and spill all over. That is the only downside - it is convenient to have around but perhaps not as portable as I'd like. It works great for the office.

review/summary: Not A Great Taste
review/text: The concept is pretty cool. Customize the amount of flavor in your water. What's not to like? Maybe it is just the peach tea flavor, but I found that I just could not get a good balance. It is mostly peach flavored, but the tea portion means that in lower quantities, it has a weird lacking taste. In larger quantities, it is too overwhelming peach a artificial sweetener. I didn't enjoy this at all. I had hoped the kids would enjoy this flavor, but they didn't enjoy it either. Bummer. (The kids like to order water at restaurants and add drink mix to it since they don't like soft drinks very much. This just didn't do it for them.)<br /><br />I do like the little container. It is small and discreet. So, when you are adding it to a glass of water at a restaurant, it isn't like you're pulling out some giant container to use. I also didn't have any leaking issues (which I worried about) in my purse.

review/summary: Great Concept, Handy and Portable but Very Sweet
review/text: To be frank, I love the concept of the MIO Liquid flavors (I tried the Peach Tea), and really wanted to be able to give it 5 stars and recommend it to everyone, but it fell a bit short of that wish.<br /><br />The bottles are small and will fit in your purse or coat pocket really nicely (love this).  For me, a very small amount was more than enough for a strong glass of Peach Tea... the problem came when I drank the Peach Tea.  At first I loved the taste, but then the artificial sweet flavor took over and I ended up pouring it out.  Wanting to give the MIO Peach Tea Flavoring another chance, I even tried adding it to Club Soda as I love flavored seltzer waters.  I had the same problem - the sweet is still too artificial and really takes over.<br /><br />I think MIO is on the right track, but maybe instead of being 0 calories and using artificial sweeteners they could use REAL sugar and have a concentrated flavor without the sickeningly sweet fake/chemically taste.<br /><br />In short:<br />- Handy, compact size<br />- You choose how much to use, so you can vary the strength of your drink<br />- A little goes a long way<br />- Good alternative to plain drinks for some dietary concerns<br />- Initial taste is great, but then the artificial sweetness takes over

review/summary: Make your own flavored water
review/text: Putting flavor on regular water really depends on one's preference. I am curious and very intrigued with this new product that I tried the following three flavors: Peach-mango, sweet tea and peach tea. Out of the three, I prefer sweet tea the best as it tastes closer to the real kind than peach tea and peach-mango. Although I prefer water in its plain form, the taste is not far from ready-to-drink flavored water available commercially. If you like those, it might worth to try as you more control in what flavor and much flavor you want to put in your water.<br /><br />Mio is very concentrated "water enhancer" - I never heard of those words until now. A small bottle can be used 24 times. The plastic bottle has a unique way of dispensing, it will not leak unless you squeeze the bottle for a squirt - one squirt, one serving, and one squirt is enough for a 6- to 8-ounce glass of water. Of course you can squirt more it depends how squirt happy you are. The amazing thing is that even if I don't stir it, just letting it stands for 20 seconds and the flavor spreads.<br /><br />It uses the artificial sweetener called Sucralose, whose scientific name is Splenda (OK, I probably have mixed them up). Anyway, it is 600 times sweeter than sugar and has 0 calorie. Mio is also gluten-free.

review/summary: Not a fan.
review/text: Truth be told, I'm exceptionally hard to please with water flavor enhancers.  I typically think they taste way too "chemically" and often fail to taste like they intend.<br /><br />The MIO Liquid Peach Tea is not an exception.  The peach taste is absolutely all you get, and its assaulting.  It is not a "day at the beach, little umbrella in your glass with some ice" memory flashback.  Using the recommended dose, It is an over-powering sickly sweet peach flavor that is not very reminiscent of warm summer days, or tea in any capacity.<br /><br />After you get over your initial shock of the extreme sweetness, you may then note the acidic aftertaste of the chemicals used to acquire the peach'y goodness.  Although I recognize I may be overly critical and many may not be as judgmental as I am, for my personal palette - this tea is just too harsh.<br /><br />I was under the impression this would be a water flavor enhancer, not a water flavor obliterator.<br /><br />On second thoughts however, with something this strong - I believe it will do well in places where you are desperately trying to mask the flavor of impure water. Overseas the water in Iraq and Afghanistan is reportedly considered notoriously bad so I think MIO Liquid Peach Tea would be loved with open arms.

review/text: These are great drinks. I put 2 long squirts into 24oz with ice. The sweet tea is more sweet than tea, the peach is nice, and the mango-peach is very very nice. Keep in mind, those are my taste buds.<br /><br />They are liquid, and have a cap that is attached. The connection to the bottle seems a bit frail, but it has not come off.<br /><br />The package is sealed very well; however, one out of three bottles I got had leaked through the seal. I believe these must be boxed, because envelopes invite crushing.<br /><br />I really like these drinks. They last 2 months opened, no refrigeration; however, anything sweet goes in my fridge.<br /><br />What is also good about these drinks is that they have a little color, but not enough to stain my clothing, as my sippy cup leaks sometimes.<br /><br />Nice product; needs improvement.<br /><br />----<br />UPDATE:  The product bottle is more durable than I had anticipated.  These drinks have been my mainstay to stay hydrated throughout the day. I even dilute the product because I drink it all day.  Green Apple and Black Cherry from the store are wonderful too.  I am sold on these water flavorings.  Sweet Tea was my favorite from the batch I got from Amazon.

review/summary: Flavor on the Go
review/text: Something I never thought of before is why they only put Kool-Aid or Crystal Light in pre-measured packets.  It wold be much more convenient sometimes, like at the office or on vacation, to be able to make just one glass instead of having to make 2 quarts or however much it is for Crystal Light "singles" pouches.<br /><br />Mio Liquid gives you that kind of flexibility.  Just squirt one shot per 8oz of water and instantly your water has some flavor in it.  And if you're like me you might want to add more than one shot per 8oz just to make it stronger.<br /><br />Overall I can't find anything to say negatively about the product.  The liquid is less messy than powders and no worrying about any residue left at the bottom.  The taste is pretty much the same as Crystal Light or sugar free Kool-Aid.  And really the flexibility of being to add just as much as I want would make it a better buy than powdered stuff.<br /><br />That is all.

review/summary: Simple to use, tastes great
review/text: MIO Liquid Peach Tea<br /><br />A co-worker showed me her MIO Berry drink and how it worked, and that got me thinking about trying the MIO liquid peach tea. The packaging is very small, so it fits in a lunch bag or pocket of a back pack without taking up much room, and it is very secure. The valve used to dispense the fluid is similar to the valve used in Heinz upside-down ketchup bottles, the ones that require quite a bit of force to squeeze out and does not leave a mess.<br /><br />I found that 4 or 5 squirts into a 16 oz water bottle was enough to provide a good tasting drink. The Liquid Peach Tea tastes just like peach tea, but with a strong hint of citric acid. My co-worker's berry drink contained some Vitamins, and we noticed that there was also an Energized version of MIO. This liquid peach tea was just a regular MIO water enhancer, no extra vitamins or caffeine is added.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5, easy to use, tastes good, but the actual metering is variable - just use as much as you feel is needed

review/text: I find the packaging for Mio Liquid to be awesome. It's cool looking, fits in a pocket or purse etc. I love the idea of a handy, non-fridge needing liquid that I can flavor water with easily. I drink a lot of bottled water at work and just thought this was a great little thing to keep on hand when I want some flavor. Well, it's the flavor itself that I have an issue with. It is in fact, kind of peachy, so that's good. But it's got that chemical taste. The more of this you use, the chemical flavor seems to compound. If I used too little, it was barely flavored water. If I used `enough' it didn't taste good to me.<br /><br />I think that you could get away with using a little to just barely flavor water and probably enjoy it more than if you made it with a full squirt as recommended on the bottle.

Diet Coke (yum! though I've almost quit drinking it) and Crystal Light are my two go-to beverages.<br /><br />I thought this MIO seemed promising, since I could add it to my regular water at work.  I also liked the idea of being able to add as much as I wanted, so I wouldn't be stuck with something too strong.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I really don't like the flavor of it.  While I am used to the artificial sweetener taste, and it usually doesn't bother me, it was noticeable in this liquid.  I don't think there is any actual "peach" or "tea" in the tiny bottle.<br /><br />I notice that there are lots of other flavors of MIO, and some of them have rave reviews.  After trying this one, however, I'm not sure I'll be buying any of the others.

review/summary: Makes a pretty good peach soda
review/text: Seems like a great idea, and I will try some more flavors.<br /><br />The container is convenient to carry around<br />You can flavor any volume of water<br />Easily adjust the concentration of flavor to your liking<br />Hassle free mixing, no floating powder, quickly disperses in water instead if dissolving with mixing<br />No little packets to dispose of<br /><br />However....<br />Controlling the amount dispensed is fairly difficult, as you squeeze it won't come out until a powerful stream comes out, then you have to quickly stop<br />Artificial taste at low concentrations<br />No tea flavor, just peach<br />Fairly high cost, seems about twice that of packets putting it in the order of a can of soda (not a vending soda) about 25� per serving<br /><br />The best use I found was using this with seltzer to make a peach soda.<br />You can buy carbonated water or make your own with a device such as Soda Stream.<br />Finally I can have a lightly flavored soda. I will be trying more flavors as a soda.

review/summary: Another pretty good drink mix from MIO
review/text: I've had the Chrystal Light Peach Tea mix and didn't really care for it and it tended to leave a funny film around the neck inside the water bottle. Now this mix has a lot better flavor and doesn't have that odd trait of leaving residue or a film on the inside of the glass. The mix in the little bottle for this seems to be stronger than the mixes for the other flavors that I've tried. One of the other flavors I've tried I only got ten 12oz. glasses of mix out of it. I've just started using my bottle of the Peach Tea so I only know that I don't have to use quite as much to mix a glass of it.<br />I've seen where others have complained about it smelling like chlorine. All I can smell from it is Peaches. It does have a slightly odd aftertaste but that's from the tea part of it. It's NOT Peach JUICE, it's Peach TEA. So it's going to have a different flavor than juice does.<br />Although I kinda like this one I'm not that crazy about it. So I doubt that I will be buying any more of it anytime soon. I'm not that fond of the tea aftertaste and there's several other MIO flavored mixes that I like a lot more than this one. But if you are a tea drinker and like the herbal teas you might like this one. It would probably be better in the summer as a iced drink on a hot day. Since its winter & I'm in Colorado and we are having a snow storm at the moment, maybe I'll try a squirt or two of this in a mug of hot tea. Just to see what its like. If it works I'll come back and update this and let you know.

review/summary: Convenient, green, not bad tasting, but nutritionally questionable
review/text: I have to say that I was initially put off by Kraft's in your face advertising for Mio.  when offered the opportunity to try it, I thought i would give it a chance, as it would be something of a treat for my son to bring to school in his lunchbox.<br />I like that it is portable, contains no sugar or high fructose corn syrup...and that portability goes beyond the lunch box (when one thinks about the amount of money and petroleum products spent moving water all over the country).  So, thinking of it more or less like sodas we gave it a try.<br /><br />My initial reaction, even before I tasted it, was that it was a very pungent smell given the small amount I used (just a few drops) and I figured it must be artificial;, probably esters.  the taste was cleaner/ truer than most sodas, but given that most sodas are artificial, that is nto saying much.<br /><br />While kraft acts as though they are introducing this concept, my kids have long made italian sodas using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005T64YYS">Amoretti Premium Holiday Syrup 6 Pack (Chai, Cinnamon, Eggnog, Gingerbread, Nutmeg, Pumpkin Spice) - 750ml Bottles</a>.  I often do the same but using fruit juice instead, much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y59Z2W">ORANGINA DRINK HAT ORANGE FRANCE FRENCH LARGE VINTAGE POSTER REPRO</a> (though we can not get the lovely Sicilian bitter sweet oranges for thousands of miles around).  That said, the only novel aspects of this product are the packaging, and that it is completely artificial.<br /><br />When I looked up the ingredients (they are way too small to see on the packaging) here is what i found:<br /><br />*  Water, Citric Acid, Propylene Glycol, Malic Acid, Contains Less than<br />  2% of Natural Flavor, Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium<br />  (Sweeteners),Potassium Citrate, Red 40, Blue 1, Potassium<br />  Sorbate (Preservative).<br /><br />at least 2 of the above are listed as potential carcinogens.<br />In fact, having spent quite a bit of my graduate school years understudying the only non-MD ever admitted to the American college of physicians and surgeons, for her work on non-nutrative sweeteners, i know wnough to avoid them like the plague, and did not know there was sucralose in this porduc or I likely would not even have tried it.<br /><br />That said, we live pretty healthy.  My kids usually drink mineral water or milk and have smoothies or shakes as treats, so I would consider this an occasional lapse. It is something i would let them have on a very irregular basis.  Really, I do not want toi get anywhere near the "danger levels" (if we even know what those are) with this product.<br /><br />I have long hoped (and still do) that amazon would add nutritional information, or at the very least ingredients to their packaged food listings.  If you came looking for this information, it  is towards the top of my review.<br />Note: less than 2% natural flavoring, and a stew of chemicals.  gggole this and you will see that virtually every organization involved in food has given this a d or f for nutrition.  I unfortunately know form experience that a lot of people just do not care about this.<br /><br />In sum:<br />The taste is truer, stronegr than most sodas.<br />It is a convenient package which is environmentally sounder than most (both in terms of packaging and transportion costs, petroleum involvement).<br />Nutritionally, it is as bad as any product out there, save for the absence of salt 7 fat.<br />2% natural = 98% chemical.

review/summary: Pleasant Tasting Soda Alternative
review/text: This is the third MIO flavor I've tried.<br /><br />The taste of this one is not much different from the Peach Mango. It's definitely more of a peach flavor. I don't detect much tea in it.<br /><br />Still, I find this to be pleasant and refreshing. Since I'm trying to get myself off diet sodas, this is a good alternative.<br /><br />The one problem I've had with all the MIO flavorings I've tried is that it's not an exact science on how much to squirt into your liquid. It doesn't come out in drops but instead in a stream. I think I'd prefer drops so I had a better idea of how much I was putting into my drink.

review/text: First of all, I must admit that I was a bit mistaken as to the product.  I kept seeing the words "Peach Tea" and thought I was buying some sort of Tea.<br /><br />There is no "tea" about this product.  This is a "Water Enhancer" - basically something to flavor your water so that you, ostensibly, will want to drink more of it.<br /><br />More disappointing, when you check the ingredients, there is no peach listed anywhere.  Instead, you get a laundry list of chemicals and dyes that taste like...are you ready...chemicals and dyes.<br /><br />I'll take plain old water over this any time!

review/summary: MIo Peach Tea
review/text: I actually decided to try this product before Vine sent me one. My first purchase was at Target where I compared the price of the generic Crystal Light price to this. The generic price was less. BTW Target's price on this is less than Amazon's. But I bought this because a work colleague thought this was a better product than the powder as it travels better-agreed, and you can add it to a bottle or a single glass-the powder has single packets too, and it gives you the choice of adding as much or little as you want- the jury is out on this last point.<br /><br />As I continue to use this, I will let the buyer know if I can get 24 servings out of the container as advertised on the small bottle. The squeezing takes some practice as with any hard plastic bottle. My squeezes were inconsistent from one glass to another. The peach tea tasted like peach but not peach tea. I have yet to try the berry pom which I bought at Target. I also would not put a flip top in a purse or briefcase to carry as it may spill. If one does not secure the top with a final click, it is not closed. A screw cap may have been a better choice.<br />I do like the small bottle, but is the price worth the extra plusses?  In my opinion only as a convenient travel drink, not as an every day replacement to powder. There are so many inexpensive powders that compete with Crystal Light that taste good. Mio is a great novelty, but not a replacement as an every day drink.

review/summary: Great tasting water enhancer
review/text: I drink a lot of water, especially during workouts and while at work. Before getting the MIO, I have never heard of a "specific brand" water enhancer before. The closest thing I could compare to enhancing your drinking water was adding a slice of lemon in some restaurants and that was it. Getting a chance to try this gave me a different perspective of water in its variety all together. The MIO water enhancer gives a dash of creativity in the way you drink this life-giving liquid. Adding a few squirts of the MIO Peach Tea to a glass of water gives it flavor that one can tolerate. It just gives it a sweet flavor for your to enjoy water in a different way. I like the fact that it is free from Caffeine, Fat, Calories, Sodium and all other stuff that you may find from drinking other not so healthy beverages. It is artificially sweetened with Sucralose and Acesulfame Potassium, which after doing a bit of research, are both non-caloric sweeteners. In fact, Sucralose is actually Splenda so you do not need to concern yourself about caloric intake when it comes to drinking your MIO-enhanced H2O. Overall a pleasant and new experience in the way you drink water.

review/summary: Cool concept with an "OK" taste
review/text: MIO's concept is quite cool. Basically, these are small 1.6-ouce squirt bottles which you can store pretty much anywhere - a cabinet, a desk drawer, a backpack, etc. - and you squirt them into water to create a  flavored drink. In this case, it's "peach tea" flavored and you put in one squirt for every 8 ounces of water. It's extremely convenient to just grab a bottle of water, throw two squirts of this stuff in, shake it up, and enjoy.<br /><br />But more importantly, does it taste good? Well... it taste OK. Nobody would mistake it for fresh Peach Tea, but it is somewhat palatable. I didn't notice the "chemical" aftertaste that other reviewers have mentioned, but it definitely does come across as artificially flavored. Based on other reviewers comments, it seems like there is wide range of opinions on the taste (as you would probably expect). So if you're looking for a convenient way to have flavored water anytime, then it's probably worth at least trying this product.

review/summary: This is better than Mango Peach
review/text: I found that the Mango Peach was sweeter but had an artificial sweetener after-taste. The tea flavor at the end of the Peach Tea masks that after taste. I believe that if you want a strong taste you have to use more of the product and that means fewer servings. I like the product but the cost seems high.

review/summary: a little too tart.....
review/text: I've tried several of the mio flavors and my favorite by far is the mango peach, so I was anxious to try the peach tea.  Hubby and I both tried it today and we came to the same conclusion.  The perfect blend of sweetness didn't come through on this one and it left a bit of a sharpness or bitter taste.  Out of all the flavors I would say this one is the least favorite and I would not purchase this one.  I'll most likely use up what I have, but it won't be on the grocery list.  I do, however recommend the peach mango and I found the sweet tea to be pretty good as a second choice.

review/summary: Not my glass of tea *rimshot*
review/text: I was intrigued by these new "flavor enhancers," so I took the opportunity to try one out.  I like peach tea, so I chose the Mio "peach tea" liquid.<br /><br />The bottle is pretty small.  The lid snaps securely in place.  It has a pinprick nozzle -- if you squeeze it with any force, it will shoot a thin jet of liquid with considerable force.<br /><br />I squirted a little into a glass of cold, filtered water.<br /><br />I can't say I was impressed.  While the product purports to use "natural flavor with other natural flavor," whatever that means, this Kraft Foods liquid does not taste much like peach tea to me.  It tastes like a peach-flavored Jolly Rancher� circa 1982.  I got no tea flavor at all.<br /><br />I tried differing amounts of the Mio to see if I was simply using too much.  But that wasn't it.  Using less resulted in a watery drink without much flavor.  It just doesn't taste like peach tea.  It is reminiscent of peach candy with a somewhat odd aftertaste.  It's not quite the same as the artificial sweetener aftertaste of diet soda, but it's in the same ballpark.  Worse, the aftertaste lingered for several minutes.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.  Some people may like this.  To me, however, it tastes like a scientific counterfeit of peach.

review/text: This is a great product for those of us with wheat and gluten allergies.  It's crunchy, has great flavor, and a real treat.  I eat them with soups, chili, and crunch them up and use them as a breading for meat.  These crackers fit into my whole and natural foods list.  We purchase the assorted for variety, but my favorite is Tamari Sesame.  You won't be disappointed with the taste or the price.

review/summary: Stale.
review/text: Love Mary's Gone crackers, but hate the price. Trying to be thrifty, I decided to switch to these; I have bought this brand of crackers before, from local grocery stores. After they arrived I opened up the first package, blecchh. Out of date. Tossed the package, figured it was a one-off. Next package, same thing. third package, ditto. Don't think I am going to test my luck further. I looked into returning them, but as they are a food item, they cannot be returned. I have subscribe and save for a number of gluten-free foods, this is the first  and hopefully only) time I have receieved something in-edible. Back to Mary's from now on.

review/summary: Not Much Intensity
review/text: I was making a very special cake from scratch with different colored buttercream frostings and fondant decorations for my granddaughter's 16th birthday. I had a really nice set of gel colors <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S1C6">Ateco 1112 12-Color Food Coloring Kit</a> but I wanted to use some neon colors as well. I was thinking of lime green, pink, and purple but on the neon side. I found these neon colors at wal-mart but when I tried use them to color a bowl of vanilla buttercream frosting a pale orange, drop after drop I couldn't get much color to show in the frosting. Rather than dilute my recipe with a whole tube of gel color, I switched back to my Ateco colors which tinted the frosting after a couple drops. Then I tried to color some fondant neon purple and again had to resort to the regular purple from my Ateco set. I'm not sure what I'll do with these tubes of gel color now. Maybe I'll try them in whipped cream or a white cake batter. Possibly they might work in a smaller batch of frosting.

review/summary: Glad to have a trusted source
review/text: Having enjoyed OTC Oyster Crackers all my life, I was so dissappointed when local stores in South Florida discontinued stocking OTC products over the last few years.  I was so glad when I found this product offered through Amazon.com in quantities suitable for an individual household.  Amazon.com has been a trusted source for a variety of products for many years now, so I felt very comfortable making this purchase.  The 3-pack and 6-pack are both great values.  But because OTC Cracker Meal is also not sold at stores here anymore, and the minimum quantity offered online is not practical for an individule household, I purchased the 6-pack of whole crackers from Amazon and make my own cracker meal from them as needed.  Choosing the 6-pack provided the added benefit of FREE Shipping!<br /><br />OTC crackers are a product with a unique taste and texture.  There is really nothing else with which to compare them.  They are a great snack, and terrific with soups, salads, stews and chowders.

review/summary: An American Institution
review/text: I have been enjoying OTC crackers for over 50 years beginning when my parents would take my brother and me to Wenger's Oyster House in Reading, PA, another institution from the Great Depression days.  If I didn't have OTC's I wouldn't eat an oyster stew.<br /><br />You have to know how to break them when putting them into your soup or stew.  I see some complaints that they are too big, but these complainers are culturally illiterate!  You must take two crackers in hand, and squeeze them together.  One will break. Grind it smaller, then get another whole one, and repeat.  I laughed at those who say OTC's are too big.  What did you do- put them in your soup whole? They'll float for a year and not get soggy.  You must break them as it states on the box or bag.  And don't try to break just one by hand.  You are not strong enough.<br /><br />OTC's are indeed an American institution- been around for since 1848, and they still look and taste the same.  I pity you wretches who put those despicable weenie hexagon-shaped atrocities in your soup.  Be a man!  Bust OTC's in your stew!

review/summary: Great taste, fun to chew, strong scientific backing for health claims of Xylitol
review/text: After using an "all-natural" gum (that contained cane sugar) and getting my first cavity in 12 years after 6 months of use, I knew I needed a switch. I heard about Xylitol from a naturopathic student, that basically, the bad bacteria in your mouth feed on Xylitol but they can't digest it, and the good bacteria can eat it, so they proliferate. I thought I had tried other Xylitol gums in the past and didn't like them, but I decided to give this another chance because I want a gum to chew after meals that is actually good for my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised at the Spry gum! It has a great flavor (which goes away pretty soon after chewing, but it's a nice shot of good taste), but the best part is that the gum itself has a great texture to it and continues to be fun to chew for as long as you want. It doesn't even turn hard after drinking water like most gums do. I am a medical student so I did a search of the research literature and the claims of Xylitol are more than proven. However, all of the literature and research studies explain that you need 4-12 g of Xylitol a day (no need to get more than 15), but the average piece of gum has .75-1 g, so you'll need to chew at least 4-5 pieces a day to get the dental benefits (chewing it only sporadically, i.e. once a day, did NOT show any dental benefits). No problem for me, I chew one after every meal (I have 5-6 a day), and love having the fresh clean feeling as well as knowing that I'm doing something great for my teeth.

review/summary: Helps to Reduce Cavities
review/text: After chewing one piece of Spry peppermint gum you may notice your teeth and gums feeling more healthy. Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar as an ingredient, this item caught my attention.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It can be commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. Some Xylitol products are also made from corn.<br /><br />This product is made with a Xylitol, gum base, natural flavors, glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin and beesewax.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br /><br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />What more could we ask for from a gum? This gum is a natural defense system and you will start to notice the results. Unlike other sugary gums, this will reduce cavities and it is just as flavorful, if not more so than most gums.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: This is a great product
review/text: I tried to find chewing gum at my local supermarket that did NOT contain aspartame, or some other man-made sugar substitute.  I never was able to.  I checked my local health food store and they sell Spry gum and Spry toothpaste.  The gum is just as good tasting as any major brand, and it doesn't hurt my stomach.  It doesn't become ultra sticky like major brand gum either, so I can give it to my 3-year-old and 1-year-old without worry.  The flavor doesn't last too long, but chewing it is good for your teeth, so I don't have a problem going through it quicker than major brand gum.  One of the best parts - it's cheaper than major brand gum.  I get a pack of 10 for $0.89 from my local food store.  The others cost $1.10 at the supermarket.<br />I also tried their toothpaste and I love it.  I use it everyday.  It's safe for my little ones too.  It says right on the label that there's nothing to worry about if the toothpaste is swallowed, because it is not harmful since the product is fluoride-free and all natural.  I highly recommend Spry products - especially for families.

review/text: Being a gum addict, I go through a pack a day. Sugar does a number on your teeth, so I prefer sugar-free... or I did, until I read how many cancer causing ingredients the leading gum brands have. You might as well smoke ;-). That's where SPRY comes in... made with Xylitol, a natural sugar derivative (and not `natural' like Splenda) it has a long lasting flavor and good texture. The only problem I ran into is that the consistency degrades after about 30 minutes of chewing.<br /><br />All in all, for a 30 min gum fix, Spry is #1.

review/summary: Not Gluten Free enough...
review/text: Even though there is a statement right on the front of these packages of gum that claims "Gluten Free", I don't believe this gum really is.  I bought a pack of Peppermint from the health food store that my daughter and I both chewed (we are GF/Celiac) and we BOTH reacted to this gum.  We both tried it again a few days later, thinking perhaps it was something else we had eaten, considering this gum says Gluten Free right on the front.  The reaction was WORSE the second time around!!!  This company sources their Xylitol from China, and almost all the companies I looked at online that you can purchase Xylitol from also make lots of Wheat Gluten----so I am assuming some sort of cross contamination at the source of production in China, for which this Spry company does not test for!  They are obviously just assuming that the product is 'naturally' gluten free and taking unreliable China's word for it----at the expense of customers with Celiac disease who get sick from this product.  Very disappointed.

review/summary: Loses flavor FAST; most likely not worth it
review/text: Ever since Trident White changed their "formula" to create a better flavor (which I do not care for at all), I've been on the search for a newer, better sugar-free gum. My dentist recommended Spry, so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's pricier than most of the sugarfree gums I frequent, but it came recommended by an oral expert, so I figured it would be worth a try.<br /><br />NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Literally, after less than 4 minutes, the flavor is completely gone, and the gum itself reverts to a stale, slightly metallic, tough-to-chew state of existence. I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?<br /><br />Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.<br /><br />Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards "No Thanks" is the fact that it is not worth its value.<br /><br />This is USEFUL information for those who want to chew gum to freshen their breath, or prolong the feeling of minty goodness in their mouth for more than just a couple of minutes!

It hasn't worked too well for me.<br /><br />I do like the spearmint flavor, but it only lasts for a few minutes. (After that it has kind of a chemical flavor that doesn't taste good.)  I do like chewing this gum after meals; it works great to freshen things up.<br /><br />This gum feels really small in my mouth.  Maybe two pieces would be better?<br /><br />BUY THIS: if you want to freshen your breath after meals, if you only want to chew gum for a couple minutes, and maybe if you want to share gum with kids (since the xylitol is better than sugary gums and artificial sugars are pretty scary).<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS: if you want to chew your gum for very long.

review/text: I was looking for a gum with xylitol and found lots of good reviews on this one. It has more xylitol than some other gums, such as Trident.<br /><br />Overall, it's just OK. I'll finish off what I purchased, but I'll also be looking at other gums with xylitol.<br /><br />After chewing for a few seconds, I noticed the gum feels very small, which makes it less satisfying to chew. As a comparison, the tiny Trident gum I used to chew felt almost twice as large in my mouth as this Spry gum. Not a huge deal, but if you have a large mouth, you may need/want to chew two pieces at a time, which increases the cost.<br /><br />Good:<br />Contains more xylitol than some other gums, such as Trident.<br />Good flavor (while it lasts).<br /><br />Not so great:<br />Flavor lasts less than 30 seconds. Still tastes ok after flavor is gone.<br />Individual piece of gum seems very small after chewing.

review/summary: Just OK ... For Xylitol, I recommend Ice Breakers Ice Cube instead ...
review/text: If it wasn't for dentally beneficial ingredient Xylitol in this gum, this gum would be 2 stars.  The gum was small; had to chew two to get the same size feel as National brand sugarless gums. The flavor faded quickly and had slightly bitter after taste.<br /><br />If you want gum with Xylitol, Ice Breakers Ice Cube in any flavor is the gold standard in my book.

review/summary: I'm not a dentist, nor do I play one on TV
review/text: I am not going to review why Xylitol is great or beneficial. I am not going to comment on the effects of chewing gum to reduce cavities, lose weight, catch the eye of the person on the subway you are attracted to, or eliminate planters warts on the bottoms of your feet. I will not go into the wonders of this gum, and how I keep packs in my desk at work, in my car, and under my pillow for those late night cravings.<br /><br />However, I will state that this is a great price to pay for twenty packs of this gum. In the stores, this gum runs about $2 a pack. The price I paid through Amazon is less than 75 cents per pack. I no longer have to feel guilty when I take that second piece because sometimes one piece just isn't enough.<br /><br />This is a great, guilt free, chemical free, wonderful tasting and long lasting gum. If there were just some way to harness the power from gum chewers' jaws into a clean energy...

review/summary: fresh and good flavor
review/text: I got the gum because my dentist recommended it to keep cavities at bay. It arrived quickly and was in good condition. The gum was fresh and had a good cinnimon flavor. The intense flavor didn't last any longer than most gum. I'm chewing it after meals when I am not near a toothbrush and during the day when I would normally reach for a snack. So far I have no complaints but I have not been to a dentist to see if there is a difference in my teeth condition.

review/summary: Great Deal and Good for You!
review/text: This gum contains xylitol, a sugar that the "good" bacteria in your mouth like, so they can thrive and can help you avoid cavities. One piece chews down pretty small and loses its flavor fairly quickly but I only chew it to clean my mouth. It does its job and this pack is a good deal because you would find 1 pack for .99$ in stores.

review/summary: Eliminates bad breath, tastes great, handy packaging
review/text: I was researching dental health one day and found lots of evidence proving how great xylitol is for oral health and teeth (although it is deadly for dogs so beware of leaving it lying around and don't litter!  Unfortunately, over the counter gums have other ingredients that counteract or nullify xylitol's positive effects.<br /><br />Spry is a great example of a gum that is really pure in its delivery of xylitol.  If you get into the habit of chewing a piece or two after you eat (I prefer chewing two pieces at a time to extend the flavor) it's meant to eliminate the bad bacteria in your mouth and prevent acidic foods from doing damage, leading to staining and cavities on your teeth.  Plus, Spry is very inexpensive!<br /><br />An added benefit I noticed is that it increases salivation, which is very good for me since I am prone to having a somewhat dry mouth.<br /><br />I love the peppermint flavor- this gum doesn't give you an aftertaste and leaves my mouth and breath fresher than they've ever been in my life. I agree with other reviewers that the gum does lose the majority of flavor after a few minutes of chewing, but it's not unpleasant until about 30 minutes into chewing, which is better for your jaw anyway. I have not had any abdominal discomfort at all from chewing this gum.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product

review/text: Good product! If you are set on chewing gum this is the stuff. You can feel the difference, teeth stay cleaner between brushings. Sugar sweetened gum will degrade your dental health if you are a constant gum chewer like me. I just hope they don't find out something seriously wrong with xylitol down the road. ;)

review/summary: Good, but could last longer.
review/text: I'm a gum fanatic, but usually I'm used to the sugary versions, or else the very minty alternatives.  I'm trying Spry for the first time, and I think it's a fantastic gum, but I feel the flavor runs out very quickly, and it also comes in very small portions.  The packaging is also frustrating, because I'm used to pushing into the tab for the gum to come out, but the packet that actually holds the gum is small compared to the sleeve, so you have to shake it out.

review/summary: Good for you but doesn't last long
review/text: I like Spry because I know it's good for me, but the gum size is meager, and the flavor, while good, doesn't last long. So I pop in two pieces at a time and just enjoy it while I can. I kind of assume that the reason it doesn't last is because it doesn't have a lot of the nasty chemicals in it to preserve it, so I am willing to accept the tradeoff for better health!

review/summary: Not very great
review/text: This product has xylitol in it and its useful/good for your teeth, I get it. But, at the end of the day I chew gum to freshen my breath up. The flavor of Spry lasts only for 3-5 minutes. Then you are basically chewing on flavorless gum. You need to chew atleast 2 at a time to feel the flavor. This product might be good for your teeth if used extensively but honestly I think its overrated. You will do as well with any sugarless gum like Trident, which has xylitol too and lasts much longer. Not to mention that its expensive too as compared to Trident or any other sugarless alternatives.

review/text: This is a Herdez product, which means its also a Hormel product. And while I'm<br />not a fan of Hormel, the Herdez subsidiary is still doing it right!<br /><br />I was reluctant to try this sauce cause I had its twin brother (Chipotle) and<br />thought it was terrible. This stuff however has earned a place in the cabinet<br />for its flavor and versatility.<br /><br />First of all this sauce is clearly made from fully ripened Jalapeno peppers, so<br />this sauce has fruity more mature flavor, rather than the alfalfa-like greenish<br />flavor of the unripened green jalapenos. The carrots and sugar also cut the normal<br />bite of the jalapenos, and give this a very mild faintly sweet flavor.<br /><br />Its more complex than your typical Mexican style sauces, and the frutiness of the<br />chilis really shine through with a hint of lemony/herbal flavor in the background.<br />The consistency is also fairly thick which means its perfect for tacos, beans,<br />and any other Mexican dish you can think of. Also works well on burgers and as an<br />additive to off the shelf barbecue sauce. 4 Scovies!

I give it three stars for effort because he does eat it reluctantly.

review/text: Kitty Kaviar (or Delicious Fishes in my house) is the favored treat of my finicky felines.  As long as they like fish, they're guaranteed to love KK because it is all tuna all the time.  That's a good thing--no adulteration from carbs that cats cannot assimilate anyway.  Kitty Kaviar is also a great gift for cat lovers.  I recommend the smaller size for this purpose just in case their cat is not a fish fan.

review/text: This is the one treat that our two cats (who are 1-yr-old twin brothers) never tire of. All I have to do is tap on the lid and they forget they are cats and fly like birds to get their kitty kaviar. One has very severe issues with trust due to his rough transition from being feral to domestic (as well as possible raccoon raids on their infancy nest), but he can put that aside for the kitty kaviar. Although, he doesn't like kitty kaviar enough to go willingly into his crate like his brother does.

I know it was not as smelly when they liked it & went kokoo over it.  It was more potent smelling when freshly opened.<br />  But my cats are odd, they like sticky buns, cake, marshmallows, Mexican food & sandwiches with all the fixings besides there normal diet of Diet Eukanuba & canned cat food.

review/summary: Our Cats Say 5 Stars.
review/text: We have a couple cats. One is three, the other is four. Both are very nice pets to have around the house. We feed our cats partly soft food and partly pellets. Both foods are of a somewhat expensive prescription variety because of a urinary tract blockage one of the cats developed. The cats do not seem to particularly like the food. Given the choice, they'd take Trader Joe's tuna. However, day after day, it's the same old same old. Do the cats get bored? Well, they don't show it if they do. But we try to add a few minor treats from time to time, just in case. My wife found these Kitty Kaviar things at a local pet store. Well, they smell disgusting. Somewhat like an aging fish market. However, the cats are just delighted with the treat and each small sample supplied seems to disappear almost instantly. It's an interesting product and the cats love it!<br /><br />Gary Peterson
