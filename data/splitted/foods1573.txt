review/summary: Yip yap Smells like C**P
review/text: I just got a tin from the local pet store because my pit has some pretty bad breath now and again. I first opened the tin with the "Now with TALKING BONES!" )meaning that they are like the chalky heart candies we get around February) and I was over whelmed with how bad it smelled. The mints smelt terrible. and they were of a brown spotty color and not like the white color you see on the box, see attached photo. Now looking in retrospect maybe this batch has gone bad. Anyway I gave one to my dog and she eats everything and anything you put in front of her and she instantly spit out the treat. I handed her another and again the same. She would not go near the third and final one. How can something worse the her breath make it smell nice?

review/text: Although I don't know if these actually function as "breath mints" I DO know that all I have to say is "Yip-Yap" and my 3 dogs come running!  The shape is adorable, facilitating their gently taking one end of the "bone."  This product is so good that I've shared it with 2 friends who now love it, as do their dogs!  It's a great treat.

review/summary: Dog Hates Them...
review/text: My dog doesn't have a real problem with breath, but I got these cheap off the clearance rack and wanted to try them.  Unfortunately, Luna hates them.  I give them to her and she spits them out.  The only time she actually ate one was the first time I gave them to her.  Anyway, they look and smell good, but are pointless because my dog refuses to eat them.

review/text: I first bought yipyaps as they are nearly protein free, and my dog was on a low protein diet for liver failure.  But it turned out that all 5 dogs love these yipyaps!  They're cute little crunchy treats, kinda like the old Pez candies but shaped like little bones.  Now I keep a tin in my purse for treats at the vet's office or wherever.  It's great to have a purse/pocket sized treat that never rubs off on your hands with stinky greasy crumbs, like other products.

review/summary: Five Barks for Yip Yaps!
review/text: Halitosis was a major problem for me, especially when it came to socializing with fellow hound dogs.  Peeyoo!  was the general reaction I'd get as soon as I'd open my mouth to sweet talk the ladies.  It wasn't until my uncle gave me a piece of Yip Yap Breath Fresheners when my life took a sudden change for the better.  I chewed it cautiously, I still don't trust green tea, and was pleasantly surprised to feel that fresh tingly scent jackhammering away at my nasty halitosis.  Yip Yap Breath Fresheners are prepared with parsley and rosemary, and, yes, green tea, and cooked with liver.  They're shaped like miniature dog bones, though I'd prefer femur shaped bones, these miniature dog bones are shaped in the 'traditional dog bone design.'  Yip Yap Breath Fresheners also contain 1.5% crude protein, which is enough protein to last me an entire month!  My uncle then tossed me a frisbee, and I chased it down and caught it with my mouth.  I was surprised, not to mention impressed, with my newfound ability of chasing down hovering frisbees and seizing it with my sparkling teeth.  Oh, yeah, halitosis is a thing of the past.  Now, it's all about the Yip Yap.

review/summary: Mix in with other juices, especially citrus
review/text: Passionfruit by itself isn't as interesting as what the flavor does when mixed with other juices, especially citrus, and a little goes a very long ways. It doesn't go so well with apple juice.<br /><br />One of these small bottles should be enough to add an interesting taste to about 2-4 quarts of citrus-flavored beverage. It may remind you a bit of Hawaiian punch, but you can mix it much less sweet to adult tastes.

review/text: I bought this juice to make a drink my wife and I had while in Bora Bora, French Polynesia. It was called "Tahiti Drink" and the ingredients called for passion fruit amongst other things. The juice was priced very reasonably and arrived quickly and well packaged. The juice itself was delicious. One reviewer stated it was too sweet, I dont believe this to be true at all. It does have some sweetness to it but by no means is it too sweet. It is very refreshing, has a good balance of acidity and sweetness and did the job in recreating the Tahiti drink.

review/summary: Make your own vitamin water-like beverage.
review/text: My favorite brand of vitamin water has been discontinued so I have been on a mission to create a drink of my own. In experimenting, I tried the popular brand of guava concentrate in a can, but it is so full of sugar that I just can't justify using it, even watered down. I decided to find an alternative guava product, and bought this one. It comes in square cardboard containers, which is great for storage and recyling. It's made with cane sugar as opposed to the high fructose muck. It's also inexpensive, compared to the canned nectar. If I have any complaint it's that it isn't sweet enough, but I find adding an artificial sweetener helps with that. Guava has a rich grassy aftertaste, which takes some getting used to -- especially if you're new to the taste. For those who love fresh guava, they will LOVE this product.<br /><br />With all my experimenting, I discovered that I also really like the flavor of passion fruit. If you're interested, here's my beverage recipe:<br /><br />In a 24 ounce glass container, add:<br />1/2 cup guava or passionfruit nectar<br />1 pkg of sweet n low (or whatever you like)<br />2 tbls of Torani syrup (mango or passionfruit, etc.)<br />then fill container with cold water and shake well.<br />Serve over ice.<br />Makes 4 - 5 servings<br /><br />It tastes better than the vitamin water I thought I couldn't live without, it's less expensive, I'm not throwing away all those plastic bottles anymore, AND I can control the amount of sugar, type of artificial sweetener, and the amount of filtered water I use to dilute it.

I improve it by adding some ground pepper and a touch of nutmeg, even a few drops of scotch on occasion.  I wish I had ordered more before the price went up.  It was a good deal at first,  less expensive than buying it at the Scottish shops in N. Carolina.  I buy it much less often since the price increase.

review/summary: Great coffee, the perfect blend. Wake up to Starbucks flavor in your home!.
review/text: This is by far one of the best breakfast blends, I have tried.  The beans chosen are a perfect meld, with a low acidity.  Starbuck's did their job right in selecting beans for their taste rather than supply.  A typical pattern in many coffee house brands is to throw together a low grade more plentiful bean with a few mid to high range beans and then pawn it off as a quality brew at a higher price.  This often results in a coffee blend without taste.  Starbucks, however, did their taste test on this blend and came out with a true winner.<br />The beans are roasted much lighter than your typical Starbucks type beyond french roast, this also helps in creating a coffee that is less acidic.  Yet while lightly roasted the beans have been roasted enough so that the oils will be released when put through a drip maker or coffee press, a problem usually encountered with lighter roast.  Their is a defint natural sweetness in the beans that are enhanced with the use of fat free milk, the lactose sugar of the milk bean the only additional sweetener need.  A full fat milk or cream would mask the complexity of the sutler flavors here and leave you with coffee that is on the taste par with any store brand stale canned bean type.<br />This coffee's blend and flavor would make it great choice for a hearty comforting breakfast of bacon and eggs where the flavor of the foods are enhanced by a milder coffee that leaves the food as the star and not an attention grabbing bitter coffee.

I decided to try a couple different types to see what I liked.  My dislike of this Starbucks variety might be exacerbated by the fact that the coffee I tried just before this one (Lavazza Qualita Rossa) was so good.  In comparison, this blend has a very harsh and bitter taste.  I won't be buying this again and wish I hadn't purchased a three-pack.

review/text: Star Bucks coffee is without a doubt the best coffee in the world. I do like the smell of star Bucks coffee when I return from walking my dogs.<br /><br />The smell of good coffee covers the room. Then when I take the first sip, I know it is time to start my day.

review/summary: Ok Coffee, lacks the Starbuck's "Flair"
review/text: Rating coffee is hard as it's like rating a piece of art - highly subjective. As background, I love the strength of Starbucks coffee as compared to Dunkin, Eight O'Clock, Pete's, and Target Brand. The issue here is that I thought I was getting the House blend (Starbucks changed their packaging) and I got the Breakfast blend. Now this was my error, so I thought I should try it. It was rather weak and had little character. Wasn't full bodied at all. Seemed like the bottom fell out of this blend. For my tastes, I had to add more coffee and just to bring this to where it was somewhat bearable.<br /><br />Now, there may be those who like this type and they would give it 5/5, for me, the 3/5 resulted from the loss of flavor and character. Not that it was milder, it just didn't taste good to me. I've tried the whole Starbucks spectrum of coffee and while I may not like the french roast, I can taste the "flair" associated with it. This was different. Like making clam chowder with 1% milk, something's missing.

review/summary: Starbucks Breakfast Blend
review/text: Tried this Starbucks blend a few months ago, and it's the best coffee I've had in a long time.<br />Even started ordering it from Amazon.  It's not bitter and tastes great when you make it strong.<br />Other Starbucks blends I've tried, like French Roast, were too over-powering and bitter.<br />To me there's a difference between a strong coffee and a strong-tasting coffee.<br />A strong-tasting coffee can be made weak, almost see-through, yet still have an over-powering taste.<br />Don't like this!<br />I prefer a strong coffee that no light can pass through, and it doesn't have to be a dark-roast bean.<br />If you haven't tried the Breakfast Blend - give it a try.

review/summary: It stunk and tasted just as bad
review/text: I purchased this from my local market and boy, am I sorry to have done that.  This particular Starbuck's blend is awful to say the least.  I knew it wasn't going to end well when I opened the bag and was nearly overcome by the nasty aroma.  To me, coffee is supposed to smell good as well as taste good.<br /><br />I decided that maybe my nose was deceiving me.  So I brewed a couple of cups worth (I make my coffee at night for the next day) and waited thinking that perhaps it would taste better than it smelled.  Once it finished brewing, I took a sip of it black.  UGH!  I thought maybe sugar will help.  NOPE.  My next trick was to add vanilla flavored creamer.  NADDA!<br /><br />It seems as if this is a smokey blend.  The taste is very heavy and not at all appealing to me.  I think I expected a lighter, smoke free and perhaps more tangy flavor.<br /><br />Now I have to try to give this away....(sigh)

review/summary: Jelly Belly's are the Best
review/text: Needed some bulk quantity jelly beans to fill small jars for baby shower favors.  Buying them this way saved a lot of money over buying them by the pound at the local candy store.  As stated in another review, the jelly beans just come in an unlined cardboard box.  This seemed a bit odd, but there were 2 sheets of wax paper, I guess to prevent dust, etc from getting into the box through the top and bottom.  Not much else to say, they're Jelly Belly's at about half the cost of the local guy!

review/text: Is it me or am I not the only one who actually loves the flavor of olives? I have been eating olives since the early fifties and I love the flavor of those little beasts. I've been purchasing olives here on Amazon for some time now and have come to realize that an awful lot of olives are flavored with "stuff" that, basically, overwhelms the actual olive flavor. These olives are in that category. They taste fine, but they don't actually taste like olives. They taste more like garlic and lemon. Middle eastern olives are often flavored with lime, garlic, lemon and hot spices. I like all those spices, but I like the flavor of olives. These olives don't have that flavor.<br /><br />So, they are great as Mediterranean or middle eastern olives, but not as "real" olives. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.<br /><br />NT

review/summary: Too powdery, doesn't stick.
review/text: I make air popped popcorn without butter.  My hope was to add some flavor to the popcorn without adding calories.  This product is spicy and tastes okay, but its too powdery to be useful.  First off, it is so finely ground that it doesn't stick to the dry popcorn.  Even worse, it tends to float in the air and I end up inhaling it (which is unpleasant).  I think for this to work I'd have to wet the popcorn in some way (with water or butter?) to get it to stick, but I'm not looking for that level of effort.  I now use a low calorie 'butter' spray instead.  Much easier.

review/summary: BEWARE!!!
review/text: I air-pop my corn at home, sprinkle salt and eat them in a "healthy" way without butter.<br /><br />When I sprinkle this on "dry" freshly popped corn, the powder is so fine that the powder either goes into my nose (when I breath out while eating, which we usually do as humans, try holding your breath while chewing something it's not natural) making me cringe, or into my throat (air vent) making me cough/choke.<br /><br />I'm guessing they expect me to eat this with layers and layers of butter so the "powder" doesn't get sucked into my nose/throat, but I eat my popcorn without butter because it is healthier!<br /><br />So now, for me to use this seasoning I had to use olive oil (instead of butter, as it is healthier than butter) and place them into a ziplock and shake them.  The problem is that I can't just add a little, I have to add a lot of oil so it covers all the popcorn.<br /><br />So if you don't mind 10 pumps of--movie theater style--butter then this might work excellently for you.  If you're looking to eat your butter without butter or oil, then this will make you choke, sneeze, gag, cough and make you frustrated you can't even enjoy your own popcorn.<br /><br />If you want to try something that is crazy spicy and really addictive, put some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R6HC2A">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red 5oz.</a> and shake them up.  This is how a lot of people in Brazil eat their popcorn (with hot sauce) and you'll be crying because it's so spicy/hot but you won't be able to stop eating because it is so addictive good!<br /><br />I wanted to give 1 STAR but I guess majority of Americans eat with butter so I gave it a fair 3 STAR because with butter/oil the product works... without them, omg.... I think the 5 packs I didn't open are going to be a White Elephant gift for Christmas next year.

review/summary: Wonderful Cereal
review/text: It really stinks that eating the healthiest foods costs the most but in my opinion, it's worth it.  I love these cereals.  The first case I bought from amazon was the original and I wound up eating it for breakfast, snacks, lunch, whenever, without milk or adding anything... I love the crunch and the taste. I actually ate the whole case in about 2 weeks and very little else... and it is amazing that I didn't gain weight, my bms were much better, and I had great energy and felt well- my body was craving it.  Try that on Coco Puffs, Cornflakes, and even any of the other "healthy" cereals in the healthfood stores!<br /><br />I actually make my own sprouted grain breads and crackers which I could easily break up to make this type of cereal- there is nothing in the world like it, but it takes 2 days of sprouting and a couple of hours to complete the food processing and spreading on the baking sheet process, and then 3-4 hours of low-heat baking.  So when I don't have time to do this, a very close second are the Ezekiel products (their bread, english muffins, cereals, and pastas).<br /><br />Anyone who makes health their top priority will eat very little of non-sprouted grain products (flour products).  For those interested, Amazon sells a book called the Essene Gospel of Peace which contains writings found in the Vatican archives- in this little book, Jesus teaches his followers how to make bread, and it has nothing to do with taking the dry grain and grinding it up into flour and using yeast- he teaches them to soak the grain, let the sun bring it to life, grind it up alive, and then let the sun bake it.  That makes the only truly living, healthful breads and cereals.<br /><br />Yes, these products will feel and taste different than most are used to, but the more one eats this type of real food, the more the body starts remembering and then one begins to really enjoy the taste and textures because they equate to life and health.  :)

review/text: Being a diabetic, I have used their breads for years. Most diabetics don't cut flour from their diet. They simply don't understand that there is no difference between sugar and flour in your body. Anyway, I just happened to be shopping with my wife and came across a display of this cereal. I didn't know Food For Life even made other products. I grabbed two boxes. Making a long story short, this is simply the best cereal a diabetic can have. It tastes great with no sugar, fat free almond milk. I feel so much better eating their products. Thank you Food For Life! Your name says it all!................Lou

review/summary: Good Tasting, Good For You.
review/text: A friend recommended Ezekiel and I'm glad she did. Just before that, I decided I really need to eat better and have been trying to ween myself off as many processed foods as possible. This cereal is a great choice for that because the ingredients are all natural with no weird chemicals.<br /><br />On a separate note, I love carbs but they don't love me back. My body burns them up too quickly, and then find myself in that droopy 'low blood sugary' feeling. What's nice about this cereal is it allows me to eat carbs (38g / serving) but I never get that blood sugar dip because the sugar content is low (less than 1 g / serving) and the protein is high (8g /serving).<br /><br />The cereal texture is very small grains, with the paper-thin almond slices being the largest things you'll see in the bowl. Every bite is super crunchy.<br /><br />I have tried it in milk, but didn't really like it that way. Instead, I use a fruit variety of kefir, which is sort of like a creamy yogurt drink. I've tried Ezekiel with peach, pomegranite and mixed berry kefir varieties, and it is a tasty combination. If you want to try this, keep in mind that kefir is a bit thicker than milk. I prefer just enough kefir to moisten the cereal so that the grains remain the star of the show.<br /><br />Ezekiel is a very healthy cereal, perhaps the healthiest one available. It isn't going to taste like kids cereal because kids cereal isn't super-healthy. Straight-out-of-the-box Ezekiel with milk probably is hard core cold turkey if you're reforming from bad eating habits (like I am!). But, with the addition of a little fruit or some almond milk or flavored kefir, you'll find it's an enjoyable meal that also is doing good things for your body.

I would recommend a little honey and mik and warming it up for a 45 sec.

I like blueberries and bananas, or blueberries and strawberries, or bananas and honey.<br /><br />If you're trying to stay away from white/refined flour and white/refined sugar and other really bad carbs, but you need some type of grain carb, or you need something that you can eat quickly in the mornings, or you just really like cereal and can't give it up, go for this.<br /><br />It taste's good and it really is good FOR you.

review/text: Ezekiel cereal is just plain delicious. Eat it with fruit, yogurt, or anything else you can think of. I eat mine with almond milk. I like to let it soak for a couple minutes to soften. Much softer than Grapenuts and much more flavor. It is much better than any of its competitors. Of course no one else is specifically using sprouted grain. I was trying to eat healthy and was eating oatmeal. However, oatmeal never carried me through to lunch without feeling ravenous. Ezekiel cereal keeps me feeling full.

review/summary: Best cereal on the market, and only one with a complete protein nutrition
review/text: This cereal is surprisingly delicious.  I love most of Food for Life's products, but this cereal takes the cake.  If you are into nutrition and exercise, and you love eating cereal with milk in the morning, go with this brand.  It has a complete protein system, what else could you ask for?  I hope to see more options for a complete protein cereal on the market in the future to see how my expectations can change, but I don't see any other brand competing for some time.  Although, having a five star review on Amazon will encourage competitors to step up and deliver the quality food people deserve, but there may not be huge profit margins in it for them, so we'll see.  It is a niche market, but the company is delivering properly.  I love their bread too, but the cereal wins!  P.S. Get the Almond because the raisins in the Raisin are sort of stale, and the flax seed in the Flax is not ground up, so you don't get the real nutritional value.  With Almond you get the value of the nuts.  I just add some fresh ground flax in there myself and enjoy!

review/summary: Stop the sugar madness
review/text: Of course, my testimony here is going to be just anecdotal evidence, but about 6 months ago I changed my diet to reflect that of what is outlined in the books "Healthy at 100" (John Robbins) and "The China Study" (T. Colin Campbell), both of which advocate a high-complex-carb, low-fat, low-protein (yes I said low-protein - against the grain of all the low-carb craze diets) diet full of whole grains, vegetables and fruits with relatively no added sugars, oils or fats. When you start removing all this extra nonsense sugar from the SAD (Standard American Diet) it tastes a little bland at the beginning, but that is only because we have been eating so unnaturally for so long. After a little while you come to appreciate the subtle flavors of the grains, and also come to appreciate the natural sweetness and taste of other fresh fruits and vegetables. (Last week I tried a bit of some Frozt thing from Starbucks that my wife ordered and nearly choked - it was so cloyingly sweet.) This is a great cereal - thanks Ezekiel!

When I first opened it I noticed it was very firm and granular.  However after a few minutes in milk it was ready to eat. I also tried it hot by placing a bowl with milk in the  microwave for 1 1/2 minutes.  It seemed to unlock the full flavor and was delicious. I now eat it this way. I shared some with a neighbor and they liked it and the Bible story that accompanied the box.

review/summary: Golden Flax All Day :)
review/text: This was the first kind my family and I bought.  Lucky for me I didn't let it stop me from trying the golden flax flavor.  OMG - I eat it for breakfast, lunch, snack - it's the best way to "cheat" when you get those after hour urges.  It's sprouted grains and very nutritious with a good amount of protein.  I have it after my superfood/fruit smoothie in the morning and have a lightness about me all day that I haven't had in a while.  It makes it easy for me to eat 5 x's a day and make healthy lunch choices at my sedentary job where there is free notsohealthy food offered all the time.  Even my 12 y/o daughter who hates lentils loved this and was VERY surprised when I told her what she was eating, lol.  We both hated the almond and love the golden flax but everyone's taste buds are different.  FYI, the texture of the golden flax reminds me of grapenuts cereal. Can't remember much about the almond except that we hated it and the full box is still in my kitchen and we are currently working on box # 2 of the golden flax.  Very happy and appreciative to find something that is so healthy taste so good.  Hope this helps!<br /><br />Love & Light,<br /><br />Angel

review/text: Let me set the scene for you: three felines in the house, purebred, rescue, and recalcitrant- take your pick! Ages ranging from kitten to curmudgeon. All three are picky eaters - they all subscribe to the same Rule of Tongue: if they like a food it's one paw up and a proud member of The Clean Plate Club - nothing left behind!  If they don't, well, it's a replay of "Just Walk Away, Renee" - disgust, revulsion, and they vote with their feet. In all three cases here, it's one paw up, Club memberships, and total annihilation when it comes to Evo Duck for cats. Of course, ymmv, but I think it's worth a try if you aren't put off by the price, and aren't dealing with existing puss problems like diabetes, renal failure, and obesity, where a more restrictive diet may be in order. For us, it's a hit!

So I picked this up, knowing that Evo is a really good brand (like Wellness).<br /><br />It is one of the most disgusting smelling cat foods I've ever had the displeasure of using.  I was gagging while trying to put it into the bowl.  My cat took one taste and walked away, and chose to eat nothing until I replaced it 12 hours later with some dry food.  I would try another flavor of their food - since I know it's high quality - but I wouldn't buy the duck flavor again.

review/summary: Best Chicken Stock Ever!
review/text: This IS the best chicken stock ever, but here's what I want to tell you about my experience with Amazon. I ordered a six pack of beef stock and a six pack of chicken stock at the same time. The total was $45 something. They were shipped separately. The chicken stock was damaged early in the shipping process. I contacted Amazon and they said the $22 something(I don't remember exactly)would be refunded. I purchased these through Amazon as the seller, which eliminated the shipping and handling charge with my Prime membership. I guess that experience with the damaged shipping sort of scared Amazon away from selling it again, because now, the chicken stock is no longer available from them. I have to use a different seller=pay shipping/handling. If they think I'm going to pay 22+ plus the $13 shipping when I just got the beef stock for a little over $22.00, well that's just not going to happen!<br /><br />This is not to degrade this seller(Bangella, I think it is). They are probably great and do a good job. The stock is the best. Buy it. Just try to get a good deal.

review/text: You can buy one of these at wawa for under $2. So why pay so much on he for them. $3.42 is crazy to pay.

review/summary: A new favourite juice
review/text: Nantucket Nectars Red Plum is one of the best tasting juices I have ever had. The taste is quite surprising at first, until one realises that it is because it tastes EXACTLY like a plum. It is, therefore, like drinking a plum. If you are a fan of the fruit, you will love the juice.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I love the taste of this salt.  It works in all my recipes and is wonderful on raw veggies like cucumbers and tomatoes.  I was very happy to learn that it was also healthy for me. It is in large chunks however, so you have to grind it if you are using it in baking.  I used a mortar and pestle and it worked easily.  I think it's cool that 2% of the profit of this salt goes to the Dolphin Project.

review/summary: Great taste, beautiful crystal!
review/text: My wife and I use this everyday in our dinners.  The crystal is a clean white finishing salt and with 33%lower sodium then table salt and 2% of our magnesium and calcium it is super healthy.  I've used it in my water during workouts (just a little pinch) for a good electrolyte boost.  i'm a big fan of this product and honestly can't recommend it enough.  It reminds me of a higher quality fleur de sel.

review/summary: white lambrusco
review/text: I tried this wine once on a whim for something different. I've always been more a fan of red wine in general and the traditional Lambrusco red is a staple at our house...but I fell in love with this the first time I sipped it...it is slightly sweet but not overpoweringly sweet...goes wondeful with just about anything. If you like Lambrusco red you should definately try White Lambrusco.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I bought this at a local farmer's specialty market and I was thoroughly impressed. Having an affinity for cheeses, especially of this variety, made it easier to pick up on the quality of this product. It's rich and very flavorful.

review/summary: A small taste of heaven
review/text: Pierre Robert is similar to Brie but with a smoother, creamier taste. The best way to enjoy it is on toast points with slices of strawberry, the tang and sweetness of the berries accenting and enhancing the cheese's saltiness. You may think that the price is a little high, but I can assure you that you'll be more than satisfied with a wheel of Pierre Robert on your party table -- or just enjoy it yourself and drown in decadence.

review/summary: Old Points, Bold Flavor
review/text: These individually wrapped thin mints are super tasty!  They don't taste like "diet food" and just one or two completely satisfy my sweet tooth every time.  The only problem is the 1 point value (per mint) shown on the bag is based on the old Weight Watchers system, not the new PointsPlus system.  So if you're currently on the WW program and tracking your points, beware.
