review/summary: Be Careful Here!
review/text: I am doing this review simply as a 'heads-up' for those who may think this is coconut oil for cooking - it is not!<br /><br />I use coconut oil in my kitchen for cooking - this came up on an Amazon search for coconut oil, but it's not for cooking, it's a hair oil.  Yes, that's clearly stated in the Product Features, but some folks may not see that.  It may not be eatable, for there's something in it that is keeping it from solidifying at room temp as normal coconut oil does - perhaps a chemical.  But as you can see, Amazon is treating it as a 'Grocery' item, and that alone will cause some to order it as a food item.  In my opinion, it should be labeled as a hair oil, and more clearly stated in Amazon's description.<br /><br />Be careful.

review/summary: Think Big
review/text: The first time I ordered this product, I only got a small amount. This time I went big! It has a wonderful smell. Great for cooking.. adds a great flavor (the smell goes away when cooking). It smells NOTHING like coco-butter--which I hate. It really does smell like a fresh cracked coconut.<br /><br />It also feels great on the skin after shaving or exfoliating. A small bit on hair after washing keeps it smelling wonderful and shining.<br /><br />It does come frozen and is a solid at room temp. Just place it outside or on a heater vent for  a few moments to make it fluid.

review/text: I thought it was so cool that there could be a reusable straw that you could see through so you know if it's dirty or if whatever you're drinking is getting through. Unfortunately, the glass material makes it bulky and hard to not dribble when you're drinking. Also, it's hard to store since I can't put it with my other utensils since it might roll around and break. So yes, I probably wouldn't buy another one but it's fun to use once in a while.

review/summary: Why is this Tea so Special?
review/text: I have drunk "english-blends" of tea in various forms and guises. But being a wee bit Scottish, I tend to like everything in life, "maxed-out".  Almost all tea blends from various companies have FAILED to meet my criterion of "Maximum Tea Experience". Now, along comes Yorkshire Gold tea. Yorkshire Gold tea is carefully blended in North Yorkshire England by Taylors of Harrogate, and part of the real secret to this tea is the company's attention to DETAILS.  Now undoubtedly, such teas like ASSAM (from North-East India) will give you some strength, but not always enough brightness.  "Strength" works well at the Middle and FINISH of the flavour gamut, but initially, it is Brightness which catches your palate's attention and then the Stength simply Underscores it.  It's sort of like playing a huge C chord on a concert piano in double octaves and then you gently add a LOW Contra C.  The deep low note brings out the richness of the chord.  The case is the same here with Yorkshire Gold.  So why Yorkshire Gold and not another brand?  The parent company in Harrogate is a superlative corporation who takes great pains at CONSISTENCY.  The magic is in the Details.  I am actually drinking a cup of Yorkshire Gold RIGHT NOW as I type this, and I can tell you, I have never found a company more consistent, attentive to details, and maddeningly insistent upon excellence.  Through myriads of experiments and counter-experiments, Taylors has discovered what GRABS the tea-drinker's "Gustatory" attention, if you will.  But there's more:  this blend both refreshes and relaxes you like none other.<br />Additionally, there is something here to which coffee drinkers may relate: AROMA.  When I make the loose or bag tea variants, both exude an almost beefy richness in bouquet.  The process of mixing furiously boiling fresh water with the tea invaribly and consistently produces a fine aroma akin to the scent of a British Sunday Lunch where a delectable roast beef is the order of the day.  Rich, piquant, and satisfying.  If your brand of tea does not do ALL that I have noted ... consider a change.

The color, after adding milk, is a beautiful, golden tan.  Each bag will make 2-3 good, large cups of tea, depending upon how strong you prefer your tea; therefore, the cost is comparable to "lesser" teas.  It is also my wife's favorite, and we have tried many different brands over the years.

review/summary: You WIll Never Want to Drink Anything Else
review/text: Many years ago a friend in Eugene, Oregon, told me that if I ever drank Yorkshire Gold, I would never want anything else, and she was right. Today,when a shipment comes into a store, word of mouth makes the boxes disappear fast.  Once, when I asked a cashier where I could find Yorkshire Gold, he went to a back room in the store and came back out, holding the boxes of tea as if it were contraband, looking both ways before he took it to the check stand.  When Yorkshire Gold comes in to a store, there is a run on it, and you can look down the shelf where it was stacked and see a blank spot.  I have heard it is going to be difficult to get this tea in the US, although the tea drinkers in the US are responsible for its great success.

review/text: A Scottish friend introduced me to hot tea with milk 20 years ago.  She started me on PG Tips, which I can take or leave.  I then ordered a lot of different types while trying to find one that suited me.  YG is it - and has been for many years.  It is strong, but one bag will make 2-3 cups depending upon how strong you take it.  While strong, it has a clean, clear flavor - not woody or fruity - just good, ole tea.  I've also tried the red label - not nearly as good as Gold.  I sip others on occasion, but my "every morning" brew will always be YG!!

review/summary: Outstanding tea made even better
review/text: As an avid drinker of Taylors of Harrogate, when I discovered that there was a "Gold" tea of the same brand, I hurriedly purchased it, anticipating being shot into hitherto unknown heights of tea-drinking bliss. I knew when the package arrived, as it descended into my home in a brilliant shaft of light. The package unwrapped and opened itself and a teabag jumped into my waiting cup.<br /><br />My palate revealed that there is a difference in the quality and smoothness of this tea. The tea also presents an exquisite gold colour while steeping in the glass. The question is whether this warrants a purchase at a higher price?  The regular brand, in the red box, is an outstanding tea already and likely the best one can get in the States.<br /><br />There would be no need to feel that life was less lived having only sampled the regular Yorkshire.  Truly, if needing to save money, one could consider themselves a lucky man with buying regular Yorkshire. If your purse contains a little more, then let fortune bestow the privilege of adding this to your daily repertoire.

Yorkshire Gold tea has more flavor and character than most teas.<br /><br />The secret seems to be in the high quality of the teas selected for Yorkshire Gold and in the shape of the tea bag which allows for the tea leaves to spread out more and I think this enhances the ability for a full tea flavor to develop.<br /><br />This tea blend is perfect to steep along with a cinnamon stick. It is strong enough to serve with whipped cream and a dash of nutmeg.<br /><br />The art on the box was painted by Lizzie Sanders and it sets a nice English mood for your tea drinking experience.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Compared to some other loose-leaf black teas I've usually purchased from the Indian markets, this is relatively very rich, fragrant, and not at all bitter. I'm enjoying it immensely and have shared it with coworkers, who also thought it was great. So, take that for what it is: a tea layperson's endorsement. :)

review/summary: Making tea a meaningful experience
review/text: Yorkshire Gold Tea is a consistently high quality product that provides outstanding flavour with each & every cup. It provides satisfaction that meets our expectations of what a "good cup of tea" should be - pleasingly robust but, without a bitter aftertaste. It is the best tea available!

review/summary: Cucumber and green tea are not a good combo
review/text: I gave this product two stars because it did seem to keep unpleasant odors at bay. However, the actual scent of this deodorant was unpleasant itself. It was just an odd smell on the skin. In the applicator, it was fine, but on a few different people ( who rubbed it on their forearms to test), the scent was not a good one. I did not like the way it reacted with me. It also gave me an itchy rash so I had to give up on it. One person said it smelled like urine,not good at all! But I didn't give it one star only because it seemed to do its job by keeping away the BO, I think.

review/text: My wife and I are coffee people fans, with the Jet Fuel and WakeUp call being our very favorite K-cups.  With the WakeUp Call apparently disappearing I tried the Tree Hugger as a potential replacement and am very disappointed.  The coffee is not bad at all, it is just nothing like the other bold offerings from coffee people.  If you like mild, low acid coffee with a subtle flavor, this will probably float your boat.  If you like a strong cup of joe with a lot of flavor and character, or like to brew the 12oz setting, look for a stronger offering.

review/text: Since acquiring a Keurig-type brewer several months ago, I've been sampling, one or two at a time, all of the bold varieties I've been able to find in a K-cup.  I'm in no way a connoisseur of coffee; just like a straightforward, strong, not bitter, cup or two to start my day.  Although not my absolute favorite among the brews I've tried, Tree Hugger ranks near enough to the top of my list for me to say that I'll definitely purchase it again.  Try it and enjoy!<br /><br />Also, because my income is truly "fixed," it's an added bonus that I can purchase this in the 50-pack quantity--much easier to fit into a monthly budget!

review/summary: Best K-cup I've had
review/text: I've tried a lot of K-Cups and this is by far my favorite.  I like a very strong, but not burnt/bitter coffee.  It is hard to find extra bold k-cups that are medium, they are usually dark roast.  This one has been consistently strong (even on the 10oz setting of my Keurig mini).  I am really don't understand the other reviewers who say it is weak.  I know that I am very picky about weak coffee, I can't drink any of the non-bold k-cups as they all taste watery to me, but I've never had a problem with this.  I am wondering if it may be because I have the mini and it brews this k-cup differently than the regular or alternately if some people confuse dark roast with coffee being strong.<br />Anyways this has a very nice strong non-bitter taste, I would say there are hints of chocolate in it.  Very tasty.  I am also a big fan of the Coffee People Donut Shop coffee.

On a side note, the taste is good if you brew a small cup (i.e. 6 oz).

review/text: Coffee People's Tree Hugger Coffee is the favorite at my office. We have cycled through many different Keurigs.

It makes a well-rounded, solid-tasting cup of coffee and continues to be our favorite after every new K-Cup we try.

review/summary: tastes like medium roast with slight burnt/bitter aftertaste
review/text: I am not taking to the taste of this coffee. For me, it had a medium roast flavor, (meaning not too strong), and a slight burnt-bitter aftertaste. There is an ever-so slight hint of cocoa in the flavor, not to it's detriment. I did not want a super-strong coffee, and I was  hoping that this would not harbor the burnt/bitter aftertaste that some of the stronger coffees seem to have. In any case, I am trying to find a medium roast, good smooth coffee to replace the Van Houtte Kenyan k-cups, since they are not being sold now, and Tree Hugger is not the one to fill those shoes for my taste.

Just a tad too weakish and mild on the flavor for my individual tastes.<br /><br />I believe this is supposed to be a 'bold' Kcup. Which doesnt mean a super dark roast..bold refers to them adding I think 20% more coffee per kcup. However, when I shake a kcup compared to all other 'bolds' this doesnt seem to have as much coffee.<br /><br />Plus, it must be a light roast, as well.....<br /><br />Saw some reviews saying this is as bold as it gets...<br /><br />Man.,..if anybody things this is bold/dark/strong/rich.....then dont even try organic, jet fuel, black tiger, wake up etc....cause those are far bolder/stronger/richer/darker with a whole lot more flavor...each very unique as all CP blends are, including tree hugger...I just think tree huggers uniqueness is far to bland all around for me.....

review/summary: Weak Coffee - Green Mountain is Ruining the Coffee People Brand
review/text: Coffee People has always been my favorite brand of coffee.  This is probably because I prefer bold and full bodied coffees.  I was told by one of their employees  their secret is they use 30% - 40% more coffee than the competition.  Since they were acquired by Green Mountain Coffee, who is buying up all the K-cup makers, this brand is going downhill quickly.  It is probably because the profit margin is less because of the extra coffee needed to make their brand special.  They used to have at least 10 different blends, now they are down to four.  They have done away with three of the best flavors, Organic, French Roast, and Santa's Buzz (seasonal).<br /><br />This Tree Hugger seems to be representative of the "new" Coffee People brand, it is weak, bland, and boring.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I'm a big fan of Coffee People bold and dark roasts, and this one is no exception. Tree Hugger has an almost chocolaty taste and well balanced. The fact that it is organic and fair trade is an excellent bonus. Note that I like a splash of milk in my coffee and seldom drink it black (only when I'm out of milk), so I cannot speak for those who take their coffee straight. Nonetheless, for those who like it bold, I recommend Tree Hugger, as well as the other Coffee People bolds: Wake Up Call, Organic, Jet Fuel, and (especially) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZDK">Black Tiger</a>. I drink them all because they are each subtly different from the others.<br /><br />As much as I like Coffee People bolds, my favorite remains <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG">Green Mountain Coffee Revv</a>. And, like many others, I'll be glad to see the return of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L41Y8A">Coffee People Kona Blend</a>. Let's all pray for a good crop in Kona, Hawaii, this year.

review/summary: Yummy Gummy
review/text: These worms taste great.  I share these with my two nephews and they love eating them too.  I asked one of my nephews which was better, these worms or a typical gummy bear from an ordinary company, and he said that these were better because of taste and that it wasn't too hard to chew on.  I chooose getting these because of it's soft chew and taste, which can be found similarly on Black Forest gummy products.  These can melt in the mouth if you keep it in there long enough and with mininal chewing to it.  You get two five pound bags that are sure to last a while.  I would recommend to anyone to try these for themselves.

It wasn't overly sweet, which is always good in my opinion, but there was something missing.  Ritter Sport has a milk chocolate cappucino bar which is better, but is a little sweet for my taste.  Before trying this one, you may want to try the one by Ritter Sport.

review/summary: Carnation Instant Breakfast - Vanilla - Great breakfast-on-the-run
review/text: My nutrionist "prescribed" Carnation Instant Breakfast (CIB) to me many years ago when I was a child. Though I think I have "outgrown" it but I continue to drink it, mostly for breakfast because I like the various vitamins, minerals, and protein it provides along with the convenience. Most morning it is my only form of sustenance as I rush to work. Tastes great, can't go wrong with Vanilla. Sometimes I switch things up a bit and get the variety pack which has Strawberry, Vanilla, and Chocolate. Back in the "good old days" a box of 10 packs cost only 3.50. Now it ranges from 4.99-6.99 hence I have decided to go online and get the bulk pack which is a good deal relatively speaking.  If only they have vanilla flavor canisters available, like they do for chocolate. Definitely recommend CIB. In fact, I have recommended it to a handful of friends.

It is exactly what it states it is and i prefer taking the hassle out of trying to find these locally (have been sold out locally especially once school started).

review/text: This product was recommended to us by the pediatrician.  My daughter doesn't like to eat and so we have to supplement her milk to give her more protein and calories.  We dilute it more now that she's older.  For every packet of powder, we mix it with 20 ounces of milk so it's not overly sweet.  I've heard that pediasure is a lot sweeter.  I also use the carnation packets to make smoothies and they taste so much better with the packets.  Highly recommend.

review/summary: I have one every morning mixed with almond milk
review/text: Regular milk, even lactose free milk is hard on my stomach. I love the taste of the vanilla CIB and have found it mixes great with Almond milk (found in the dairy section next to the real milk). Almond milk also has more calcium and more protein than regular milk. I've tried mixing it with coconut milk but could still taste the coconut.<br /><br />I have vanilla CIB every morning for my breakfast, then eat a light lunch around 11, and a regular dinner at 5. There have been times when I wake during the night and find my stomach growling. I don't feel like eating but it's hard to go back to sleep with a hungry tummy. I just get up and mix one of these drinks and go back to sleep.<br /><br />To mix, I pour my tall glass about 3/4 full with almond milk. Dump in a CIB packet and stir with a spoon. Insert straw and drink. It feels odd to me to drink it by sipping on the side of the glass. The mix is a little on the thicker side and I prefer a straw EVERY time.<br /><br />My kids enjoy the chocolate CIB and they like their milk warmed first. They actually call it "hot chocolate". They too, have some every morning and then a light breakfast of toast or cereal.

These get old if you have them everyday, and occasionaly benefit from the addition of some fruit, but you can't go wrong.  Also, the carnation brand tastes much better than the generic store brands.  This is one time where you benefit from going with the name brand.

review/summary: Great breakfast or healthy snack
review/text: I first had Carnation Instant Breakfast as a snack when I was a kid, and now my kids love it too. We usually get Chocolate, because it is cheaper (about $10 for a 30-pack at Costco), but we prefer Vanilla (we like vanilla milkshakes better than chocolate too). $30 for this pack of 60 is not a bad price considering how much it is at the store--you might be able to find it cheaper sometimes on sale and/or with a coupon, but Amazon is so convenient that I decided to stock up.<br /><br />I love this, because it is great as breakfast on the run (my teen has it almost every day) or a yummy but healthy snack for the kids--or ME! The kids feel like they're getting a treat and I feel like they're getting vitamins!!! Sometimes I drink this instead of grabbing something from the candy bowl--tastes great and I don't feel guilty! It's a great alternative to pre-mixed chocolate milk too.<br /><br />Now if only Amazon would put this on subscribe and save... :)

review/text: We tried this oatmeal about 2 years ago. My sister recommended it to us. It has such a wonderful flavor and texture. It's not the flakes like we're used to. It's little nuggets, steel cut, that take a little while to cook but it's well worth the extra time. It's creamy and nutty and tastes wonderful with bananas and raisins and brown sugar. I highly recommend giving this product a try!<br /><br />(If you put the oatmeal in with the water to start and let it come to a boil and then turn it down to simmer it doesn't take quite as long.)

review/summary: Great Oatmeal
review/text: McCann's is a new experience in oatmeal.  It takes longer to cook, but boy oh boy, is it worth it.  It's best to cook the full recipe that they speak of: one cup McCann's, four cups water.  Not real tough to remember!<br /><br />Unless you use the shortcut method, it takes over 30 minutes to make one batch.  So if you're going 'green' (energywise), try the overnight method.  And warming it up the next morning with the microwave is great; I put milk on it before nuking it.  So good when it comes out!<br /><br />Note: if you undercook McCann's, it'll be like eating pearl barley (or birdshot) that's not cooked long enough--- not a great treat.  Remember, it is full grains of oats that have been cut maybe once each, but many at a time of course.  The water must be given time to permeate the oats grains.<br /><br />Great for comfort food on those cold mornings when you want something that'll stick to your ribs, plus be good for ya.<br /><br />A friend that I and one Mr. S.G. "Long Lense" Johnson call "Oatmeal Beard", a.k.a. "Prof. Braddock" (don't ask)--- because he used to eat oatmeal, out of the pot, every morning for years driving to work (but it was the 'quick' stuff), well we put him on to McCann's............. a real officianado of oatmeal.  I eagerly await his review of this fine product.  I give it a huge thumbs up!

review/summary: Misleading packaging, now with extra sugar!
review/text: In the past few weeks this General Mills product was reformulated with 3 time the sugar.  This change was made without ANY changes to the packaging outside of the nutritional label.  This product went from a mainstay for us and our toddler to something we will no longer be buying.
