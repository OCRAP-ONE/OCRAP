review/summary: Great taste, Great Results
review/text: This protein powder was highly recommended from a few of my friends when I started looking for something to help with my work out results.  This protein powder taste fantastic, especially when mixed with some frozen fruit and peanut butter, just like an ice cream shake.  It fills me up, it can be used as a meal replacement.  It also has helped me increased muscle size much faster then previously.  This product is great and I recommend it for anyone from an everyday Joe just trying to get into shape to people who are very serious about working out.

review/summary: Very nice flavor
review/text: I tired this product for the first time & have tried several others over the yrs. I found this one to be very nice in both flavor & texture. It blends well & doesn't have the chalky taste many others have. I tried it w/ just water & it was okay & tried it w/ lowfat greek yogart & also w/ some fresh fruit blended in to make it more as a smoothie. I work 12 hrs shifts & sometimes having this as a meal replacement works well rather than a lot of snacks with  meal while working or for the grab & go breakfast @ 4am (mixed the night before & chilled overnight & put in water bottle). I tied the strawberry flavor & will try others as i go along. ***HINT drink very chilled for best results.

It tastes like brownie batter - best protein out there, although its a MRP so the calories are a bit higher than a standard whey pr casein. Nice blend and great product.

review/summary: I use it as chocolate dessert replacement.
review/text: If one loves chocolate, this works great in a very low carb diet instead of sugar laden cake one can buy. I use 1 1/2 of the enclosed measuring spoon full of it and add very little water to it. Have it with my afternoon coffee like a small bowl of chocolate. My cravings for sweets have vanished. (1) Have taken the glamor out of chocolate. (2) Have made it practical. (3) In spite of being near the fridge all day working from home, I restrained myself to looking forward to this one dessert once a day. Now I'm used to it and feeling in charge.

review/summary: Alright
review/text: I have just started using this supplement after workouts and it has taken me a bit to figure out a taste combo that I can live with. The milk-shake flavor may be a little bit overboard. I would probably like just a normal chocolate flavor. The recommendation is two scoops but I use one and I still feel the taste is quite strong. I mix one scope of this with 2 cups of almond breeze almond milk and sometimes some frozen strawberries - blend it in my blender and it is a great drink. It also provides enough chocolately flavor to cure any possible sweet tooth I might have.

It tastes great and mixes completely.  No clumping.  I have only tried the chocolate ice cream flavor ( and the chocolate peanut butter in the packets) so I can't speak on the taste of the vanilla or strawberry.  If you are looking for a good MRP, this is it.  Don't waste your money on anything else.

review/text: Tried this product after doing a little research online (including here).  The product lived up to its good reviews.  Like most protein shakes, this is best cold.  I usually make a drink after exercising but with classes starting back up, I plan on switching to mornings since I'll be preoccupied during class.  The only downside to the product for me was trying to find the perfect amount of 10oz. of water to get the shake to taste perfect (I think I managed that feat twice), but nonetheless, it's still good.

review/text: Look, I know there are nasty tasting whole earth raw shakes out there that are seriously nasty, and as an industry we've come a long way in flavor with these, but this vanilla ice cream powder is so nasty that I cannot describe it other than to say that it smells like a cheap "buttercream cupcake" candle, and it tastes like a whole truckload of quarters and fake Splenda sweetener rusting in your mouth...the way your mouth is cold when you haven't slept all night, like all that nasty at the same time.<br /><br />Now with all that said, the chocolate ice cream flavor is the best ever!! I make it as an after gym hot chocolate breakfast and it's just delicious and it works like even I can't believe. Get the chocolate and give it a little more water than it calls for, it's great.<br /><br />Gonna try the strawberry one next, hopefully it's like the chocolate one.

review/summary: don't like taste at all
review/text: I've have never had a good tasting protein meal replacement shake and this one is no better.  I know taste preference is all subjective.  But if you don't like the sickening sweet flavor of artificial sweetners and that nasty after taste, then you won't like this. Please note I hate the taste of diet soda too, just to give you a reference point.  After forcing myself to drink it once a day for a week, I just couldn't do it anymore. The articial sweetening is too much for me and the thought of having to drink it everyday..well I just can't do it.  I will continue making my own meal replacement shakes with plain whey protein with no artificial sweeters.  I like to mix in a little fruit( blueberries, raspberries or strawberries) or yogurt or honey to keep carbs low.

review/summary: High-quality salt!
review/text: I would like to start out by saying that I am picky about salt. Iodized salt has no character and kosher salt can be very overpowering. Sea salt can be a hit or miss. Some sea salts can be intensely salty while others lack any panache.<br /><br />But this salt is beautifully pink and its flavor is mild and balanced with a wonderful finish. It has the character and class expected of a salt in its category.<br /><br />Extra points for packaging..I loove the space-efficient airtight design with screw on lid. It's easy to store in my already full spice cabinet. And the price is perfect.<br /><br />Kudos for affordability, health benefits, design, ease of use, and taste!!!!!

review/summary: Don't like
review/text: I have used quality salts for years, and have always especially loved the pink salt variety, so I ordered this one because it is much cheaper than others out there. Well, this one just doesn't taste like the pink salts I've had in the past. Upon tasting, I also I realized that this salt is just 'too pink' for me to believe that it is not enhanced in some way! I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.) Anyway, Amazon is wonderful and refunded me for this  salt, so I will purchase a different brand.

review/text: Salt comes in a sturdy aluminum pouch with a screw cap. We live in South Texas where the humidity can turn salt into a brick overnight. This packaging keeps the salt nice and dry. Salt is finely ground which we liked as most dishes require a pinch. Taste is very mild and doesn't bite you with lingering after taste like regular table salt can do. 5 Stars

She said this salt tastes very much like what we are used to cooking/seasoning with (table salt), so she didn't feel like she would have to adjust the quantity in recipes. Southern quisine is usually heavily salted and seasoned. I ordered some for myself on her recommendation, but I haven't tried it yet.

review/summary: Nice Addition to the Spice Rack
review/text: I had purchased this because I had gotten hooked on Himalayan Pink Salt at the local grocery store. They offered it in small rocks in a grinder container. Seeing this online, It was much cheaper to purchase it in this size, especially since I already had a grinder.. This stuff adds great texture to a meal when you finish it with a small crust of it. The only reason I gave this particular kind 4 rather than 5 stars is that the salt is already pretty finely ground, when I thought I was getting something similar to the small rocks of salt I was getting before, and I could grind it as I wanted it. Still a good buy, though. I barely ever use regular iodized salt for anything other than pasta water any more.

review/summary: So far, it's the best salt I have found
review/text: I felt that I had to give an update reassuring people a little more about this product.  I can assure you that I have no connection or financial interest in this company or in regard to this Himalayan salt.<br /><br />The reason for my interest is that I have an autistic son, and I am very watchful for contaminants in his food. I avoid the type of sea salt from the ocean since heavy metal contamination is an problem.  So when I found this Himalayan salt, I was glad because the label states that they monitor the contents for contaminants.  And it doesn't come from the ocean, which greatly reduces the likelihood of heavy  metal contamination.<br /><br />One reviewer was quite concerned because there seemed to be some sediment left at the bottom of a glass of water when he attempted to dissolve the salt.  He felt that this sediment was dangerous and not fit for human consumption.<br /><br />So I did some research of my own.  I tried to dissolve some of the salt in a glass of water also.  I noticed that some of it did not dissolve immediately.  It took a while, but eventually all but some red powder had dissolved.  So I know that some of the salt dissolves immediately, some of it will dissolve after a lot of stirring and perhaps after it sits in the water for a couple of hours.  But the red powder did not dissolve.<br /><br />I looked up Himalayan pink salt and found out that the Bavarian consumer protection agency analyzed the composition of 15 Himalayan sea salts sold in Germany.  They found that it was composed of 10 different minerals, including, of course, sodium and chloride (98%).  It contained 2-3% polyhalite or gypsum and 10 other minerals in small amounts.<br /><br />Gypsum is a very soft sulfate material made up of calcium sulfate dihydrate.  I am assuming it is safe for consumption since it is used as a coagulant in tofu.<br /><br />Polyhalite is a hydrated sulfate of potassium, calcium and magnesium.  It's reddish color is due to various levels of iron oxide in salt deposits.<br /><br />This may seem alarming, but I did yet more research and found that insoluble minerals do not absorb and simply pass through the body. Based on that information, I am not ready to assume that this insoluble mineral is harmful.<br /><br />Himalayan pink sea salt has been harvested from the salt mines in Pakistan since the 13th century.  So they've been eating this stuff for a long time.  And if they've been consuming it for that long, and if that's the way it comes out of the ground, I think I can feel pretty good about it.<br /><br />I am not 100% confident about my conclusions, but for now, I am feeling a bit better about serving this to my children rather than serving any other salt on the market.

Just adjust the grinder screw from coarse salt to fine salt and it works perfectly. Love the taste of this salt, it is slightly lemony and very mild. Low sodium!!! This package will last probably over a year (2 pounds of it!!!). Totally will buy again.

review/text: I heard that Himalayan Pink Sea Salt was spoken of highly so when I needed to buy some more salt I decided to try this.  I have always used sea salt in a salt grinder.  The main differences between regular sea salt and this product, I would say, are that this is a very finely ground product, and it seems to be the saltiest salt I have ever tried.  I definitely have to be careful and not use a lot because a little goes a long way flavor wise.  Also, even though it is a finely ground sea salt I still use it in my salt grinder and it works perfectly fine.  Overall I would say that I do like this product and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something new to add a little more flavor to their food. Just remember, a little goes a long way!

review/summary: Diogenes Sleeps Deeply
review/text: When my grandson was born, Diogenes was able to retire and seek the sleep he so deserved after searching so many centuries for an honest man. My grandson speaks his mind eloquently and succintly.  Upon the arrival of my order of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNHQ34">Funfresh Foods Real Food Trading Company Himalayan Pink Sea Salt, 2-Pound</a>, I quietly served it at a family meal.  Almost instantly my grandson asked who put sand in the salt.  I smiled, chuckled and told him no one had put anything in the salt and that this was special pink salt from half way around the world.  "It has sand in it, Grandpa! I don't like it!" he replied.  Nay, nay, not so, I assured him (and everyone).  "Let me show you."<br /><br />I drew a small glass of filtered water and added a liberal amount of the pink salt.  (BTW, if you like the C.Cola bottled water, *asani, much of it comes from the same source in FL as my tap water)  So I swirled the pink salt around in the water.  Let me mention that I have a degree in science and a bunch, like a lot, of chemistry courses so I know that table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl) is really really soluble in water.  Well, after much stirring I got quite a bit of pink insoluble grains on the bottom of the glass and, most disturbing, the liquid was cloudy!  I've been watching it for a couple of hours now and nothing is settling out.  I'll keep watching, but what the cloudy water means is there is either a fine particulate that will settle out in time or there is something else in the "salt" that is not or not completely water soluble or is colloidal, which does not make me feel good about this product.<br /><br />It is my understanding that most table salt is produced by crystallizing the salt from a saline solution, either natural (sea water) or man made.  The difference between "regular" table salt (at least in the US) and Kosher salt is that regular salt is allowed to crystallize undisturbed and will form cubical crystals while Kosher salt must be raked during the entire crystallizing process, thus forming the light flaky crystals familiar to that form.<br /><br />This product, it appears to me, is a mined mineral that contains a high NaCl content that is not further refined.  It is finely ground perhaps in the hope that end users will not notice that it also contains rock, sand, or whatever makes up the Himalayas.  The product claims to contain less Sodium (Na) and that may well be true, but is that lower Sodium content because it has ground rocks/sand in it?<br /><br />I'm returning this because it is an inferior product that is not what it is advertised to be.  This might be fine for a live stock salt lick but it is not fit for human consumption!<br /><br />Many Hours Later:  The cloudiness is clearing, so my conclusion is that it was caused by very small particles that took longer to fall out of suspension.  Nevertheless, sediment is sediment and sediment is not salt!  This is another example of when a low price is not a bargain!

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: For awhile I was eating Pacific Natural Foods organic tomato soup and found it to be really tasty. One day I tried this Progresso Hearty tomato soup and never looked back. Not only is this the best tomato soup I've ever had but it's the best soup I've ever had from a can, period. I think I'm addicted (I'm serious). Every spoonful is better than the last. Like another reviewer said, I eat this soup at least once a week and look forward to it. For me one can is one serving. Strangely the Walmarts in my area don't carry it for some reason, although they carry all the other Progresso flavors.<br />How can it be so darn delicious? I'm actually afraid that Progresso will stop selling it so I tend to stock up.

review/text: I was one who never cared for tomato soup. But I was at my daughter's house and she was feeding this as lunch with sandwiches to her husband's sons. I looked in the pot- thought it was interesting to see chunks of tomatoes in tomato soup. I tried a spoonful. I sipped the edge of the spoon. I emptied the pot!! I am hooked on this! The best soup ever, ever. I have it all the time now. You will not regret this- try it, you'll like it for real.

review/summary: An impulse buy has become a staple product
review/text: I'm the type that would occasionally get in the mood for a bowl of tomato soup (always with a grilled cheese sandwich). Those moods weren't often and would never be a craving. Just a simple bowl of condensed soup, add 1 can of water and heat.<br /><br />But that was until I found Progresso's Hearty Tomato Soup. Wow, I can't even believe I'm spending time reviewing soup but it's REALLY THAT GOOD!! I tried this only because I happened to see it on sale and thought, "why not"? Now it has become a regular item on my shopping list. This is nothing like condensed tomato soup and I will NEVER go back to that. It's 19 oz which I think is perfect amount for me. The soup has a sweetness to it and then a little bit of a bite. There are actual chunks of tomatoes and I think it's seasoned perfectly. I might add a little pepper but it needs nothing more.<br /><br />Those occasional moods for tomato soup are now replaced with a true desire to have this is as part of a meal on a fairly regular basis. Lunch, dinner, snack...I don't care. Anytime for me to have this is fine and I just haven't grown tired of it. I add a grill cheese sandwich for the PERFECT combination. Really, you should try this. Enjoy!!

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/text: You should definitely incorporate 2-4 tablespoons of wheat germ into your daily diet.  It doesn't require any cooking.  Just eat it! Adults and children love it when sprinkled over chopped bananas and other fruit. This product must be kept in the freezer once opened or it will go rancid relatively fast.<br /><br />This price is horrendous!  Go to your local grocery store and buy two 12 oz jars and only pay $10.00.  Yeah, you get 24 oz locally for less than the price of this Amazon product and you don't pay any shipping.  This Amazon seller is clearly trying to rip you off.

review/summary: DID I FORGET TO MENTION? -- IT TASTES GOOD TOO!!!
review/text: "Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what Wheat Germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and does provide an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated "Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1]- Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2]- Substituting Wheat Germ for bread crumbs in Meat Loaf, veal/chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This "Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!

review/text: I use Kretschmer Wheatgerm in my homemade granola regularly.  Excellent.<br /><br />HOWEVER.  Absolutely the finest thing about this product has got to be the sound of opening a brand new jar!<br />In our family, several of us will stop what we are doing and gather in the kitchen to hear the breaking of the vacuum seal.  MMMMM!  Ear Candy!<br /><br />Another great way to eat it:  Slice a banana half, and then the slices lengthwise.  Spread each piece with banana,  sprinkle with Kretschmer wheat germ, and add a few raisins on top.<br /><br />Kretschmer's can also be sprinkled on a toddler's banana pieces.  Helps them hold on to them!

review/text: First things first, I did enjoy this product. Depending on the amount of concentrate added to your water you could have it range from subtle to overbearing. The Cherry Berry is the only flavor I have tried, and I would say that it does taste better than other water flavorings like Crystal light, Mio, etc. The end fruit flavor tastes much more natural, and it is great that this drink mix depends on natural sugars instead of opting for zero-calorie garbage.<br /><br />The biggest issue is the price. $7 for a bottle that gets 24-30 8oz servings is a steep price. I only see myself buying this in the future on special occasions, perhaps when the weather gets warm out and I want a refreshing summer drink.

We use the bottles and the to-go packets, and really enjoy both.  Yes, it does have calories, but it DOES NOT have propylene glycol, which seems to me to be a very good thing.

It is 9 oz instead of 8 oz like most Hershey's Cocoa. Unsweetened, produced from apparently one source, Tumaco Cocoa Beans in Colombia. Unlike Hershey's Cocoa, it does not specify if it is a Dutch process or not, if it is certified non-alkalized cocoa or not... TJ will not even supply the information even if they are asked to do so. It works great with my mix and I would have given it five star if TJ would have been honest... Deduct two stars.

review/summary: Very Happy Dog
review/text: And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.
