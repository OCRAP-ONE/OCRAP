review/summary: My baby's favorite
review/text: My little eater isn't picky, but the spinach, mango and pear is his favorite food of all.  The food is tasty, although it's a little bit expensive at Amazon.  The grocery store and the big boxes tend to have this one a little bit cheaper.  Thankfully, Happy foods are becoming increasingly easy to find.  Good products and tasty foods = well, Happy Baby!

review/summary: Pouches Not Recyclable
review/text: This product tries to skirt the fact that the pouches are NOT recyclable, and the caps are a choking hazard. It doesn't make a lot of sense....buy an organic food product that puts more trash in the landfill. They toss around the buzz phrase "BPA free", but it is still more plastic going into the landfill. And, they use another buzz phrase, "lower carbon footprint than glass jars". Huh? Glass may have a higher carbon footprint, but it can be (and is) recycled over & over into food containers. Plastic cannot be recycled into new food containers. Yes the caps are recyclable, but recycled plastic often has no market for reuse. And, make sure your child doesn't try to eat them first.

review/text: I really dislike that Companies are combing Fruit & Vegetables. No wonder kids are not liking Vegetables. I would like to purchase pre-packaged Baby Food, but after Stage 1 all I can seem to find are products with Vegetables and Fruit mixed so the food tastes sweet. I guess I have to stick with making my own baby food. Oh and the packaging is so convenient that you can even forego the Spoon and Dish, what does this teach your Children!

review/text: My 2 year old daughter loves these sort of squeeze pouches so I ordered a whole case of these thinking that I could sneak some veggies in. Unfortunately this is not the case. These are so sour that she shudders after taking a sip!  So just says "don't like it!" and wants the plain mango one. Curious, I tried it and although it has a very sweet taste in the beginning the after taste of sour beets is awful!  Be prepared, if your little ones aren't a fan of beets, they may not be a fan of this flavor!

review/text: I was hopefully that since this was a mixed food combo it would be thicker in consistency - WRONG! It was like straight water. It made such a messy. I used it with my 6 month old who has recently started solids, but this was a disaster. He did seem to like the flavor, that's why I gave it 2 stars. I am going to keep it so that when he older I can mix it with some oatmeal for breakfast.

review/summary: Dominant Beet Flavor
review/text: I was hoping to "sneak" beets into my sons snack, but there is no hiding with this brand. In fact, the beet flavor is rather overwhelming, and rather on the "raw" side. I enjoy beets, pickled and roasted, but this flavor is just not appealing at all. If your kid loves beets (maybe even raw ones?) go for it.  Also, someone commented on it being a runny consistency but my recently ordered batch is on the thick side.

If you buy the spinach, mango and pear one, which amazon itself sells, it is half the price (see link) of 911drugstore and about twice what you'd pay retail.  Don't buy from this company. They are price gouging.<br /><br />That said, all of this band of baby food that I've tried are great.  I don't even use a spoon, my son likes to just suck it right out of the tube and has been since he was 7months old.

review/summary: My son's favorite food!
review/text: Our son is 6 months old. This was his first mix of foods after he's had his first foods an ingredient at a time...You should see how he opens his mouth big like he's about to swallow me whole every single time I bring one of these to him and am about to open it. It is so convenient, too...because when we are out at the park or after a doctor's appointment and he's hungry, I can just take one of these out of the diaper bag and squeeze it into the spoon for him to eat it. Also, when he only has half of it, we put the rest in the fridge and then in the evening we heat it up in a bowl of hot water. It's also great that we never actually touch the food w/ the spoon, so no bacteria goes into the pouch...We love it...We really have no negatives about it...I'm about to order a new batch now as we're vising some friends in TX next week and we need to grab food for the plane and also for the trip. These are great because they're not as heavy as the jars.

review/text: All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth.

review/summary: Sweet and a little tart, but delicious and fresh!
review/text: We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing this banana, beet and blueberry flavor after reading several reviews that it was sour and their children did not like the taste.  However, our 8-month old daughter loved this flavor and in fact, hasn't opened her mouth as widely for any of the other Happy Baby flavors as she did with this one.  The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that "baby food" type of taste that many brands have.<br /><br />Also, there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4BV5U">Plum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.  It comes with a carrying case for the spoon tips.  This makes feeding time so much easier when you screw the spoon onto the package and then can easily throw away the package and put the spoon tip back in the case rather than having to bring a separate spoon and container to squeeze the food into so you can feed your baby.

review/text: My boy is not a picky eater. He likes these pouched food except this flavor: it is too sour, even I have a problem with it! He is eager to try, sometimes he even takes it out of the food storage box and asks me to open for him, but after one sip or two, he gives up. Now I am stuck with a box of these, not knowing what to do with it. I'd like to give them away, but if my son doesn't like them, how can I know if other babies will eat it? I will not buy them again. My mistake was that I didn't read all the reviews on this item :(. A hard lesson learned!

review/summary: Too sweet!
review/text: We generally make food for our little one at home, but I wanted to try a couple pouches because they seem like a good option for throwing into the diaper bag.  I chose the Happy Baby Broccoli, Peas and Pear because of the great reviews from other parents.  It's true, our baby opens his mouth WIDE for this stuff.  He is a fairly good eater of whatever we give him, but I don't think I've seen him this excited to eat since he first started on solids.  The problem is, I tasted a tiny bit of it and it was extremely sweet.  The package doesn't list any additional sugars or sweeteners, but I find it hard to believe that pears can be THAT sweet.  Even if the sugar comes 100% from the pears and is natural, I still think it's too much.  I'll be mixing it in with oatmeal until it's done and after that I will try a couple other brands to see if there is anything less sweet out there.  If not...I'll just have to suck it up and bring homemade food with me everywhere.

I started ordering all of the different flavors of the HappyBaby and HappyTot (which has the magic supergrain Salba in them)line through the automatic delivery service (which lowers the price/amazon mom's helps too) and I call them smoothies. My toddler gobbles these up and asks for more! Even the ones that are green bean, peas, pear, and salba. It's like a miracle! My baby eats them too, but not with quite as much enthusiasm. It makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and I don't need to break my neck trying to do it. Oh and they are wonderfully anti-messy. I shove a few in my purse when I know we will be out during hungry times.

She also loves the spinach, mango, and pear happy baby pouches which are bigger.

I started adding Apple Cherry to my daughters cereal because she didn't want to eat the rice cereal plain. Now she gobbles it up! I feel good that she is getting awesome organic fruit in her cereal that doesn't have added sugar or color and it only took me a few seconds to get it prepared for her.

I love that all of the products are Organic and GMO-Free. I also thought that the price was very reasonable and would definitely order this again. Try mixing a bit of it into Happy Family Organic Oatmeal for a new twist on breakfast for the kids. Happy Family is a must have in our house :)

review/summary: Great flavor combination
review/text: We're big HappyBaby fans here, and this flavor pouch is one of my favorites for my son, who is now two. I tried to make my own baby food for him when we were first introducing solids, but I had trouble finding all the fresh organic fruits and vegetables during certain times of the year -- and apricot was one of them. I would have never thought to combine apricots and sweet potatoes on my own, but the combination works! I love that it is really nutrient dense and an easy snack for on the go. My son is in the picky-eater phase and these pouches help get the veggies in! I also think this pouch is the reason behind his current love of dried apricots :) Overall, this is a great flavor combination and a super nutritious food for little ones.<br /><br />I don't find that these pouches are runny like other commenters have mentioned, FYI.

He is now 16 months and it is one of his favorite HappyBaby flavors.  In fact, he just gobbled one up at lunch today.  He is at the age where giving him snacks on the go is difficult.  I don't always have time to do a bib and highchair for snacks.  I can give him this pouch and it keeps him satisfied until lunch or dinner, and I know he is consuming food that is good for his growing body!

review/summary: Update: Runny Consistency Good on the Go!
review/text: My daughter loves this (as well as every other Happy Baby food she has tried)! The only reason I docked a star is because the consistency is thin. I normally mix all of her Stage 2 foods with cereal, so it's not a big deal for us. However, if your baby eats this straight, try one of the various "squeezie" spoons on the market. It is too runny to use a traditional spoon.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I changed my rating to five stars. Yes, it's still a bit runny. However, I have found this to actually be a good thing.<br /><br />My daughter is almost seven months old. We were out the other day, and I had a pouch of this food in the diaper bag. I had just gotten her seated for lunch when I realized that I'd forgotten her bowl, spoon, and cereal to mix with the food. I decided to let her try to "eat" it directly from the pouch. (We both drink homemade green smoothies a lot. The consistency is similar.) It was great! She was easily able to suck it out of the pouch, with me holding the pouch, making sure that there was always food near the opening. She only spilled a tiny bit onto her bib. It also took less than five minutes for her to eat!<br /><br />I am going to keep a pouch of this food in the diaper bag from now on. It's great that I don't have to worry about carting a bowl, spoon, and container of cereal anymore. However, I will continue to mix it with cereal at home.

review/summary: Used to be the only way I could get veggies down my baby!
review/text: Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.  I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked "interesting."  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.<br /><br />Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.  I wish that these would have been available years ago.  :)

I also use them in the house for those days when he says no to all other foods. He has never turned down one of these pouches. Figure it's more nutritious than eating goldfish crackers for a meal.

I don't find the consistency to be thin like other reviews have expressed. In fact, I ended up using the left over pouches for my 5 year old daughter's lunches. I used it on her almond butter sandwiches instead of jelly. So I thought the consistency was fine.<br />The taste was obviously delicious as my daughter didn't even notice the difference. Plus organic, no GMO, BPA free...can't really beat that.

I highly recommend this product and company. no gmos and organic what a mom wants in food that she didnt make. it is thin but makes it easy to eat out of pouch with little to no sucking involved. i even like them, but i try all food before i give it to my son, quite tasty!

review/summary: Unlikely reviewer
review/text: I was so impressed with this product that I felt compelled to write about it. My 14 month old picky eater would not eat ANYTHING but toddler formula and english muffins. I started cooking for him since he was 5 months old and he ate well but something happened when I went back to work and he no longer accepts "good" food. However, he happily ate entire pack of HappyBaby Spinach, Mango & Pear and asked for more two days in the row! My husband is a Mr. Mom for now so weight off his shoulders as far as feeding. We ordered other flavors and hoping trend with eating organic veggies and fruits will continue with our picky eater.

review/text: We first discovered these pouches at our local Target for $1.09.  We had a coupon and thought we'd try them with our 11 month old.  He absolutely loves to eat this flavor straight out of the pouch.  In fact, it appears that he's drinking it.  I try all the food I feed my baby and was pleasantly surprised by this flavor combination.  I love that with subscribe & save, I can get a great deal on these pouches from amazon.

review/summary: Wanted so badly to like it
review/text: My 8 month old has eaten nearly on the flavors of ellas, happy baby/tot, and sprout meals.  This one is so tart, she shuttered with a sour face and then started to cry- something that NEVER happens.  I tasted it and it is pretty sour (I like sour), perhaps overwhelmingly so for a fresh pallette (not a beat up adult one). I served it along with a savory meal and she was fine with that but I wont be buying it again.  May be good for an adult smoothie where you want some tang.

review/summary: Son eats ALL HappyBaby products EXCEPT this one
review/text: My son has been gobbling these pouches down since he was just over a year old (he's now 2 1/2).  They are such a fantastic way to get quality foods into picky bodies.<br /><br />However, this is the only combo that he has refused to eat.  I've tried it multiple times, and he continues to leave the pouch full after taking just one sip.  The rest he will slurp down until even the air is out of the package ;)<br /><br />I'd order any of the other combinations if I were you.

review/summary: Best way to keep my toddler eating his veggies!
review/text: My son has a very high gag reflex and transitioning to solids has been a task.  However, he also won't have anything to do with homemade baby food anymore.  We found these pouches when buying food for a trip and he was hooked.  I like that the veggies are organic, the pouches produce little garbage, that he can feed himself, but most importantly, that it is keeping the taste of veggies in his diet while we slowly work on chewing veggies.

review/text: Vegan. Natural. Kosher Pareve. This rajma masala can be compared to a typical spicy bean chili, India-cuisine style. Was very pleased to try one of my favorite Indian dishes as a vegan product from Kitchens of India. Beautiful & amazing over organic brown rice. Rajma means kidney bean. Masala mean spice. Very flavorful. Indian foodies will find this recipe medium or typical, but others may find it on their spicier side. Highly recommended. Made with tomatoes, onions, red kidney beans, sunflower oil, garlic, spices, salt, & ginger. 300 calories and 12g protein per package. Product of India. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

review/text: When you love Indian food, but don't have the time to cook it, Kitchens of India is a really great alternative. I have yet to be disappointed in one of their dishes and this one is no exception. The great thing about Indian food is that they are mostly sauce (or "gravy" as they say), so I will cook up some meat or steam up some veggies and add one of these packets to make a fabulous meal. Their really aren't much in the way of veggies in these packets, but that is typical in Indian food, no matter where it comes from. American's tend to use gravy or sauce as the secondary component while Indian's use it as the primary component and sop it up with lots of bread or rice. By steaming or sauteing some additional vittles, you can really stretch one of these packets.<br /><br />Is this review helpful? Please vote. :-)

review/text: I am not Inidan, so this is not a "professional" opinion. I am away from home for most meals. I was looking for something easy to make at the work site and a change to the "usual". Just open the pouch, squeeze into a microwavable dish and a minute later you have a hot vegetarian meal with plenty of flavor. I like all of the Kitchen of Inida products I have tried so far. And if you are storing up some food for emergencies like a hurricane, these store easily for later use.

review/summary: A Good Tasting Quick Curry Solution...
review/text: The Kitchens of India(KoI) Ramja Masala (Ready to Eat) is just what the doctor ordered for when the Curry Craving strikes.  Simply open the package and put it into a small pan, and in under 5 minutes you have hot curry ready to go.  Ramja Masala is a Red Kidney Bean curry.  It has a nice melody of Soft Red Kidney beans and delicious spiced curry.  While the curry is no where near as spicy as some of the other KoI curry's out there, it has enough of a kick to give some added flavor to the mix.<br /><br />You get approximately 1 1/4 cups of curry out of a single packet.  While this may not seem like a lot, do keep in mind that while you could simply devour this curry by itself it is meant to be eaten over some Rice, or accompanied by some bread to help round out the meal.  I prefer mine over rice as the rice ends up picking up the flavor of the curry plus acts as a nice filler.<br /><br />In terms of the quality of curry, the "Ready to Eat" curry by KoI feels like a small step down from their pre-packaged curry pastes.  While the Rajma Masala was delicious, it also tasted a bit too salty.  However, it is reasonable to expect this as is with most "Ready to Eat" meals.  A small element of quality gets lost in packing/processing the product to survive on a shelf yet be instantly available to eat.  At 610mg of Sodium per serving (1525mg for just one pouch / 1.25 cups) the product is a tad high in sodium compared to the packaged curry pastes (per serving).<br /><br />OVERALL, this is a good curry.  It isn't "great", but is still vastly superior to some of those generic "Ready to Eat" products or frozen TV dinners that plague supermarkets.  Though you only get 1 1/4 cups of prepared curry per package, it is meant to be served over rice or with bread, such as Naan.  A simple packet actually goes a long way and is worth the investment.  A really good quick meal.  4 Stars!<br /><br />* Nutritional Information ** (Entire packet)<br />Each packet is 10oz (285g) and contains a little less than THREE Servings (~2.5 servings).

review/text: If you've ever eaten Indian food in a good restaurant in India, you'll especially appreciate KOI's quick-fix packages. These are very tasty, a good value, and easy to prepare. This one's my favorite of the Kitchens of India recipes (neck-and-neck with Dal Bukhara). I like to pressure cook some brown rice (black japonica is even better!) with some lentils and fenugreek seeds (easy on those -- strong flavor), then add a package of the prepared mix. (It's also fine to eat right out of the package.)

review/summary: I see why others like it...but not for me.
review/text: I'm always wary when buying food items on the basis of Amazon reviews. I've found the average reviewer (especially when dealing with ethnic foods) still prefers items that are Americanized or similar to American foods...like when reviewers blast umeboshi for (of all things) being too salty or grumble about seaweed tasting too much like the sea.<br /><br />So when this cropped up as a good seller, I should have known better. It still gets five stars because I found the quality, packaging, and ease of preparation to be great. Almost all of the beans retained their shape and texture, the seasonings were good, it was easy to prepare and had no strange aftertaste from the packaging, and it arrived in an easy-to-store box in which all the individual packets fit in perfectly.<br /><br />However, I won't be buying again. Why? Because it tastes like chili. Oh, there's a subtle hint of spice and the quality definitely sets it apart from Hormel, but for all intents and purposes, it tastes like meatless chili. I can see why that would appeal to a lot of people who might find stronger and more unique Indian foods off-putting...but I was in search of strong and unique and this just doesn't fit the bill.

review/summary: Like meatless chili with curry seasonings added...
review/text: As an American unschooled in Indian cuisine, but looking to add some variety to my diet, this seems to me like meatless chili with curry seasonings added - familiar enough that I tossed some crackers in it and ate it like chili (- my apologies to the chefs for probably bastardizing it ;-), but it was convenient...). I would call it medium hot - spicy and rather warm, but didn't burn off my taste buds. (I'm not someone who is into hot Mexican food - for instance, my comfort zone is Tostitos Medium salsa, and this is comparable in heat.)<br /><br />I got this in the variety pack. This is the first one of the variety pack I tried because it has the fewest calories and grams of fat - 300 calories per packet and 9 grams of fat. (Since this was my meal in it's entirety, the 2.5 servings the packet claims to contain was certainly not in line with my meal plans, so I had to do the math.)

review/text: I have never seen anything like this on the menu at the Indian restaurants I have been to, but I still enjoy this. It has a very mild flavor and I actually do think it could use a little more spice because it slightly resembles chili and not Indian food. But overall, I think it has a good flavor and it is a pretty low-calorie vegetarian meal. It does have saturated fat, but also a good amount of protein and no cholesterol. The convenience of having it ready from the pouch is why I buy it.

I am not sure if it was the intention to make it bland or not, but I can't pick out what makes it special. I microwaved the product in a bowl with a lid over it and it came out a bit think and not like a sauce you would expect from curry. The food is not bad, it's just not special.

Just nuke it and add to a cup of soup or serve it over rice, on top of eggs, add it to sauteed onions and/or other veggies, with serve with pork chops or chicken breast or hot dog chunks, whatever you like. You can easily stretch it out by adding it to a can of plain beans, too - I just adda  little more curry and add to rinsed beans. That takes the saltiness down a bit, too.

review/text: The three products from Kitchens of India which I tried were all excellent, and typical Indian. My wife liked them too.I particularly liked the Indian Jugalbandi music enclosed with Navratan Korma and Palak Paneer. They were bought from Amazon.

review/summary: Quality control problem
review/text: I just cancelled a subscribe and save on this because of a problem with the quality control.  3 packs out of 6 I opened had less than a dozen red kidney beans in each pack. It was more like a thin soup than the Curry as pictured on the packages. The other 3 packages had the proper among of red kidney beans.

review/summary: yummy and chewy
review/text: Quick and easy meal. Very tasty, and as a vegetarian<br />I like that there is some chewiness to it.  I especially<br />like this on chilly evenings, or when I turn the a/c down<br />and pretend it's a chilly evening :) (Live in southern part<br />of Florida so I have to pretend a lot lol)
