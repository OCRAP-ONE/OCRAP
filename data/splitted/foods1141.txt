review/summary: All Non GMO Grains
review/text: From Great River's site:<br /><br />CERTIFIED ORGANIC NON GMO Grains<br /><br />From our Facebook page:<br /><br />"I get questions regarding the GMO status of our products so I thought I would post here for our friends. All Great River Organic products are produced from non-gmo grains. It is true however that there is some cross pollination that occurs in nature especially in corn so while the planted seeds are non-gmo you can pick up traces of gmo in testing. Typically these are at a very very low percentage."

review/summary: love my bread n stuff
review/text: for lack of comparison, i am not sure how Great River compare with other brands of flours.  However, the bread from my bread machine made with this organic bread flour is heavenly.  very soft yet chewy and full of flavor.  It's a total joy to eat.  I also love the cake i baked w/ this pastry flour.  I haven't gotten around to use the corn flour, but i'd imagine it is just as great.  the price is better than buying organic flour from my local safeway w/ save and subscribe.  shipping is also very fast.  all in all, great product and i feel very comfortable feeding what i made to my little ones.

review/summary: Great Deal on a Fantastic Multi-Grain Flour
review/text: Ordered this multi-grain flour in an attempt to bake bread with a lower glycemic index. The price for the flour, with free shipping, is very reasonable and the quality of the flour (including the excellent packaging) is just outstanding! Our first loaves using this flour turned out INCREDIBLE! Thank you Great River Organic Milling for a stellar product and amazon for a great deal, which arrived at our doorstep much sooner than anticipated!

review/summary: Review changed!! No longer best ever!!
review/text: Original review: You would think the difference would be negligible, but there is a huge taste and texture difference between these nuts and your run of the mill Planters or Fisher nuts. Too expensive to buy all the time (I am on low carb and snack on nuts a lot), but definitely worth getting for a lovely little gnosh now and then!<br /><br />Update second purchase 6/1/2011 Dropped from a 5 star rating to a run of the mill 2 star rating. They were on sale so I ordered two bags - big mistake. These are nowhere near as good as the first bag I bought. The nuts are less fresh and 1 pound 10.9 oz of these nuts were almonds and cashews, probably more than that because I ate a few of them, so probably about 6oz of these nuts were something besides almond/blanched almonds/cashews - too bad because the last bag I bought seemed to have more of the "goodies" and less of the filler nuts and a lot of the pecans were flat and hard, as are some of the almonds. Given a choice between these and the Planters deluxe w/macadamia, I'd have to go with Planters...too bad, they were awesome. Guess I'll return that second bag. :(  (I don't really like almonds and cashews all that much)<br /><br />I can no longer enthusiastically recommend them...what a shame. I was really looking forward to this delivery. :(

review/summary: Not as good as the ones I bought when living in El Paso area
review/text: I lived for 11 years near El Paso and occasionally would buy deluxe mixed nuts from their headquarters store. As I recall, the nuts in the bag were larger, and tastier. These are better than average, but don't quite measure up. Maybe these are the "export" version. This doesn't mean you won't find these these best mixed nuts you have ever tasted.  They just don't quite measure up for me.

review/summary: MISLEADING - CONSUMER BEWARE
review/text: I bought this because it said it was "Gluten Free  No MSG" on the label in the picture.  When I received it and read the ingredients I found it contains Monoammonium Glutamate.  This ingredient contains the same processed free glutamic acid as MSG (Monosoduim Glutamate).  It is the processed free glutamic acid that causes all of the bad side effects of MSG!<br /><br />So, the label is extremely misleading.  If you  don't want the side effects of MSG don't buy this because it still contains the same processed free glutamic acid which causes the side effects!

review/summary: Not what I'd hoped, but it'll do
review/text: I have several recipes which call for chicken broth, but I am now on a low-sodium diet.  Fat-Free/50%Reduced Sodium Chicken Broth (such as College Inn) still has 450mg of sodium per 1 cup and I use 2-3 cups per recipe... and that total amount is unacceptable for me.  My only other recourse would have been to make my own chicken stock  (and I'm simply not that motivated lol)<br /><br />This product is a good substitute for chicken broth in recipes if you're on a low sodium diet, however, it does not have the taste of traditional canned chicken broth.  As another reviewer mentioned, it has an overwhelming celery seed taste/smell to it (although, oddly enough, celery is not listed as an ingredient).  I haven't tried the Wyler's sodium free version so I don't know how it compares flavor-wise and as far as I know there is no sodium free chicken version from Knorr.<br /><br />The price is good for the amount you get - much less expensive in the long run than buying the 8 packets box, though you might want to try a box first to see if you like the taste before committing to Amazon's pack of 6 jars.  I gave this 3 stars because while it works for recipes which call for chicken broth and I'm glad to have a sodium free version, I couldn't say it was a very good-tasting broth.  It'll do.<br /><br />For those of you who are counting:  1 tsp. bouillon to 1 cup water = 1 cup broth.  According to the label, each jar makes 26 cups and it is Gluten free, no MSG.  There are 10 calories per cup, 0 sodium, 0 trans-fat, 1 gram sugar.

review/text: I'm trying to cut down on my salt because of blood pressure. This stuff isn't the most "natural" chicken bouillon, but it does taste like chicken, at least to me. It lets me do some dishes which might be salt content prohibitive were I using the traditional bouillon. On the whole, it's a good product if you must cut your salt. If not, there's nothing wrong with the taste, but I'd probably be trying to go for products with more actual chicken in the ingredients. I do use low sodium chicken broth as well.

review/summary: I WANT to love it
review/text: The pros:  Herb Ox is the only sodium-free bouillon I've been able to find that is both salt and MSG free.  Also, this larger size is not usually available in stores.  The cons:  The broth this bouillon makes tastes like celery.  Not celery and chicken, not celery and onion, not even celery and pepper.  Just...celery.  I know that a sodium-free bouillon is not going to taste anything like regular chicken bouillon, but try as I might I could not find any semblance of chicken flavor in this whatsoever.  I am a soup addict and am trying to eliminating as much salt from my diet as possible, so I REALLY wanted to love this product.  I will still use it and hope against hope that I develop some kind of taste (or tolerance) for it.  Perhaps I can doctor it with garlic powder and make it a little more flavorful.  For me personally, at this point the only purpose I think this will serve for me is a milder version of celery seed.

review/text: When you just need something crunchy and salty, these fill the bill.  Count out 30 of them and sit down to a crunchy snack with only 110 calories.  They are crisp and sort of similar to potato chips, but less oily. I generally eat 15 of them and find it satisfies me just as much as a 150 calorie bag of potato chips, for only 55 calories.  Ideally, I would avoid a snack entirely.  But when I just feel like I've gotta have one, these are great to have around.  I open the package and count them into serving size baggies right off the bat so I am not tempted to just eat from the box without counting.

review/summary: Crunchy and satisfying, but too high in sodium. :(
review/text: Picked up a box of Kellogg's Special K cracker chips (Sea Salt variety) today at the grocery store (I did not buy from Amazon).  They also come in at least one other flavor that I saw--Sour Cream and Onion.<br /><br />Taste and Texture:  They are crunchy, potatoey and a little on the thick side compared to most potato chips.  I was reminded of the look and texture of Munchos with a flavor combo of Munchos and Pringles.  They are small and round (about the size of a Ritz cracker) and have a bit of a scoop shape.<br /><br />Being hypertensive and not a big salt user, my palate tends to be sensitive to over-salty foods.  I found these chips appropriately salty to my tastebuds, so they may not be salty enough for a true salt junky.<br /><br />Nutrition Information:  I compared the nutrition facts on these cracker chips to the brand of potato chips I usually buy--Utz Natural 40% Reduced Fat Kettle Cooked.  The serving size on the Special K chips is 30 chips (30 grams) whereas the Utz serving size is 20 chips at 28 grams--not exactly the same, but close.  Here is how they stack up nutritionally when put head-to-head:<br /><br />Utz 40% Reduced Fat Chips<br /><br />Calories  130<br />Total Fat  6g<br />Sat Fat  0.5g<br />Sodium  75mg<br />Total carbs  18g<br />Fiber  1g<br />Sugars  0g<br />Protein  2g<br /><br />Special K Cracker Chips<br /><br />Calories  110<br />Total Fat  2.5<br />Sat Fat  0<br />Sodium  230mg<br />Total carbs  23g<br />Fiber  3g<br />Sugars  &lt;1g<br />Protein  2g<br /><br />So Special K wins on calories (minimally), total fat (substantially), sat fat (minimally) and fiber, but loses on sodium (substantially), carbs and sugar.<br /><br />While I found the Special K cracker chips enjoyable, I do not find them nutritionally superior enough (and definitely not superior enough in taste and texture) to the chips I'm already eating to switch, especially when I only buy a bag or two of chips per month and when the Special K cracker chips have 3 times the sodium of my regular chips.  However, if you are looking for something with less total fat, and sodium isn't going to be a health problem for you, then the Special K product may be for you.

review/text: A friend at work turned me on to Special K cracker chips and I am hooked. I love all flavors, these are at the top, along with the cheddar. They have a nice flavor, not too busy and not too salty. When I bring the box home, I measure out servings into sandwich bags and put the baggies in the box, so when I am craving, I just reach in the box and the serving is ready to go!

review/summary: Fantastic low calorie potato chip substitute.
review/text: My husband and I both enjoy these. Crunchy and flavorful. A serving is approximately 30 cracker chips for, I believe, 110 calories. Can't beat that. Prefer the plain to other flavors. Only downside is they have a fair amount of sodium for those who are watching their salt intake.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: These are super delicious! Just enough salt to cure my 'fix' but much healthier and better tasting than regular potato chips. Even my 15yr old daughter loved them...said they weren't like chips, not like crackers, not what she was expecting but really good and I would agree. And at a much better price than any local store I found them in.

review/text: These crackers are so good, so crunchy, so salty, and you can eat the whole box in one sitting and it's less than 400 calories.  I'll be honest, I tend to over eat, so things like this are awesome because I can just munch away without doing too much damage.  I've been waiting for something like this!  Also great with peanut butter.

review/text: I am absolutely over-the-top pleased with Amazon's Subscribe and Save.  I have several items on standard order.  The Kellogg's Sea Salt Cracker Chips happen to be just one of the items.  My local Walmart Supercenter carries what they like from week to week, not necessarily what I like.  I first purchased these since I am conscious of calories, fat, and carbs.  I loved the taste, but the next week NO SEA SALT flavor.  I waited a month before I saw it again - on and off, on and off - until I found Amazon's program.  Same thing with the Kellogg's Multigrain Crackers.  I now have them on order.  Amazon's free and fast deliver is superb.  I love everything I get with Amazon.  I particularly like reading the reviews they provide to help me make up my mind.  I hope this helps someone on the fence about Subscribe and Save to jump in and enjoy having your favorites delivered to your door at a cheaper than local price.  ENJOY!!!!

review/text: We're big fans of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005QD62VM">Keebler Townhouse Flatbread Crisps with Olive Oil & Sea Salt - 28.5oz Box</a> at our house, so when I saw the Special K crackers I was eager to give them a try because you get so many more for a lot fewer calories. The Special K cracker is a bit like a Pop Chip texture, but the taste is pure salt and cardboard. I had three and then decided that eating three of the more calorie dense crackers would satisfy my salty urge way more than 30 of these crackers ever would.

review/summary: Best microwave popcorn ever!
review/text: I don't have any idea what beachgirl85 (another reviewer) is talking about.  First, this isn't the Newman's Own Organic popcorn - it's the non-organic version.  So maybe she just posted her review for the wrong product (I have never tried the Newman's Own Organic popcorn).  Second, I have been eating this microwave popcorn, in the Natural flavor, for somewhere around 15 years.  I tried it when Consumer Reports rated it the best microwave popcorn many long years ago.  It has a wonderful, light flavor.  What I like best about it, though, is that it is not swimming in salt like most of the microwave popcorns.  It definitely has salt, don't get me wrong, but the salt content to me is just perfect.  You can even check the sodium level on the nutritional information and see that it is lower than most other microwave popcorns - it has only 200 mg sodium per serving (3.5 cups), where Act II, a popular brand, has 310 mg per serving, and Orville Redenbacher (which does not seem to have a natural flavor any more, though I could be wrong) has 390 mg per serving of its butter flavor.  I want salt on my popcorn, but not so much that all I taste is salt!  This popcorn is the best microwave popcorn I have ever tried.  I order it by the case online because I can't find it in my local grocery stores.  Give it a try!

review/summary: superb popcorn - best for sure
review/text: I'm with the review in favor of this popcorn. again, no idea what the negative reviewer is talking about. indeed, it's not organic, so they're comparing apples to oranges. and anyway, they're nuts saying it's fake and salty. ON THE CONTRARY. I've spent 12 yrs on the west coast, half in LA where I learned how to eat very healthily. half in SF where I went more organic, less meat and avoiding preservatives. I lucked out randomly trying it from a small grocer here in Manhattan and am completely impressed. absolutely tastes superb. and I never ate microwave popcorn since it generally wigs me out -- the chemicals, stench, etc. this one uses subtle but absolutely enough flavor and tastes VERY natural. I've raved about it to family, who can't believe it also doesn't leave your microwave smelling - at all! that is a miracle, and testament to it's decent ingredients.

review/summary: Excellent natural popcorn
review/text: Natural, butter-free microwave popcorn is becoming very hard to find.  Thank goodness Newman's Own follows its usual high quality with this product.  The bag pops almost completely and the contents tastes just like popcorn, not like the greasy artificial quasi-butter-like-substance most microwave popcorns taste like.  If you want butter, melt some real stuff and put it on yourself.  But personally, this stuff doesn't need it.

review/summary: If Lucky Charms were a drug, I'd be in rehab....
review/text: The first thing I have to say is that people who pick out the marshmallows and waste the rest should be exiled from this country. This is the best cereal out there. No part of it should ever be wasted. Especially the leftover milk at the bottom of the bowl. The sweet aftertaste of the LC's make the milk heavenly. I eat a bowl of LC's in about 4 minutes average so Amazon's 5 box deal is more of a challenge than a bargain to me. So in conclusion, whether you buy this in your local grocery store or off the divine online shop, Amazon, you really can't go wrong with Lucky Charms.<br /><br />Thank you and goodnight.

review/text: Last Christmas I left my husband with a batch of sugar cookie dough in the fridge and told him to make Christmas cookies.  So, he cut out and baked dozens of trees.  Palm trees.  Hmmm, I never thought palm trees were particularly Christmas-y, but what do I know?  I then assigned him the task of decorating the cookies and left him with a variety of options and was a bit timid to see what he would do.  What he did was pipe them all in white and then dust them with opal sanding sugar.  They looked gorgeous and very festive.  I think the cookies got more compliments than anything else we prepared for the party!

Since I really didn't need a pound, I decided to keep this product.  I agree with the other review that rated these expensive for what they are -- just slightly colored sugar.<br /><br />I sprinkled them on my daughter's birthday cake and she liked them.  A few minutes (10 at the most) later when we cut the cake, the had already melted/dissolved into the frosting.  I used them on white frosting and they were very had to see, even at application.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: Opal Sanding Sugar for Glistening Icicle Cookies
review/text: The sugar was perfect, I ordered it to go on a cookie I make only at Christmas time.  The cookie is an almond flavored one that you make by chiliing the dough and then cutting off a small piece which you make into a ball and then roll by hand out so it is about 9 inches long.  You try to keept it a little thicker in the very middle so when you twist it, it has a tapered look.  You leave the top with a small opening so you can put a pretty ribbon thru it like it can be hung on the tree.  When they are cooked and still warm you put a thin coating on them of powdered sugar and almond flavoring and water and when they are still sticky, you sprinkle the sugar on.  They came out beautiful, I then put them in an old cookie tin and serve them up to company, they think I am soooooo talented and it is so easy.

review/summary: Seems like a good food, but watch out for urinary tract issues...
review/text: My cat recently tested positive for a number of food allergies (several of them being the top ingredients in most cat foods! Argh!). So I went looking for an alternative food & came across Blue Buffalo.  After feeding this to him for several weeks, he began having trouble urinating.  He was treated for a UTI (urinary tract infection) and recovered, but soon acquired a second UTI.  Frustrated, I looked to the food as a possible cause.  Sure enough, not long after I took him off the Blue Buffalo food his infection cleared up and hasn't been back since.

review/summary: Great coffee
review/text: I tried about twenty brands and different roast. I like this one the best. It is not too sharp and has a deep and lasting aroma. People who tried it loves it. Keep in mind that the grander is the key so try to get it as fine as possible. it depends on your espresso machine through. Price wise. It is changing so keep an eye on it, it is all about timing. Buying through Amazon was the best deal for me thus far and I received it (a few time) promptly.<br />I don't understand why one reviewer rated the product as one star because he has not received it. Perhaps a user error but this is a review for Amazon service and not to the product. People have to be less emotional when they review products and to be fair rather then expressing their frustration through this channel. We are helping each other after all.<br />Enjoy

review/summary: Excellent-tasting pods, size seems a little off
review/text: These espresso pods produce a good taste and nice crema from my basic espresso maker. The only slight problem is they don't exactly fit in the e.s.e. pod holder of my machine so I balance them on top of the holder before installing to brew.  I haven't had this trouble with any other brand...and I've tried every brand in the sampler bag from podmerchant.

review/summary: Great espresso at home, no mess
review/text: This product is a great thing for anyone who loves espresso, and wants to make it at home.  There's no grinding, no mess, no tamping, or anything else that makes the science of great espresso so challenging.  The only downside to using these is that you need to purchase a machine capable of using them.  We have one, and it's a beautiful machine (the Francis Francis X1) but it cost close to $1000.  If you enjoy espresso a lot, the machine will pay itself back compared to trips to Starbucks or your local coffee shop every day.  If you are an infrequent consumer, you may want to look at a less expensive option.  Nonetheless, these pods are fantastic, and the coffee is exquisite.

I filled up a little parmesan shaker and one shake of this stuff onto a single portion definitely kicks it up a notch, 2-3 shakes on a single portion and its borderline inedible at times.  I love spicy though, heck...i even grow ghost chili's (bhut jolokia) in the summertime so this stuff is right up my alley!  It helps me get through those winters after all my pepper plants in the garden have shut down.  This 20oz jar is going to last forever, i think i've only filled up my shaker twice since i bought the stuff nearly 4 months ago.  If you like spicy powder...check this one out.

review/summary: Love it!!
review/text: This tea is so nice. It brews up slightly sweet with the roses bringing a flowery flavor to the green tea. I put stevia in it once brewed, making it even sweeter. It has very high rose petal to green tea ratio, but you still get that clean taste in your mouth from the green tea. I bought 2 boxes on Amazon thinking it would last forever, but now I'm almost through my 2nd box! I will definitely get it again. I've also tried their other green tea with rose petals and lemon verbena (It's called Very Goethe, I think), and I liked that one much less. It is much more herbal tasting, and not sweet at all. I liked the Rose Alongi much better than that one and also other rose + green tea combos I've tried from other tea makers.

review/summary: Good Product, Expires TOO Soon
review/text: Received this product on 20Jan11, Expires 20Mar11 (`60-days). Now I know that it is 'Organic' and should not contain the normal preservative 'junk' that other foods contain, but shouldn't it expire (proper storage considered (cool/dry place etc) to be common sense) more than 60-days from date of receipt? I feel that we received product that was FIFO, which is good warehousing, IF the product has any chance of being consumed within a REASONABLE time period. For my family, 60-days is NOT reasonable for 6 bags of flour, not sure I know who that would be reasonable for short of a retail food store.<br /><br />Since I cannot leave Vendor Feedback, which would not be over 3 stars, I want to say that upon my contact with Amazon Customer Service (yes, it DOES exist) I was treated well and the situation was somewhat solved, clearly to my satisfaction. Thanks Amazon! I just wish that Amazon was that helpful when I had my DIRECTV Store opened with them as a Vendor!<br /><br />Thanks for listening and be sure to inquire about the expiration date before you buy.

review/summary: Some Dogs love them; Owners question
review/text: Two little Yorkies basically love these little chicken wrapped biscuits.  Each morning each one gets 2 of them and they start the process of enjoying them.  Then after a few minutes they finish with a nice little mess.  I do not understand but near the end of the process they either just get tired of eating them or do not like them or they are suggesting that they want to share the leftovers with us.  Regardless, we always have a few pieces on the floor that have to be vacuumed.  No big deal, however.  There are three treats these critters love:  these biscuits, pig snouts and freeze dried livers.  I would love to have a return of all the money we have spent on other treats that did not make it to the eating condition.  Yorkies are blatantly picky (or at least these ones) and it's one sniff and eaten or gone to the neighbor's dogs.  Maybe that's where the expression "gone to the dogs" originates.  If you buy food and do not like it then give it to the dogs.  Bottom line:  great for us, love the little plastic container and they love the treats.  We'll be back for more.

The addition of stevia leaf makes this enjoyable even without additional sweetner, but you may want to add a packet of stevia to sweeten it further.<br /><br />The organic tea and the philosophy behind the blends makes this a satisfying beverage. As Zhena says: "So enjoy, because with each sip, you are helping to save the world."<br /><br />This is a Fair Trade Certified product. I love the containers and the round shape of the tea bags.

review/text: For quite some time, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Tabasco Brand Buffalo Style Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I consider to be a disappointment.  I have tried this product several times, but my opinion of it has not changed.  Even though it is not bad, it is not good, either--it has a dull flavor.  When it comes to the heat level, neither is it too hot nor too mild.  I am glad that I gave this product a shot, but I just am not pleased with it.  Actually, I rate this hot sauce 2.5 stars.
