review/text: Ordered "Dark Magic K-Cup - Box of 2". Therefore should be each box of 24 x 2 = 48 K-cups. I only received 1 box of 24. The company changes its name frequently and sends wrong quantity. Beware of non- Amazon sellers. Amazon contacted and will investigate the fraud. However, Amazon has easy return process.

review/text: Seeing such great deals here for Green Mountain Coffees, i assumed they would have the best deal on my Dark Magic blend I love. Most of the come in 2 packs with 24 in a pack. but the Dark Magic is clearly the exception. It is way over priced here. I can get an 18 pack in Target for $10, but low and behold over at coffee cow a 24 pack is 12.99 much better deal.

review/summary: Smooth and rich
review/text: Green Mountain Coffee Roasters began life as a cafe in rural Vermont. They specialized in quality coffee, and continue that tradition through to today.<br /><br />Now, with a name like Dark Magic Extra Bold, you might expect an overpowering coffee - you know, the kind that will grow hair on your chest whether you want it or not? Well, in fact, this coffee is smooth and rich, and (if made right) not overpowering at all. I find this to be a delicious coffee, one that I enjoy any day of the week.<br /><br />(Review of Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold K-cup)

review/summary: Hits the Spot in the Morning
review/text: My Doctor only allows me two cups of caffeinated coffee per day, and if that is all I'm going to get, then by George this is the brand and the roast I'm going to be drinking!<br /><br />Rich, full bodied and aromatic. A hint in the aroma of spices, deep dark color, a taste that will perk you up and get you ready for the day.  There is  no bitterness, and this Dark Magic makes an excellent iced coffee as well as a superb hot coffee.<br />I also drink this later on in the day, (I drink more cups than I would like to admit in public) decaffeinated and it shares the same attributes as the fully caffeinated one.<br /><br />As far as expense goes---well yes it is more expensive than a store brand, but it truly is worth it. Not everyone shares my addiction so it won't be as costly for you as it is for me, and I think it works out to be about 66 cents a cup (without additives of sugar, creamer etc.) a far cry from anything you can get from any coffee shop, or drive thru.

review/text: There is nothing so good as Dark Magic.  I wasn't that crazy about it when they changed it to be stronger a few years ago but now I like it.  I keep my Keurig brewer at the smallest cup setting and use 2 Dark Magics to fill a cup.  It's heaven.<br /><br />My husband likes coffee water (as someone in a review labeled it)and he goes for the Breakfast Blend on a larger cup setting.  But that is the wonderful thing about K-cups.  You can each have what you want.

review/text: The extra bold hints at a flavour that is strong with solid highpoints and this selecion is close to ideal. I have been using the Sumatran for a while but it was not strong enough. This selection is a little stronger but it tastes like a bit more roasting is all that separates the two. If you use this for a travel cup (8oz or more), it will not be as flavourful. I found that this flavour "grows" on you and a work colleague of mine absolutely loves this one.

review/summary: Not the same quality!
review/text: I compared the 18 cup Dark Magic (from Target) to the 50 cup Dark Magic(from Amazon), since the labeling and k-cup is markedly different.  The coffee did not taste as rich, so I became more curious.<br /><br />I opened the k-cups to find the 50 cup filters have a visible cross hatch pattern, as compared to a dense firm paper style.  I used a microscope to see the difference in density, as well.  The weave of the fibers of the 50 pack is not as closely bound.<br /><br />The coffee granules are finer in the 18 cup, giving the coffee a different texture on the fingers.  The 50 pack ground coffee appeared 50%-100% larger under the microscope.<br /><br />I hope that Keurig can shed some light on my findings!  I have photos I can submit.  I notice amazon is out of stock, currently.  Perhaps, Keurig is looking into the matter.

review/text: My partner was getting distressed with the lack of taste in her K-cup coffee (my bad, since I'm the one who buys the coffee), and she requested something with a bolder taste. So, I tried this. We have used Green Mountain Coffee before, but not this particular product.<br /><br />Bottom line. My partner really enjoys this. The taste meets her expectations. Indeed, although I am supposed to keep my intake of caffeine fairly low, I have also tried this on occasion--and I, too, am satisfied.<br /><br />So, if you want a bolder flavor, this is worth considering.

review/text: This is a robust, aromatic and satisfying blend with balanced acidity and no bitterness.  It's a complex roast that's reminiscent of espresso with a subtly sweet taste, I love it.  I have had a difficult time finding truly strong, yet flavorful coffee for my Keurig brewer--Timothy's coffees are too acidic and Van Houtte blends lacked complexity--and  I've finally found several extra bold flavors from Green Mountain roasts that really deliver that morning one-two punch.  For comparison, my other favorites are the Espresso blend (sadly now discontinued) and Double Black Diamond (a bit more of a smoky flavor).  And for the most potent flavor profile, the Barista Prima Italian Roast is magnifico!

I did a search for extra dark coffee and found these for significantly less.  This coffee is perfect.  Rich, dark, flavorful, not at all bitter.  Smooth and delicious.  If you like dark roasts (French, Italian, etc) and have a k-cup machine, this is the coffee for you.

review/text: I just recently got my first Keurig machine (I say first because I love it, and plan to get the bigger pro model eventually), and a couple of sampler boxes. This was the best of the flavors I sampled, and that says alot because I loved most of them. I am a lifelong espresso drinker (Cubans start giving their kids sips at like age 3) so I like a strong coffee. This one is definitely that. It doesn't, however, suffer from the bitter aftertaste or "burnt" flavor of many bold blends. Best of all, with the Keurig machines you get the same flavor EVERY time.

review/summary: Product has changed
review/text: I've bee subscribing to this coffee for months now and have had multiple shipments, all quality until this last shipment.  I opened the new box today, made a cup, and wondered why it was so watery. Made a second thinking it was a fluke. It was not.  Seems now 3 kcups into the box, the whole box is full of kcups with about half the coffee in them there should be.  Instead of it being strong and bold like dark magic is supposed to be (I've drank this coffee daily for two years now so I should know)... It's weak and watery even on making a smaller cup of it.  Amazon won't let me return it.  I'm a dedicated amazon customer and use subscribe and save for many items.  If they won't treat me like a dedicated customer I might be stopping my membership.  Hoping they'll make it right.

review/summary: favorite 50 cent KCup is still elusive
review/text: Am still searching for a 50 cent K-Cup with decent flavor. This particular Extra Bold K-Cup is ok but is not anything special. Looking for discounts is tedious and tiresome. Have pretty much decided that the 50 count or 100 count "value" packs offer the best price available. Others swear by CostCo so it does help to shop around but the 50 cent K-Cup is still elusive. Extra Bold K-Cups as a whole seem to have better flavor than the regular variety.

review/text: We ran out of K-cups and I absolutely cannot begin my day without my coffee-jolt.  (WAY better than Red Bull, etc.)  Green Mountain Coffee is our preferred brand/flavor, so I decided to scan through Amazon.com to see if they carried it.  A 50-count box of Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic, (Extra Bold), was available at a crazy-low price, so I ordered it.  Not only did it arrive in perfect shape, before the promised delivery date, but there was 51 K-cups in the box!  A bonus!  Great coffee and great service at a great price!

review/summary: Awesome coffee
review/text: I bought the Keurig because when I wake up in the morning I'm a zombie that runs into walls and can't see past my nose, so I wanted a machine that would take any possibility of brain power needed out of making coffee for that oh so needed caffein punch in order to wake from my stupor. I have found though that the k-cups tend to produce watery and bland coffee at best, which is why it was such a nice surprise to find these dark magic extra bold k-cups! These things actually taste like decent coffee and aren't watery or acidic. Thanks green mountain for an awesome product and for curing my morning zombie woes! Oh and although a small gesture, I noticed that they shipped me 51 k-cups, thanks for the 1 extra!

review/text: I have been drinking dark magic for a long time, this in no way compares, its horrible, watery. I should have been suspicious when the coffee pods were floating free in the box rather than packed in the company box. I thought the first cup was an accident but today it tastes just as bad. Very disappointing and no return policy. Don't buy it its junk.

review/text: I needed to change up from the coffee that I was drinking due to it being so much money. I tried a breakfast blend but it was so weak I gave the rest away. Decided to give this a try and so glad I did. The taste is right up there with my old favorite Dunkin Donuts coffee and the cost is much lower. I use fat-free half and half and splenda so it does make it alittle weaker, so thats perfect for my taste buds.

I saw that you have 3 options for the 'liquid' ingredient. On my very first try, I used plain greek yogurt! 40 minutes later I was enjoying wonderful Irish soda bread!! It was so good I'm going to stick with the yogurt! I don't enjoy baking, but this was so easy.  Yes, the dough is sticky, but after kneading for 2 min. as directed, I put a nice 'ball' of dough in my cake pan. I made it today, am reviewing it now, and will be ordering more when I'm done with this!! Yum!!

review/summary: Oh so virital flavorings
review/text: We love flavored coffees but the price is just to high so I bought orange flavor, hazelnut flavor, cherry flavor, caramel flavor, and chocolate flavor powers, to make my own and they work very well. we can flavor by the cup or the pot and we are very happy with them.<br /><br />With some experimentation we fond all but the chocolate dissolve in cold. So we can and do use it in ice coffee, and we can now make our own flavored water with out having to pay the overly high price.

review/summary: a tangy and flavorful introduction to Brianna's salad dressings...
review/text: The labels on Brianna's salad dressing read 'Award Winning.' I wanted to know why, so, on a whim, we got a chance to taste a bottle of Ginger Mandarin dressing, for the experience. It had a lovely, gingery, mandarin-infused taste, along with the zest of tamari sauce (soy sauce). Just so you know, this dressing does have quite a does of added sugar in the recipe, but, it didn't stop me from tossing it in with my mixed greens and sliced tomatoes....Num, num, num!

review/summary: Wonderful oatcakes
review/text: These oatcakes have a fine, crumbly texture, and a lovely well-balanced flavor.  Not a hint of chewiness or bitterness/sourness that you sometimes get with oatcakes.  I like them with a thin slice of good cheddar, or raspberry jam or honey, or even on their own.  Having been in the US for a few years, I'm getting cravings for them...!

review/summary: Tasty treat!
review/text: I bought these berries as I needed to add something to my cart for super saver shipping.  I was planning to get goji berries from Whole Foods in bulk, the cheapest source by me for organic gojis in town.  They run about $18 a pound there.  I got them on sale here for $11-12.  I liked the ones from Whole Foods, but these are even better!  They are fresher, probably since they are put reasonably quickly into the bags and sealed.  The other ones taste like some sort of gummy fruit rolll-up type treat (good), but these actually taste like a fruit.  You should buy some.  The only problem is that I eat them too quickly, they should be called wolf-them-down-berry.

review/summary: something that tastes very good and is very good for you
review/text: I tried a bar of these through UBERSAMPLES organic sampling program and I must say this was surprisingly tasty and had no aftertaste.  I was expecting the worst since it's chock full of good stuff like goji berries, acai, mangosteen and pomegranate. The truth is I usually cannot stand a lot of these brand-name or private-label nutrition/sustenance bars, drinks, and supplements. I have tried a lot of them also.<br /><br />This one is so good, it just taste like a slightly-sweet (NOT THE USUAL SUPER-SWEET) dried fruit.

review/summary: Ready to feed --- after 30 min....
review/text: We've previously been very happy with the ready to feed bottles of similac. Our son likes them, spits up less and the bottles are very convenient when we're out and about. They are however fairly heavy and not so cost efficient, so we decided to buy the singles.<br /><br />Unfortunately the idea of the singles are better than the actual use. Size and price is good, but the powder does not dissolve easily. You either have to shake very hard, or shake gently for a very long time to dissolve the powder. So if you have a hungry infant, your choice is to have the baby scream because of hunger whilst preparing the formula, or risk an upset stomach later as the heavy shaking traps airbubbles in the formula. Naturally you could prepare the formula prior to the time of feeding, but in a way that defeats the purpose of the singles. The formula must also be used within a certain period of time, so your infant needs to be pretty regular in terms of feedingtimes.<br /><br />All in all, I think it deserves a some positive feedback on the quality of the formula and the convenient packaging, but unfortunately the cons outweighs the pros on this particular product.

review/summary: The only formula my son will drink, and so convenient
review/text: My son refused formula for 5 months, but I was having the liquid gold problem so we kept trying different types.  Finally, we tried this powdered version of similac blue (we had previously tried to liquid form with no luck).  He drank it.  Well, he drank it after some fuss, and me alternating between nursing (with almost no milk) and giving him the bottle, back and forth and back and forth.  He finally learned that I little milk at night and he now accepts this formula (and only this formula).  I am also too shy to nurse-in-public.  So he has, on occasion, consumed this when we are out and about, with little fuss.  I'm torn - sad not to be exclusively nursing, but THRILLED about my new flexibility.

review/summary: An Olive Oil with REAL flavor
review/text: This is simply the best I've tasted and worth the price. It's bold and will hold its own in salad dressings, dipping oils, sauteeing and for adding to just about any light recipe, although I doubt I'd bury this extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) in a sauce or a hearty stew; it's too good for disguising. I don't care for subtle olive oils. This one isn't, and it's become my EVOO of choice (cold-pressed). Be aware that Columela makes several different types of EVOO, so this review is meant to address only this particular varietal.

review/text: I bought this olive oil because it was the top rated by America's Test Kitchen, and I wasn't disappointed.  It has excellent flavor and color - much better than anything I've been able to find at the local stores.  I use it primarily for dipping bread and for salads, as the flavor is too good to use for cooking - I use my regular supermarket olive oil for that.  Highly recommended.

review/text: I am a Cooks Illustrated fan and don't hesitate to try what they recommend.  Once again, they were right on target.  This olive oil is wonderfully light on the tongue with complex flavor.  It has made a significant difference in the dishes that I prepare where olive oil plays a vital part.  Great for drizzling, too.  I shall certainly purchase again....and again.

review/summary: good but expensive olive oil
review/text: Fruitty, sweet, smooth tasting olive oil with a hint of bitterness that is a characteristic of good olive oil.  Expensive and made more expensive by the shipping cost from the seller.  I'm not sure how old the oil is since it's travelled from Europe and perhaps might not be as fresh tasting as it can be.  I am not likely to purchase this again since there is a better alternative.  I really like California Olive Ranch's extra  virgin olive oil, it's fruitty, fresh, and smooth, and I do not miss the slight olive bitterness and tang that Columela has, and I like that it comes from my home state and is not imported, it's always fresh tasting.

review/text: I wanted to love this.  Columela was rated #1 in Cooks Illustrated.  They mentioned a 'peppery finish'.  I did not get this at all.  It just tasted like plain olive oil with nothing special to write about. I bought this at Stop & Shop supermarket and it had the red drawing on the bottle at the bottom like is shown in the picture.<br />  I did try a bottle of unfiltered olive oil from Whole Foods that I really liked, it had a grassy taste and a peppery finish so I do know the difference.  The brand I like is Frantoia Barbera Extra Virgin Olive Oil 17oz at Whole Foods for $17.
