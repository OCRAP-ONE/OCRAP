review/summary: best coffee ever
review/text: I was having trouble finding a good everyday coffee for my new Keurig. I like a strong flavor, but all the "bold" ones I tried were too bitter, some even tasted burned. The "not-bold" ones were too weak. I decided to give the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser a try because of the reviews, recommendations from friends, and I like their minimal packaging. This coffee is great! Exactly what I was looking for, a strong rich coffee flavor with no bitterness. Perfect for me!

review/text: I have used a K-cups for years. Found San Francisco Bay Coffee cups and decided to give a try.  As soon as I opened the first bag I knew it was going to be amazing.<br />The smell of the coffee grounds was awesome.  I did not know until then how I missed the smell of fresh grounds.  That woke me up immediately. Love the Fog Chaser coffee!  Can not wait to try other flavors!  Highly recommend.

review/summary: Now the standard in our household
review/text: I like a bolder cup of coffee - not "Starbucks-bold" but full bodied and flavorful.  The SF Bay Fog Chaser really fits that bill.  Not over the top strong but very flavorful.  Its great that this product offers competition to the traditional K-cups.  Price is lower but quality is very high.  We've never had an issue fitting this into our Keurig brewer.  The only issue mentioned by many others is the small "sediment" in the bottom of each cup.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious, best cup of coffee around!
review/text: I rarely rate things 5 stars, this coffee deserves the top rating. It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious. I can't think of a cup of coffee that I've bought anywhere that can beat the bold, rich flavor of this brand. It's like drinking a glass of fine wine. My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell. I doubt any of the pods I have will have time to ever get stale however, because I'm drinking them all the time.

review/summary: Excellent Taste and More Robust Brewing with These Type of Pods
review/text: I previously purchased a smaller quantity package of this coffee and, liking it as much as I did, I purchased this 80 count package as the price per cup is about 18% less per cup.  This coffee is strong, but not too strong, and good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a "clean" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods. I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  I believe I have found a new favorite coffee!

review/summary: Keurig Who????
review/text: I was so excited to get my box of Fog Chaser. I had been paying nearly $40 for Starbucks at a wholesale club and only for 40 cups. I had cut myself to one cup per day! Then my friend shared this link and I thought "Why not!" It arrived quickly, and smelled heavenly. I like dark, strong coffee, and I could tell by the smell it would fit the bill. The real test is in making it. I brewed it this morning--no grounds in my coffee, and no residue left in my cup. Wondered if the soft filter cup at the bottom would work, and it does. How great is that???? It doesn't taste like instant coffee either, which some imitations do. 80 cups for $33 is an awesome deal...that is around $0.42 a cup. If you buy the little boxes at WalMart you only get 18 for $10..which is around $0.61 per cup...you save $0.19 per cup, which doesn't sound like a lot, but you would spend $50 buying as much at WalMart to get 80 K cups. So you are saving $17. I love it!!! Order yours today, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Good Cup.. Great price.
review/text: I am one of those guys that dont like the rising price of k cups. This works great and makes a pretty good<br />cup of coffee. It is very easy to clean up.. just throw away. At the current price of 16.99 it is about .47<br />per cup or .40 with subscribe and safe. I also like saving money using the EKOBREW the refillable k cup filter, when you use that you can put in your own grinds and it costs about .25 for starbucks. This is a little easier when you are finished though and is a Good Value.

review/text: I was a bit leary when I ordered this, as it wasn't the traditional K-cup but no need to worry.  It worked just fine.  Only problem is, they don't fit in my K-cup carousel all that well and tend to fall out if I turn it too fast.  Beyond that, the coffee tastes just fine and I LOVE the aroma in the kitchen.  Since they have a kind of mesh/fabric back, the aroma of the coffee comes through.  I HAD to have a cup as soon as they arrived just 'cauze it smelled so good!

review/text: I'm pretty much a coffee snob and don't care for most of the choices offered for K-cups.  After trying the San Fracisco Bay French Roast I don't think I'll be able to go back to any of the other K-cups!  It tastes so much fresher than the others and has a rich flavor that beats most gourmet coffee at the high-end shops.  Try it if you like real coffee.

review/summary: Strong, But Not Acidic or Bitter
review/text: I like more full bodied, strong coffee, but usually find they are too bitter, acidic or taste like burnt grounds. The SF Bay Fogchaser was none of the above. I like the "cup" it's a lot less packaging than the normal k-cup (which isn't accepted in our recycling can). With these, I recycle the top and plastic ring and throw the rest into the compost pile. Yes, they look funny, and yes you need to put them into some sort of airtight container to keep them fresh, but a small change for a pretty good cup o' joe.

review/text: I love strong coffee - not bitter - but strong and flavorful.  I grew up in New Orleans and loved the coffee.  I have tried several "bold" coffees and find that they are not flavorful at all - just strong (and bitter).  I bought the fog chaser from the local grocery out of pure frustration of not being able to find anything in a K cup to my liking.  Low and behold I LOVE THIS COFFEE.  It is good, strong coffee with a ton of flavor - very smooth.  Those nay-sayers - stick with the mild/medium stuff.  If you want good strong coffee - this is it.

review/summary: Finally, Less Plastic and Really Bold  Coffee!
review/text: I just poured my first cup of San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers, and it is great! First of all, the Fog Chaser Coffee will do it's job to chase the Fog away: It is REALLY BOLD! I brewed a medium cup because I like bold coffee and was not sure if this brand would deliver. Next time I will not be afraid to brew a large cup. The coffee is rich, flavorful, and did I say Bold?<br /><br />Secondly, I love my Keurig, but hated feeling guilty about all the plastic I was adding to the landfills using the Keurig K-Cups. This pod uses at least 1/3 of the plastic of the standard K-Cup: There is a plastic ring holding the mesh coffee filter pod to the foil cap. Environmentally, this is a step in the right direction. I also feel the design of the pod is what allows the coffee to brew stronger, smoother and with more flavor!<br /><br />My husband does not like his coffee as bold as I do, so I look forward to trying out the other flavors of San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup.

review/text: I tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser since they have reduced the cost & plastic waste by reducing the packaging. I love a good strong cup of coffee and I love my Keurig brewer.  But I am a cheapskate at heart and hated paying the price for the regular K-cups. This is a great compromise.<br />Since it does not have the plastic cup base and is just a round filter hanging from the top ring, you have to keep them sealed in a zip-lock or similar air tight container or they will not stay fresh.  That is a small inconvenience I can live with.  They also reduce our use of plastic and the trash we generate and I suspect that there may be health benefits from not brewing the coffee in the little plastic cup.

review/summary: Great coffee, works fine in old-style B30 mini machine
review/text: My 5-star rating is in comparison to other K-Cups I've had, not compared to beans just ground and brewed in my Technivorm Moccamaster. Having said that, this is still a satisfying cup of coffee. My wife was drinking Coffee People Donut Shop as her everyday cup, has switched to this. For me the DS was OK, but I favor the darker brews like Paul Newman Extra Bold and the Van Houtte Eclipse. I like this Fog Chaser quite a bit better, and it's a great bonus how much less plastic waste the cups create. On top of that, they're cheaper, so extra bonus. If you like strong, but not bitter, coffee, this is definitely worth trying.

review/summary: wow! Great  coffee
review/text: This is great coffee! I can not say enough about how bold and rich this is. I was pleasantly surprised at the richness in the coffee, because I feel like most of the k-cups are kind of weak. This coffee is so good that my husband has declared we will ever buy another brand again. I love the packaging on it as well. I'm not sure if the filters at the bottom instead of the plastic are what help the coffee to taste so good, but it's a great idea! So much less waste and coffee wasn't meant to be streamed through plastic anyway. I wish more k-cups were made this way. We have no problems with the coffee going stale before we get  through the 10 in each package. I store them in the k-cup holder I have and they are still perfect. LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Pro: low cost, Con: flavor
review/text: This has been running much less than other K cups so I gave it a try.<br /><br />Lower cost than K-cups but more than using an Ekobrew cup with your favorite coffee.<br /><br />Much stronger smell when you open a plastic package.  Not a pleasant coffee smell but some people like that dark a roasting, look at Starbucks.<br /><br />Cons: not very complex, darker almost burnt roasting, some bitterness.<br /><br />If your preferences are more to the Nantucket Blend on the roasting scale this is not for you.<br /><br />Added, I see they have a Breakfast Blend which according to reviews is milder and more complex. However they helpfully point out it is still roasted more than other brands and I believe the amount of roasting is part of my objection to the flavor.

It would do well as an iced coffee due to it's rich, bold flavor - hmmmm, not a bad idea, I think I'll try it right now!

review/summary: You get what you pay for
review/text: This was an extremely affordable item, but the old adage you get what you pay for applies here.  The coffee was nothing special and tasted like discount coffee.  One of the best aspects of the single-cup coffee maker is that you get a cup of coffee that is strong (depending upon your preference), fresh and, tastes like a cup of coffee from one of the chain reatil locations, without the retail price. This coffee tasted like weak, old coffee - coffee that was made in a drip maker.  In my opinion, not a "Fog Chaser" at all.

review/summary: Almost my favorite K cup!
review/text: Coffee People Kona Blend Island Style has been my favorite (prepackaged) coffee for my Keurig.  Fog Chaser may come in a close second.  I started on this one as the Kona hasn't been available for awhile now.  The Fog Chaser is a medium-bodied blend that does well any time of the day.  I like it iced also.  It's smooth with earth and cedar notes.  Not sweet, but not bitter.  A nice balance.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the plastic bags with the air seals on them.  No coffee, no matter if it's whole bean, refrigerated, or in fancy packaging will retain the same flavor profile it had in the first weeks after it's roasted.  Coffee should be drunk in about 2-3 days after it's roasted and for about another 2-4 weeks.  The majority of flavor in coffee comes from it's aromatics, and they are gone in a relatively short period of time.  When I have time I buy green coffee beans, roast them in my air pop popcorn poppers, wait 2-3 days, grind as needed, and drink it all in the next 2-4 weeks.  TMALST  These won't go bad if you leave the bag open on a counter.

review/summary: It's Worth a Try!
review/text: After reading the reviews we jumped in with both feet and ordered this and the French Roast. Here's my take on the Fog Chaser after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer the French Roast, but I like a darker roast. This has a fruity undertone, similar to a Breakfast Blend, that I personally don't care for. But, my husband likes it and I find it drinkable.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is pretty strong, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like darker roasts but most people don't, and this is a little more bold than mild. There is a not-totally-pleasant aftertaste, but not enough to not drink it.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine.

review/text: I almost didn't bother writing this since everything i have to say is covered by others.  Stated simply, it's good coffee, excellent price, with less plastic to go into the trash.  I often run two cycles (one large and one small) using the same "k-cup" (not really a k-cup but functions as one) and mix them together. To calibrate my opinion, I'll mention that I am a huge fan of Dunkin Doughnut coffee and I tolerate Starbucks.

review/summary: Finally a K-Cup that makes a bigger cup of coffee
review/text: Because this Fog Chaser K-Cup makes a very strong regular (a.k.a. SMALL) cup of coffee, it is a great pod for making a larger (travel-sized) cup of coffee that is the perfect strength.  This is absolutely the best deal I've found anywhere online for any K-Cups, and this brand has proven to be of excellent quality as well (I've also ordered French Roast Decaf and was happy with those too!).<br /><br />Because these have a filter-type bottom, you will have to keep them in a sealed bag or container once the individual bag has been opened to keep them at optimal freshness, but this is easy to do and, in my opinion, not a big deal.<br /><br />Great price + great taste = great value.  You can't go wrong with these.

review/text: PLEASE READ!!!!! Do not let the bad reviewers drive you away, I almost didn't order these because of them. If you like REAL coffee not fluffed up flavored coffee but real coffee this is for you. I have tried pretty much every K-cup on the market and the only ones I enjoy are midnight magic and jet fuel. If you like either of these two you will enjoy this cup of coffee. A little about my coffee preference, I mainly enjoy french pressed strong coffees because the flavors are out of this world. I do have a Keurig (Christmas gift) for about 5 years now, sad part is I only use this if I ran out of time in the morning. With all of that said do realize this is not even remotely close to a french press but is now being added to my very small k-cup approval list.

In addition, the coffee itself is a nice strong cup worthy of it's name, Fog Chaser. It is my favorite cup of coffee in the morning.

I get an 80-pack box from my local BJ's for $28, so it works out to be $.35/k-cup.  It's much more rich and flavorful than other k-cups I've tried (donut shop, green mountain, gloria jean's).

review/text: Count me among the fans. I love the lower-waste design of these k-cup compatible pods. It is a mild inconvenience keeping them in an airtight container, but the investment in a tight-sealing jar paid for itself with the first case. It was smart to package them in bags of 12, so each bag is only open for about a week.  The coffee is good. Not astonishingly strong, but pretty rich and balanced. They don't advertise it here, but the company's coffee is fair trade/direct trade as well!

It's great tasting coffee!  And more importantly, even though it brews in the Keurig, it's NOT in little plastic cups.<br />More than two years ago I switched to the oh-so-convenient K-Cups, despite reservations about brewing coffee in little plastic cups. (1)Very hot water steeps in Plastic cups. (2)Lots of little plastic cups go into landfills or incinerators.  Now, finally, there's a product with all the convenience of the K-cup brewers, but none of the drawbacks!  Why didn't someone think of this sooner?

review/text: Our family really likes this brand of coffee.  The package the coffee by the dozen in plastic bags to ensure freshness and the taste is a mild to medium flavor.  The subscribe and save is a great way to save money (around fourteen dollars for thirty six cups) and ensure you're never without coffee.  Although it's still wasteful, each cup has less plastic than the regular k-cup coffees out there.  I actually like that you can see the coffee and the little filter pouch it sits in.  We recently found out that costco is selling this brand of coffee (french roast - which is much more bold) for a more economical price (eighty cups for around thirty six cents a piece).  We will continue to purchase and suggest you try it out at least once.

review/summary: Only decent coffee. Poorly filtered and goes stale
review/text: I purchased this because another reviewer likened it to Coffee People's Jet Fuel.  Unfortunately it is not even close.<br />The first cup seemed fine. The flavor immediately after brewing is good, but as soon as it cools down some it turns harsh fast.<br />The open-filter is a poor design. It can and absolutely will go stale.  I compared the scent of the final coffee pouch(cup?) from a previously opened bag to a newly opened, and the scent is completely different. Think old coffee can vs. freshly opened.<br />The other gripe on the filter is the poor filtration. There is always sediment at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />About me: I am very picky about my coffee. I drink it straight black and brew at 8oz with double filtered water in a Cuisinart Keurig coffee maker.  I don't reuse k-cups!<br />My favorite coffees are Coffee People's Black Tiger and Jet Fuel, Caribou's Mahogany and Van Houtte's Eclipse.

review/summary: This is the best one yet!
review/text: "Fog Chaser"...a great description! Extremely fresh. The taste is surprisingly deep and rich for a medium roast, or "Full City." I usually drink a darker roast just to get the extra bit of flavor, but this one is even better than San Francisco Bay's French Roast. The only other coffees that come close are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q822L0">Brooklyn Bean Roastery "Fuhgeddaboudit"</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q82652">"Cyclone,"</a> two of my other favorites, along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I5DM">Green Mountain Revv</a>.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these are "pods" rather than actual k-cups, so after you open the bag, you will need to seal the unused capsules in a zip bag, preferably in the refrigerator (not the freezer). Doing this, I've never had the coffee go stale. If you like deep, flavorful coffee, I recommend you give this one a try.

review/summary: GOOD AS EMERIL AND LESS $$$$$
review/text: No sediment, just great tasting (and smelling) coffee.  Tired of Emeril's constant price changes and packaging changes.  This is as hearty as Emeril and as smooth with less waste to Mother Earth and much less money.  Very impressed, been using Keurig for over 5 years and this coffee is great.

review/summary: Great Coffee!!!
review/text: I am not big on posting reviews but this coffee is awesome!  The aroma when you open the bag, the smell while it is brewing, I just cant say enough good about this coffee!!  Yes is it not the same K-Cup we are used to seeing - so what!!!  It works great and I will just store them in a canister - it is worth it for a good strong cup of coffee.  Something, in my opinion, that has been missing from K-cup selections.  Hope this review helps!!

review/summary: Too smoky for my taste.
review/text: I like the concept of eco-friendly packaging. It fit and brewed in my Keurig just as a regular K-cup does. The coffee was smooth and aromatic but a bit too smoky for my taste. Maybe I will try a different blend.

review/summary: This is AMAZING coffee!
review/text: After living in Europe for 6 years, I have become very picky about coffee.  I am not a "coffee snob"...I can't tell what aroma a coffee may or may not have; I can just taste the difference between good and bad coffee.  Don't be fooled by the price of this coffee or the different looking k-cup; this coffee is top-notch.  If you like good coffee, this is worth a try.<br /><br />****EDIT****<br /><br />I thought about writing a long rant, about how the negative reviewers of this coffee, don't know what good coffee taste like, but I thought twice.  They just like a different taste to their coffee.  So instead, if you like Folgers, Maxwell House, Green Mountain, The Coffee People, etc., you will probably not like this coffee.  The people who will like this, should know who they are, by my previous comment.  I did find a couple of varieties of coffee from the same manufacture I did somewhat enjoy; Coffee People - Black Tiger, Green Mountain - Black Magic and Sumatran Reserve, although I did not like it enough, to purchase them again.<br /><br />Here is a list of coffee I really enjoy and come in K-Cups.<br />Caribou Mahogany, Starbucks Sumatra and Pikes Place.

review/text: I stumbled upon this coffee while browsing Amazon and was instantly interested because of the price and when I looked further I saw that it had much less plastic.  I decided to try it.  It is sooo  good.  I can see this being my new favorite coffee.  I will have to see how it stores.  I do like that there are 3- 12 packs so I only have to open 12 pods at once.  I'll store them in tupperware or something but I can't imagine it will be much of a problem.  It really really is a wonderful, strong, flavorful cup of coffee.  Thank you SF Bay Coffee.

review/summary: Depends on your taste
review/text: This is one that truly seems to depend on your taste in coffee.  I served it to five people at the office because I personally love it.  Two of them said they couldn't finish the cup, while the other three thought it was the best they've had. I personally like the more traditional taste of brewed coffee that this product produces.  The plastic k-cups always seemed to have an awkward taste to them, almost as if I wasn't really drinking coffee.  I do get a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the cup, but also don't mind that.  Since it does turn the inside of my white cup pretty black, I suppose I should also start thinking about what it's doing to my teeth and my insides, but the flavor seems to make it all worthwhile anyhow.  At the office it was clearly a love it or hate it type reaction - this from four people who usually choose a bold coffee and one who always drinks light (but happened to love this).

review/text: After buying the SFB French Roast K-Cups, I thought I would give the Fog Chaser a chance.  Wow!  What a good and strong cup of coffee.  Stronger than the French Roast.  I will keep buying these!<br /><br />Just an update:  Recently I found k-cups on sale and bought a box of what used to be my favorite.  After brewing the coffee and drinking it, I realized, I did not like it!  The SF Fog Chaser is superior to the k-cups offered.  Will not go back to the regular k-cups again.

I usually buy coffee by the case at Costco but this is a superior option.  Less plastic also makes them more ecologically friendly and potentially recyclable.  Two Thumbs Up!

review/summary: Strong Flavor, Quite Acidic
review/text: This is an intense, rich, flavorful coffee. While I like a robust flavor, this one seems quite acidic. It does "chase fog", for sure! I think it has a real caffeine kick to it. The cups are intersting in that they have a wider brim so they fit right into the Keurig without touching the bottom poker. I brewed a 12oz. cup and a 16oz. cup. The 16 was more to my liking, but the acidity of the coffee made it difficult to finish either cup. Just a little too strong for my liking. Interesting packaging. We drink several cups a day, so I don't believe it would get stale. And they do fit right in the carousel.

review/summary: Don't let the different form factor scare you off - they'll work in your Keurig
review/text: These work just fine in any Keurig-style coffee maker - if it uses K-Cups, it can use these.  If anything, these are probably a bit more environmentally-friendly than standard K-Cups simply by virtue of containing far less plastic.<br /><br />The only problem is, they just don't taste that good.  The coffee itself leaves something to be desired, surprising considering the history of the company that makes these. (full disclosure: I worked briefly for these folks back in the late '70s. Since I have a personal connection to the products, I really wanted to like them) I liked this better than the Rainforest Blend (which I found weak and watery) but not as much as the French Roast. (which I didn't really care for that much when I first tasted it, but found it grew on me as I worked my way through the case and compared it with other K-Cups)<br /><br />Keep in mind that this review is based on a single cup, and I didn't really like the French Roast when I first tasted it either, so you might want to take this with a grain of salt until I've had a few more opportunities to sample the product and compare it to other varieties.  I'll update if my opinion changes with time, but on first try, I doubt I'd buy this again.  It's better than the Rainforest Blend, but I'd be more likely to buy the French Roast than this.<br /><br />Like other One Cup varieties, these leave a bit more sediment in the bottom of the cup and produce more "crema" - the brownish foam floating on top of a good cup of coffee - than most traditional K-Cups.  The Fog Chaser seems to produce less than either the French Roast or the Rainforest Blend, for what it's worth. I found the flavor just a little on the thin and bitter side.

review/summary: Best Keurig cup of coffee I've had!!
review/text: These "cups" have a little filter at the bottom instead if a plastic cup which allows for less waste in the trash can, yeah!! I always felt kind of guilty putting so many plastic cups in the garbage. Now to the coffee it is absolutely the best I have had.  A 10oz cup is possible without tasting too watery, especially with the French roast.  Every one of the Rogers family cups are great.  The fog chaser is a little smoother than the french roast but nice and dark.  The french roast is great also not quite as bitter as the usual french roast even the decaf is great.  This coffee rivals fresh brewed easily and is less expensive which is a bonus for those of us who want the freedom of K cups but don't like the price.  I will buy this brand from now on, I am a loyal customer of this Old San Francisco Bay Coffee.  Rogers family thanks for bringing real coffee to Keurig.

review/text: OK, I know there are over 200 reviews, but I just had to add my two cents. THis is by far THE BEST approach to this one cup (kcup) system. Not dispensing with the pod system, which is slightly less toxic to the environment. Ok, so without a doubt a step in the right direction on the kcup systems; but the coffee....WOW..this stuff hits your nose when you open the bag and keeps hitting it each time I open the zip lock I put them into, after opening the original ( slight dig on the company for not making a resealable bag..come on man!  Anyway, can't say enough about the coffee, I have tried just about every bold, dark, espresso, medium roast, you name it, and this one is my favorite so far.<br />I may have to buy some beans or grounds to use to make my own.<br /><br />Thanks!

I've bounced around through all the Keurig dark roasts and in my opinion, this is better than all of them. The aroma and taste far surpass any K-cup I've ever had. I store the coffee in an air-tight container, and have had no problems with freshness. They work perfectly in my B70 brewer, and I do wash the K-cup holder every couple of days or so because these have a real filter instead of plastic. The price is great, especially with Subscribe and Save - never going back to plastic K-Cups!

review/text: I like coffee but I don't have a palate that can differentiate between a coffee with subtle hints of vanilla, grass and one with "smokiness." I just know whether I like it or not. To me there's two kinds of coffee, the smooth kind and the kind that has a bite.<br /><br />I feel like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts have a bite to them, something that makes them different. This Fog Chaser coffee is like that. There's something about it that makes it different and I think it's really good!<br /><br />The cups are not your normal K cup so I just got a metal tin and put them in there to keep them fresh.<br /><br />If you do the subscribe and save on amazon, it makes these cups very affordable (for k cups).<br /><br />Overall, very good coffee.

And sometimes it allows the coffee sediment to leak through. It doesn't happen all the time, found to be about 20-25% of the time. Also you have to place cups in a zip lock baggie to keep fresh, after you open Mfg's.bag. If it weren't for this I would have given it 5 Stars.

review/summary: Not Quite a K-Cup, but awesome coffee!
review/text: First of all, the coffee is quite rich, and definitely appropriately labeled Fog Chaser!  Non bitter, smooth bold medium-dark roast.  It is one of my personal favorites.  But the purchaser should be aware of how this coffee is packaged. It works great in the Keurig machines but the packaging is not a true K-cup.  A K-cup, as designed (and probably patented), is a small plastic cup sealed with a foil lid, under which is a coffee filter pouch of a single serving of coffee.  The packaging on this does not have the plastic cup encasing the foil lid and filter paper pouch of coffee.  I suspect the manufacturer is saving in paying licensing fees from using the K-Cup design by excluding the cup.  But you have to use different storage containers for these packages, as using the usual racks and other means of storing K-Cups will allow air to get to the coffee and cause it to go stale unless stored in an air-tight container or plastic bag.  Also, this packaging may not work in Keurig brewers that automatically dispose of the spent K-Cups.  Another slight inconvenience is that the brewed package leaves a wet coffee filter sack of coffee grounds, whereas with a genuine K-Cup, the spent package only has one small hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, the rest of the package is dry upon disposal handling.

review/summary: Fantastic Product and a BIG Surprise
review/text: I am very surprised that the biggest secret about San Francisco Bay single service coffee , which works perfectly in famous brand K-Cup makers, has not been revealed in any of the previous comments.  Or at least I did not find the secret yet revealed.  I love Amazon.com and am a high volume customer but folks, you can get this product at COSTCO at a significant savings.  An 80 count box at COSTCO is just around $30; unit cost is about 34 cents.  Do not hesitate because of the 80 count box.  The contents are packed 8 units to a heavy duty sealed nitrogen filled bag that will hold for over a year.  You will find the 'good until' date clearly printed on each bag.  When you cut open the bag (you will need scissors) the phenomenal fragrance of freshly ground French Roast coffee comes right at you.  If you like that rich smell of fresh ground, this will be almost as good as when you drink it after brewing.<br /><br />So is this a good coffee?  I am an old restaurant guy and I always prefer my coffee rich, dark and not bitter.  I tried virtually all the K-cup samplers available so I could do a comparison of the DARKS, BOLDS and FRENCH ROASTS I could find.  Other than a few Sumatra brews, this SF BAY product stood out at the top of the list.  That even includes the really expensive stuff that is good but not good enough to be price competitive or flavor superior. If you do not at least try this coffee in your K-Cup brewer, you are missing a unique opportunity for quality and value.  If you shop at COSTCO, you need to look for it and get the best competitive single serve French Roast around town.  You will also find that San Francisco Bay bulk coffees have been sold at COSTCO for a very long time.<br /><br />Now, about that little filter material container in place of the plastic cup you are used to seeing.  Well, the Rodgers Family who produce all the San Francisco Bay Coffees (and other labels), are independent and want us all to get their premium coffees without having to pay the Royalties to use the "K-Cup" brand name...and they do not want to infringe on copyright designs, so they were inspired to have this design created.  The entire container portion of the unit is indeed a filter and allows for the best extraction methodology.<br /><br />You must be asking yourself if I am a "shill" for this company and the answer is an emphatic NO.  I am just a life long student of consumer economics and I really like to give credit when and where it is earned.  The Rodgers family business is located in Lincoln, California in the vicinity of where I live - and I also like to support my local business.<br /><br />You may forget all about what I have said here, but you will always remember San Francisco Bay French Roast once you have tasted it.

review/summary: Good Cup of Coffee
review/text: Like others here I am always on the lookout for a K-Cup bargain. With such an attractive price I finally decided to give San Francisco Bay's Fog Chaser a chance. I was a little worried about the unique design of these cups. However, after receiving them and brewing a couple of cups of coffee I can say that there was no need to worry. I would describe this coffee as Medium roast, maybe leaning towards dark. It has a nice distinctive flavor, and the Amazon Frustration Free packaging really is frustration free. We store our open cups in a sealed container to help maintain freshness. All in all a good cup of coffee, and as long as the price remains competitive I will be a repeat customer.
