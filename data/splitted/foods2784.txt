review/summary: Interesting!
review/text: I have to say that I had no idea what a Mojito was, but I figured Crystal Light doesn't make anything bad. :D My best description of it is lemonade or limeade with a splash of mint, and it's very tasty, although I found that it took a little getting used to. I expect this would be positively wonderful in the heat of summer, so I'll try it again next year too. In the meantime, it's mighty fine and distinctly different.

review/text: A healthy and tasty drink! If you could go for a mojito but don't want the calories or alcohol, this is a terrific alternative. Refreshing. I am enjoying the minty-lime taste. In fact, I think I'll go get another glass right now.

review/summary: Ditch the Soda and Grab a Mojito
review/text: The Mojito is one of my favorite adult drinks.  There are some pretty nasty tasting Mojito mixes out there, but this isn't one of them.  Making the drink is pretty simple, because all you have to do is pour the mix into your water, chill it, and TA DA you have a great tasting drink.  If you like lemonade, and are ready for something different, try the Mojito.  Each packet makes 10 quarts, and each serving is only 5 calories.  If you're looking for a low-cal alternative to soda, this is a refreshing choice.

review/summary: Nice and Easy to Make
review/text: I keep and make Crystal Light products all the time so when Moctails Mojito came out I wanted to give it a try.  Like all Crystal Light products it is easy to make.  When I poured a glass right after making it did not have much flavor, in fact it was like sweetened water.  I put it in the refrigerator for several hours and it had a much better flavor.  By the next day it was better still.  If you want to get the best flavor mix ahead.  It is a nice low calorie drink.

review/summary: Refreshing...
review/text: First off, let me express my disappoingment that Crystal Light is still using Aspartame as it's sweetener. I had hopes they had continued their move forward by sweetening this product with Stevia (as they have will some of their other newer offerings). That being said, although the taste of this drink is ever so slightly artificial (it's not "natural"...DUH), it is pleasantly refresing and does have more than a passing resemblance to a mojito (without the ETOH, of course). Because of the Aspartame, I'm not likely to buy this again, but if they changed the sweetener to Stevia or Stevia blend and kept the taste the same, I would definitely purchase regularly. If artificial sweetener choices aren't an issue for you, I recommend this product whole heartedly!

review/summary: I'd give this a 3.5 star rating
review/text: I am a mojito junkie. Give me a minty mojito on a hot summer day (make sure you're not skimpy on that booze!) and I will be in heaven. No joke.<br /><br />I originally saw these Crystal Light Mocktails in my grocery store a month or two ago. While intrigued, I chose not to purchase this product due to my sensitivity towards artificial sweeteners like aspartame and sucralose. Both tend to give me headaches and nausea, depending on the amount consumed. My reaction got so bad that I actually had to give up gum at one point (but I am a gum-aholic, so...). Lucky me food manufacturers put those things in EVERYTHING.<br /><br />But I digress. When I saw this was being offered to Vine members, I knew I had to give it a shot--sensitivity be damned.<br /><br />Two days ago, I received my Mojito Mocktail in the mail. I opened a package, poured it into a huge pitcher, and filled it with plenty of water. Upon taste testing, I was semi-impressed. Like another reviewer said, this was like a watered down lime drink. The mint is there, but it's not very strong. I knew it was missing something--and not the booze. Luckily, I had club soda in my fridge, so I poured half of a mini bottle into my glass. Instantly, my drink became a lot more appealing, and hence why the star rating is a 4.<br /><br />By itself, this mocktail is okay (probably 3 stars). With the addition of club soda, it becomes a lot tastier (4 stars).<br /><br />And while I know that this is supposed to be a mocktail, I cannot help but wonder if this would be good with some alcohol in it. I'd test it, but I got my nausea/headache from the aspartame and sucralose after a few hearty gulps which means no more for me.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? Only if you do not have an artificial sugar sensitivity. My family seems to enjoy it though, so while I might not purchase this for myself, I probably would for them... or someone who does not drink alcohol, but enjoys the taste of mojitos.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I haven't crystal light since it was still made with saccharin, but I have been wanting to lose some weight and stop drinking so many sugary drinks, but it's  hard being most diet sodas end up giving me a headache.  Anyway, I went out on a limb and I tried it.  It was delicious, you could hardly even taste the artificial sweetener and the flavor was yummy.  I don't drink alcohol, so I have never had a real mojito but this had just the right amount of mint to add a little something to the lime.  I have tried a recipe from Paula Deen for a honeydew limeade with mint and it's one of the best drinks I've ever had, but it's also loaded with sugar and with all the fruit it ends up costs 8-10 bucks a pitcher so I usually only make it once or twice a summer, but this has the same flavors of mint, lime and a sweetness.  If only they added some honeydew, but then it won't be a mojito I guess.<br /><br />I will definitely be getting it again, and it didn't even give me a headache like diet soda does.<br /><br />5 stars.

review/summary: just add rum
review/text: As a lover of Cuban food I've had my share of mojitos, bad, good and excellent. I've had other Crystal Light products yet was never impressed with their weak powdery flavor. So it happens that I'm pleasantly surprised by the clean subtle taste of this moctail. I have to admit I made it with less water than the directions call for so adding ice wouldn't dilute the flavor. I find it more refreshing than a good lemonade. I even tried an adult version by adding Bacardi rum and fresh mint. Not the best mojito but way better than most mojito flavored mixes and hey!...way fewer calories. Even my Cuban hubby was impressed.

review/summary: Sweet Lime with a hint of Mint
review/text: I'm not sure the flavor of this is really reminiscent of a Mojito, but I like it a lot. Put it to your nose and there is but a hint of mint. Take a sip and it's sweet lime - a perfect balance of sweet to sour. (In my opinion) It's a unique color - a light lime green.<br /><br />The only thing I'm unsure of is the idea of a Moctail product which would easily be found right next to the sugar free Kool-Aid in the supermarket.<br /><br />I can take or leave most sugar free beverages but now there are two that I could consume by the gallon - this one and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UEG8YE">Ocean Spray's Blueberry Lemonade Powdered Mix, 0.11-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>

The great thing about Crystal Light Moctails Mojito is that my friends who drink can add alcohol and those that don't drink love this as moctails.

review/summary: Added some rum just for kicks
review/text: I love a good mojito.  I spent a few nights in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico a few months ago and tried some of the best mojitos that I've ever had.<br /><br />But even though I love mojitos, I didn't think I'd love Crystal Light Moctails version of the mojito.<br /><br />I must say that it's very good.  I drank almost 1/2 gallon of the stuff this afternoon, so that's a pretty good sign.<br /><br />Then I got to thinking...Hmmm, how would it taste when served over ice with a shot of rum?  So I brought out a bottle of 10 Cane rum and gave it a shot, so to speak.<br /><br />It was actually not bad.  Would you ever mistake it for a real handmade mojito?  No, most wouldn't, but if you threw in a couple of mint sprigs, I'll bet no one would ever guess that this was Crystal Light.<br /><br />But I was pleasantly surprised.  This is actually pretty tasty stuff.

review/summary: Surprisingly very good
review/text: I didn't expect alot from this product and I was very happily proven wrong.  While no one would mistake it for a fully liquored mojito the drink is cool, minty and refreshing with the background hint of lime I love.  The flavors are well blended so that neither the mint nor the lime predominate.  I am going to try it with seltzer and a squeeze of lime instead of plain water.  I suspect that it will be even more delicious.  It did not have the artificial sweetener flavor I was afraid of and will be useful when I need to hostess parties and remain sober while enjoying a drink with my guests. It is not too sweet so it is refreshing and calorie free to sip on throughout the day.  This is very good and a definite hit for Crystal Light.  I might experiment adding some alcohol to this but in my experience alcohol does not mix well with artificial sweeteners.  It would be VERY good made into a slushy drink too.  I will be buying this again.

review/summary: Tasty, Refreshing
review/text: I am not a regular drinker of Crystal Light products, but I enjoyed this one. It mixes easily (even with cold water), which means it would whip up fast even with company over. Not sure how much similarity to a mojito there is, as it smells like lemonade and tastes more like limeade with a hint of mint.<br /><br />Though I haven't tried it with alcohol, I think it would pair nicely with Absolut Citron or something else of that nature (if you're not watching your calories too closely).<br /><br />If I'm figuring the price right, it's $22.40 for 20 pitchers (it comes in a pack of 4, each container has 5 mixers) of this stuff, which isn't a bad price. It would be nice to keep on hand during the late spring and through the summer as a nice, cool drink. (But perhaps jazz it up with some fresh mint.)

review/summary: A Yummy Fake Cocktail with Tons of Flavor!
review/text: I was soooo disappointed when Crystal Lite discontinued their Pineapple Orange flavor because I drank it all of the time. I LOVED IT. I wish they would bring it back. When I had the opportunity to try the new Mojito flavor, I jumped at the chance, and I think I found a new favorite!<br /><br />It's crisp and light and so yummy you'll think you're drinking the real thing. I tried it the other day and was wowed! It's from their "mocktail" line of beverages, and they may have a margarita flavor too, and I think apptletini as well. Next time I mix up a batch of Mojito Crystal Lite, I am going to muddle up some mint and cut up a lime, maybe rim my glass with sugar and tell the kids not to bother me while I enjoy my fake adult beverage.<br /><br />I seriously felt like I was a grown-up for about two seconds while I was drinking it. But then a kid started screaming and a ball flew past me in the kitchen and life as a stay-at-home mom continued on! Next time, I'll put the kids to bed first. THEN, I'll enjoy my beverage!<br /><br />I'm telling you, Crystal Lite better keep this flavor around or else I don't know what I'm going to do. Woman can not live on Lemonade alone!

review/summary: Crystal Light Is Always Great - Mojito Is Convincing
review/text: I have always been a great fan of Crystal Light. That's all I drink at home - except for orange juice and Soy Milk - I have enjoyed the Natural Lemonade as my favorite flavor of all of them.  I have also enjoyed Wild Strawberry (for Energy), Green Tea Peach Mango (for Metabolism), Pomegranate Lemonade (for Skin Essentials) and Natural Cherry Pomegranate (an Antioxidant) as well as many others.<br /><br />It appears the Makers of Crystal Light are branching out to give  `alcoholic' flavors to a non-alcoholic drinks.  They have captured the flavor of the Mojito in a non-alcoholic way. All the flavor of the mildly sweet but tart kick of a real Mojito and none of the dangers.. It's amazing how they captured the real flavor.<br /><br />Mix ix with a quart of water and the light blue color has the smell and taste of the real alcoholic drink without the alcohol. Crystal Light has made an amazing product for years and I always wondered about allowing us nonalcoholic drinkers tasting the flavors of all those exotic alcoholic drinks. Here it is and they've done it well.<br /><br />If you like Mojito's and the Mojito flavor...you'll LOVE this mix. 11-2011

review/text: I got the Mojito Moctail in my stocking this year from my sister. She always finds the best, most unusual things for stockings. I was skeptical to try the Mojito since I am not a big fan of the drink. When I tasted it for the first time I could not believe how refreshing and complex the flavors were. I could taste the hint of lime and the mint. I gave some to my friend who loves the actual drink and she loved the Crystal Light version. I can't wait to serve these at the next family picnic! I'm sad though since I cannot buy them in my area. I guess ordering them online isn't so bad.

review/text: I am currently preggo, so I reached for this the other day after I had a rough day and work and needed a "drink". Since one packet makes a whole pitcher and I only wanted a glass (kinda wish they were single-serve), I just opened a packet and dumped in and stirred powder into a glass of ice water until it tasted potent enough for me. I'm not a big connoisseur of mojitos, but I thought this tasted pretty "mojitoy" and enjoyed it. It's a nice little treat for if you can't have a REAL drink (hey, have a mojito AT work!), and would probably make a decent mixer with actual alcohol if you don't otherwise have or keep the necessary ingredients on hand. I'd buy it again, and am looking forward to trying more flavors.

I have long been a drinker of crystal light and like that they are finally acknowledging what many of us were already doing - mixing their drinks with alcohol.  Now they've made it even better by creating moctail flavors.  This follows exactly what I've come to enjoy about Crystal Light.  Yes, it's a bit artificial tasting (as are all their beverages) but if you don't mind this, it is refreshing and delicious on its own or mixed with rum.

review/text: I will start by saying mojitos are probably my favorite cocktail.  I got this drink mix to see how close to a mojito the flavor would be.  Initially I disliked this mix greatly, I think because it does not taste like a mojito to me.  And the kids (who have never had mojitos) did not like it at all.  They thought it was too sour.  But I continued to drink it to see if it would grow on me.  It did.  I think it is a good tasting drink that tastes like limeade (kind of like lemonade, except made with limes instead).  I would drink/buy it again, I just wouldn't expect it to substitute for a mojito.

review/summary: Too sweet for me!
review/text: This drink - when mixed up - looks and smells quite a bit like lemonade. But once you taste it, you'll find this isn't like any lemonade you've had before. The drink is very sweet - too sweet for me. (My family and I drink very few sweet drinks, and rarely buy and soft drinks or mix up Kool-aid-type drinks. While I do this for personal health reasons, I have to be fair and admit that my taste buds do not find very sweet drinks very likeable. So, while I am biased against this type of drink, if you enjoy very sweet drinks, you'll probably find it more to your liking.)<br /><br />When my wife and kids tasted this, they also found it to be too sweet for them. My wife actually dumped out the rest of her drink after one sip and said there was no way she was drinking anything that sweet! We recently also tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LGIY">Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini, 1.69-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>, and we thought that drink was OK - better than this drink. Perhaps the developers at Crystal Light can tone down the sweetness and add in a bit of tartness, instead, and I'd like it better. As it is now, I really can't recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Tastes very good buts whats in it??
review/text: I received this product free as part of Amazon.com's Vine program to generate reviews for new products. I have to say this taste very good, all you do is just add it to water. But before recommending it or not, I want to tell you what is in it, and you can make an informed choice. The ingredients contain Malatodexri, Aspartame, Ascsulfame Potassium and also Yellow dye 5 and Blue dye 1. Ok The Asculfame Potassium adds a slight touch of sugar, the others I mentioned are all not necessarily natural. There is much debate about Aspartame and its relationship to overall health, and I know some are allergic to it. OK there you go, it taste good but is not so natural. So I will say to you if you want it for the taste and are not concerned about the artificial sweeteners then this is a product for you. If you are concerned about the artificial sweeteners then this is not the product for you.

review/summary: Do you spike it or not?
review/text: The "Mocktails Mojito" is a powdered drink very similar to other Crystal Light drinks, but targeted at adults. Unlike other powdered drinks, this one isn't as strong.  I typically add more water than the directions say, but this one is already a little watery.  And as the ice in your glass melts, the flavor lightens even more.<br /><br />So is this a cocktail or not?<br /><br />Not as packaged.<br /><br />I really can't tell what their intention was either.  Is this a non-alcoholic (*wink wink*) drink?  Or am I reading too much into their intent?  I've never heard of a virgin Mojito before, so I'm still a little confused.<br /><br />Can you drink this as-is?  Sure.  It's a decent drink.  It could use a little something though.<br /><br />Possible variations:<br /><br />I tried adding some soda water to it and it was really good, but watered down.  So I tried substituting half of the water with soda (4 cups water & 4 cups soda water).  That was even better.<br /><br />I tried using the drink as a mixer with white rum (both the standard version and the doctored fizzy version).  This wasn't such a good mixer; the rum flavor was much stronger than the Mojito flavor.  Then I tried this again with less water in the mix so that the flavor of the drink would come out a little more.  This wasn't too bad.  It was actually pretty good.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />If you love Mojitos and want something non-alcoholic to drink, this isn't bad.  It's not quite my cup of tea, but I can't complain.<br /><br />Or if you want to make instant Mojitos at home and don't want to use the high calorie mixes you find at the store, this is a workable solution.  Just make sure and experiment with the strength before you start pouring for your guests.<br /><br />Tip (spiked version):<br /><br />If this is "to go" (picnic, pool party, etc.), then I recommend picking up a 2-liter bottle of soda water at the market and using that as your container.  Start by pouring out a little more than half of the soda.  Then in a 4 cup mixing cup, mix 3 cups of water with the drink powder until it's fully dissolved.  Then pour this into the 2-liter bottle with the soda.  This is your base mixer (1 cup of water shy of the full recipe).  Look at your plastic bottle: The imaginary 8 cup line is right where the bottle starts to curve.  Use this as your guideline as you add the rum.  I recommend you add one cup of rum and then taste.  This will be a weak-ish cocktail.  There's still room for about one more cup of rum in your bottle.  Fill to taste.  Pack this in a cooler and bring a bag of ice.  If you're really trying to show off, bring some fresh mint leaves to add to your guest's glasses.<br /><br />IMPORTANT:  If you doctor this up and take it with you in a generic soda water bottle, please use a sharpie or something to label the bottle so that nobody accidentally drinks this or serves it to children.  Be a responsible hostess/host.

review/summary: Refreshing and mostly guilt free
review/text: I think this drink is very good.  The taste is refreshing, light, and mildly sweet.<br /><br />I have difficulty getting in the habit of drinking water, and this has been a great choice for me in regards to having a non-caffeinated and non-alcoholic beverage around with low calories.  I can easily drink an entire 64 ounces of it (made from one packet) in a couple of hours.<br /><br />I wish that it used a natural sweetener like Stevia, but with my experience with drinks that use it, it wouldn't taste this good.  That's the trade off - good sweet taste and low calories still seems to fall into the world of artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />One note - this beverage is mildly acidic.  My teeth are sensitive to drinks like lemonade, and I experienced a mild form of that with this drink.  It's not bad enough in my case to stop me from drinking it, but just a heads up to anyone else who has sensitivity issues.

review/text: I give up...simply just give up. This is strike three out of three Crystal Light Moctails, none of which I'd buy.<br /><br />We are long-time Crystal Light drinkers, aftertaste and all! No matter the flavor, there is always *someone* in the house that will drink it! But not so true with the Moctails.<br /><br />Like the others we've tested before it, this one falls flat. In fact out of the three (Margarita, Appletini, Mojito) this one drew the highest number of bad-faces and recoils. One of my family members said it tasted like someone swished their toothbrush into his glass. That pretty much summed it up for me as well. The mint note isn't tasty, it's....gross. It's like taking a drink after you've brushed your teeth and haven't spit out all the toothpaste. The smell is not even appealing enough to make you anticipate drinking it.<br /><br />I'll stick to the other Crystal Light products when I want a sugar-free flavored drink, but not the Moctails! If you are not already a regular Crystal Light consumer, then the typical aspartame-aftertaste of this product is not going to endear you to it, on top of the minty-unfreshness of the resulting drink.

review/text: Mojitos use mint.  This, as far as my taste buds can tell, doesn't have a trace of mint flavor in it.<br /><br />I could go on to complain that its not alcoholic or fizzy either, but that would be dumb, as I knew those things going in.<br /><br />But the mint thing... That's important.  Without the mint flavor what you basically have is just a low sugar mix for Lime flavored Kool-Aid.  That's fine if that's what you're looking for, and the low calorie count is nice, but it is absolutely not even close to being a substitute for the flavor of a Mojito.<br /><br />p.s.  Those looking for alcohol in their drink experience will be glad to know this stuff tastes great with a little gin added.

review/summary: For a water flavorant, great.  Definitely not a cocktail.
review/text: Breaking away from my sweet tea habit was a bit of a struggle for me, and water flavoring packets like Crystal Light have made it much easier.  I'm generally a fan of lemonade and berry flavors, but mojitos are my favorite cocktail so I decided to give these a try.  I generally use part of a packet-- about 1/3-- to flavor a large, 32 ounce water bottle.  Any less and it just tastes like slightly acidic water (not bad, but not great) and more tastes way to sweet.  It's got a nice distinctive minty lime flavor, you can definitely tell that it's meant to be mojito flavored!  On the whole, it's very good and I'd definitely get it again as a water additive.<br /><br />On the other hand, it does have a bit of an aftertaste and doesn't quench thirst quite as well as plain old water.  I also wouldn't use this for a cocktail base (with water added-- I can't speak to just dumping the powder into rum).  It just tastes really watered down (unsurprisingly) and certainly isn't a good substitute for actual mint, lime, and soda, unless you really like to punish yourself by imagining how good an actual cocktail is while suffering through a nasty tasting "diet" substitute.  If you want a real mojito just save your calories and get one on the weekend, don't try to use this stuff!

review/summary: Crisp, fresh, smooth and clean taste
review/text: I have always viewed "Crystal Light" as a grown-up's Kool-Aid.  The flavors are more exotic, have less sugar and calories. Not for nothing, Kool-Aid over the years has gotten better about less calories and sugar.  Anyway, this flavor of CL is "Mojito".  Most folks know that mojito is a beverage that traditional uses alcohol.  Well that is definitely not the case here.  However that is not a bad thing, the flavor is very good.  It has a smooth, crisp, clean and fresh taste.  The underlining blend of mint, lime and other citrus elements shine through rather nicely, with no aftertaste. Also it would be great to drink this in winter to remind oneself of summer.<br /><br />The only complaint I would have about this product is the amount that each packet makes.  Notice that I use the word "packet", I remember in the old days when "Crystal Light" came in a tiny cup with foil over it.  I suppose this new method is done to produce less waste.  Nevertheless, it seems that these new packets do not make a pitcher worth of "brew".  The directions state to use 8 cups of water, which only filled my pitcher half way.  I suppose this is a minor grievance, but it is something worth taking notice.  Notwithstanding, this is a very good beverage and I enjoyed it very much.  I would use it again and it is a nice alternative to juice and/or soda.

review/summary: Very Refreshing!
review/text: Crystal Light Moctails Mojito tastes like a light limeaide with a hint of mint. It is really refreshing and would be particularly great for hot summer days. One package is supposed to make a "pitcher" but my pitcher holds 16 cups of water, not 8. So, it took me two packages to make one pitcher. This makes it seem a little pricey since one container only makes 2.5 pitchers. At the current Amazon price ($22.40) that makes it $1.49 per pitcher. Not as cheap as Koolaid, but in my opinion it isn't a bad price for the unique (and adult) flavor that you can't get from any other sugar-free, non-alcoholic drink mix. Most of us would easily pay $1.49 for a 20oz sugary soda at a gas station.<br /><br />Speaking of alcohol, a little rum or even vodka goes great with this mix! I substituted some of the water out and tried it both ways. Yum!<br /><br />I think that most kids would like the taste of this Mojito Moctail mix also. It may be a great way to keep them from feeling left out when you are drinking real Mojito's (or you could spike yours and they would never know). Plus, it is much healthier for the kids than sugar filled juices or soda. I would recommend this for both kids and adults. It is a refreshing, great tasting drink.

review/text: I just got this in the mail today, and I gotta be honest - I was kind of thinking this was going to be a mix with instructions on making pitchers of mojitos of the alcoholic variety.  But just for today, I decided to go ahead and actually make them the way they're supposed to be made.  I have to say, it's a nice, refreshing flavor.  Limeade is great, but that subtle kick of mint does make it just a bit more refreshing.  And since I made them sans alcohol, as instructed on the package, I poured some for my 4 and 6-year-old kids.  I thought the mint might throw them off, but they both remarked right away that they loved it.  So go ahead, order it and make a pitcher - it won't go to waste.<br /><br />And on another note, I'm still planning to do a little experimenting to see if I can make a grown up version of this in a blender with some water, ice, and light rum.

review/text: I drink Crystal Light products as an alternative to sugar-induced drinks, and while this Mojito flavor has a bunch of artificial sweeteners, it tastes pretty good!  Its flavor is exactly as you might expect with hints of lime and mint.  But the key is dumping some rum in there.  Where I come from, a mojito isn't a mojito if it's not making you dizzy, and some rum will achieve that effect very nicely.  Sure, the drink tastes fine without it, but this achieves new heights once you agree to spice it up.<br /><br />On a nice, hot day this drink is highly recommended.

review/summary: Interesting new diet drink, but heavy on artificial sweetener.
review/text: I think Crystal Lite did a good job of balancing the traditional lime and mint flavors of a mojito.  Both are strong in this drink and it's surprisingly refreshing.  However, the drink's biggest downfall for me was that it was very heavy on the artificial sweetener flavor.  Admittedly I have a very sensitive palate for aspartame, but normally Crystal Lite beverages don't bother me.  Unfortunately, these 'mojitos' left a strong artificial aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />If artificial sweeteners don't bother you and you're craving a low-cal summer cocktail, drop a splash of rum into this mix and it's definitely the drink for you.  If you're overly sensitive to aspartame, then steer clear.<br /><br />It's not a bad drink by any stretch.  But perhaps a little more time in the test kitchens would benefit the overall product a great deal?

The bonus of just 5 calories is a huge plus.<br /><br />The second batch that I made, I substituted some of the water with white rum... and YUMMY... it makes a quick Mojito without having to find the mint, muddle it, mix, etc. I highly recommend this product to anyone who likes Mojitos (or wants to try Mojitos).

And be warned about this chem-drink: If you fill one dixie cup with water, and another dixie cup with Crystal Light Mojito drink, and leave them for 24 hours, the water will be contained in the morning, but the Crystal Light will have begun to eat through the glue of the same cup, and begun leaking. And... when that stain dries, it leaves a green flaky residue. Not very cool or appetizing.

It's good. It really is. I promise.<br />But honestly... it's no mojito. I may just have to break out some mint leaves and limes and sugar and tonic water and a little rum flavoring to satiate my pregnancy craving.

review/summary: Not enough mint flavor, overly sweet and cloying
review/text: I'm a big fan of mojitos.  They're one of my "go-to" cocktails when I'm out and about.  As such, I admit that I'm a bit of a mojito snob.  I hate when a bar tries to pass off rum and lemon-lime soda with a sprig of mint as a mojito; I call that a faux-ito. However, trying to keep the ingredients for a good mojito fresh at home is a challenge, so I was excited to try the new Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito mix.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me right away was that the instructions do not provide ratios for using this mix with alcohol.  They only provide the non-alcoholic instructions.  Given this, I decided to try both alcoholic and non-alcoholic variations. For the alcoholic mojitos, I used a ratio of 1 750mL bottle (roughly 3/4 of a quart) of rum added to a 2 quart pitcher filled 3/4 with ice.  Then I added the mix and water to fill the rest of the way and used a stick blender to mix.  For the non-alcoholic mojitos, I used the ratios specified on the package, again using the stick blender to mix it thoroughly.<br /><br />In both variants, I found the mix to be overly sweet and artificially tart tasting.  It reminded me of a sweet/sour hard candy.  I could not detect the mint at all. If it was there, it was overpowered by the other flavors.  Considering that the muddled mint is what truly differentiates a mojito from other beverages, that was disappointing.  While the alcoholic variant cut the sweetness slightly, it was still overpowering.  I was not able to finish the glass I poured myself of either concoction.  (Note: Regarding the sweetness, I've generally had this opinion of other Crystal Light mixes.  If you're familiar with the brand, I'd say this is on par with their usual sweetness at the recommended ratio on the packaging.)<br /><br />I decided to go away from their recommended ratios and do my own variants.  I eventually settled on using 1 quart of seltzer water with either the rum and ice (alcoholic) or regular water (non-alcoholic) for one packet.  Using seltzer instead gave the concoction a nice fizz, but admittedly, it did also remind me too much of those faux-itos at mass market establishments.  You could get the same effect by simply using diet lemon lime soda, e.g., Sprite, and muddled mint.  (Actually, that will probably come out better because the mint will come through.)<br /><br />Overall, I can't see myself buying this again.  I'd rather make the real thing or simply have a different cocktail instead.  This feels like a poor attempt to cash in on the mojito trend.

My ONLY complaint is I have had trouble finding it. I finally did at a local walgreen! But I would recommend it highly. Not too sweet or tart

review/summary: Eh.... doesn't fool me
review/text: This doesn't really taste like a Mojito on its own - perhaps if you used it as a non-calorie mixer. Adding alchol would add colories. Sadly, non of the Moctails in this line are worth a 2nd taste. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LJ04">Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>was poor as well.

review/summary: Pleasant!
review/text: I'm really fussy about cocktail mixes. I've tried about 10 margarita mixes, for example, and none tastes as good as a margarita you get in a restaurant. Mojitos are my favorite drink, so I decided to try the Crystal Light, but with very low expectations.<br /><br />Well, the Crystal Light Moctail isn't a very good mojito, but it is a pleasant beverage. There is a little bit of artificial sweetener taste, but it doesn't bother me. The Moctail is an enjoyable and light lime-flavored drink, even though it's not really mojito-y, and I plan to buy more.

I think you're either a Crystal Light fan or not.  If you're not, there's nothing about this drink that will appeal to you.  If you are a fan, this is a nice addition to product line.  I'll definitely be getting more of this and trying some of the other Mocktails

review/text: My family drinks a lot of Crystal Light beverages. We like the low calorie intake and no caffeine while having a break for carbonated beverages. That being said we thought we would try this new flavor. I can only tell you that the flavor is nasty!<br /><br />It is very weak with a slight taste of licorice and a chemical aftertaste. This is the first of the Crystal light products that I have ever given a 1 Star rating to. Trust me, it is awful!

review/summary: pretty close to an actual Mojito
review/text: I just returned from Mexico and had several Mojitos in one of my favorite bars; the bartender there makes a better Mojito than anyone else I've encountered.  This Crystal Light mix is surprisingly good.  Of course, it makes a "virgin" Mojito, but you could obviously mix it with rum if you want.  The main difference between this mix and a real Mojito is that it's obvious this mix uses artificial sweetener and not sugar.  Quite honestly I was more than a little surprised that the mint and lime tastes both come through but are also present in the right proportions, particularly since so many bartenders simply don't bother to crush the mint properly so that its flavor is released into the drink.  (If you're a big mint fan like me, you might want to still add some fresh mint so you can eat the leaves when your drink is finished.)

review/text: Now, this doesn't taste exactly like a mojito, however it does taste pretty darn good.  A friend of mine brought this over this past summer with a bottle of rum, and it made a great low calorie alternative to a real sugar filled mojito.  I saw these on Amazon, and decided to grab some.  Still very good!  My wife is an avid Crystal Light drinker, and she is in love.  If you are wanting something that tastes exactly like a mojito, you might be disappointed, but I'm going to have to stock up!

review/text: Because I'm not a drinker I can't say how the drink compares to the alcoholic version, but I can say that the taste of this drink is minty and very lime. There is a slight after taste because of the artificial sweetener but I drink crystal light all the time so I am used to it. If you like the flavor of lime I definitely would recommend trying the Crystal Light Mojito. However, I do think the price is a bit much.

review/text: Everyone seems to be coming out with new drink flavors these days in hopes to corner the market instead of coming up with your usual passion fruit tea, etc. Now, Crystal light took a new direction and started making non-alcoholic versions of your favorite drinks.<br />With their mojito mix they have achieved perfection. The mixture is perfect. The taste is just like drinking an alcoholic mojito just without all the bad side-effects (i.e. headache) plus the entire family can enjoy it, and at a much cheaper price.

review/summary: The most refreshing drink ever!
review/text: Sometimes I have trouble drinking enough water. Sometimes nothing sounds good to me. However, Crystal Light Moctails Mojito is somehow refreshing and appealing no matter how queasy I feel. Instead of making up a pitcher full, I pour the powder into a little jar, toss in a demitasse spoon, and mix it up one big glass at a time. I probably don't make it up as strong as the directions every time, but gosh, I crave this stuff! I hope they keep making it; the mint and lime go together just perfectly. I don't mind a drop of rum in it now and then, either.

review/text: I don't often drink flavored water, but this is a taste I could become addicted to. The mixture of lime and mint in extremely refreshing. It doesn't have a strong artificial sweetener taste, and neither the lime nor the mint flavor is overpowering. The flavor is perfectly balanced. My only complaint is that I would personally enjoy individual packets for a glass of water rather than for an entire pitcher of water. I can never imagine making an entire pitcher. However, the nice canister that the packets come in do keep the powder fresh if you just use a little bit at a time out of the packet. I'll definitely look for this one again once I run out of it.

I love Crystal Light and drink it on a regular basis so I was excited to try out this Moctail as well as the Appletini one.  I truly enjoyed the Appletini.  It actually does taste like an Apple Martini however the flavor of this particular Moctail didn't sit well with me because it tasted like medicine.  It also tasted like menthol mixed with a little antacid. I won't be purchasing this flavor in the future.

However, if you drink mojitos and expect that true "mojito" taste, it's just not there.<br /><br />It has a very strong lime taste and it is refreshing but it just tastes artificial.  It kinda made me thirsty after drinking it.  I'm not into the artificial thing and feel like if you want sweetness, just add natural sugar.  However, if you can't have sugar for some reason, then this might be good for you.<br /><br />I definitely had an aftertaste but maybe if you chill it real good, add some fresh limes or lemons, and maybe a splash of booze, it might pass.<br />For me, I would rather have the real mojitos.<br />I like Crystal Light products but I feel they all have the same artifical aftertaste and maybe that's why I didn't really care for this product too much.

Although it has the "artificial sweetner aftertaste", it is pretty slight - and this is from someone who avoids diet drinks like the plague.  Since I've never had a Mojito, I wasn't sure what to expect from the taste.  However, it was a very pleasant blend of Crystal Light's standard Lemonade with a hint of Mint and Lime.  My 7 and 10 yr old children were even able to independently tell me without coaching what added flavors were in the drink.  One said "I taste something minty" and the other said "I think there's lime in here too", so Crystal Light obviously did a good job on the blend.  They obviously also did a good job on the overall drink because my kids drank an entire pitcher while I was at work.  And I thought I was getting the drink for the wife and I...

Either way you save some calories with these zero calorie drink mixes.<br /><br />My first pass I discovered that adding enough water is pretty important as the flavor can be pretty intense if under diluted. Subsequent trials have yielded better results, and I find them to be pretty refreshing, but nothing like the actual drinks that they are named after as far as taste. I have tasted the Mojito and Margarita flavors and favor the Mojito one for taste, though both are drinkable.<br /><br />Overall, diversity is a good thing and the Moctail line offers that to the diet drinking public, just don't try to compare them to real cocktails.

review/text: I love mojitos so I decided to give this a try. I expected that it would not be as good as a "real" mojito, and I was right. "Light" is the operative word here. Not a lot of taste without the booze, but it's a light, refreshing drink, especially for the warmer months. It does have a nice lime flavor, just not that strong. With the liquor it's a bit more authentic tasting, but still not as good as one you get at a bar or restaurant. I prefer some of the other Crystal Light flavors to this one. You might try adding fresh lime juice to this to perk it up a bit.

This one will definitely make it into our rotation, especially during the dog days of Summer here in central Texas.<br /><br />Let me be clear, it doesn't taste as good as a mojito.

review/text: Crystal light Mojito flavor brings the sweet and tart flavor of Mojito to a non alcoholic drink mix that will be a great change of pace to the iced teas and fruit punches we usually drink. Each small pouch makes two quarts. The drink is mildly sweet with a fresh mint flavor, which tastes very natural and not artificial. Very tasty and good.

review/summary: Good, but I like Appletini flavor better
review/text: I would personally probably give this 3 stars, but my mother and another person (both of whom LOVE Mojitos) really liked it a lot, so I thought 4 was a fairer rating.  I enjoy a real Mojito now and then, but this didn't quite cut it for me.<br /><br />I found this to basically taste like regular Crystal Light lemonade with a little fake mint flavoring added.  However, there was also a somewhat odd third taste that I could not identify...and that's the taste I didn't care for.<br /><br />That being said, with alcohol mixed in, I am certain this would probably suffice nicely, especially AFTER the first drink goes down!  ;-)<br /><br />All in all...I wouldn't buy this product again, and I almost didn't want to finish the first pitcher I made (gave the rest away).  But my Mojito-crazy loved ones liked it, so you might too!  I just didn't care for that aftertaste.

review/text: I never thought I liked mojitos, and maybe I don't, but I really enjoyed the Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito flavor! The color is a bit off-putting, it looks like flat tonic water doused with a serious hand of lime juice, but the taste is very light and refreshing. It's ever so slightly minty with a good lime flavor. I liked this flavor a great deal and will be repurchasing in the future!

review/summary: It'll never replace a real mojito, but...
review/text: ...not bad.  The truth is, while I enjoy a good drink, there are many times I don't want (or can't have) the alcohol.  This product places a "virgin mojito" within easy reach, eliminating the fussiness of preparing the real thing (mojitos don't have a ton of ingredients, but they do have a few steps that you have to get right to ensure a good outcome).  Crystal has done a pretty good job of capturing the essence of the drink, combining the refreshing qualities of both citrus and mint.  I didn't go wild over this mojito moctail, but it was good enough to have on hand, especially for some of my non-drinking friends who might like to have a glass of something cold and mildly exotic in their hands, too, during a summer picnic or party.<br /><br />Follow up note: One of the other reviewers mentioned using sparkling water (I used club soda) in making the drink, and I can recommend that, since without it the moctail mojito is flat, whereas the real one is lightly fizzy.

review/summary: Packaging Grabs Ya - Taste leaves you longing.......
review/text: Absolutely fantastic packaging - it draws you right into the scheme of mojitos.  My daughter's drink of choice is the mojito so I thought I'd get her this mix and maybe with just a little "juice" she'd have a quick drink.  The smell of lime is evident but it tastes like lemonade and lemonade only.  We'll use it but she'll add alcohol, a slice of lime and mint leaves.  I suppose it serves its purpose because the sugar will be deleted from the original drink.  Only one thing - I wish this was in single servings.  It's a waste to make two quarts when you want just one quick drink on a Sunday afternoon.

review/summary: Crystal Clear
review/text: The Crystal Light Moctails, Mojito flavor is a good light flavored drink.  If you like to flavor your water then you'll probably like this.  One packet will create a picture of flavored drink.  The flavor isn't going to knock your sock off or anything and honestly it tastes a lot like lemondade to me.  But as a non-sugared alternative is certainly isn't bad and it is very easy to make.  I'd try another flavor based on my experience with this one.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: I must confess I have never had a Mojito drink. I was interested in trying this product because I use other Crystal Light products and LOVE them, especially the raspberry flavor.<br /><br />The taste of this drink was unfamiliar to my palate, a minty limey kind of flavor, but I found it enjoyable. Not too sweet (a feature of all Crystal products in my opinion) and refreshing.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned that using the full 2 quarts of water is not recommended if you want a full blown taste of the Crystal beverages. I agree. About 1 and 1/2 quarts of water gives the optimal results.<br /><br />Based on this experience  I intend to try the other Crystal mocktails. What better recommendation that that?

review/text: Wow...really $20, yikes!<br /><br />I was not expecting much when I got these as I thought, "how could it really taste like a mojito?"  Well, it doesn't taste like a mojito, but it IS good.  It is a very light refreshing drink, a nice lime flavor with just a hint of mint at the end.  I only tried it with water, but I believe I will be trying it with rum soon as I do like rum drinks.  This is probably one of the better Crystal Light mixtures that I have had and if the price is better I would love to continue using this product.  Yummy!

review/summary: Really tasty, refreshing low calorie wonder!
review/text: Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)<br /><br />This is the second Moctail flavor I've tried. The first was the Appletini flavor which I liked. This one is even better. I was very surprised as I'm not a big fan of mint. There is a very light mint flavor, appropriate for a mojito, but it's really good. I may be converted. It is nice, refreshing and most of all tasty! I am amazed how much I like it. I haven't tried it as a mixer as I don't have any rum in the house. Still, it's a great drink that stands on its own. I really recommend you give it a try. It's my new favorite "have in the fridge" drink. As with all Crystal Light drinks, it has minimal calories, five and big taste. This is a real winner and totally unexpected. Enjoy!

review/summary: No Mojito Please
review/text: I have to say that these new line of Mocktails have not been a hit with me. I tried 2 of the 4 flavors and neither tasted very good. I find the cocktail flavors very far from their intended targets and the after taste from the diet sweetener is quite strong in both cases. The mojito is a bit better than the margarita mix in that it's less artificial in taste. But if I had to choose, I'd go back to one of the original lemonade flavors. And, as someone else mentioned, making the packets for pitcher-size servings really doesn't make a lot of sense.

review/text: I've never had a mojito before so I can't compare it. However, I can say that this has a refreshing mint lemonadeish taste. It's more sweet than sour and I simply mixed this with some water. I diluted it a bit, but I still didn't really like the mint lemonade taste. I might try to add some ice next time, but mojitos aren't really for me, alcoholic or non alcoholic.

review/summary: Crisp and clear
review/text: I've tried the Appletini and Margarita varieties of this Crystal Light drink mix series, too, and the Mojito is certainly clearer and more pleasant in its gentle blue hue (that fluorescent green was getting old). The taste seems gentler, too -- crisper, purer. The traditional Mojito drink includes lime and some mint leaves, and I'm not so sure I detect any hint of mint here. Lime, yes, a little -- reminiscent of the aforementioned margarita mix. Overall very nice, very tasty, a good refresher.

review/summary: It's Crystal Light, not Booze
review/text: I was eager to try a new flavor of Crystal Light especially an exotic drink flavor. At first it tasted a little bit like wintergreen mints, but it grew on me. I like the tartness of the lime and that it's a lot different from other low-calorie drink flavors. However, it doesn't taste like a Mojito, which it shouldn't because it's not. It does have a nice lime/mint flavor though.

review/text: I am terrible te about drinking enough water in a day.  It is just too boring for me most of the time.  Adding a little flavor helps me get more in.  I'm not a huge fan of the fake sugar additives because they leave an aftertaste and taste sugar-free.<br /><br />I really like the Mojito flavor.  I've had a mojito before and liked it, but don't love it (I'm not a huge mint fan).  It has the light flavor of a mojito, but not strong.  Just enough for a taste.  It does have a bit of the sugar-free aftertaste, but not bad.  It is refreshing and light and I definitely drink more water with it.  My husband, who hates sugar-free stuff, actually liked it, too.<br /><br />I plan on buying more and even looked for some at the store (it wasn't available).

review/summary: I don't like the flavor
review/text: I am not a huge mixed drink person. I prefer a hearty beer or a tasty wine to a liquor concoction. However, I was willing to try this moctail that Crystal Light puts out. I have tried in my past their traditional stuff, the lemonade standard, and always thought it was on the very sweet and very tangy side. To me that same taste is still present in their Mojita style moctail. It seems to have a hint of mint and maybe something else to give it a "liquor" flavor. But overall I don't like it.<br /><br />It probably would be ok if you actually mixed it with alcohol, but I am guessing Crystal Light is not purporting those kinds of mixology outside of just water. They have other flavors, but this is not begging me to try others or even finish up the remaining packets. The artificiality of the flavor does not lend itself to a refreshing taste with that aspartame flavor on the tongue.<br /><br />As far as packaging goes, it comes in a standard plastic little container, each with 4 packets. The back of the item says "sugar free", however, if you read the ingredients, it clearly states "sugar". But then with a disclaimer that says "adds a trivial amount of sugar". Whats that about? Either it is or is not sugar free. Dont make a claim that clearly goes against it! Not to mention sugar is probably better for you than aspartame.<br /><br />A single serving is 8 ounces which is 5 calories. The entire container serves 40 while 1/8 of a packet serves 1 person or 1.1 grams. So basically, each package can serve 8, while there are 5 packets, that will give you your 40.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars for its ease of making a drink. One can easily control the amount of water to "flavor-down" the taste, but I am not willing to experiment enough to find that "taste" in something that is only ok. The second star for the potential if you wanted to use it with alcohol to make a drink for yourself. Which might be ok as an accent to something else, but not as its dominant flavor. Maybe Sandra Lee would find use for it, but I am not inspired.

review/summary: Instant (Almost) Mojito
review/text: Mojitos have become all the rage in mixed drinks over the past several year, especially here in S. Florida. This instant mix takes most of what is great about this drink and distills it into an instant mix. One package makes enough drinks to serve a number of guests. It is a bit much for one or two people and I think it would be nice to have the option for single serving.<br /><br />The mix itself is surprisingly drinkable. I'm not a big fan of artificial drink mixes, but they got this one right. It still has a detectable artificial aftertaste, but it for the most part it is quite an enjoyable mix. You can mix it as per the directions, or add a bit of rum to the mix for a quick cocktail. Either way, Crystal Light's Moctail Mojitos mix is a better instant mix than one might otherwise hope for.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: Good as a filler for your dog,my dog LOVES THESE!!!!
review/text: My Dog LOVES Moist and Meaty, I mean loves it.  My last dog liked it too although not as much as my current dog.  Basically I wouldnt ONLY feed this to my Dog but what I do is use it as a filler meal.  I mostly will mix half a pack with a small can of wet food (my dogs favorite).  At night most of the time I will mix the other half of the bag with a premium dry food, for example Natural Balance from pet stores which is VERY healthy for the animal.  Or I use it as a snack at night and just give her one bag.<br /><br />My dog is very healthy and LOVES this food over all the rest.  One of the reviewers was complaining that it was full of crap--WELL GUESS WHAT, so is our food.  Corn Syrup is in like EVERYTHING we eat almost.  NOT EVERYONE can afford to feed their pets 100 percent organic or raw, if you can well then hey your lucky.<br /><br />All in all this food is NOT THAT unhealthy for your pet as long as its not the only thing you feed them.  Most dogs will only live a certain number of years no matter what you feed them so why not feed them what they like as long as their healthy and taken care of.<br /><br />If I was rich I still would buy this for her because she really likes it and I have YET to see a high end natural pet food company make something that matches this product in taste and texture, the fact that is is between dry and wet is appealing and it is HIGH TIME maybe a high end company like Natural Balance or California Natural made something to compare to Moist and Meaty!<br /><br />You can also give your dogs vitamins each day that dont cost that much from either a pet store or 1800petmeds to compensate for not being able to buy them 100 percent raw and high end food and you can give them bones and tablets that keep their teeth clean (NOT THE GREENIES!!!)  Just saying.

review/summary: Tainted product
review/text: I have purchased this product 3 times using the monthly subscription process.<br />  The first case had multiple tainted bags. By tainted I mean that some portion of the product in the bag had turned to a powder consistency and smelled foul. I didn't realize it the first time, and after feeding it to my dog, it made him sick for a few days. I assumed that this was an anomaly, so I removed the bad bags, and let the subscription continue. The second and third cases also had a couple of tainted bags.<br />  As I see it, since I'm having to throw away multiple bags per case, purchasing this way is not a good deal. Instead, I'm going back to purchasing cases of this product from Sam's Club. Those cases never had bad bags.

review/summary: When it comes to my dog......
review/text: I purchased this product before pricing around. My dog wasn't eating properly (my daughter moved out & took my dogs sister) I was unable to get out of the house & just used Amazon....when I received the box it had a brown powder substance all over inside and out...I thought nothing of it...a few days later I found my dog & 3 cats sniffing around the pantry door...I opened the box of this food & found at the bottom  apparently 2 of the packets inside weren't opened but they consisted of just meat powder and a BAD ODER!!!??  Not sure how that happened maybe in a warehouse something got into it. Just yesterday I went to Walmart to purchase more dry food & saw that Walmart had the same food (their name brand) 12 pks per box for only $3.97 so I bought 2 boxes. When I got home & fed my dog, I noticed that the Walmart brand was much redder in color!<br />The only thing I can think of is the box I purchased from Amazon had been sitting for so long the food disintegrated within side the box. I feel bad that my dog ate about 18 of the 36 pouches!!!<br /><br />Grosss!!

review/summary: These make a great treat for dog training!
review/text: While I'm not sure about the nutritional content of this food, I've had very few dogs at the animal shelter near me turn these down as a reward during training. These are great for training because they are small which allows you to reward the dog a lot without worrying about overfeeding it. I also like the fact that they don't make your hands greasy or sticky like hot dogs or cheese. Another plus is that these don't require any preparation, unlike most other dog treats, which need to be cut up into smaller pieces to be the right size for training.<br /><br />It seems that these are a fairly high value treat for most dogs, being on par with or a little better than other soft meaty commercial dog treats and worse than cheese or hot dogs.<br /><br />I don't think I would recommend them as a staple food for dogs, but as a training treat, they are great!

That happens when you let them walk all over you. Buy them a good quality food, something meat based, grain free like taste of the wild, blue buffalo, nutrisca, etc, mix in some good quality canned food or add chicken stock and let soak and serve. If they're hungry, they'll eat it.

review/text: I'm not a huge fan of canned veggies, frankly, but my husband prefers canned green beans to fresh so I decided to try these.  I was pleasantly surprised - not too salty, not mushy or mealy like some brands I've tried, similar to boiled beans cooked all the way soft.  They were more palatable with a rinse and a splash of fresh lemon juice, I'm guessing they'd be pretty good with bacon and mushrooms and would make decent baby food. Very well priced for organic compared to our local discount grocer.  Amazon delivered promptly, as usual, and the cans were well packed.  If you have a preference for canned over fresh or would just like a decent substitute for fresh on hand, short of canning your own, I would recommend these.
