review/summary: AWESOME!
review/text: This was soo good!  I enjoyed the texture, as it wasn't too hard and crunchy, like I have experienced with other granolas.  The flavor was delicious as well.  The "bits" were bit enough that it could be eaten out of hand as an on the go snack (which I did) or as a cereal in a bowl with milk (which I also tried).<br /><br />The only drawback I see to this is that the raspberries are quite tart, and without anything else in the bite can be almost over powering.  But, mixed in with the cereal and chocolate bits, they are quite lovely.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious and nutritious, a welcome addition to an overall healthy diet
review/text: As someone who tries to be healthy as far as food is concerned, eating whole grains has been the cornerstone of this endeavor. Along with exercise, trying my very best to eat a healthy diet has reaped rewards as far as my weight overrall health profile is concerned.<br />Making Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola a part of my diet helps me in sustaining a healthy lifestyle by maintaining a consistent intake of whole grains and Omega-3 which supports a healthy cardiovascular system. It tastes very good coupled with the fact that what you are actually enjoying to eat is good for you---14 grams of whole grain in 30 gram serving. This can also serve as a good snack in place of those chips which can be high in fat and cholesterol. Nothing indicated on the ingredients is a cause for concern, not even its sugar contents which is only 6 grams per serving. Total carbs is kept at a minimum at 20g per serving, even if you have 5 servings, you are still under the allowable daily carbs allowance even if you are under a carb restricted diet. I love snacking of this without the guilt. It is in the middle pack as far as price is concerned. But for the indicated price that you see here in Amazon, you get a pack of six 11.5 ounce bag. I am totally stoked with this product that I will be ordering more. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Dangerously delicious
review/text: Heed my advice!  When you go to eat this, measure out your portion, seal the bag and put it under a timed lock.  It's a pretty high calorie snack and terribly, terribly delicious and I think I got about 3 servings out of the bag instead of the...you know...10...it's really got in there.<br /><br />Also, bring a spoon.  I think the concept is finger-food with chunks of granola but in the end there's a lot of loose granola lying around.  I also wish it had more of the dried berries... also note that it's not "chocolate infused granola" but rather, granola clusters with small chunks of chocolate scattered throughout the mix.  My first bite was like "eh...not much chocolate taste here" but I didn't realize the chunks of chocolate were in there separately.<br /><br />It's a great mix and a tasty snack and you'll be awfully tempted to eat the whole bag in one go, which is probably not the greatest idea.

review/text: This granola crunch, intended to be eaten like trail mix, has a well balanced flavor between all of the ingredients.<br /><br />The chocolate chunks and dried berries are small and easily mix in a handful. And the coconut flavor is quite pronounced. It is a perfect size for storing in a desk drawer at work or somewhere climate controlled. With the real chocolate, these could have a problem if you carry it camping or leave it in your car on a hot day.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients as shared by Natures Path:<br /><br />Made with love and...<br />Rolled oats*, evaporated cane juice*, soy oil*, rolled spelt (wheat)*, dark chocolate chunks* (evaporated cane juice*, unsweetened chocolate*, cocoa butter*, soy lecithin*, vanilla*), flax seeds*, dried coconut*, cocoa*, freeze-dried berry blend* (freeze-dried strawberries*, freeze-dried raspberries*), rice starch*, sea salt, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor, tocopherols (natural vitamin E). *Organic.

review/text: Love Crunch - Dark Chocolate & Red Berries is an awesome granola.  I love the balanced taste that the dark chocolate, berries, and granola clusters provide.  I also like that I can easily read and understand the ingredient list.  There's no "partially blah blah" this or "modified" that.  The flavor lives up to the name.  If you like these things, there's a really good chance that you will like this granola.  The only danger is that this relatively small bag has 10 full servings.  While you could use it as a cereal, I use it more as a snack/stop gap between meals.  A few bites mid-morning or afternoon will help bridge the between meal gaps.  There's really nothing not to like about it.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: More Than Just A Breakfast Cereal...
review/text: As a confirmed chocoholic, I am always on the lookout for something chocolate that might legitimately be eaten as a breakfast food.  When I found Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries, I thought I had reached the end of my quest.<br /><br />The granola portion of this cereal is excellent - it is flavorful and tastes good.  However, the red berries - which appear to be dried strawberries - were lacking in flavor and added little more than some color to the cereal.  I found the tiny chocolate squares to be grainy.<br /><br />This product would be excellent used as a basis for a cheesecake crust or as a layer in a dessert parfait.  It might work well as an addition in basic chocolate chip cookie dough as a substitute for oatmeal and chocolate chips.  It is a granola that allows you to use your imagination andd to enjoy it in multiple forms.

review/text: This is without a doubt the best chocolate granola I've ever had. You can taste the richness of the dark chocolate, and the flavor berries are untainted by any sugar or that off taste you sometimes get if they haven't been dried properly. Chunky and decadent but not overwhelming - my only problem with this was that it didn't come in a bigger bag! Definitely will be buying this again.

review/text: I had read about, tasted and really liked this distinctive style of black pepper obtained from another vendor (World of Spice?). So when placing an order with Angelina's, I included this item and was very pleased by the price. However, they were completely nondistinctive, from the beginning. I don't know if they were stale from the start, or not what they were represented to be, or as the Test Kitchen recently reported -- not all tellicherry peppercorns are alike from different vendors. Anyway, while I generally like Angelina's products and believe this vendor is a good one, I give a thumbs down to this particular item. Try them from another vendor.

review/text: I have been using agave for 2-3 years now and find it can easily sub for any other sweetener.  I can't use any artificial sweeteners and sugar (including honey, molasses, brown sugar, malt sugar,etc.) causes me an array of physical problems.  Agave is the only sweetener that my body accepts.  I have used it to bake cookies, brownies and breads with no difficulty and it tastes great.  I recently made hot fudge sauce for my ice cream with it.  Because it is sweeter than sugar, I use less of it than I would sugar:  2/3 c. agave = 1 c. sugar.  I am really grateful for this natural and organic sugar alternative that lets me have my sweets and eat them too!

review/summary: Great, delicious, natural sugar substitute!
review/text: I first tried Madhava Agave Nectar about 5 years ago when I was on vacation and toured Celestial Seasonings where they had it available as a sweetener in their tasting room.  I've been hooked since that day and am loyal to the brand.  I use it for nearly everthing I want to sweeten and even though I'm not diabetic, I feel good knowing it has a lower glycemic load than other sweeteners.  It not only tastes great, but it really dissolves in cold drinks and I love to drizzle it over  cereal and fresh berries for a little lift.  It doesn't crystalize like honey does and from everything I've read, it is a completely natural and organic product.  While there are products that don't live up to their claim, this is not one of them.  I personally endorse this product and have convinced several friends to start using it too!  I have zero affiliation and have not received any compensation from Madhava; their products are just wonderful and I am happy to give them the praise they deserve.<br /><br />I have found it can be expensive to purchage agave nectar at grocery or health food stores and have found Amazon the best source to stock up at a great price and have yet to have a bottle go bad or change before I've used it.<br /><br />I also recommend trying the amber agave nectar and use it as a syrup replacement for my pancakes.

review/summary: Toxic to Some People
review/text: About 30-40% of the population of Central Europe has trouble digesting fructose.  If you have trouble digesting fructose, it can cause a lot of unexplained abdominal pain.<br /><br />This is almost 100% fructose.<br /><br />Personally, I spent about two months with very bad, mysterious abdominal pain that seemed to be everywhere. After several weeks of doctor visits, discussions about IBS, and an abdominal ultrasound that came up normal, I started thinking about what was different in my diet:  I had been using agave nectar in my tea several times a day.  After throwing out the agave nectar and looking online for a list of lower fructose food, I changed my diet, a little.<br /><br />The pain went away in a matter of days, and hasn't returned.<br /><br />If you're using agave nectar and you have suddenly started having digestive issues, try getting rid of the agave nectar.  For some people, this is really bad stuff.<br /><br />Note to gluten-intolerant folks:  fructose malabsorption can go along with being gluten sensitive or intolerant.  If you're wondering why you're still sick if you're following a gluten-free diet, this may be the culprit.

review/text: We aren't health freaks or even conscientious eaters.  But this stuff is SO GOOD!  It is sweet, but not sickly sweet.  It is thin and light, unlike honey or molasses.  It adds just the right amount of sweetness to the frozen Kashi Blueberry waffles we buy at Costco.  OH MY!  This stuff is so good!  You won't be disappointed.  Keep in mind that the benefit to using the light agave nectar is the glycemic load, NOT the amount of calories.  Serving per serving, it has similar calories to sugar or other syrup, but the glycemic load is much lower!  Which means that we can eat pancakes (in moderation) and waffles with our agave nectar without that drugged feeling afterwards.

review/summary: Agave "nectar" is a scam
review/text: from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word "Agave" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as "diabetic friendly". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing," said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses", she told me. "Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.

review/text: This sweetener is wonderful for tea - especially iced tea - you can add it to hot or cold and it sweetens without being gritty like sugar or powdered sugar substitutes.  It also works well for making margaritas - use it in place of<br />the sugar syrup - healthier and time saving!<br /><br />The light agave does not have a strong taste and therefore it works well in everything - tea, lemonade, coffee, mixed drinks - even baking. You can get a small 15 or 30ml bottle and fill it up to take out with you since most places don't have agave syrup available as a sweetener.

I'm just concerned that it has the same caloric intake as refined sugar.

review/summary: I use Agave Nectar for many things
review/text: Agave Nectar is a wonderful substitute for sugar or any other sweetner.  I use it in my tea, protein shakes, and even in baking.  The flavor is very close to the flavor of sugar.  I purchase the 6 pack so I don't run out.

review/summary: Agave Nectar Light
review/text: I first became acquainted with this yummy yet healthy nectar from the Arizona cactus at my favorite breakfast place, Coyote Pause (cool name, no? Yes!). The waitress brought a small serving of it with my french toast and asked me to try it. She said she often uses it in place of honey. It is really delicious and as the name suggests, light. It's a slightly thinner texture than honey but oh so sweet. I would encourage you to try it, too! I think you will like it.

review/text: I had first tried agave nectar at my sisters house with waffles and was surprised by how good it tasted. Lately I've been trying to cut back on sugar, first artificial sweeteners and now white sugar. Honey is great in some beverages like chamomile and black tea, but I don't like the way it tastes in jasmine tea and coffee. I bought my first bottle yesterday and this morning tested it out in coffee. The verdict: Doesn't taste any different than I'm used to. I can't wait to bake with this stuff. I recommend drizzling it on kodiak cake waffles. Yum!

review/text: Agave nectar has become my new sweetener for cooking - especially in my steel cut oatmeal in the morning (along with chopped walnuts, cinnamon, and madagascar vanilla - try it, you'll LOVE it!)  It's so much healthier than sugar, and since it's liquid, much easier to cook with than stevia.  Plus it has that bit of nutty flavor!  I like getting multiple bottles because then I don't have one bottle opened for an extended period of time.  Figuring it out price/ounce, it is a very good deal!

review/summary: Didn't Make Me Tired
review/text: I like to make hot cocoa from scratch using Hershey's cocoa, milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar (sometimes with a pinch of salt and vanilla). But I was falling asleep about 15 to 20 minutes after drinking the cocoa, regardless of how much sleep I had the night before.  I had this problem years ago when I used to eat cereal for breakfast, switched to eggs or other non sugary breakfasts. I'm not a diabetic, but sugar sometimes makes me sleepy. As an experiment I bought this Agave Nectar and used it to sweeten my hot cocoa every night for the past week or so. I have not fallen asleep once. So, based on my results, it would seem that this is indeed low glycemic and does not trigger an insulin surge. I'll use it to sweeten Oatmeal from now on. I also used it to sweeten a Latte today and it was great. In the past I've used a small amount mixed with an once of filtered water, 100% Agave Tequila, and fresh squeezed Lime Juice to make an excellent Margarita (without Triple Sec, which is garbage).

review/text: I'm not completely sure if this is a reseller problem (improper storage) or a QC problem. I have bought this product many times before and it's always been good. This time I noticed a leak in the box and found 2 bottles were leaking. The rest looked like they were still sealed correctly, but wree a darker color than the batch I already had. After trying one of them I noticed it tasted bad. I smelled it and it smelled bad. All 6 of the bottles in my order were bad. That's $30 down the drain!<br /><br />The reason for the 2 stars is that I've had several good batches, but I can't risk dumping another $30 down the drain. If it wasn't for the good batches I had before, this would have been a one star rating. I've seen other people who have had the same problem....

review/summary: Better than artificial sweeteners
review/text: This is my second time getting this product, Madhava Organic Nectar (light). What can I say, bottom line it taste great! It's sweet but doesn't change the flavor of what you are mixing or leave an unpleasant aftertaste (key - does not leave aftertaste!).<br /><br />I tried using honey and after eating honey every day I believe the honey started to disagree with my stomach. I switched to agave nectar, I use it for everything but primarily with coffee so I dink it every day and did not have any discomfort or side effects.<br /><br />If you are still not sure look for it locally and try a small bottle, try to get this particular brand since I have not tried any of the others (there is no need). I mean, the agave nectar doesn't taste like sugar, the flavor is a bit more like honey but with a milder "organic" taste, but if you are already looking at this page and decide to get it I don't think you'll regret it.<br /><br />... Did I forget to mention the flip open top works great?

review/summary: Very Good Substitute
review/text: I now use Agave Nectar Light exclusively as a substitute for cane sugar. It dissolves quickly in hot or cold liquids and can be used in cooking. The Light Nectar does not have a distinct taste which I like. Only wish I knew what the long term side effects, if any, might be for continued use.<br />Guess obesity might be a side effect if you use too much.

review/text: Some of the reviews written here explain about the fructose, etc.& a lot more, everyone is different & if one's doctor says go for it, that's good enough.  It's good to read into it, it also would be nice to understand what they read. Best thing is to ask one's doctor. We only use Agave light like in coffee & oatmeal, tastes good & use less than regular sugar which our doc also recommended compared to Equal, Sweet'N Low, etc, they have chemicals which are not good to people, according to the clinic.<br /><br />One should ask their doctor

review/summary: A great replacement for white sugar
review/text: We have completely replaced white sugar in our home, and Agave Nectar is one of the things we have used to do it.  We use it in baking (although this gets expensive, so sometimes we use organic evaporated cane sugar instead), for syrup (I don't buy or make syrup anymore), on PB&J's, on top of cold cereal or hot oatmeal, etc.  Agave is actually GOOD for you, as it is high in minerals.  In addition, it is low on the glycemic index, so it does not raise your blood sugar levels.  I have been off of white sugar and corn syrup for over a year, so I can tell immediately if something is high in sugar of any form.  Agave does not give me that feeling, so I know it is not affecting my blood sugar level.  I love this stuff, and this subscription on Amazon is the best price around for the good quality Agave.  Thank you Amazon!  By

review/text: Bought this hoping to make flavored frostings, which did not work out at all. When I used it to make a caramel flavored frosting, it smelled very strongly of alcohol. Someone just stopping by my house when I was in the middle of making it even commented on the smell! HOWEVER - I threw some of this in my sugar cookie dough, and now I use it every time as my secret ingredient! Gives the cookies a great, but light (not overpoweringly caramel) flavor. Long story short, use in baked goods so the alcohol smell/flavor bakes out.

review/summary: Rabbit, great for cats!
review/text: Finally, relief for my poor Siamese....<br /><br />I have a 10 year old Siamese who has always had issues with food. The past couple of  years things got really bad and I started experimenting with different foods, all to no avail. I ended up cooking him either fish, steak or pork daily and he got a lot better but not completely. His eyes were still runny, he would sneeze and scratch, but at least his bleeding ulcers, scabs and constant vomiting were over with. I was getting tired of the endless cooking and also wanted to get him to the point where his runny eyes and other issues cleared up, so I went out on another search and was given this canned rabbit food at a local fancy pet store. WOWOWOW! After only four days my Siamese is gorgeous! No runny eyes, nose or otherwise, his skin is shiny and he is happyhappyhappy! (As am I.)<br /><br />The other two kitties also love this stuff, which is a first, since they each have very different tastes. First time they ever agree on something. I guess that makes four of us who love this cat food!<br /><br />(I posted the same review for a similar brand of rabbit food as well, because both work just as good.)

review/summary: Canned rabbit and dry rabbit are their favorite flavor!
review/text: The food this company makes is the closest I can find to raw until I actually get to feed mine raw more often. The value is amazing... actually because it is so dense with nutrients, my cats eat less and I spend less feeding them this brand of food than the other premium brands I was feeding them before.<br /><br />The canned is a dense pate style that needs to be mashed down. My cats had not been fond of pate textures of other brands of foods in the past. It took about 4 days for one of my cats to recognize it as her new food. She had to be enticed but it ends up she is loving it! (Patience pays off!) The other cat will eat anything and there was no problem getting her to eat it. The both now eat all 3 available flavors and seem to love the rabbit the best.<br /><br />Their coats are magnificent! Their stools are small and odorless, similar to what it would look like if they were on a raw diet. My oldest cat who had mild digestive issues doesn't have them anymore. Hooray! I also noticed that while on this brand of food, the crusty sleepies in their eyes are just about non-existent. I hardly have to groom their faces anymore. And they are so active I can hardly believe they have that much energy for their ages.<br /><br />I honestly believe that having no synthesized vitamins makes a world of difference. I had to go back to my old brand of kibble for a short time because I was waiting for my next Nature's Logic order to arrive. On their old brand the cats were producing so much extra waste and it wasn't nearly as healthy-looking. The difference really is amazing.<br /><br />There is no doubt to me the Nature's Logic foods are truly easy to digest and the nutrients are absorbed and used! I hope they continue to grow and the product becomes more well known and available. I recommend it to everyone with cats!<br /><br />Pros : Improves Coat, Increased Activity, Good Value, Likes It, All Natural, Good Taste, Nutritional, Easy To Digest, Odorless Stools<br />Cons : Few Flavor Selections

review/text: I love Earl Grey tea--long before the Captain of the Enterprise made famous those words: "Earl Grey, hot."  I have had some lovely Earl Greys over the year but have wanted a decaf version.  Enter Twinings Lady Grey tea.<br /><br />Lady Grey is a very pleasant tea.  It is smooth and has a very mild taste.  I did find that I need to use 2 bags in my mug to get that nice flavor--I suspect that one bag would be sufficient if you use an actual 4-6 oz tea cup.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the mildness was just a bit too mild for me.  I prefer a more robust bergamot flavor to my tea and will order the decaf Earl Grey next time.
