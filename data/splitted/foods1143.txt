review/text: I LOVE these cookies.  Most cookies are too sweet for me -- not these.  However, since they follow the  European trend of using  natural ingredients, they are full of saturated fat from butter and cream.<br /><br />WHO CARES?<br /><br />They are the best cookies, for me, in the world, comparable only to<br />"Feullitees Doree," which can be bought on in France.

review/text: I bought these cookies for myself and as a gift for my dad for his birthday. Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.

review/text: I really like these cookies.  They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin, flaky, crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!

review/text: I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.

review/summary: Burn, baby, burn!
review/text: Believe me, once you've had a Blenheim ginger ale, you won't settle for anything less.  I've hunted far and wide, tried all of the local ginger ales and beers as well as the exotic, "designer-label" ones.  They all disappointed.  Some, admittedly, have a tiny hint of "hot" (Reed's Jamaican ginger ale), but that's all it is--a mere nuance.  Even Blenheim's "medium hot" version is guaranteed to knock your socks off (probably best for beginners to start with that "plenty heated" one rather than the one explicitly named "hot" by the company.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the price of the drink plus the postage make it cost-prohibitive, except for the addicted (which I confess I'm not).  Until Amazon makes Blenheim Ginger Ale available through Amazon Prime, I'm simply swearing off ginger ale altogether.

review/text: Blenheim's ginger ale is the most unbelievably hot ginger ale on the planet. If you haven't tried it and you're a fan of ginger ale, you're missing out. Start with the "less hot" gold cap. The red cap will literally put you into a fit of coughing if you inhale the bubbles. A fanatic of ginger ale will take that as a positive comment. Ginger ale is ALL this company does, and they've done it for over 100 years, so its safe to say the recipe is good. Give it a try!

review/text: Lived in South Carolina for 6 years and happened to pick up some of the Blenheim Ginger Ale at a farmer's market.  I had no idea what to expect when I took my first sip.  The Blenheim hit as though I'd just consumed a spoonful of Asian hot mustard or wasabi and then took a deep breath in. It's a sensation between pain and extreme pleasure.  All I know is that once you've had a Blenheim then any other ginger ale or ginger beer will be a let down. This is truly great stuff and makes me wish that I never left South Carolina.

review/text: and after consumption of the first bottle, have found a new favorite beverage. As noted by other reviewers, the ginger flavor is quite intense at first, but tends to seem more mellow the more sips taken. The lips and mouth tingle pleasantly as you drink, while sip after sip, the stomach is cooled and refreshed. For a lover of aromatic spice, this drink is quite satisfying. Sugar and ginger are in proper proportions, also: not too sweet, not too hot, but well-balanced. I'm not one who often raves about any product, but here, I must make an exception. This rare gem deserves to be lauded.<br />Best if poured over plenty of ice and consumed immediately.

review/summary: Blenheim was very spicy
review/text: The blenheim hot formula was very spicy but had a good flavor to it.  This ginger ale made my nose run, and sometimes I coughed on just the fumes.  I really liked the hot formula as it was the hottest ginger beer I have tasted.  Defintely much spicier than Reeds Extra Ginger Beer.  Reeds is sweet with not much of a bite to it.  Cock n Bull is a decently spicy ginger beer that has a good taste to it, but ginger is not listed as one of the ingredients.  I like drinks to have real ginger.  Fever Tree and Fentimans are both great ginger beers that have a good kick to them, but not as spicy as Blenheim's hot flavor.  Fever Tree has more of a crisp taste, while Fentimans has more of a complex taste but they both have a good kick to them. All of them are quite expensive compared to Canada Dry.  Canada Dry has no bite to it.  Due to the cost issue involved with the price of Blenheims combined with the shipping,  I most likely will not be buying it again.  I wish they would sell Blenheims in my local grocery stores at a decent price.

It's easy to digest and I add a scoop to her bottle of milk, to her oatmeal, cream of wheat, anything I can add a spoon to - I do. The product is from Holland which one other reviewer noted. This is important because of the European restrictions on hormons given to livestock. It's a known way to add calories to diet without increasing amount of food that a child takes in. Same goes for coconut oil (which Amazon also sells and a great, organic version too). Since starting to add this to my child's diet, she has been steadily gaining weight and is now average for her age group. Long way to go from 3 pounds at birth and this product definitely helped move things in the right direction.

This posed a dilemma when traveling outside the country because we couldn't take enough milk with us for the long-haul flight (almost 24 hrs) and were concerned about the taste and hygienic standards of the whole milk available at our destination. Some friends recommended Nido. We were very familiar with the brand from our time outside the USA but found it rare over here. Found it on Amazon, the tins arrived on time, and our son took to it without any problems! I must add, though, that if you are in a big city, you can find this at an ethnic grocery store for a better price.

review/text: I have been using NIDO instant milk since 1979, the time I was missionary in Africa. Here in USA I was using bottled milk which sells in our suppermarkets. This bottled milk can stand for two weeks and not get sour, which is not normal. But if it eventually get spoiled, it is not sour, it is simply stinking and it has slimy texture. This bottled milk gives me terrible indigestion and lots of gas. Doctors told me that I have lactose intollerance. I am back to NIDO, KLIM or Peak powdered instant milk and I have incredible results. I have no more indigestion and lactose intolarance is not there any more. My son in law had the same experience.

Just use 1/2 cup powder (for a mixer bowl full of potatoes) and margarine, or butter, to taste. Awesome! We also keep Nido in our "preparedness/emergency stockpile," and in the kitchen, for those times when you need a little milk but are OUT. We also use the powder in baking, especially bread. Tasty and easy to use, and all the convenience of shelf stable. Each can makes 3 1/4 quarts of whole milk, or you can make only a cup at a time. Recommended!

So I ordered the smaller cans of this Nido milk even though it was more expensive than the big cans. First thing I did when I got home was open the can and grabbed a spoon. So how good can this thing be anyway? OH WOW. It seriously tasted like milk candy. And there wasn't even any added sugar.  I gave a spoonful to my husband and he thought it tasted like candy too! Now I think I need to order more b/c I just keep eating it out of the can... sigh, what am I going to do when I need it for baking?

review/summary: MOST DELICIOUS OF POWDERED MILK-FROM EUROPE
review/text: We started buying powdered milk because we live in the mountains and are not able to get to town often and we love milk.<br /><br />There is a difference in the Nido powdered milk.  It tastes the best in that it is whole milk not skim as most are. I have purchased the Nido from Mexico and from Europe.  I found the one from Europe is a little more expensive but when it is chilled I can drink it and find it delicious.  The one from Mexico has a little more of a 'bite' to it.  Can't keep from thinking that when I was in Mexico the cows looked like they were starving to death and were probably being fed corn and when I was in Europe the cows looked healthy and were grazing on the land as cow were intended to do.  Just an observation.  My son likes the Mexico milk better as he says it is richer.  I disagree  and do not like to drink it but he will drink my european Nido milk.  It is great for cooking as well and handy when you can't get to the store often. I will only buy the European Nido now.

review/summary: way better than any powdered milk I've had thus far.
review/text: This powdered milk puts other non-fat powdered milk to shame. This stuff is delicious, but I'm not sure of the nutrional content. I'm thinking of buying some from Walmart but i hate paying the tax here at 8.75 in Southern California. Great stuff for the office as you don't have to worry about someone stealing the stuff from the Fridge. It's quite refreshing and way better than soda for you!<br /><br />Make those bones strong!

review/summary: Great taste and mixes good too!
review/text: Nido is "neato" really a great tasting product and mixes well for all kinds of applications. I used it to replace coffee creamer by using it by the teaspoon as well as mixing it by the quart for other "milk" uses. You will not be disappointed in Nido but I recommend that you get the European mixture to try to avoid any additives that could be in the milk.

review/summary: This is fabulous in my tea (or your coffee) - no strange chemicals, just milk from well treated cows
review/text: I was looking for a powered creamer for my tea that was not filled with weird chemicals and preservatives.  A friend told me about Nido (thanks Maggie!) and I have been using it ever since.  I also like that it comes from European cows where they have better laws to protect the animals.  I like the idea of using milk from well treated cows.  Then I tried it in making my pumpkin pie and it was one of the best pies ever.  I have a friend who's grand daughter won't eat much.  Her mom stirs some of this milk powder into everything she can from oatmeal to cocoa.  The girls health is improving.  I love this stuff.

review/summary: best dry milk
review/text: I backpack often and often take another powder milk but, I always thought it tasted like water. After looking around on the internet and a quick look at my other milks box I realized it was "non-fat instant milk". No wonder it taste like water! I drink non fat milk at home but it's never been "reconstituted".<br /><br />I quickly looked around the internet for a "whole milk" because I figured it would have more of the "reconstituted" milk "flavor" and found Nido! This has changed backpacking "milk" for me forever! This stuff taste like milk! (well it is milk but you get my point)

review/summary: Maybe okay for cooking but its a poor substitute for drinking, and its expensive
review/text: When you do the math, this works out to about $6.65 per gallon.  I use it in coffee and tea and it works great for that but recently I made up a glass for my father-in-law and he didnt care for the taste.  Granted, we didnt measure per the directions because they were given in grams and ml but I would guess that it wouldnt matter anyway.  Also, it wasnt sufficient just to mix with a spoon, we had to put it in a shaker to get it perfectly blended.  Im not sure how it is with cereal but if you're not cooking and you're going to be consuming more than just a bit for coffee and tea, I would suggest just buying milk at the grocery store.  Shelf life turned out to be just 1 yr and 2 months because the cans sent were packaged about 8 months prior to shipping out.

review/text: Well I just heated up my first bowl of Oatfit and was ready for some warm good oatmeal on a cold morning. Unfortunately I had to spit it out after the second bite. It is extra mushy and it leaves an awful after taste. Very artificial and almost bitter. For an extra 60 calories I rather stick with their other lines.

review/summary: Taste is good, zero sugar is great!
review/text: I bought this for a camping trip and would definitely eat it again at home. Unlike everyone else, I do not taste an aftertaste or artificial taste with these. I also used less water than called for so mine isn't mushy when I mix it up. All of the regular-sugar instant oats are mushy IMO, so this product is  no better or worse on that score. But zero sugar is wonderful - I hate the standard instant oats because you might as well be eating cookies for breakfast.  I DO wish this company would ditch the artificial sweeteners and opt for something like stevia. Yes, I do like these but still prefer my home-cooked steel-cut oats or old fashioned oats, but in a pinch these are A-OK.

review/text: I've tried both the Oat Revolution and Oat Fit and compared to real oats, they don't compare. The only reason why I tried them was because of the 25 cent price, but it's not even worth that. I have to throw in raisins and cranberries just to eliminate the artificial flavors. I'm going to stick to my Old Fashioned Oats from now on. And if anyone on here eats as much Oatmeal as I do, you'll notice a difference.

I read a lot of labels and have not seen anything that high in a long time.<br /><br />Will eating one filet kill you? No. But if you want a healthy diet free from trans fat you should probably stay away. Especially considering it is a box of 6-7 filets.<br /><br />But they do taste good...

It has more fat in it than plain fish due to the toppings - but overall not so bad for you to get so much taste at dinner.<br /><br />The filets are large, my husband and I split one for dinner with a salad and rice - it was the perfect amount.<br /><br />I perfer to overcook them in the oven a bit - that way the outside gets really crunchy and actually tastes fried!  All the oils come out and sizzles the breading (I added no butter or oil - just right on top of a cookie sheet sprayed with pam).  The inside doesn't get dried out and you feel like you are indulging :)

review/summary: Pretty Nice for a Light Soup--still salty enough for flavor, hardly any beef (no surprise)
review/text: This is a soup on the "fluid-ey" side (not thick). Lots of broth, some veggies, some barley, almost no beef. Granted, you shouldn't expect a ton of stuff in a "light" and lower calorie version of soup.<br /><br />For dieters, not much caloric damage. For those who enjoy the combo of beef and barley in a tomatoey broth, here ya go. The main veggies are carrots and celery, but you find peas and green beans and bits of tomato, too. Eighty (80) calories per serving. Pretty good.<br /><br />For folks watching carbs, it's 14 carbs per serving. Just skip the crackers. ; )<br /><br />If you aren't low-carb: Add some crisp and light Wasa crackers and Jarlsberg Lite, and it's a comforting, satisfying lunch without too many calories (hubby had this today).<br /><br />I would buy this again.<br /><br />Note: Updated to say that,  no, I wouldn't buy this again, but that's cause I avoid gluten these days, and that means avoid barley, wheat. etc. :)

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E50TD8">Dan-D-Pak World Class Cashews, Unsalted, 32-Ounce Plastic Jars (Pack of 2)</a>[Roasted] This is an absolutely great product. Taste is A+, unbroken nuts A+, packaging A+(in a nice, reusable, plastic Jug).<br />  I have tried most of the cashew options on Amazon and all of the highly rated ones. I have tried the large boxes of cashews (isn't quantity supposed to bring the price down? Didn't work out so well.). I have tried the 4-32 oz. options(some are about as good but more expensive). None have surpassed Dan-D-Pack for flavor and most have not been in the same class. I love the degree to which they are roasted - not too dried out, not too raw but JUST RIGHT (as in Goldilocks). And I never miss the salt. It is a saving in price/ounce if they are offered for prime shipping, which was the case the last time I shopped for cashews, which prompted me, once again, to try a large (10 lb.) box to save a bit of money. The taste was just OK and there were sooo many broken nuts. An unacceptable portion at the bottom of the sack that would have been usable only as a sprinkle. This definitely was not a saving unless you are only going to use them for cooking.<br />  I have never had any such problem with the Dan-D-Pak. But I can't over emphasize the quality of the flavor. It is excellent, and that is what I really buy cashews for. In flavor and appearance, they are also perfect to serve to company.<br />I won't experiment with other options again.

review/summary: Finally, an affordable, delicious green tea powder
review/text: I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly.

review/summary: great alternative to bottled green tea
review/text: The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something "healthlier." I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.

review/summary: nice substitute for soda or sugary tea
review/text: I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!

It tastes refreshing and fruity.  The flavor isn't overpowering or fake.  I mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda.  The powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste.  I was so impressed that I have signed up for automatic delivery.  It's a great product.

review/summary: Very Reasonably Priced and Delicious
review/text: If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for "White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream," "Green Tea Papaya Nectar" and "Green Tea Sugar Cookies." You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

There are 6 packets per box.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.<br /><br />I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)<br /><br />Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again.

review/summary: No Flavor - Not Authentic
review/text: I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.<br /><br />I tried to return it to Amazon, but they don't allow grocery items to be returned!

Although the Stash rep tells me there is a "negligible" amount of caffeine, the placebo effect gives me a great boost in the morning before my workout. Since I love mint, I think I've found the perfect product.

review/text: This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isn't sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry, but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: "Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties." Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well.

review/summary: Mild taste, easy to mix, will buy again
review/text: I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.

review/summary: Trying this product for the first time
review/text: I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity "kool-aid" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price.

review/summary: YUM....Yum, Yum!!!!
review/text: This is just the quick iced tea fix I have been searching for.....it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural, refreshing blueberry flavor. Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea "add to bottled water" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this "top shelf" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!

review/summary: Just had a glass today
review/text: When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said "natural", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong "mint" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)

review/summary: Doesn't have taste...
review/text: I wasted a little over $15.00 because the reviews were so good.<br />This has no taste cold or hot. It states to use 16oz of cold water.<br />Well, I used just a cup and it didn't work out for me.<br />I tried adding more packets and it helped but very little.<br />I am an avid tea and coffee drinker and can only resolve<br />that the other reviewers have never had a good strong cup<br />of green tea--, or I am missing something here.<br />I do not recommend this tea.

review/summary: Of al the Stash iced teas this is the best, and it is still not all that good
review/text: What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add the rest of the water just to make these palatable. And only than were these passable...<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it.

review/summary: Makes great drinks but you have to use a lot!
review/text: This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected.

review/summary: Not bad.  A bit light.
review/text: I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I first tried these powdered green teas from Stash last summer. This spring I wanted more, but the store I got them from didn't think the vendor would be carrying any.  I was delighted to find that I could get them from Amazon. I ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing REAL FOOD drinks all summer in an easy to make form.

review/summary: First time purchaser!
review/text: I finally finished my box of the Blueberry Green Tea Powder and wanted to try something new!  So glad I tried this flavor as it is now my favorite!  Just add it to a cold bottle of water, drink it as is, or add a few drops of Stevia or Agave and you are good to go.  Very refreshing!!  Will be packing this on my trip to Mexico!

review/summary: quality lightly sweetened green tea powder
review/text: lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened.
