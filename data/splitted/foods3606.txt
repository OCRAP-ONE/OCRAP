review/summary: Yumm-O!
review/text: I love the taste of this.  It's the only tea that I've been able to drink without honey.  The lingering blueberry flavor is delicious!  I'm not sold on it as an appetite suppressant though.  That effect doesn't really come till after the second cup of tea, and there are just other things I'd rather be drinking.  Still, it's a very delighful green tea.

review/summary: this verses oolong tea
review/text: I've tried green tea verses oolong tea and read a report from The Journal of Nutrition, 2001, 131:28482852 that said oolong tea is better than green tea. This tea tastes good and has a nice flavor to it, but I'm going to stick with oolong for weight loss.  The best bang for the buck I found is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081ALNL6">3 Boxes of Wu-Long (Oolong) Premium Slimming Tea - All Natural Diet Oolong Tea , 100% Pure and the Original</a> where there are 60 bags in each box.  For the price, this is a nice green tea with a smooth finish and green tea does have other benefits outside of weight loss.

review/summary: Keep Calm and Blueberry On
review/text: I purchased this tea because I wanted to detox from the fatty foods, chemicals, and little exercise I had been getting. I am trying to replace all soda, diet or otherwise, with flavored water and tea - but desperately need a delicious replacement. I also need to shed a few pounds, and find myself having next to no energy during the day. I cannot count the number of different teas I have tried and were not satisfied. Typically green tea is too harsh and bitter, and flavored teas end up tasting artificial. HOWEVER! Yogi Green Tea Blueberry Slim Life was a breath of fresh air. I always smell the tea in the bag first, and it didn't smell fake or overwhelming - a good sign. I brewed the tea and took a sip without any sweetener. The tea is not bitter, it is smooth and has a slight natural blueberry taste to it. I repeat, does not taste artificial and overpowering! I can already see myself ordering more of this tea, and soon. Each tea bag comes with an inspirational saying which was a nice touch. The packaging is eco friendly. This tea really makes me feel good, clean, and light. It gives me energy throughout the day as I sip away. I highly recommend this product if you are a fan of tea!

review/summary: A Nice Way to Relax During the Day
review/text: A cup of Yogi green tea is a great way to take a break during the day and just take a moment to relax.  The blueberry tea is supposed to help with detoxing your body (which is essential to a healthy inside and outside) and it helps give you energy so you will feel invigorated when you are working out (be it at the gym or yoga studio).<br />In a word: Yum!  A delicious tea to enjoy anytime :)

review/summary: Excellent Flavor & Aroma....Wasteful Packaging
review/text: Sweet blueberry flavor & aroma, perfect mild green tea energy!! I buy this by the case now..just wish Yogi Teas would stop playing the price yo-yo game with us. The subscription price changed from $17 to $30 to $20 to $17 again.<br /><br />My ONLY true problem with this tea is the packaging. Each tea bag has two tiny metal staples used to attach the little paper tag (with quote on it) to a string, to the tea bag, and then enclosed in a pretty colored paper pouch with the name of the tea on it. Wouldn't it be both cost effective & environmentally friendly to skip the staples, tag, string & colored paper pouch altogether and just have the 16 netted bags of tea inside the box? Obviously if you open up the box and grab one, you know which tea bag you are putting in the cup, so unless you really need to show off the clever Yogi quote by dangling the string outta the cup, I find it utterly unneccesary. Just think of all the thousands of mini staples and threads of strings and paper pouches that are being produced for pure aesthetic (and come on..the quotes aren't that life changing).<br /><br />But I digress....<br /><br />The tea IS DELICIOUS! :)

review/text: I absolutely am in love with this tea.  It is fragrant and has a flavorful, delicious, and natural blueberry taste.  I was worried that I wouldn't like this, as I often shy away from "blueberry" food items, since fake blueberry flavor makes me ill because of the sweetness of it.  This is not too sweet, but is also not too weak of a flavor to make a difference.  It fills my entire mouth with flavor, which is what I think aids in appetite suppression. A must buy!!

review/text: I bought this tea primarily for the flavor and secondarily for the appetite suppressant quality.<br /><br />The flavor is outstanding - I am a huge blueberry fan and to have this in a tea (a green tea at that!) is a treat. The hint of orange is just that - a hint, barely there but in no way affects the taste one way or the other.<br /><br />I have noticed that my hunger cravings have greatly diminished since I started drinking this tea so I believe it lives up to its claim. I've also noticed my energy level has increased dramatically in a not so dramatic way, another plus.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this tea!

review/text: I have been drinking this tea with my breakfast for the past few months and really enjoy it. I am not a big fan of the taste of green tea in general but the addition of blueberry here makes it sweet enough that I don't even notice the green tea flavor. It does give me a bit of an energy boost but mostly it has helped supress my appetite. I was thrilled to see it available here at such a great price. I used the subscription option and now there is one less item to pick up at the grocery store.

review/text: I have been drinking this product for four years now. I was initially looking for a dieter's tea that didn't act as a laxative. This tea tasted great, but unfortunately didn't help me lose any weight or suppress my appetite. It did, however, get rid of my acne and continue to keep me energized, which is why I'm still hooked! Name is deceiving, but still highly recommended.

review/text: Yogi tea is an excellent purchase and enjoyable tea for this price range.  The blueberry slim and kombucha quickly became my favorite flavors to date.<br /><br />As for this specific tea, it is your standard green tea but with a hint of blueberry.  The water actually turns to a purple/blue tint, and the aroma itself is delicious.  The aftertaste is a mild fruitful blueberry taste.  If you are looking for the benefits of green tea but with an interesting change of things, I highly suggest you give this flavor a try.

review/summary: excellent choice
review/text: This is my first order of Yogi tea on amazon. I wanted to get away from loose tea leaves to save some time and I also wanted to pop two bags into my thermos with some hot water and take it to work. In the past I have had issues where it seemed like tea bags exploded inside the thermos. These Yogi bags are great they don't do that. The tea tastes GREAT and it does help keep me from buying two pops a day at work (there are too many good reasons to NOT drink pop so I won't even go into it) and also curbs my desire to buy snacks. I used to have a breakfast and then by lunch I was so hungry I would overeat but since I started bringing this tea in and drinking a full thermos of it in the morning I don't feel excessively hungry over lunch so I tend to have a lighter lunch. Overall I feel more trim and I don't fall into the post lunch coma that came with eating too much food for lunch. It's doing what it says in my book.

review/text: Honestly, at first I didnt care for the tea.  The product says to drink it hot and I prefer cold drinks we live in AZ).  I made a large amount in a 2 quart container and added a little agave nectar and it came out GREAT! After 2 cups or so, I have energy to run after my toddler and clean up while not constantly feeling hungry.  I am also a nursing mom and it hasnt affected my son in the least.  I have been trying to get some of the baby weight off with diet and exercise and have been looking into a safe supplement while nursing.  This product is it! I highly recommend! It also definately beats the grocery store prices at almost $4 per box.

review/summary: Not their best!
review/text: I love blueberries, green tea and Yogi Teas but I do not like this!  It has an orange spice taste up front like the only flavored tea around when I was a kid, didn't like it then, don't like it now.  Then it finishes with a Stevia after taste!  Yuck.  I like my teas plain and would prefer to add my own sweetener if I feel it's needed.  This is a miss in my book and it's not surprising when the ingredients list 'natural orange flavor' before 'natural blueberry flavor' in the line up.  Why not something more natural like actual blueberry? Right? Silly me. It doesn't taste like a berry of any kind by my standards. So, if berry and green tea are the taste you're looking for AND you like the multifaceted herbal taste of Yogi brand teas then try their Goji Berry instead, it's wonderful w/ no weird sweetener after taste and no orange spice! Goji Berry is 5 stars in my book!

review/summary: Very good if you love blueberries
review/text: I have really been into Yogi tea and trying them all! I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that Rejuvenation tastes the best. It has a natural peach and lemon flavor that is very natural and mild. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. I do not like the artificial flavors at all, nor do I like the artificial sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf.<br /><br />This Slim Life tea is very good- Amazingly good compared to diet green tea pills! I do not ever feel the side effects of a diet pill with this tea and I drink a lot of it being I got 6 boxes from Amazon. I think it's a wonderful tea but I'd prefer it if the natural blueberry flavor was left out. It does taste natural and sweet but mixed with Green tea, I'd prefer the lemon or peach flavors myself. If you do love the flavor of berry in your tea, you will love this one and it is mild and pleasant to drink all day long.<br /><br />The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Kombucha tea is also great which has a berry taste, that is good and natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you? At first I just bought these teas for the messages then I learned to love the tea as well! Rejuvenation is my favorite green tea and Peach Detox and Redbush Chai are my favorite flavored teas and make exceptionally good iced tea as well! The flavors, however, are very close and it took me quite a while to figure out which green tea I preferred the best.

review/summary: GREAT product, BAD seller
review/text: This tea tastes great - has a hint of blueberry flavor, and it really does what it says - it helps curb your appetite. I usually have one in the morning (between breakfast and lunch) and one in the afternoon (between lunch and dinner). I have found that my snacking has decreased drastically on days when I'm drinking this tea.<br /><br />I can't give the product a stellar review, however, because it comes from a bad seller. I had this on auto-renew and selected the "every 3 months" option. From the first shipment to the second shipment, there was a 40% markup on the product. With the markup, it's not worthwhile to keep buying it on Amazon - I can get it for the same price in my local Whole Foods.<br /><br />Due to this very poor business practice, I have cancelled my "subscription" of this product. Buyer beware.

review/summary: Not just for cooking and baking, but it's a health food in it's own right!
review/text: What a joy when I read about that!  The only problem is finding a way to add chocolate to my diet without all the extraneous sugars that are NOT so healthy.  In the past I have tried various higher percentage chocolates and found the Scharffen Berger bars to be excellent, so when I decided to get some cocoa powder this is one of the three I decided to try.<br /><br />For my purposes I have been mixing it in with a small amount of dairy to add to coffee.  Turns out this makes an excellent chocolate coffee.  I do the mixing at the bottom of the cup and spend some needed time making sure it's blended, and then add the coffee after that.  Very good and I get to call it healthy.<br /><br />Using the unsweetened powder allows to add only the barest sweetner of choice--suit to taste so to speak.<br /><br />The other thing I've used it for is to mix up a bit of cream, the chocolate and a tiny bit of Splenda...blend it up in a bowl with a spoon until it thickens a bit and then it's a great strawberry dip.  Again, I pretend this is health food--and really as desserts go, it's not so bad if you are more interested in the science behind carbs vs fats (but that is a whole different topic).<br /><br />In any case, of the unsweetened chocolate poweders I've tried so far...this one is the best product in terms of taste when making my coffee--it's good enough to keep me away from the coffee shop where the drinks are pricey and full of sugar.<br /><br />Recommended!!<br /><br />JTG<br /><br />eta: this is not 'dutch processed' so the healthy benefits remain intact.

review/text: I've been using Hershey's Cocoa to bake chocolate muffins and when I recently ran out, I decided to check if Amazon had cocoa powder on Subscribe & Save and found Scharffen Berger. It's more expensive than the Hershey's Cocoa 8 oz canisters that I've been buying for around $3 but the good reviews really made me want to try it. I'm so glad I did because it did not disappoint! The chocolate is rich and my chocolate muffins turned out perfectly moist and delicious! The best part is that the ingredients are all natural. :) I definitely won't be going back to Hershey's Cocoa.

Interesting that Xylitol has even been found to hinder the growth of bacteria that cause tooth decay and in some studies has been proven to actually help strengthen your bones. These packets are crystallized and are an exact one for one replacement for a packet of sugar. You can even use it for baking and cooking in place of sugar, but for that I would recommend buying the 1 or 5 pound bulk pack. It dissolves well and leaves absolutely no after-taste as do some of the questionable chemical sweetener substitutes that have, who knows what, side effects.

Normally I am not a huge stevia fan because sometimes it can taste too strong but with the mix they did on these packets I think it's a perfect combination and for me it tastes more like real sugar. I carry them in my purse so I can use them when I go to Starbucks or out to restaurants so I don't have to use real sugar since it's bad for me.  Give Xylitol a try; I think you will be pleased but it does take some getting used to if you are coming off of sugar.  Good Luck!

review/summary: A yummy quick lunch
review/text: Nong Shim noodle bowls are a definite step up in quality from the typical cup noodles.  They are simple to prepare: just add boiling water and let sit for about 3 minutes (I prefer my noodles a bit softer and let them sit at least 5 minutes).  The bowls provide a generous amount of noodles to make a filling lunch.  The Spicy Chicken variety is my favorite so far (better than the Beef & Ginger).  The broth is fairly spicy but not too much for the average palate.  Along with the noodles, there are pieces of dehydrated vegetables as well as chicken pieces.  The chicken pieces taste ok but are spongy and look kind of disgusting; I have thought about picking them out before adding the water but haven't bothered.  As other reviewers have noted, the bowls are high in sodium; however, you can use less of the seasoning packet if that is a concern.  For the price, these noodle bowls are a real winner, and they have become a frequent work-time lunch for me.<br /><br />I should note that when I ordered then from here, the case was slightly crushed and about 1/3 of the bowls were somewhat smashed.  Fortunately, the bowls were not broken and did not leak; however, because they were uneven in depth, not all the noodles were submerged in water, so they cooked unevenly.  I'm sure Amazon would have allowed me to return the bowls, but it seemed like too much hassle.

review/summary: A Spicy Meal Alternative... But Pricy...
review/text: I actually purchased a pack of NongShim Spicy Chicken bowls (pk of 12) from a local warehouse in my area. Ever since college I've been a fan of these "cup of noodles" style meals during late Autumn and Winter. Makes for quick alternative meal that warms you up. How does Nongshim's spicy chicken version stand up against other brands I've had?<br /><br />Pretty good actually! Each bowl contains a fairly large amount of noodles, compared to the cup variety. The noodles are your typical standard dried Ramen noodle. I am not a big fan of microwaving these products so I make mine by boiling water. Just put some water up to boil, open the package and add the "flavor pouch" or Soup Base, add boiling water to the fill line and wait 3 minutes. Instant hot soup with noodles. While the noodles are standard , the broth is really good. It has a lot of flavor to it and a good spicy kick to it. Put the two of them together and you get a very satisfying meal that will fill you up, and wake you up.<br /><br />Despite having a good spicy broth and making for a filling meal... This product does have some CONS I am wary of. For one the product contains almost 1800mg of sodium for a single bowl. This is insane! Most of these cup/bowl of noodles are overloaded with sodium to begin with, but it still needs to be pointed out. The fat content is a bit high also, at 14g for an entire bowl. Another problem I have is that most of the products I've tried usually come in a sturdy container for your product. Nongshim's Spicy Chicken Bowls come in a flimsy plastic bowl. It works fine but once prepared I would definitely suggest carrying with two hands, as it has a very cheap feel to the bowl. The price per bowl is also a bit expensive. At the warehouse I purchased this, I paid $9 for 12 bowls. I could of paid $6.50 for 24 cup of noodle varieties. Compared to the cup variety, you are paying a premium for these; And while the bowl produced better quality broth, I don't see it being worth the price increase. (12 bowls = 24 servings.. $9 for 24 servings. the cups were $6.50 for 24 servings.. so basically $2.50 more for bowls vs cups)<br /><br />OVERALL I would give this product 4 stars. Despite having a flimsy bowl, and incredibly high amount of sodium the product makes up for it in the overall quality of its taste and sheer volume of noodles. You get a big meal here that will both fill you, and warm you up. It has a really nice spicy kick to the broth that lingers without becoming annoying(see NOTE). I've always enjoyed spicy foods so having a few of these laying around the house helps if I just want a quick meal. I would not recommend eating these everyday, in fact maybe I tend to aim for one a week. Products like this are not exactly the healthiest alternative meal for you, but if you need a quick emergency meal these are a good alternative.<br /><br />NOTE: The product contains chicken but I really wouldn't call it chicken. You might find a few tiny little bits of re-hydrated chicken<br />NOTE: I do not use the entire flavor/soup base packet. The amount of sodium it contains is ridiculous! I use no more than 3/4 of the packet. I tried using the entire packet once and it made the broth start to taste far too salty, as well as making the spice in the broth overpower rather than compliment. Don't be afraid to use less of the packet...

review/summary: Green Jalapeno sauce
review/text: We first tasted this yummy sauce in Boston at the Boylston street burrito place.  We dumped it into our burritos and it made a delicious burrito even better.  It is not too too hot like a jalapeno pepper w/ seeds, but has lots of flavor.  I can purchase this in a small size at one of my local grocery stores, but they don't carry this larger size.  We go thru a small bottle in about a week.  We put it on BBQ, chili, tacos, soups, and sometimes I add it to whatever is in the slo cooker!  Highly recommend this sauce for people who like to spice things up!

review/summary: One of my favorite condiments!
review/text: I just love this sauce in many of the foods we eat, it is really good in Mexican food and it mixes well with other sauces or dips to jazz up the flavor.  It is great in guacamole, salsa, tacos and burritos.  I love it in homemade bean soup or with my Mexican rice.<br /><br />My wife makes the best pulled pork enchiladas with green chili sauce and this is good to help season them to your liking.<br /><br />You can even add it into barbeque sauces to use as a basting sauce when grilling out.  It is a little milder than the original red sauce and it is even good in Bloody Mary drinks to spice them up.  We also like it in homemade chili.<br /><br />It has hundreds of uses and you will like it if you like to add zest to your food.  This is good without setting you on fire!

A 'Scoville Unit' is actually a measure of capsaicin (the chemical in hot peppers that is responsible for their heat).<br /><br />Scoville's test was a comparative taste test that is considered subjective by today's standards. A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact). By contrast, the Bell Pepper comes in at less than 100 Scoville Heat Units."

Try lucuma ice cream if you have an ice cream maker, or put it in your smoothies like me. If you like lucuma, Navitas is a good brand to get it.

review/summary: Careful with bloodsugar levels
review/text: For this review be aware I strongly react in my blood sugar levels and based on that, I did not like using it.<br /><br />I tried it but do not like it as it does increase my blood sugar levels. Its not the same as (cane) sugar or maple syrup but I did feel it going up after using it. I tried it for a few days, then tested eating the same things without it and it was gone and this was the only thing I changed.<br /><br />Then I got mesquite powder instead which has more (molasse-like) flavor and could be considered a bit strong but its perfect blood sugar lever-wise!<br />So I now use that instead (on some of my creations as I also use dates or blue agave as a sweetener).<br /><br />Edit: I use it now with some smoothies and I have no problems with it. I add cinnamon and coconut oil navitas and then it works great and I have absolutely no problem on blood sugar level (which I do have with agave in some cases and certainly with 100% pure maple syrup)<br /><br />I also gave it 4 stars now instead of 1 which I had initially

review/summary: Yes and No
review/text: Yes, because it does taste like lucuma in its original form. No, because it is quite expensive for what one gets. Let's say you decide to make an ice cream and use conventional methods, it will take most of the package. Lucuma has always been a truly unique kind of fruit, plus its added benefits in terms of health, you can make use of it in several ways. Smoothies, ice cream, pies, icings etc. From what I have read it maintains well in dry form but perhaps looses some of its intensity in flavor, but from what I tried not very much. 3.5 Stars.

review/summary: Heavenly Ginger Treats
review/text: We are not [gasp!] chocolate addicts, so are always on the lookout for non-chocolate treats.  We first found these in Canada on Prince Edward Island, lured by the unusual ginger flavor, and both fell in love on first taste.  We spent the last of our Canadian money to buy up several tins to bring home.  And then they were gone...<br /><br />Our Internet search brought us to Amazon, and we ordered a case which is reasonably priced. All the usual accolades for Amazon apply - top quality, fast service, well-packaged.<br /><br />These chews are sturdy, not like gummy bears, so you can let them slowly dissolve in your mouth like a hard candy, providing you can resist the urge to chew! They are not too sweet, and the ginger flavor is intense, so if you are looking for a hint of ginger you will be overpowered.  Ginger lovers, though, will be hooked by the very first one and always make sure to have a tin around from then on.  They travel well without smushing and spilling out in your purse like the cardboard gum packets, and the tins recycle nicely for folks thinking green.<br /><br />For enterprising palates: I recommend you also try the peppermint ginger chews. Hubby isn't so much into peppermint and prefers the original ginger chews, but I'm more daring and will happily alternate between them.  And how wonderful that we don't have to go to Canada to get more!

I've compared them side by side and really find this flavor to be superior. Chimes also has less sugar, which is great if you're sensitive to high sugar foods.  I imagine some people might prefer other brands because they are softer and more sugar-laden.  But if you really like good ginger, try this one!

My only disappointment is that there has been a significant price increase in the past week that makes them more expensive than other K Cups. When I initially purchased the item the price per unit was less and now it is not, which a big let down.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Fat Free. Semi-mashed style refried beans, contains some bean pieces and chunks. Great for burritos, for making black bean soup, as a bean base for other hearty soups or chilis, and for dips. Make a quick and easy organic chunky black bean veggie dip by adding one can of these organic refried black beans, one can of drained organic sweet corn kernals, and a half a can (or to taste) of your favorite organic salsa. Serve with blue, yellow, or white organic corn tortilla chips (or even all three!) Labeled 'vegan' right on the can. 385 calories, 24g protein, 0g fat per can. Made with water, organic black beans, and sea salt. Great value, especially for quality organic beans. Highly recommended. I have been very pleased with all the Natural Value products and continue to try more of their varieties, as I can. It is so great that these high quality organic products are available nationwide [thanks Amazon!] at affordable prices. Really a bonus when combined with an Amazon Prime two-day shipping subscription, especially to small towns and rural areas that may lack good alternatives. Every person no matter where they live or how wealthy they are should have access to affordable, 'clean,' & nutritious food. Natural Value is a 'family business' based in Sacramento, CA. No big hype, just great products and prices. Also really like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXH5E">Natural Value Organic Beans, Pinto, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTMSZI">Natural Value Organic Beans Red Kidney, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. When we buy vegan products (especially products labeled vegan) from any company, we help the vegan part of their business grow. Few grocery stores (and not Amazon Grocery either) sells exclusively vegan products. Buying from companies that label products 'vegan' or have a vegan 'department' will help these compassionate places grow for everyone for whom this makes a difference and for all living beings. When one's heart is focused on helping goodness everywhere, it becomes filled with beauty. Happiness arises from supporting what one finds to be good. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices.

review/text: Recently I purchased a very good product. It is a combination of royal jelly, honey and pollen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00014IHIC">YS Royal Jelly/Honey Bee - Fresh Royal Jelly+, 24000mg, 18.2 fl oz liquid</a>.  Royal jelly as known has anti-aging effect,reduces cholesterol. Pollen is a good source of vitamins. This is a good combination of these two ingredients containing an optimal concentration of royal jelly. I'm going to purchase this good quality product regularly and will recommend it to my friends.

review/summary: Nice Bold Earthy Flavor!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this tea! From the minute I first smelled its earthy, nutty scents (with hints of tobacco and leather), I knew it would be a delightful morning tea. I couldn't have been more right. For those who love boldly flavored and earthy teas, this is a must try.<br /><br />As one who has recently given up coffee (got tired of the jitters and crash), I have been searching for teas with bold and robust flavors, like in coffee. I do not exaggerate when I say that this tea has the boldest and most interesting and  complex flavor I've experienced (without the bitterness of many "bold" black teas).<br /><br />Coincidentally, this tea also has nearly as much caffeine as coffee. As with all teas, though, the caffeine absorbs into the bloodstream at a much slower rate, leaving the drinker jitter- and crash-free. (For the curious, this seems due to the fact that the caffeine in tea bonds with the tannins, making it much harder to metabolize.)<br /><br />Thus, this morning mate is not only absolutely delicious for its nutty and earthy, yet smooth, flavor, but is great for concentration and energy. I cannot reccomend it enough, particularly for those looking for boldness from their tea!

review/summary: Great morning tea
review/text: My Morning Mate is a mix of mate, black tea, and red rooibos. Listed under ingredients are sweet cocoa, chocolate and almond bits, pistachio nuts, macadamia nuts and coriander with warm hazelnut and cinnamon.<br /><br />Some of the reviews on the Teavana site state that they think this tastes like coffee.  It does not taste like coffee but mate has a very distinct taste.  Although the ingredient list is extensive, I think it mostly tastes nutty.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it is not my favorite mate tea-it is a little bitter to be 5 stars.

review/summary: GOOD PRODUCT /NORMAL PRICE
review/text: Okay, I like ragu pasta sauce. I dont have a problem with the sauce. My problem is with the price. Without the subscribe and save, plust the RAGUKNRR coupon savingss this is WAY to high. I was expecting way bigger jars of sauce. I have purchased these in the store on sale for $1.50 each, so for $2.31 a piece after all the coupons is not the best deal.  Not for me anyway.
