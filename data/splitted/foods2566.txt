review/summary: If you've never had seaweed snacks before, you might enjoy this.
review/text: As a frequent buyer of Sea's Gift Roasted Seaweed Snack wasabi flavor, this seaweed had an appealing price so I thought I'd try it. However, I was quite disappointed with the flavor once I tried it. I have 99 packs remaining and hope to find someone who I can give them to.

review/summary: Not Japanese but OK
review/text: In spite of the fact that this has a Japanese name and a picture of a Japanese woman on the package, it is not Japanese.  The reason I know this is not my seaweed expertise, but the fact that "Product of China" is stamped on the inside packages.  Of course, English being what it is, the "Japanese" could refer to the seasoning as well as the type, but......  It's my understanding (from Wikipedia, I think) that Chinese seaweed is cheaper and lower quality than Japanese.<br />It tastes OK if you're a fan of roasted nori, as I am, and it's certainly the cheapest.  However, I prefer Sea's Gift and that Japanese teriyaki-flavored one that comes in a jar. Both of these are also available on Amazon.

review/summary: Good, but not my favorite seaweed
review/text: This seaweed is good, but not very flavorful.  It has a mild teriyaki-type flavor but no spiciness, as the product describes.  Becasue it isn't fried in oil (which is why it's fat-free), it's not light and crispy, but rather chewy, like nori naturally is.  The packaging is convenient, you'll get your vitamin burst (which is why I eat it), and you'll get a low-calorie snack, no-fat snack, however.  My favorite nori is the stuff roasted in sesame oil (the perfect compliment to the fishy flavor of seaweed), like Seas's Gift, but seaweed roasted in oil is not a low-fat snack.  Just be aware that low-fat seaweed = chewy texture.  I probably won't buy this again - I'm going to try Yamamotoyama Teriyaki Nori Seaweed next.

review/summary: blech, there are better choices
review/text: First, let me say, I love seaweed so It's not like I didn't know what I was getting.  I've tried several brands, but hadn't tried this one.  The 100 pk sounded like it would be a good value, but it's not.  Overall there isn't much I like about this product.  The flavor isn't very good and is fishy compared to other seaweed.  The texture is a little chewy.  The calories see a little high for the serving size, they're not a lot, but compared to the size it seems a little high compared to other seaweed snacks.  Each serving has 16 calories, no fat, and 1 protein.  The carbs seem a little high considering there's a carb for each piece and the pieces are only about 1x3".  You get 100 total pkgs of 3 pieces each.  Each pk is in a strip of about 6. When I first looked at the product I thought that seemed like a lot of seaweed for the price, but it's not since pieces are so small.  You're getting a lot of packaging for 3 scrawny pieces.  I didn't like this product at all.  I think I'll stick to Annie Chun.

review/text: Annie Chuns is the best; Sea's gift the next best and Ajitsuke last.  Annie chuns is too expensive because I eat a lot of seaweed for snacks.  I'm on a diet.  I don't like these individual packs because I ended up with dark green flakes all over my clothes since the strips are so fragile.  And they don't brush off if it's a sweater.  I do like the spice in them.  Kids probably can't eat these very well because you have to be careful opening them so they don't completely fall apart. So, I ordered Sea's Gift again after trying these out.

review/summary: Not bad, not great
review/text: Decent tasting seaweed.  I have several Korean friends who have prepared Korean meals for me, often including seaweed.  I tried this hoping it would be the same thing.  It tastes decent, but not as good as what I am used to, and not as crunchy as some of the other stuff I have tried.  My biggest frustration is the packaging.  If you are trying to eat a few packets in the car, the numerous small packets leave a lot of extremely light/thin plastic that won't just stay in a cup holder or other trash holder.<br /><br />Pros:  Good price, large quantity, fairly good taste<br /><br />Cons: Packet size (trash left after opening)

review/summary: Addictive little strips of yum.
review/text: If you don't like seaweed at all, don't bother.<br /><br />But if you, like me, have enjoyed a really good seaweed salad in your life you will find these little strips strangely addictive. Tasting like their deep green color, soy sauce and maybe just a hint of sesame (the "spice" is more flavor, not heat), these guys will go fast if you don't slow down.<br /><br />I'm not going to claim they are "healthy" - they pack a lot of salt in a little space - but they certainly are less guilt-inducing than other salty snacks. At 4 calories for three packs, your tongue will go numb from saltiness before you can ingest enough to put on a pound.<br /><br />I love them - and if you are a fan of Japanese food, you might too.

review/text: Well it's my own fault - I've never been a fan of seaweed but this sounded like it may be spicy and I love spicy.  This stuff definitely tastes like seaweed and for many of us that's an undesirable flavor.  I didn't notice much spice to it - slightly salty is about all I would say, but that does not take away from the gross flavor I call seaweed.<br /><br />It's not a total loss.  It makes for a fantastic prank - so far everyone of these I have given to someone has invoked a prank worthy reaction.  Just don't give it to drunk people - odds are high they'll spew.  Even after they spit it out the taste lingers, and if they swallow any of it they'll have fish breath for hours.<br /><br />Of course if you already have a pallet for seaweed all the others say its great!  But if you're searching for that seaweed product that changes your mind on how gross seaweed can taste this is not your product.  I won't rank it zero despite my tongue wanting me to - it's just not for everyone.

review/text: Based on the previous review and some web searches this sounded like an ideal product to replace salted peanuts, chips, whatever as a snack.  I took one bite from a packet and forced myself to chew the styrofoamy like texture and rotten off-fish smell.  Later that day I tried to see if my dogs would eat them and got nauseous opening a packet for them.  No, they were smarter than me and just sniffed them and walked away.  This product may be wonderful for your health but I hope there is a tasteless pill that can do the same thing if we have to get health from this.  So if someone likes this stuff I have 198 packets that I would be willing to send free of charge to the first one to email me via amazon.

review/text: I wanted to use this as a non-smelly hair oil. It is not easy to use because before each use, you have to melt it. Plus it has a strong but natural smell of coconut oil. I should have expected that. It does not have any added fragrance, hence the "fragrance free" claim. But the natural smell of coconut oil is itself significant. A good product I am sure but not appropriate for my intended use.

review/text: This "chowder" claims to be neither New England nor Manhattan -- i.e., no milk/cream and no tomatoes.  As an old clam chowder fan, I'm willing to try something new, but this was not a success.  Most disastrously, they brag about using sea salt but they use too darned much of it.  The salty taste lingered throughout dinner.  We still have five cans of this, so next time will make it with milk or half-and-half and see whether it converts into a decent New England chowder.  The clams and vegetables seem okay, if only one could taste them better.

review/summary: use it on all your steaks and burgers
review/text: My wife is from Texas and introduced me to this stuff.  I now use it on basically everything I put on the grill (especially beef).  Adds a nice subtle flavor and makes the meat look even more appetizing from the nice browning after you pull it off the grill.  Fortunately this sauce doesn't require refrigeration after opening or you'd be in trouble because you only need a couple of drops per burger (about the same amount as if you were using Worcestershire sauce).  So this bottle will probably last me YEARS.  But that's okay... since I've never found it in any supermarket north of Richmond.  Enjoy.

review/text: I've used the product of some 50 years now. The bottle is basically the same except it is plastic now. It has somewhat of a browned flavor although there is no meat or meat products in it. Straight for the bottle it has about the same taste as Worcestershire Sauce without the vinegar and chili pepper taste. Sometimes I use both depending on the flavor I am after, Kitchen Bouguet being the milder and smoother of the two. Most stores carry the 4oz bottles but the quart bottle is my choice that way I hardly ever run out. It makes brown gravy quick and easy when poured over the meat before roasting. Then just add water, some salt and blend in your thickening agent...Gravy.

review/summary: My fave coffee for the Keurig Vue
review/text: If you like strong, dark coffee, the Barista Italian roast for the Vue cup is excellent. I make it on the STRONG setting for 8oz and it's perfect. In fact, it's better than what I make in my regular pot unless I have very fresh coffee just ground from beans. The color is a rich, blackish brown, the roast is dark but not burnt-tasting and of all the coffees for the Vue I've tried, this one wins hands-down. I have the same blend in K-cups (for the office, where the K version sits) and they are not as good, for some reason. The Vue is not the most economical way to make coffee (that would probably be a plastic Melitta filter with a paper cone and a mug or a French Press) but the Keurig is fast and convenient. And I get the coffee the strength and temperature just the way I like it.

Fresh, tasty - so good in fact that they bear little resemblance to your average oily brazil nut.  A delicious, nutritious bargain!

review/summary: Big cup of good coffee
review/text: In the two years since I have had a Tassimo, numerous new coffees and teas have become available, including Seattles Best and now Starbucks. But only set of T-Discs is specifically formulated for big cups of coffee, Gevalia Morning Roast.<br /><br />This coffee is smooth and mild, and it produces a full twelve ounce cup of joe. If you use bigger coffee cups there is no need to water down the brew using the manual switch on your Tassimo.<br /><br />In the future more coffees will become available in 12 oz servings, but until then you can wait while sipping leisurely on your Morning Roast.

review/summary: It has 202 cals and 53 carbs per cup. Great sweetener, but their marketing is misleading!
review/text: I like this sweetener a lot. But it is not a NO sweetener like the label claims, it is a LOW calorie sweetener when you do the math.<br /><br />The company says on their website that are 202 calories and 53 grams of carbs for a cup of Ideal. So it is 12.5 cals/3.3 carbs a tablespoon, and 4 cals/1.1 carbs a teaspoon. So not an actual NO calorie sweetener like the bag says. They list 0 calories because they can since it is under 5 calories for the serving size they have listed, but on a large pouch meant for baking you would use way more than a teaspoon -- especially if you wanted to make any of the sweet items they have pictured on the front of the bag! The label should be changed to reflect its intended purpose. It's like saying a can of regular soda is calorie free if you list it as being 42 servings.<br /><br />That said, I will still be using it since it has less than a third of the calories of sugar, about a quarter of the carbs and tastes very good. Their shady lack of disclosure on the bag leaves a bad taste in my mouth. But while it's not a no calorie sweetener, but it is pretty close to ideal.<br /><br />Rating breakdown:<br />Product claims = 1 star<br />Product taste = 5 stars<br />Overall: 3 stars<br /><br />Calorie and carb info from their own website.

review/summary: Ok in a pinch, but make your own
review/text: I thought this product would be vastly different from all the other 'brown sugar replacement' items on the market. It does taste better than Diabetisweet or the Steele's.<br /><br />Ideal has become my new favorite sweetener. There is no aftertaste, unlike what many of us experience with Splenda. However I did not find this Ideal Brown Sugar sub to be so much different that it's worth the higher cost. It's just Ideal sweetener and molasses, packaged for convenience with the higher premium for convenience's sake.<br /><br />I make my own 'brown sugar' out of Ideal using about a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses to 1/4 c. of Ideal regular. You can adjust the molasses to suit your need for light or dark brown sugar in your recipes, or to suit your taste. (And your pocketbook will thank you)

review/summary: Simply the best sugar substitute available
review/text: For health reasons, our family has searched for an adequate sugar substitute. Over the years we have tried them all and found each product wanting - until we found Ideal.<br /><br />This sweetener has the taste and texture of sugar without any of the issues surrounding other sugar substitutes. It avoids the question of health risks attributed to aspartame. It does not have the 'grassy' taste of Stevia; the 'cold' sensation of erythritol; or, what we find to be, the after-taste of Splenda.<br /><br />For baking, it is unparalleled. Even our friends who eat sugar cannot tell that we use Ideal. We bake custards and crustless cheesecakes with Ideal and no one knows that they are sugar free. We use it in confections such as fudge and chocolate truffles with exceptional results.<br /><br />Like many other sugar alternatives, Ideal will not caramelize. This is not a fault of the product but rather a chemical dynamic of sugar alcohol based sweeteners. However, this seems is a small price to pay for a sweetener that is otherwise indistinguishable from sugar.<br /><br />Whether you choose to use the brown sugar substitute (which does not have the actual sugar found in Splenda's brown sugar blend) or the white sweetener, we are sure that you will find Ideal a wonderful alternative to sugar. We recommend it to our friends who are diabetic or who are looking to cut out sugar for other reasons. They all agree that it is the best tasting alternative to sugar on the market today.

I've been hearing all the horrors of sugar in our bodies and decided to really search for a substitute for my whole family. Well, I've found it...this sweetner was very good in my oatmeal along side the cinnamon. I was a little more hesitant to use it in my favorite cookie recipe. Well, this evening I used it in my recipe and it was fantastic! I didn't miss the sugar at all and it had no after taste at all. My husband even couldn't tell it was sugar free.<br /><br />So if you're like me and trying to get away from sugar, try this. It might surprise you too.

review/text: Finally, a really good substitute for brown sugar! I've only used it in three recipes so far, but it tastes great. The really good recipe was for Carolina Pulled Pork, and the accompanying vinegar barbecue sauce. Splenda's idea for brown sugar is to use their sweetener along with sugar-free maple syrup. Doesn't sound like brown sugar to me. This really does taste like brown sugar, though. It's not moist and clumpy like brown sugar, but the taste is there, and that's what counts.

I'm not happy about this, which is why I only gave it 1 star. If I could order more today I'd give it 5 stars.<br /><br />I didn't think anything could replace brown sugar in my latte, but this did it. It was good while it lasted I guess.<br /><br />Updated 4/26/12<br />Ok, they must have filled up their supply at Amazon because today it's back down to around $5.49. I get cranky when I run out of stuff I like, so this time I'm ordering 3 bags of it. AND raising my rating to 5 stars.<br /><br />BTW, this stuff is made with zylitol which my dentist promotes like crazy. He says it kills bacteria that cause tooth decay AND is a great anti-inflammatory.

review/summary: Better than Splenda Brown for baking
review/text: After doing lots of research regarding the best sugar substitutes for baking, I decided to try the Ideal brand.  I try to adhere as much as possible to a South Beach Diet eating plan, but I love to bake, so it was important for me to find something that fits the plan and still tastes good in baked products.  I had been pleased with Splenda Brown, but it still contains more sugar than I wanted to use.  I've been substituting Ideal Brown for brown sugar in my cakes and cookies and have been very pleased with the results.  There is none of that strange, artificial taste that often comes with sugar substitutes, plus Ideal Brown is much easier to measure.

review/summary: Wonderful stuff - and gluten-free too!
review/text: I'd had no luck finding a gluten-free brown sugar substitute until I found this on Amazon - and checked the manufacturer's website, which assured me it is gluten-free.  AND mostly xylitol - the sugar substitute I prefer anyway.  So I order one bag to try it, and quickly went back to order more.<br /><br />It's great stuff - more like light brown sugar than dark brown, so I need to add a tad of molasses in some of my baking.  And of course like plain xylitol, it's much drier than sugar, but adding a little applesauce to whatever I'm baking helps with that.<br /><br />But mostly I use it on my breakfast cereal - sprinkling cinnamon in the bottom of the bowl, adding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TXT502">Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> and a handful of raisins, microwaving it, and topping it with Ideal Brown no-cal sweetener.

I got 20 cookies from my dough so that's barely over 1 gram of carbs per cookie from the Ideal. The egg had less than 1 gram of carbs and the Peanut Butter had 32 grams of carbs in a cup so that's 1.6 per cookie. Total carb count for my cookies is less than 3 grams per cookie.

review/summary: ideal brown sugar substitute
review/text: I love ideal brown sugar substitute. Because it is from sugar alcohols it is natural, and unlike sorbitol or maltitol based substitutes, it doesn't affect my stomach. I use it on oatmeal and in baking to cut down on carbs. There is no aftertaste. My only complaint is that it is not clumpy like real brown sugar and that can sometimes affect baked goods, but so far I have had no problems with it!

I think it is an excellent product. it seems like there's hardly anything in the packet but to me one little packet compares to 2tsp of sugar when i put it in my coffee.

review/text: The Green Mountain Co. has a great assortment of different coffees and teas, and many are my favorites.  This variety box has many good ones, but there were about half that are in the stronger, dark roast category, such as the dark roast and french roast. I find these a bit stronger than I like, so I make a 12 oz. mug using two sixes. Overall a good product, I would just prefer a few more of the light and medium roasts like Donut Shop.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: We'd just bought a new Keurig coffeemaker and wanted to try an assortment to see what we liked.<br /><br />We love Green Mountain blend coffee, but the Breakfast Blend was a big disappointment. It is a light roast, but it tastes as though something was added to make it bitter. Maybe it's chicory. Whatever it is, the aftertaste is unpleasant.<br /><br />Dark Magic was okay for a darker roast, but we have found other dark roasts by Green Mountain that we like better.<br /><br />If you are looking to try different kinds, it is much better to find a local grocer that sells k-cups individually.

review/summary: Quality product and superior customer service
review/text: I discovered Amber Lyn chocolate about 9 months ago and was floored by just how good this sugar free dark chocolate was.  Some people find the maltitol objectionable and its true that some folks have a harder time with its digestion, however, other sweeteners have their own issues as well, not the least of which is how it affects the taste of the product.  I'm not diabetic but I have friends who are, I am however, a life long struggler with weight and avoidance of sugar goes a long way to making that battle more productive.  But being a chocolate lover, that was always a trade off till I found this product, the taste is downright sublime and satisfies far more so than even other gourmet chocolates made with sugar.  I experimented with various brands of sugar free chocolates, but at the risk of sounding like a chocolate snob, IMO those should've come labled "taste compromised".  Amber Lyn's is a taste that is pure satisfaction, a single bar is so satisfying in its taste and mouth-feel that often, it will last me 3 days as I nibble on it for a desert rather than devour it (though that temptation is definitely there).  My diabetic friends have all upon exposure to its taste, promptly placed orders themselves and not one has had anything even remotely negative to say about it.<br /><br />Finally, a note regarding their customer service.  I live in Las Vegas where the general rule is if you're ordering food online, either avoid ordering heat sensitive goods from March to September or make sure you can get extra care in shipping.  A craving overcame my normal precaution about this and I placed a order just as temps were hitting 100 degrees and carrier trucks are often 10 degrees hotter inside.  I was fully expecting a molten mess to arrive at my door as I had spaced off my normal precautions regarding such a order, yet the package arrived in a sytrofoam lined box with cold gel packs wrapped in paper between the chocolate containers.  My order was literally in pristine condition and totally without any say so on my end, they just knew to take that extra step for their customer.  That is a very rare level of service these days and Amber Lyn cemented my loyalty for life with that move.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're looking for quality, taste, and satisfaction not just for your taste buds but for your presence as a customer, I cannot recommend these people enough.  If all corporations were this dedicated to customer satisfaction, a lot of lawyers would be out of a job.

review/text: My wife and I are both diabetics so sugar candies are never on our list. We have<br />tried other sugar free chocolates but most have an after taste but were OK.  Amberlyn Chocolate are the best we have found.  We treat ourselves to half a bar each most nights, some nights we include a glass of red wine with our dark chocolate which adds a nice complement to Amberlyn's dark chocolate.  Maybe some day someone will create a sugar free wine to go with the chocolate? Well maybe but probably not in my life time. Anyway give ameberlyn a try, it's well worth the price.  God Bless and God Bless the USA!!

review/summary: Exceptional Chocolate Bar
review/text: After a student giving me an Amber Lyn Chocolate Bar, I was amazed how delicious and exceptional the taste was. I do not like sugar free products, but in looking at the ingredients, artificial sweeteners are not used in making an Amber Lyn bar. After eating the chocolate bar, I went to the Amber Lyn website to find out more about their chocolates because the taste is unique. While I like most chocolate, this really is different because there is a different aftertaste left in the mouth. Chocolate seems to resonate throughout my mouth after eating the Amber Lyn bar. It is definitely worth the cost to try one of these bars because See's and Godiva both charge a lot for their confections too. Amber Lyn is definitely gourmet chocolate and a box of bars might make excellent gifts at Christmas and other holidays.

Curiously enough THE WEIGHT PER BAR IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE AMAZON SITE!!  So, caution: MOST other sugar free bars are in the 3 - 4 oz range, and cost about twice (or more) per bar as this product; HOWEVER, THESE BARS ARE ONLY 1.2 oz each, so the unit cost ($/oz) is not at all favorable.

review/text: Here's the email I sent to the company after I read that it contains soy lecithin: I talked with your representative on the phone who was unable to tell me if the soy lecithin in your hazelnut dark chocolate and almonds is from GMO soy.  Since 93% of all soy is genetically modified, I'm assuming that it is a GMO.  GMOs (genetically modified organisms) have never been tested for safety in humans.  In animal studies, they have been shown to cause organ damage and infertility.  Monsanto, one of the companies that produce GMO seeds, infiltrated the government to get approval for it's products.  GMOs have been banned in many European countries.  Most soy, corn, canola, zucchini, breakneck squash and Hawaiian papaya are GMOs. Organic products cannot be genetically modified.  I've returned many items, when I found soy in the product or lecithin.  I couldn't read the label on your product on Amazon, so I didn't realize that it contains soy lecithin.  Lecithin can also be made from sunflower seeds, so it is possible to have healthy lecithin.  Please let me know what you find out about the soy lecithin in your chocolate.

review/text: This product is not really sugar free. If you check the calories from sugar, which I could not find disclosed here, you will see that the product has calories from sugar in it.  While it does not include regular sugar, it does include Maltitol which is a sugar alcohol.  Not really a good choice for someone looking for no sugar as there are better alternatives.  A 90% chocolate can get the sugar count down to 1 gram of sugar per serving.
