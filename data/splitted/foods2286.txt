review/summary: Very weak taste.....
review/text: I have purchased the Celestial Seasonings Chai Tea tea bags in the grocery store, and was impressed with the flavor. So when I saw they had them in the K-cups, I immediately jumped on them and ordered a box. I was so disappointed in it. It tastes nothing like their regular tea bag version. Weak is a word I would use. And I'm not sure what kind of spices they put it in, but it's nothing like any other chai tea I've had. I do not recommend this brand. If you're a regular chai drinker, you will notice the difference and likely be disappointed.

review/summary: Potent!
review/text: This stuff is surprisingly strong and potent. I've always had a problem with chai tea bags because they brew such a dilute cup of tea. But with the Celestial Seasonings Keurig chai, the tea is dark and opaque. I got a huge buzz off of the caffeine. Best of all, it's pure tea and spices, unlike the Cafe Escapes Chai Latte, which is full of artificial ingredients.

review/summary: Couldn't even finish one cup
review/text: I'm an avid chai drinker--many different varieties of both lattes and straight black tea.  We purchased this product because we noticed that the Cafe Escapes chai lattes--a sweeter, creamier blend--did not actually have much black tea in it, and we still wanted our morning caffeine.  Neither my husband nor I could finish one mug of this stuff, and we will end up getting rid of the box.  It was that awful. There was none of the subtle spice blending--just a watery slightly clove-tasting flavor undercut by a bitterness that almost had hints of coffee. Adding a little milk, as we usually do, didn't help at all.  If you enjoy chai, I'd recommend Bigalow or Tazo and skip this one.

I have fancier or more old fashioned tea brewing methods that I use when I have more time, but I default to this green tea when I need a quick fix.<br /><br />Now about the tea specifically - I have tried other green tea k-cups (competing brands), and none have been as clean-tasting and crisp as Celestial Seasonings.  I will continue to purchase this brand for my green tea needs.

Most of the k-cup assorted coffee produces light, watery coffee at 7.25 oz., but this green tea has  good color and taste even at the max. 9.25 oz.  I would recommend this green tea k-cup.

review/text: I enjoy chai tea very much and my partner drinks only tea, no coffee. So when we purchased our Keurig, we wanted to try several varieties of chai to find the perfect one. I shopped on amazon and bought several types with  reviews, cost, recognizable brand and speed of shipping being accounting factors ( in that order).<br /><br />Pros: Quick delivery<br />  The description is accurate and you get exactly what is advertised<br />  Known brand<br />  Fresh<br />  The price is moderate<br /><br />Cons: I mention price here again because it is cheaper in other forms ( tea bags)<br /><br />I prefer a non milk based Chai and so this was the ideal for me. I added sugar some days and drank it plain others and both were satsifying. My partner and I both enjoyed it above all the other flavors and I will reccomend and share with friends and family. I will continue to shop and attempt to find a better price, but would pay this again because it is worth it.

review/text: I tried this because I can't seem to find the Gloria Jean Serenity Tea which I liked very much.  The Celestial Seasonings was very very bland.  I even tried it on the smallest cup, and it made no difference.  There is no authentic flavor here.  I was brought up drinking green tea.  I especially like the Yama Moto brand green tea, but wanted something quick and easy in a k-cup. I like the Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice so I thought I would try the green tea.  I realize that coffee and tea are a personal preference.  For me, this green tea missed the mark completely.

I had a rebate deal that sent me 2 boxes of the Celestial Seasoning tea K-Cups and I've been hooked ever since!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings is much smoother than the Bigelow.  I hadn't realized how bitter the Bigelow was, I can't drink it any longer!!  I'm a purest when it comes to my black tea, I don't like too many other flavors superseding the tea.<br /><br />I wish I could get this in tea bags too (to carry in my purse when at restaurants, at friends houses and what not)!<br /><br />The Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast is just an super-enjoyable cup of tea!

review/summary: Great flavor!
review/text: I am not normally a hot tea drinker, but my Keurig makes it easy to experiment and try new things. This tea tastes great hot or cold so it has become my favorite tea.  It has a great taste and no bitterness that some black teas have.  Plus, I prefer to sweeten my own tea instead of having it presweetened for me.

review/text: I'm more of a tea drinker than coffee. I am sick and needed some hot tea so my wife bought these English Breakfast Tea K-Cups for me while she was at the store. I had only used the Keurig for coffee so I was a bit skeptical. This tea is amazing. I am going to keep it stocked in my pantry from now on.

review/summary: Wonderful hot or cold!
review/text: This is my favorite of the K-Cup Chai recipes. The spices are balanced though fairly strong allowing this tea to hold up well with the additions of honey (or sugar) and milk. It's wonderful served hot or cold. For the cold version, add your honey (or sugar) and milk, stir, and then pour over ice. When doing the iced version, I find it works best brewed on the 6oz size and then poured over ice in a 24oz glass. I prefer this to the Chai Latte K-Cups because I can control the amount of sweetener and milk.

review/summary: A fun Mix
review/text: As I have been sampling the Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans, one of the things I have discovered is that for me, at least, most of the flavors are too much of a good thing. I am a person who craves a little variety, so while I love the beans, I want more than just one flavor. That is where this selection and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLLK6">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Fruit Mix</a> work out very nicely for me.<br /><br />Instead of one flavor, we have the opportunity to mix and mingle our favorites, or simply enjoy the various flavors individually. whether you are a root beer fan, love orange crush, are craving a lemonade, or just want to enjoy any of the soda flavors, you will enjoy this particular mix.<br /><br />My favorite mixture is the fruit flavored one, but this comes in a close second.<br /><br />I am grateful to the distributor for a complimentary sample pack with all of the current flavors. As the only person in my house who eats jelly beans, this has given me the unique privilege of spending time getting to enjoy each flavor individually without worrying they will disappear when I'm not looking.<br /><br />While some of the beans are aimed at the adult palate, you will need to hide this assortment from the kids because this is one the whole family will enjoy.

The ranch dressing is dried on to the kale "chip" and the chips are light and has a great crunch.  These kale chips are dried rather than baked , ribs are removed as well so there is nothing but a great crunch.<br /><br />These chips are dehydrated not baked or fried and even though 100 calories for an 1oz seems like a lot since these chips are so light and fluffy an ounce is a rather good portion.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving Size 1oz (28g)<br />Servings per container: 2<br /><br />Calories:100 Calories from Fat 41<br />Total Fat: 5g<br />Saturated Fat: 1g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 190mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 10g<br />Dietary Fiber: 2g<br />Sugars: 1g<br />Protein:6g<br />Vitamin A: 112%<br />Calcium:6%<br />Vitamin C: 80%<br />Iron: 10%

review/text: I'm pretty adventurous about trying healthy foods, so after hearing about making your own kale chips on blogs, I decided to buy some first. I think the word "chips" is what mislead me - a chip to me is crunchy and dense - these literally taste like dead leaves off a tree. They are very airy and light (very leafy and paper like) and not very filling. But that may be just what you're after - a lot of people give kale chips rave reviews, so I guess it's best to say "to each his own." I just can't get past the texture and density. On the other hand, I researched kale and found it's super safe for dogs, so . . . my two dogs give this product 5 BIG stars; they LOVE this stuff!

review/text: Okay - I have to start out saying that I really love this company.  Having lived in Austin and loved Daily Juice, my heart wants them to win. However, this product is really terrible.  It is so caked on with goop that it is heavy and fatty and you might as well have a dorito instead!  I LOVED their original recipe..it was so light and yummy - it tasted good AND it was actually healthy - what a concept!  I now eat Lydia's - because those kale chips are at least a tad bit lighter.  Again, I wish them success - but they gotta get back on the health bandwagon with these puppies.

review/summary: Capt'n Eli's: The BEST of the Best!!
review/text: After first trying Virgil's root beer a few years ago, I have become a bit of a soda connoissuer - especially with root beer.  Once you get past the big name brands, you'll find there is a wide world of truly delicious flavors out there that corn syrup and industrial processes could never offer.  I have tried tons of specialty root beers out there, easily over 20 in all.  If I haven't heard of it, in an impulse I'll buy it, and Capt'n Eli's is the best stuff I've found!<br /><br />Capt'n Eli's uses all natural ingredients including wintergreen oil, anise, vanilla, and other various spices.  This doesn't make it particularly different from Virgil's or other top quality root beers.  However, there is something special about this one.  Capt'n Eli's is superbly clean and crisp with a vibrant multitude of flavors that will dance down your throat as its ultra-creamy head satisfies your every taste bud.  It is super-creamy, super-delicious, and ultra-lively.  It is the most vibrant, lively root beer I have ever tasted, and if I want real refreshment I far prefer one of these over anything else.  The stuff is seriously tough to put down!  So, what are you waiting for?  Don't think, just buy!  You can thank me later :)

review/text: We discovered this in a restaurant in Kittery Maine - Warren's Lobster House - and were hooked.<br /><br />We were on our way to Vermont and before we left we thought we could purchased this in any grocery store. Not so. No one in Portsmouth, NH where we were staying had ever seen it in NH and it was only 4 miles from Maine.<br /><br />So we quested and found it in a town just outside of Kittery in a Hanafords grocery. We cleaned out every bottle they had and thus we were able to continue on to Vermont.<br /><br />Now that we're here - the bottles grow fewer and fewer each day - the creamy foam on top is very smooth. I couldn't describe it any better than the first review here - other than add a hearty AYE!

I should've paid more attention to label, but after a precursory scan of the ingredients, I was satisfied that it truly was grain free, so I brought it home. Imagine my surprise, when upon opening the can, there truly were two very large HUNKS of beef inside. Now I've fed my girls the "stew" varieties of wet food where you really can see all the ingredients, but this was the truest from of advertising I had ever seen. I'm also glad there were two pieces of beef, as I was dividing the can between my two. My girls absolutely loved it and I would definitely purchase this product again.

review/summary: Disappointed is not strong enough
review/text: The product shipped me was so old the chocolate had turned white and was dry, cracked and tasted toooo nasty - returned items to shipper but have not received a refund.  First time I've been unhappy with a purchase from Amazon.  Ordered all three candy pkgs shown on Amazon - was unhappy with all of them as they were definitely rejected product but at least the other two with the Reese's products and Hershey bars were fresh - just misshapen or broken but taste was good. Will never order candy again from any of these folks.

review/text: This fun pack is a veritable taste sensation.  I thought perhaps I was dreaming when I opened up the snickers and smelled the sweet aroma of nuts and chocolate -- nothing beats biting into that succulent chocolate bar! At least that's what I thought, until I unveiled the crispy crunchy twix bar.  To do this is a true revelation, as the cookie and the caramel mingling sinfully with the chocolate is like dying and going to heaven. The fact that you can top off this delightful combo by unsheathing a Mars bar or the ever decadent 3 Musketeers -- well, it's truly a miracle indeed.

review/summary: Tummy trouble gone with this food
review/text: I commented on the other person's review, but thought I would say that I'm happy with this dog food.  My dog had stomach issues with science diet, and with this one, they went away.  I really think that it's more about what YOUR particular dog does well with and not necessarily that one food is better than the other (as long as you purchase at the petstore and don't go for something like ol' roy at the grocery store).  In other words, your dog might happen to do better on science diet, you just have to do some trial and error.<br /><br />Also, I was surprised to discover that this food is *way* cheaper at the petstore than on amazon.  Normally it's the other way around!

review/text: This food has done wonders for my husband's older Pointer mix. He had diarrhea and was very shaky while on his old food, but soon after starting this food his problems went away. He loves the taste and he doesn't have to eat a ton to be at a healthy weight. I thought the price on Amazon was reasonable. I used to work at a pet retail store and it was more expensive there. I have found it cheaper at Farm and Fleet, for those of you who live in the midwest area, and that is where I will be buying it from now on.

review/summary: This food is poison, gives my dog bloody diarrhea
review/text: After taking recommendations from Petco employees and a few show breeders, I decided to spend the money and feed my dog this food.  She is a 75lbs. APBT, and for the first 2 years of her life had bloody diarrhea.  I took her to the vet many times, and they couldn't diagnose the problem.  He had me switch to rice and chicken for a week, and that didn't help the problem (damaged intestines take longer than a week to heal).  So back to Pro Plan I went.  Finally after 2 years,  I smartened up and switched her to quality grain-free dog food.  Within 2 weeks, her intestines healed up and she had firm stools with no blood in them.  I was AMAZED after dealing with bloody diarrhea for the past 2 years.  Purina dog food is poison, as are all Purina products and all other brands of mainstream dog food.  Makes one wonder about the low quality synthetic ingredients found in so much "FDA-approved" human food that seems to frequently cause similar digestive problems for me...

It looks nothing like the picture and has very few items in it.  I have to go out and buy a bigger basket and add more things to it so I don't look like a cheap skate.  I won't buy from this company again.

review/text: I still find it strange that the so-called "thyme honey" is not aromatic. I have never tried Greek honey before and I found it rather strange. Meanwhile I tried other kinds of Greek Honey and I begin to understand that it is different from other kinds of honey... It is thicker and even though not so aromatic it still tastes good, therefore I upgraded my rating. Not bad at all... just different.

Each tin has 12 teaspoon sized packets of spices so you only open the amount of spice that you need.  The rest stay fresh and flavorful!  Not only are they great spices, but they are organic and beautifully packaged.  I can't say enough good things about Tsp!!!!

review/summary: This product is for small dogs ONLY.
review/text: A fabulous blend of chicken and turkey meats, broth, vitamins, herring for beautiful hair. Absolutely NO GRAIN product. This is as close to raw feeding you will get without doing it yourself and that doesn't work for one or two little ones. Your little furbabies will love it.<br /><br />On a delicate subject, it reduces the amount of stool passed by your dog as most of the food is absorbed by the body and not just passed on through. Don't forget that nice cold bowl of FRESH water.<br /><br />Most probably can be found locally for $10 less. ;- )<br /><br />DO NOT FEED TO LARGE DOGS -- LABS, GOLDENS, DANES, ETC. Their needs are different.

Maybe I added too much water because there wasn't any extreme salty taste.  It would be a good soup for the miso-phobe to try.
