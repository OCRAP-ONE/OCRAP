review/text: Who doesn't like pistachios? The taste is great and it's so easy to just eat them without having to break open the shells. Roasted and salted perfectly. Be careful because they are addicting and if you eat too much of the pistachios you will be taking in a lot of calories. At least they are not empty calories because pistachios have fiber, iron, calcium & potassium & unsaturated fats. Subscribe and save makes these pistachios a good deal. Better price than I find in the local grocery stores.

review/summary: Decent, Low Cost Blend
review/text: A super cheapy blend of pretty high quality single malts.  The only thing that kind of ruins this one for me is the big time alcohol on the nose -very overwhelming rubbing alcohol.  It goes down a little rough too.  The brashness of this one can be hidden in mixed drinks.  It is certainly the right price.

review/text: Even though this bread is gluten free I love it, and I am not on a restrictive diet.  We bought this bread because my wife is a celiac but I love the bread too.  One recommendation, definately keep the dough less than 1/4 inch think like the directions say otherwise the outside will get too hard and the center nearly raw.

review/summary: Favorite Chebe Product
review/text: I love the taste and texture. One of the reviewers rightly said "it does not rise". But, the product is flat bread so I presume this is why it does not rise as much as regular bread. I find that if I do not use more than the liquid recommended it cooks thoroughly. I brush on Olive oil prior to cooking so it browns somewhat. I use stoneware to cook it, a round 9" pan, which helps distribute the heat evenly and may contribute to it not being "gooey" in the middle. Also, once I have finished baking I grind garlic, mix it in Olive Oil with a little bit of salt and oregano. I put it on the bread and microwave it for about 30 seconds...delicious! This is a great product for those who are on a Gluten Free and Yeast Free diet. I love that there is no yeast in any Chebe products. I am on a GF diet but my husband is not and he really enjoys it.

review/text: I have a very special diet of no yeast, gluten, or dairy. The pizza crust has been a lifesaver for me! All other products like it in the stores have yeast. That is not good for someone with a systemic Candida yeast infection or yeast allergy. I also really enjoy the focaccia bread mix too! It is strange when mixing... Seems too dry, but the more you knead it the more doughy it gets. It bakes well.

review/summary: You'd never know it's gluten free
review/text: My husband is allergic to nearly everything you could make bread from (wheat, corn, rice, oats, barley, you name it). No other gluten free baking mixes and flours work for us because they all have rice or some other kind of grain, and the quinoa and amaranth flours all have a really strong off-putting flavor. I was ready to give up when I decided to try this. It was amazing. You would never know it was gluten free. I used it as a pizza crust. I used half parmesan cheese and half mozzarella in the mix itself, rolled it out fairly thin (about 1/4 inch), then baked it on a parchment paper-lined pan for about 30 mins. I put the toppings (tomato sauce, fresh basil, and fresh mozzarella) on after I baked it and put it back in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese. It came out beautifully. Tasted like a Sicilian margherita pizza I might have gotten from the pizza place around the corner (in NJ where we know what good pizza tastes like). I can't wait to try some of the other baking mixes from Chebe.

review/text: Baking it yourself is almost always better than store-bought, and that goes double for GF products. I live at 7,000 ft elevation so baking is a challenge to begin with. I'm allergic to both wheat and corn, so the corn starch that's used in so many GF products is out for me. I use this mix for both focaccia bread and pizza dough, and it consistently works well -- I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Buy some
review/text: For months I've seen Chebe mixes in the local natural foods store.  I kept thinking that I should try it, but I have been so consistently disappointed with gluten free bread products that I wasn't terribly excited about it.  The elimination diet must have driven me to desperation because I bought  box last week.<br /><br />The baking instructions called for the addition of oil, shredded cheese (which I omitted), eggs, and water or milk.  Very simple.<br /><br />My favorite egg replacer for baking is banana, but I somehow thought  the banana flavor wouldn't work so well with focaccia.  I used flax gel instead.  I used rice milk for the liquid, kneaded, and pressed my dough into the pan.  It smelled so incredibly while it was baking that I didn't think I could wait until it was finished.  As a matter of fact, I didn't.  When it was mostly done I pulled it out the oven (after telling myself that it should be baked through and I just needed to test it), cut a piece, and placed it on a plate with a little olive oil.  Oh my!  It was fantastic.  Slightly underdone, but fantastic.  It went back into the oven sans the piece I already inhaled.<br /><br />I can't describe how delicious it is.  I can't even say that it tastes like "real" focaccia bread because I haven't had such a thing in years.  What I can tell you is that it is the best gluten-free bread experience I have ever had.  Ever.  And it happened in my very own kitchen without a lot of work.<br /><br />Chebe has one flaw.  It is not so good the day after, even with reheating.  This is especially awful considering it is already difficult to restrain myself from eating the entire batch.

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Pizza Crust!!!
review/text: I am 100% sold on the Chebe brand.  For most of the products, it may seem like an acquired taste (getting used to the tapioca flour and the way it cooks).  This product, Chebe Bread Focaccia Flat Bread, seemed like a perfect idea for pizza and sandwiches or wraps.  We own a Presto Pizza Pizzaz and it worked perfectly.  I recommend putting a sheet of foil on the pizzaz plate/or pizza pan if cooking in the oven.  I mixed the Chebe in a Kitchen Aid and then rolled it out into a thin circle (we like thinner crusts).  Unlike most Gluten Free pizza crust mixes, Chebe's actually stays thin.  It doesn't bake up like a cake, like the Gluten Free Pantry brand does.  We use WalMart brand pizza sauce (GF) and cheese, and put on the toppings of our choice.  It cooks perfectly and tastes great.  There are italian spices already in the mix that taste delicious, you just add egg, oil, and parmesan cheese.  It's quick and simple!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Cooks flat as a pizza crust should<br />- Mix tastes great with spices infused<br />- Works best for pizza, sandwiches, and wraps<br />- Makes two 12-14", thin crust pizzas (we usually eat one and put the 2nd crust in a baggie in the fridge to make a few days later)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Chebe used to hide their ingredients lists in the recipe, but this new packaging actually lists it at the top, which is helpful!<br />- Can't think of anything else...it's that good.<br /><br />If you like this, I also recommend the Cinnamon Rolls.  Mix up a Cream Cheese Frosting, and you'll swear you were eating Cinnabon.  I love Amazon's Subscribe and Save!

review/text: This mix made an excellent pizza crust!  The italian seasoning was a nice addition to the pizza flavor.  My family actually liked my crust better than the bought ones they had used. The key is to press it thin, like they recommend on the packaging, then cook it for ten minutes before adding the toppings and then put it back in the oven to finish cooking.  I can't wait to use this mix to make other items such as calzones and garlic sticks as recommended by some of the other reviewers. What a treat for those with special diets!!!

review/text: I like the foccacia mix.  At first I messed up two batches because I tried to make it without cheese - not a good idea. It came out too dry and turned hard.

But when I finally got it right, it was very tasty.

review/text: I bought this focaccia flat bread because it was on sale, but now I know why.  The mix is a LOT less versatile than many of the other mixes, and you aren't supposed to use this for pizza crust (just "flat bread").  So I just ended up making a lot of bread sticks and mini rolls (which turned out yummy), but not what I really wanted it for.  Chebe is a great product, but I would check their website FIRST for recipes, and then buy the appropriate mix.  The all-purpose is a better bet.

review/summary: Not bad, but not fabulous
review/text: This is a decent product, and much better than most gluten free mixes available.  However, it has that "slimy feel" that a lot of gluten free products have.  It doesn't rise at all, even with yeast added (seems to be too heavy). It does have Italian seasonning in the mix which is nice.<br /><br />However, if you make the mix according to directions, divide the dough into fourths, roll it out slightly thin and cook on the stovetop in a buttered skillet, it's pretty OK.<br /><br />I've also made it like above, adding extra Italian Seasoning, Oregano, and yeast.  I allow the rolled out dough to rise for about 30 minutes, then cook in butter on the stovetop.  Serve Italian style with seasoned olive oil for dipping.  Not too bad.

review/text: I have been using this dogfood since my dog was a few months old.  She is four now and is still on it.  I've tried switching to cheaper brands and she had serious stomach issues with those other brands.  I will continue to use this brand for my mini dachshund.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Food!
review/text: After lots of research online, I purchased this dog food for my 10 lb Papillon/Chi mix. I was told by the vet that smaller dogs need better quality food, because they eat less. After 2-3 months on this food, I noticed a dramatic difference in her fur. It was much healthier and softer and she was shedding less. I like the puppy food better because the pellets were smaller & it seemed to last longer, but my dog seems to like this the same!

review/summary: Not Recommended
review/text: The first ingredient in this product is corn. Dogs can't digest that ingredient and you should not feed them anything which contains it.<br /><br />This product also contains chicken, which unless boiled, can negatively impact canines in a variety of physical and behavioral ways.<br /><br />Finally, this product contains a number of fillers and processed carbohydrates. Dry kibbles in general aren't very nutritive and I don't think this is the worst of the bunch out there. But it certainly isn't one of the best.

review/summary: Excellence
review/text: These peppercorns are exactly as advertised: sweet and fruity with a  tangy pepper overtone. I am still experimenting with which pepper to use with what dish, but I did try this on a lemon salmon and it was very good.<br /><br />I also want to note that the customer service from the company was excellent. I had a problem that I did not tell them about but I did put it in a review. A customer service representative contacted me and resolved the problem very quickly and at no cost to me. You can't beat that kind of service. I will be using Olive Nation again.

review/summary: Nice addition to my kitchen
review/text: I had never used pink peppercorns before and must admit to my surprise that they are actually a very good addition to my spice rack.<br /><br />These are very mild peppercorns and as described, they do indeed have a sweet, somewhat fruity flavor mixed in with a wonderful peppery taste.  Let's face it, they also look pretty cool.<br /><br />I have been using them on different fish dishes (I use it as a rub) with quite a lot of success.  I also used them with several other spices and herbs in a bottle of olive oil for salads.  They added much to the flavor of my mix.  Do take warning though, you use these rather sparingly as the flavor can overwhelm other spices you may be using.<br /><br />This is not a spice that I use everyday, but it is one that I am glad I added to my cooking arsenal.  The same old spices dish after dish gets a bit old and it is nice to be able to dazzle things up a bit from time to time.<br /><br />I like this product.

review/summary: Great Product - New Experience
review/text: I like these peppers in everything I've tried them in: salads, stews, and soups. I've never bought pink in bulk before and am still experimenting to find their place in my kitchen. (Thus, I cannot compare them to others' of the same type.) So far, I have found that pink peppers can be used anywhere greens can be. Their taste is slightly lite with a little snap and a great aroma. I'm guessing that this first-time purchase will be repeated. However, one pound of peppercorns will last a long time. The price from the single vendor, JR Mushrooms, seems very good. I'm guessing (due to lack of experience with the pink) that this purchase was a good bargain.

review/summary: A nice cup of coffee but not my personal favorite
review/text: After going through 15 pounds of disappointing coffee (I got a little over-excited when Amazon began shipping to Hawaii) I went looking for a roaster here who produced coffee as good as I had been getting on subscription elsewhere. (Note that was canceled only because of a dramatic increse in shipping prices).  Having ordered favorite single origin beans from another roaster in 5 pound bags and being consistently disappointed, I ordered one of Coffee Master's samplers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UFSOXE">Coffee Masters Around The World In Twelve Coffees Variety Pack, 1.5-Ounce Packets (Pack of 12)</a> and realzed that at last I had found a roaster here who knew their beans, and how to roast each to bring the best out in them!<br />My mistake was putting yet another coffee on subscription before I had actually tried it (at that point having tasted the Brazilian and Costa Rica Terrazzu). I did this because all my favorites were out of stock and I was happy with the roaster and wanted to replace my subscriptions to beans that didn't make the cut.<br /><br />When I opened the bag my first reaction was " this smells like coffee".  OK, apart from stating the obvious, I was thinking that it did not have anything unique or special about it, like the distinct flavor and aroma from African coffees, e.g.  It also did not smell stale, burnt or otherwise off.  This is not a coffee I will be unhappy with (except that I accidentally ordered ground when I always opt for whole-bean when available).  I think I will save it for when I need to wake up, but not badly, and drink my other single origins when I am awake and looking for a more unique aromatic coffee.<br /><br />I would recommend instead, the Brazilian Santos, which was a very pleasant surprise (as I do not generally drink light roasts): full bodied and aromatic! I liked most of what I got in the sampler, and this was not bad (at all) I just prefer some of the other single origin coffees.  I guess I will just have to hope that Amazon has one or more of them in stock when I am ready to order more.

review/summary: The Good and the Bad
review/text: The Good - Necco Wafers can get stale if they're in inventory for too long. These weren't. They were fresh and tasted great, if you love Necco Wafers, and I do.<br /><br />The Bad - Even though obvious effort had been made to pack them properly, the box was badly battered and the contents had shifted so that the wafers were not at all protected by the little air bags that probably had surrounded them when they were given over to the shippers. Thirty six rolls of wafers with, I'm guessing, at least 50 wafers per roll. That would be a minimum of 1800 wafers. All but, perhaps 50 wafers total were broken ... some just into two or three pieces, but many were smashed to granules. I actually had to put them into a bowl and eat them with a spoon.<br /><br />I really was disappointed.

review/summary: A great candy with a long history
review/text: I love Necco Wafers.  Like many my age (mid-50's) I have fond memories of them from childhood and unlike many other candies they have not made the package any smaller.  They changed the formula in 2009, going to an all natural recipe and reduced the flavors from 8 to 7.  This went over as well as New Coke and the McDLT did.  They went back to the original product that dates all the way back to 1847 (Union Soldiers called them "Hub Wafers" and carried them during the Civil War) just this summer.<br /><br />When I received my box of 36 rolls I was surprised at how heavy it was.  It probably should have been shipped in a larger box with some packing material around it as some of the rolls on the end had broken wafers inside of them.  Other than that, I love them.  I don't eat candy very often and when I do I like my snack to be simple and you can't get much more simple (and tasty) than this nostalgic confection.  I will be ordering more.

If you like to make a stronger batch, experiment by infusing some with fresh peel like you would with rosemary etc., overnight will do, then use it quickly before the magic disappears.

I've been drinking Green Tea for a while and this is my favorite combination.  The blackberry and ginger make the tea smooth tasting.  In addition, some green teas overwhelm my guts, while this one keeps them calm and happy.<br /><br />I've also discovered that this makes a great sun tea.<br /><br />If you are looking for a strong Ginger taste, I suggest combining one bag of this tea with one bag of TM's Ginger aid (also a favorite).

review/text: I just received this box of "Green Tea with Ginger."  I brewed one cup each for my husband and myself, but there was no ginger taste, and the tea was dark in color. I checked the ingredients list on the box, and it is actually green tea with blackberry leaf!! Ginger was listed last on the list, an indication there is less of it than blackberry leaf. I wanted the taste of ginger; NOT the overwhelming taste of blackberry which I DO NOT CARE FOR and would never knowingly buy!! When I went online to Amazon Returns, it said "this item cannot be returned!!' This is terribly unfair, and this experience has lowered my estimation of Amazon.com.  Whatever happened to "quality control?"

When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as "MADE IN CHINA". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!<br />One Star is much too high a rating. I had to throw out all the Dogswell products I purchased, Shame on Amazon for selling without disclosing the source!

review/summary: BEWARE - MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I am so appalled at this finding as my dog has been taking these treats for 8 years, now this explains to me why my dog became so ill back in October 2011 and still no diagnosis as doctors kept pumping me for money and told me all tests were negative. I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like "THREE DOG BAKERY" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label "MADE IN CHINA" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it. Thanks again for the reviews and concerns of the caring people out there.

review/summary: Dogswell chicken and apple, banana, sweet potato treats
review/text: I've purchased the 3 types of treats thru Subscribe and Save.  They are no longer supplied by Amazon and I am not surprised. You can still obtain them from other vendors on Amazon.  Be aware they look nothing like the product pictured. The quality has deteriorated and is now poor at best. The apple treats are now nickel sized pieces of apple(more like little sponges)and the chicken strip around the apple is nearly black in color. It is beyond hard. Whats with this?  The ingredients state this is supposed to be chicken breast!  BEWARE-THESE TREATS ARE MADE IN CHINA!!  I cringe to think what may have been substituted.<br /><br />There was no notice by Amazon that these came from China-known for manufacturing deadly dog products.  I would never have purchased them. I suggest you don't either.  My dog no longer eats them.  I have nearly $100 of product.  I can't with a good conscience donate these to the animal shelter or even toss them out for the crows. Inquire as to the country of origin before you buy - "distributed by" doesn't count.  There are many other safe and healthy treats available and they proudly state 'made in America'!

He LOVED them...so much that even though I only gave him the recommended amount per day for his weight class he STOPPED EATING HIS FOOD.<br /><br />I went in to Petco and spoke with a customer service rep who told me a couple of people had come in with similar experiences. He said he was personally curious about it and did some research online and pulled up some reviews (which we looked up together while I was in the store) of people with the same issue. We discovered Dogswell now makes this product in China. Whether or not that automatically makes it unsafe I don't know but given the other reviews and the sign from my own dog I am no longer willing to risk it. Do some research - google "Dogswell made in china" and decide for yourself.

review/text: On occasion, my daughter and son-in-law will go away and leave their Shitsu (Dodger) with us for a few days visit.  When that happens he seems to come with all the material things that help make him happy.  That includes a large jar of assorted treats. Sometimes I'd wonder why they're called treats because he often doesn't get excited by any of the many varieties that jar contains.  I mentioned this to my daughter and she referred me to this product. We ordered it (from Amazon) on his last visit and I was amazed at how quickly he accepted and consumed them when offered. Unlike others which he might shun or sometimes take and may not actually eat, the Happy Hips treats were always eaten right away. Both Dodger and I rate this product as a "buy now".

review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered these.  I knew my dog liked sweet potatoes and because I've been buying Dogswell Happy Hips brand treats for years I thought we'd give it a try.  Here's the skinny:<br /><br />They are smaller than the other treats.  This is because they are pieces of dried sweet potato with chicken wrapped around them!  This makes them a bit chewy and thus should work well to aid in the daily cleansing of your dog's teeth.  There is no unpleasant odor, nor is there an oily or greasy residue.  They are the same high quality treats we've become accustomed to buying from Dogswell.  Our dog LOVES them and we'll be buying them again in the future as they are a nice change from the "meat" jerky varieties she has been eating for years.  Next time we'll try apple!
