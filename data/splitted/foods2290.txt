review/summary: It's Water...It Tastes Wet
review/text: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12)<br /><br />I cannot say that the claimed health benefits of this water are true. In order to prove or disprove that, I would have to hire a team of scientists and do expensive and exhaustive tests on myself. I'm not going to do that!<br /><br />What I can tell you is that I have well water and it is extremely high in iron and has to have a softener added to make the water palatable. My problem with that is that I'm on a low salt diet for a heart condition so I now have to double filter my drinking water. It's filtered once at the beginning of the well and again in a separate filter in my fridge.<br />This is some of the info from the Essentia web site, and the product description from here- "Drinking Essentia Water helps bring you back into balance and helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more. Plus, Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system."<br /><br />I have to admit that I did drink a whole bottle of this for the last few days---and I have been sleeping better (Can't tell you if it's a coincidence). IF the claims of lowering blood pressure and heart health are true that will be a plus for me, but right now as I said only long-term usage and the help of my doctor will tell me if the claims are true.<br /><br />It tastes better than my well water and actually, it does have a `smooth' sort of taste to it. Of course, since it's bottled it is convenient to tote around and to keep some in my car too.<br /><br />The problem is, is that I'm not so sure if it is worth $2.40 a bottle without the subscription with the subscription it comes to $2.04 a bottle. If you drink the amount of water Doctors recommend, that will come to approximately 300.00 a month (much more if you want to use this water to make your coffee tea etc. for added health benefits ). In addition, having to haul a heavy case of water up the stairs a few times a month does not turn me on.

review/summary: It's marketed water that is not at an ideal pH for the body
review/text: This water purportedly contains 9.5 ph. However, the purported benefits of high pH water are not demonstrated in scientific literature, only in this company's marketing materials. The fact is that the ideal pH level of drinking water should be between 6-8.5. The body maintains a pH equilibrium on a constant basis that is not affected by water consumption of higher or lower pH, unless it's consistent consumption on a regular basis. In fact, our stomachs have a naturally low pH level of about 2, which is helpful for food digestion, and our stomachs will self-adjust to maintain this naturally low pH level.<br /><br />Yes, it's water, and Amazon will ship 12 bottles to you for about 2 bucks a bottle. If you do choose to get this monster shipment, also consider purchasing carbon off-sets.

review/summary: Great water, but bogus marketing claims
review/text: Essentia water tastes great, and its price is in the same ball park as other good quality bottled water. However, stating that the 9.5 pH is good for you is completely devoid of any scientific substance. In fact, there are a lot of scientific studies that completely refute these claims. There's a page by a retired chemistry professor, who rips into the variety of similar "alkalanized" and "ionized" water marketing claims. Most importantly, his page contains a lot of links to University and other scientific research results that all undermine the important of the 9.5 pH. Having said all that, I do like the taste of Essentia water, so whatever minerals it has in it does make for great tasting, pleasant to drink water. Just don't fall for the pH hype until and unless you read the science reports instead of trusting any marketing hype.<br />[...]

review/summary: Essentia: Improved Taste, Improved Digestion
review/text: Essentia 9.5 PH Drinking water is a bottled water made with good digestive health in mind. It takes the ordinary concept of bottled water a few steps further by adding calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, and sodium bicarbonate. It then elevates the PH for better digestion and the reverse osmosis and purification via micro- filtration help make for the cleanest possible taste.<br /><br />We have all heard recommendations from experts that bottled water is a bunch of hype and not worth the money and for the most part I agree with this assessment. The majority of bottled waters on the market are nothing special and not worth the expenditure. But there are some bottled waters that are enhanced in ways that make them better and Essentia is one of them. The added minerals and improved processes help elevate this water to a level not matched by most bottled water products. The higher PH makes the product more alkaline and this suits someone like me very well, since I sometimes suffer from acid reflux. After a heavy meal, my stomach actually feels better if I drink this water.<br /><br />As for the taste, I find it very smooth and clean- the way water should taste. I have taste-tested this, side by side, against the water that comes out of my water filter pitcher and I can say that, while both taste good, this product is a little cleaner and smoother in flavor. It does cost more than the water out of my water filtered pitcher, but the taste is a little bit better.<br /><br />Essentia is packaged in BPA free plastic bottles and it is made with environmental concerns in mind. Combine that with the taste and improvements in digestion and you have a clear, bottled- water winner in my book.

review/text: Ok.. lets get one thing straight.. I can't believe I am raving about.. water!<br />When I got this bottle I read the bottle "hmm 9.5 ph.? reverse osmosis? electrolytes? yeah ..whatever" and popped it into the fridge<br />I had some yesterday after cutting the lawn and said "hmm this water tastes.... good?"<br />It had some kind of I dunno.. taste to it; anyway, I liked it and  that was that.<br /><br />Well today I had to pack 2500 markers.. basically 50 bundles weighing 50 pounds each, in the lovely NJ humid air.<br />I open this stuff.. and WHOA... this is freaking good water! I literally drank the remaining bottle on the spot.. fast enough it gave me a brain freeze a few times!  And you know what I actually *felt* better later.. Refreshed.. definitely hydrated -- and I want MORE of this water!<br /><br />Ok .. the water has electrolytes added (or "infused") and as you read in the listing:<br />"Essentia drinking water is purified through micro-filtration, UV lighting and reverse osmosis; No chlorine or flouride; Enhanced with pure minerals; Restructured through ionic separation"<br />ok....<br />.. I have NO idea what that means..... but I DO KNOW it tastes GREAT.. I can't explain it but it really *REALLY* does taste "Crisp" and there .. and I don't mean it in a bad way - a "mineral" taste to it.. I truly can't explain it.. but I can honesty say this is really REALLY good water..<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend this.. even if you try a small bottle at a local store (I don't know if it is available) and see for yourself.. then come back here and get a case!<br /><br />Thanks for reading !<br />-- a very hydrated Jim :)

It was refreshing and as the label claims, had a "smooth" taste.<br /><br />2) Bottle size:  I love the size of the bottles.  The 1.5 liter is a great size to keep by your work desk and while working out.  This was the perfect amount of water for an hour long workout.<br /><br />3) Recyclable bottle:  I also like that the company used a #1 Pete bottle, which is readily recyclable in most communities.<br /><br />While all of the above are true, I didn't find this to taste significantly better than my local tap water.  It is convenient and refreshing, but unless you have some hard core minerals or chemicals coming out of your faucet, I don't know if this water will blow you away.<br /><br />This water is bottled in Bothell, Washington.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride.

Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive. Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance."<br /><br />I have no doubt that drinking water like this non stop every day might have health benefits. But is it worth the cost or the time to constantly be buying this water. I don't think so.<br /><br />The bottle I got off Amazon Vine tasted great and was refreshing, but I have other things to spend my money on besides water.

review/summary: At The End of the Day, It's Just Water in a Fancy Bottle
review/text: At the end of the day, it's just water.<br /><br />The label claims a lot of things such as a silky smooth taste, better hydration, the infusion of electrolytes, and the "best available pH at 9.5" which I really can't comment on as I didn't have any scientific equipment to test the pH level.<br /><br />I wish I could give you some flowery comments like you can with wine, such as having the ability to smell a hint of apricots, smoke, and charcoal while drinking this, but I can't.  I will tell you the water somehow tastes different (and better) really cold vs. room temperature.<br /><br />After trying this water myself and being unable to conjure up a "wow" factor, in order to see if there is a taste difference with this water I set up a "Water Challenge" similar to the old Pepsi Challenge with two of my co-workers as follows: I poured equal amounts of cold water in cups containing the Essentia water, water from a Walmart / Sam's-branded bottle of water, and water from the tap that had gone through a filtration device in the office.  The results were incredible - you couldn't tell a difference and the limited test subjects were unable to correctly identify the "better" water.  For clarification, the Walmart-branded bottle was first for one participant and tap water was first for the other.<br /><br />In other words, there is nothing wrong with this water.  However, if you look at the cost/benefit analysis of purchasing this water - including shipping from Amazon - the accountant in me just can't say I need to make sure I buy this in the future: it's way too pricey per ounce when, at the end of the day, there's probably nothing wrong with the water coming out of your tap if you have basic filtration on it.

review/text: If you are looking for large bottles of water that has basic essentials to help keep your body hydrated then this water is perfect for you.  The water itself is refreshing.  It does not have the "metal" taste sometimes that you might find in some other more popular waters on the market.  The taste is 100% water.  For someone wishing only to drink water and yet add other things to it, this water is perfect.<br /><br />The plus of this water is the bottles themselves.  They are large and if you are doing a slower workout, this water should last the entire time and even more.  A tougher workout would probably exhaust the water but is perfect as it provides the necessary nutrients to help you after the workout is over.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased by this water.  A box of this water will last you a while.

review/text: The water tastes like every other bottled water. I have no idea whether the PH of the water makes any real difference. I did not realize these bottles were going to be so huge (over 50 ounces), so it was a struggle getting them up the stairs. It also makes them somewhat bulky to use. The price seems expensive, but when you consider that these bottles are over twice the size of most bottled waters, it is reasonable.

review/summary: False advertising
review/text: I'm so disappointed in this company! I've been drinking this water for quite a while now, but yesterday I saw my nutritionist and she checked my pH level which was acidic.  I told her that was surprising considering how much alkaline water I drink.  She suggested we test the pH of my bottle of Essentia,  so we did.  The pH was ACIDIC at 6.6!!  I was livid!  Now to be fair..I am a nurse and know that the pH strips can expire and should be stored and handled a certain way and should also be tested by buffers.  I can't guarantee my nutritionist followed these steps so I plan on purchasing my own pH strips and checking the water again.  I sure hope the strip was wrong and the next test will yield different results!  I will definitely post those results either way!

review/summary: Tasted Like Plain Water...Question the Claims
review/text: This 1.5 Liter bottle of water tasted just like water. If you want water with baking soda in it that tastes like water, this seems like a good bet. I was worried about the taste...It didn't taste great to me (I guess I'm a bit of a water snob drinking only home delivery purified water) and I prefer simple RO water.<br /><br />But the big selling point of this water is that it is alkaline. The reality is that your body has a built-in pH regulating system in your lungs and your kidneys. Want to increase your blood pH? Breathe faster. But even then, when you stop thinking about it, your brain will regulate your breathing and your kidneys will adjust to make your blood pH whatever your body wants it to be. You may be able to cause some short-term changes in your blood pH by changing the pH of your water. But your lungs will quickly compensate. You may see some differences in your stomach pH and thus some relief of indigestion similar to taking an antacid. But if you are having gastrointestinal symptoms from acid, you probably shouldn't be treating with alkaline water but should seek medical help to see if you have something more serious going on or should get some more effective antacid medications that have fewer side effects than alkaline antacids. I can find no research to substantiate the claims that alkaline water is beneficial for your health.

review/text: Firstly, I am picky with water. I do not like Aquafina or Dasani because I think they taste like the plastic bottle. My favorite waters are Deer Park and Poland Spring. Both have a clean, crisp flavor, with no funky after taste or odd plastic taste.<br /><br />Essentia has a nice clean, fresh taste. Just pure clean water. No after taste, no odd tastes overall. I love the bigger sized bottle. I cannot attest to the benefits of drinking pH water specifically because I only tried the one bottle and of course did not see any benefits or notice anything spectacularly different from any other water.<br /><br />I suppose if you have great interest in the long term benefits of drinking Essentia with its 9.5pH and if you do not mind the price, it is worth it. I myself cannot see spending so much on bottled water, although it does have a very good, pure taste.

review/text: Like many other reviewers have stated, many of the special points of this water are just marketing claims, and I agree. There's nothing really special about this product, it's basically flavorless Gatorade. I also found it funny that it comes "doctor recommended" but there is no information about which doctors or what kind recommend this product and why. Supposedly the high-pH makes it healthier for you because the lower amount of acidity somehow magically makes it a health product of some kind. What does having a high-pH level do exactly? From what I've read with my minor amount of research, it's supposed to increase your metabolism, boost your energy levels and other jargon-filled, specious claims that many other health foods make. None of these things have been proven, so why crow about it?<br /><br />This is a good water in that it tastes good, but I'm giving it a low rating because of all the dubious health and medical claims that the company makes regarding this product.

review/summary: Tastes great, filtered several times ... but not sure about the hype or the price
review/text: This company's got a very interesting philosophy - to filter the water with reverse osmosis (which is what we use at home), then also to run through UV sterilization, then add minerals, electrolytes, and some sort of baking soda to boost the pH. It's completely overkill, but I'm unaware of any other bottled water that goes to these extremes.<br /><br />The taste is great, and it actually helped settle my stomach after a bad trip to the salad bar.<br /><br />However ... when I tested the pH level at home (I tested it three times using litmus paper from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBMAVQ">Home Water Test Kit</a> I bought on Amazon), the results were the exact same as my tap water.<br /><br />Keep in mind, I'm no expert. And the Essentia web site says litmus paper doesn't work on their water (I still don't understand why - maybe there's a chemistry teacher out there who can chime in?).<br /><br />Others have complained that Essentia is just tap water that's been filtered - but I see that as a huge perk. Being able to bottle it very close to the point of sale is much more environmental & cost effective than hauling glacier water half way around the world. Since they add minerals & electrolytes, additives can be measured, consistent, and guaranteed clean.<br /><br />My bottom line: I like the taste, I like the electrolytes, I like the size of the bottles (1.5 liters) and that they're BPA-free & Phthalate-free. I still think the price point is too high, and I'm not sure about all their marketing claims.<br /><br />I think I'll stick with our reverse osmosis system at home, and use Essentia for when I'm feeling acidic or ill.

review/summary: Water, water, everywhere...but not a drop to drink
review/text: I think one of the other reviewers summed up my feelings best concerning this product with their intro line to their review, "Have you ever had...dry water?"  I understand the health benefits of drinking bottled water, but I did not like the taste of this one.  Another reviewer described this water as having a "silky taste" but I could not get the dry like, metalic taste out of my mouth after I drank this.<br /><br />My family did not seem to like this either.  My Husband stated he preferred tap water, after I fixed him a glass.  My 9 year old son made a face as he tried to drink it, stated he did not want to finish it, and proceeded to pour the rest down the sink.  My 11 year old tried it, stated he liked milk more than any other kind of beverage, and also said he did not want more.<br /><br />Again, for the health benefits the company advertises related to this water, perhaps that is why some people have given this water rave reviews.  It is simply not for me or for my family. I like tap water, and because tap water has fluoride in it, I feel tap water is better for bones and teeth.  This product was a free sample, and this is not a product I would ever buy.

review/summary: Not the Best
review/text: I liked the water going down, but the aftertaste hit me and I thought of piercings for some reason. The metal taste was not overpowering but, when I pay for water, I don't expect to notice it. I'm not gonna waste your time with a long review, i'll just say it this way. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd place this way above tap water but below Smart Water. honestly, I'd just get it if i was keen on buying something more than the 24 packs out there.

review/text: This is a very nice and very BIG bottle of water. If you are spending the day fishing or outside, this one bottle can replace several smaller ones. The water has a very good taste, no mineral flavors or after taste. As too the health benefits, just drinking water is a health benefit in its self. So the added electrolytes and pH benefits are a bonus.

review/text: Decided to try a 9.5 water hearing someone raving about it for hydration at the salon.  I have to say that the taste is very smooth and silky and extremely refreshing.<br /><br />I don't have the acid control issues other reviewers have so I can't speak for that.  I do, however, feel that this hydrates better and quenches thirst better than plain water after a workout.

review/summary: Tap water for the price of spring water
review/text: On a cost-per-ounce basis, this product is far closer to fancy imported spring waters from tropical islands than it is to any of the other purified tap waters available in their single-use plastic bottles.<br /><br />And that's all it is: purified tap water, with baking soda and a few other things added.<br /><br />Is the pH really 9.5? Who knows. Most of us aren't going to spend the money to buy the equipment to test it. (And that's not even getting into the company's interesting claim that the water is 'too pure' to test with cheap litmus paper. If the water were pure, the pH would be 7. All the fun chemicals they add to change the pH necessarily make it no longer pure.)<br /><br />What i can say is, whatever the pH was, it made no impression on a mild case of heartburn, the kind that can be knocked out with one or two chewable antacid tablets. I didn't feel more hydrated after 1.5 liters of this than i'd feel after 1.5 liters of any other water.<br /><br />The taste? Water. I drink a lot of water, mostly straight tap water, sometimes filtered with a standard filter pitcher, and every once in a while from a pre-packaged bottle of water when i plan badly and my reusable bottle runs dry. Essentia wasn't noticeably different.<br /><br />There are a lot of websites out there that promise all sorts of health benefits for drinking high pH water. There are even some people with an MD after their name that back up the claims. But that's the great thing about the internet: there's a website for everything, and often someone with a fancy degree swearing it's all true.<br /><br />So if you want to pay a pile of money for water that is, at its core, tap water with some stuff filtered out and other stuff added in, that's your business. But if you believe all the marketing hype, well, i've got a bridge for sale...

review/summary: Like Drinking Water With Baking Soday and Epsom Salts In It
review/text: I know I might be a dissenter here, but I really tried to enjoy this water.  It wasn't HORRIBLE, but it wasn't that wonderful either.  I kept tasting the salty flavor associated with baking soda- it is slight but still there-not something that I find refreshing or exciting for sure.  The water itself didn't taste awful, and compared to some bottled water, I thought it was less salty (as in the type associated with table salt).<br /><br />I am very sensitive to changes that happen when I consume things, and I didn't see any great improvement in my feeling or well being after having this water.  For bottled water, it is slightly better than other brands, but in all honesty, I didn't see anything super wonderful about it either.  I drank it in various kinds of weather from super hot to colder and in all types of weather, it just didn't seem to make me very excited.  It was okay.<br /><br />If I had to rely on bottled water, I might purchase this once in a while, but I wouldn't put it at the top of my grocery list.  It just isn't that remarkable to me.  It is definitely superior to chlorinated city water, but I have a decent well for water, and it gives me much more energy than this does.

review/summary: Not for giraffe-rinsing
review/text: ****<br /><br />For several years I have been seriously studying various bottled waters, and after researching this particular one quite thoroughly I have reached a number of conclusions, which I will now reveal for free despite the fact these tests have cost me a lot of time and money over the years.<br /><br />First, it's mostly water.  In fact, it is for all practical purposes all water.<br /><br />According to my high-quality, thoroughly calibrated pH meter, which I reviewed elsewhere, the alkalinity of this particular bottle of water is much closer to 9.3 than 9.5, but that's only 2.105% lower, which I think makes no difference unless you drink dozens of gallons a day and dozens more a night, which if you do might come you down with hyponatremia.<br /><br />This water has a particular taste both in the mouth during drinking and afterwards.  Unlike trying to describe exactly how a wine tastes - "An insouciant trace of dried foxglove petals masked almost but not completely by overarching reminiscences of the mature essences of oak barrels and lightly smoked hedgehog droppings," you know what I mean - trying to describe how the product under review tastes is simpler.<br /><br />Water.<br /><br />It tastes like water.<br /><br />It tastes like water as you're drinking it.<br /><br />After you've finished drinking some and you wait awhile to see whether there's any degree of afterbirth, there isn't.  It's exactly as though you had drunk water.  Which you had.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It freezes at 31.875 degrees Fahrenheit.  It boils at 210.77 degrees, not the 212 you might have expected, because I conducted the testing at 720 feet above MSL, but the point is that the boiling point of pure water at 720 feet up is 210.76 degrees.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It puts out a campfire just as well as tap water, and it puts out a campfire just as well as bottled water that doesn't contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, which is alkaline, which raises the pH level), dipotassium phosphate (derived exclusively from meteorites), magnesium sulfate (found only in certain caves in the Lesser Antilles islands), and calcium chloride (essence of limestone).<br /><br />****<br /><br />Amazon Vine Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12), when bought in that quantity, amounts to 18 liters of water, which is 4.7551 gallons if you merely type "18 liters in gallons " into Google, which weighs 39.701 pounds, which is extremely close to the 39 pounds 11 ounces you would expect from pure water according to Wolfram when you enter "18 liters water in pounds."<br /><br />It works well in a squirt gun, which I still think more people should carry around just in case.<br /><br />At room temperature Essentia works well as a rinse after you've shampooed your hamster or your parakeet, and it works just as well after you've shampooed your giraffe but it takes a lot more, which gets expensive compared to just using tap water through a garden hose, believe you me.  For this I subtract one star.<br /><br />****

review/summary: The Water Myth
review/text: By now, you're among the millions of people drinking bottled water. If you aren't you may be among those, like myself, who filter their own water. It's a well-known fact that most of us don't drink as much water as we should. The reasons vary, but what it comes down to is taste.I like starting out with a certain amount and making sure it's gone by a certain time of day.<br />I like the 1.5 liter bottle because it's sturdy enough to hold and drink from when full and doesn't feel as though it will collapse like some bottles do. I got Essentia from the Amazon Vine program. I began drinking it and thought it was very nice. It tasted like water.<br />I decided a true test would be to compare it against the water I usually drink. Brita filtered water. The difference in taste was startling. I gave my fiance two glasses of water. One we usually drink and Essentia. He couldn't get over the taste and texture difference. I thought all water was smooth, but really, comparatively, this is smoother. Noticeably silky.<br />The difference was remarkable. Our filtered water didn't taste nearly as clean or as smooth as Essentia. I liked it a lot and the infusion of Electrolytes is a plus. I didn't feel a lift, or more energized per se, but while at work, my staying power and focus seemed more enhanced. I really need to rethink my water. As I suspected, they are not all created equal. I highly recommend this to anyone who drinks filtered or bottled water. If you don't believe me, I double dog dare you to compare it to what you are already drinking and let me know what you think.

review/summary: Water is water
review/text: I received one 1.5 liter bottle of this water from the Amazon Vine program and my husband is the one who drank it. He took it to work with him one day and saved it in the fridge to drink on his hour long commute back home in the afternoon. He said it was cool and refreshing like water normally is but that he didn't notice any kind of difference between it and any other bottled water brands he'd tried. He said the size of the 1.5 liter bottle was good in that it was plenty to drink but bad because it wouldn't fit into any of his car's cup holders. He said it would have been a good size to keep at his desk during his work day. But considering the rather high price of this water, I don't think we'll be buying any of it. I know there are a lot of claims made regarding the benefit of this specific brand relating to its pH, but I think all that might just be bogus. I don't know of any reason to choose this brand of bottled water over any other.

review/summary: Results may vary
review/text: So, we had researched the benefits of living a more alkalized lifestyle, and had looked into Alkalized water or water with a high pH level.<br /><br />We thought we'd try this water instead of getting an expensive machine that could raise the pH of your water for you.<br /><br />Hoping that the water would be beneficial to my wife's health with RA, we had her try it for a few days as pretty much the main source of water that she drank.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she started to not feel good. Light-headed, and just not right. So she stopped drinking the water and felt better.<br /><br />We had high hopes for the water. We tested the pH with pH strips, but it doesn't come out right in the results as Essentia states you need a special machine to test the pH when the pH is so high.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there wasn't much information that Essentia could offer about the health benefits of using water with a high pH. So, we were disappointed.<br /><br />We read elsewhere that using a high pH water could be good in the short term, but not necessarily in the long term.<br /><br />So do your research to see if it's what you want, and then go easy on it when starting to use it and monitor how you do as you might not feel great after using it as was the case with my wife.<br /><br />I tested it. Drinking it for a while, but really couldn't tell any difference in energy levels or overall well being, so your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Smooth taste and texture a nice change of pace from harder waters
review/text: Similar to the caveat I placed at the start of my recent Amazon Vine review of some running shoes, let me state that I'm not an expert on the health benefits of various types of bottled water.  I'm just going to tell you whether I liked the taste of this product and communicate any other layman's benefits that occur to me.  Fair enough?<br /><br />Anyway, I did like the taste of this Essentia water, though it's quite different from the crisper, more minerally (if that's a word) brands of bottled water I usually buy.  This water is very soft (or silky, as the description on the bottle says), giving me a smoother, creamier thirst-quenching experience than the harder, splashier sensation I am used to when tossing back some bottled water.  But variety is the spice of life, right?<br /><br />The big, 1.5 liter bottles are convenient, not so huge that they're hard to store in the fridge or on the counter (I put a few bottles in each location, so I'd have both cold and room-temperature water always available), but large enough that you don't constantly have to pop open a new bottle to get a little water.<br /><br />I still prefer water that, for whatever reason (a different pH level, higher mineral content, blah, blah, blah), tastes harder and crisper, but I'd get this water from time to time to taste something different.  If you're into softer, silkier water on a more regular basis, though, this Essentia water will probably be a particularly big hit with you.<br /><br />Like I said at the outset, however, I don't have much to say about the health benefits of this Essentia product.  Perhaps you can combine my mainly taste-oriented review with another review or two that credibly addresses your health questions, and you'll get a good sense about whether this water is for you.  Good luck!

review/summary: Smooth and Delicious -- Some People Drink Alkaline Water for Health Benefits
review/text: This water is very smooth and delicious to drink. It goes down easy, is refreshing, and doesn't make me feel bloated.<br /><br />I had never heard of water boasting a pH of 9.5, and had never heard of "ionized water", and I was unsure of the role of the claim about electrolytes. The package states "doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health". So, I did some research and found articles online (not connected to this product because I wanted other sources). They discussed health benefits of drinking alkaline water in order to change the level of acidity in one's body and claimed reducing the body's acidic state to be good for one's state of health in various ways which I will not list here (you can easily find lists online if you want to know them). It is said that alkaline water does not make one feel bloated as regular water can. Some companies who discuss these health benefits are selling ionizing machines for the home in order to make tap water more alkaline. They also usually recommend purifying tap water in one's home (for multiple reasons) so the units also purify the tap water.<br /><br />I am not in a position as a non-scientist to prove or disprove these health claims. I'm not a doctor and can't give medical advice. I'm just sharing what I've learned and how this water tastes to me.<br /><br />So to compare the options for people who want water with a higher pH, this ESSENTIA water is a bottled water product that one can buy that's ready to drink instead of buying a home ionizing machine. And of course, this is portable and more convenient compared to making one's own ionized water at home and putting into a reusable drinking container to take with you on the go.<br /><br />As to the price of ESSENTIA bottled water it is more than double the cost of bottled spring water but the two products are totally different so they are apples and oranges and really should not be compared. It is not unlike comparing a glass of regular chocolate milk to a bottle of Ensure (tm), they are two different things and one product makes a health claim and serves as a meal replacement while the other is just a common drink for enjoyment.<br /><br />I did a price check online for in-home water ionizer machines and the least expensive was $900 and the top price was $2200. So if you desire to drink ionized water that's alkaline you have two choices now. It used to be that buying the machine was your only option to access this product. At least now if you want to try ionized water (for whatever reason) you can buy it premade rather than jumping in to spend a thousand or two dollars on an in-home unit.<br /><br />Some facts:<br /><br />The water is not spring water, it is labeled as "purified water infused with electrolytes for a difference you can taste".<br /><br />This water is labeled to have the ingredients: purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride.<br /><br />If you are a person seeking a convenient prepared way to drink water that has been altered to be alkaline to a pH of 9.5 with electrolytes added (for whatever benefit you feel it gives you) then this is the product for you.

review/summary: Tastes just like water....(nope, not a joke)
review/text: Very interesting product to say the least.  Quite frankly I found this no different than any other water I have been drinking throughout my life, so if anybody is wondering how it tastes like, I hope this helps!  Whether or not different PH helps or hurts you, I cannot answer that as I am not a doctor nor do I play one in real life, but it was very good and very drinkable.  However since I do not know whether this actually helps me somehow, to me it is just a bottle of slightly-overpriced water.

review/summary: Funky tasting water
review/text: After a hard and intense set of interval training, a refreshing and replenishing drink is often key to recovery.  The concept of this water seemed sound unlike the sugary drinks that are typical advertised with artificial neon colors and poured over coaches at the end of a winning game.<br /><br />Personally, I'm a big fan of coconut water after hard training, so I have a bit of bias.  The most notable problem I had with this drink is it didn't taste like water should.  The water tasted "metallic" which sort of makes sense at a 9.5 pH.  I could barely drink it down as it didn't taste right to me, but I did.  I noticed no benefit after drinking it and felt I had more cramps and shakes than after drinking other replenishing beverages.<br /><br />I see no benefit to this product and it simply doesn't taste right to me.

review/summary: thin plastic, surprisingly distinguishable taste
review/text: Since this is promoted as a healthy product, it receives 1 less star for the use of a very thin plastic. Thinner than what you find in regular soda/pop bottles. Since this is a health product, and plastic (especially thin one) is said to slowly leech into the water, it seems strange they did not opt for something more substantial/higher quality, given the price.<br /><br />Another star due to the price, which would be hard to justify.<br /><br />There is lots of research that points to good health depending on your body's Ph and this is how this water differentiates itself from others.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me, is that I could tell the difference between this water and the one that comes filtered out of the fridge. It reacted/tasted differently s soon is it hit my mouth. Granted it's not a huge difference, but I am not a water conossieur and I could tell. (Had someone else poor 2 cups and bring them to me)<br /><br />I'd probably give it 3.5 stars.

review/summary: It's Just Water
review/text: Yes, I am reviewing water.  I know, life does not get much sillier than that, but I was curious as to the claims that I have been hearing about Kangan water and now what is being offered bottled by a different company.<br /><br />In our community, there is a woman that is toting the benefits of antioxidizing, alkalizing, detoxifying and hydrating by using a machine that changes neutral tap water to alkalized 9.0 water.  All right, I will admit that I took the sample bait.  I did not feel a difference.  When the bottled version became available, I thought why not, what does this product have to offer.<br /><br />It tastes like water.  No cleaner or fresher than what comes out of the tap.<br /><br />Going back to the $4,000 machine version, the sales person said that water will return to its neutral state within 48 hours and you can test it yourself with simple testing sheets, so that is why you need to own a machine.  Curious selling point.<br /><br />Essentia's own webpage states that you will need a specialized instrument and that water as pure as their product will not test accurately with pH test strips.  Wonder why that is?<br /><br />Yes, I am skeptical, but I continue.<br /><br />I drink their product for a couple of days.  Still feel no additional benefit, but become interest in the Electrolyte infusion.  Is this like Gatorade?  One of my children is a hockey player.  Let us see how this water works under the pressure of an extreme workout.  Result "Mom, it is just water, there is nothing different".<br />OK, so my nonscientific experiment concluded with "it's just water".

review/text: My wife and I both agreed that the water has an artificial taste to it (which is not bad) and an aftertaste (which is bad).  The pros of this water are the electrolytes and the ph, but it tastes like a reconstituted water.  The info on the bottle doesn't help. Terms like "purified by reverse osmosis" and "restructured using Ionic Separation Technology" are not consumer friendly terms and reflect a marketing campaign that would only appeal to a scientific mind.  I just poured the rest of the bottle out.

review/summary: Clear, Cool, Water?
review/text: When I was growing up, we would visit my grandparents in the summer. They had a place in town, but also had a cabin up in the mountains that we'd stay at on occasion. At this cabin there was a lovely old spring house which my grandfather had built in his youth from stones found around the property. The spring house was built right into the side of the mountain where a natural, pure spring flowed all year round. The spring house had a large, thick wooden door with a huge iron latch which opened with an old key. The door would open and you would need to step down onto a concrete step which was in front of an even lower concrete pool, filled with water. On the opposite wall was a large, wooden cork attached to the stone wall with a chain. This stopped up the spring, but if the pool got low, you could remove the cork and clear water would rush out and fill it up again. There was a pail and a dipper, both were the old-fashioned speckled blue enamel. Occasionally, you would see a salamander or a spider there, but the spring house was one of my favorite places to be in the summer, dark and cool. And the water was extremely pure, very cold and very sweet. The only taste it had was a slight mineral taste. I'd give someone a hundred dollars right now just to have a gallon of that water again.<br /><br />This product shares none of these qualities and had a slight plastic aftertaste for me. Basic, bottled water here, folks.

review/summary: Mag sulfate in it
review/text: I drank a 1.5 liter bottle.  I was thirsty.  Before I did, I let my son and hubby tried it.  Hubby liked it, son said YUCK.  I think it's good.  It tastes ok, goes down really smooth.  I happened to read the bottle as I was finishing it off and noticed it had magnesium sulfate in it.  It's no doubt trace amounts but I thought, Oh no, I just drank a laxative.  I think I gave myself the placebo effect.  Surely that's all it was...I worked as a nurse for years and I see mag sulfate, I THINK clean em out.  So I think I jinxed myself.<br />I do have acid reflux.  It did not help.  At all.<br />I actually just prefer my filtered city water.  Regular water has a harder edge but I guess I'm used to it and I like it.<br />But it's ok water.  It is silky and smooth.  Might be a real winner for runners and those who work outside or in hot environments where you sweat a lot since it replaces electrolytes.  Also might work for people trying to increase their water intake that don't much care for water.<br />I'd try it if you need a no calorie electrolyte replacement - you'll either like it or you won't.  I'm not sure how to TELL without trying it, it taste like water but it has a different 'texture' almost..a bit.  It's weird like that.

review/summary: It's reverse osmosis filtered municipal water with baking soda added - tastes fine but nothing special
review/text: I travel a lot and tend to often buy bottled water as I go through airports and gas stations.  I've had enough different types that I know what flavors I like and what flavors I don't like.  I like spring waters like Fiji and purified municipal water like Dasani, so I am not that particular.  Water that has gone through reverse osmosis is about the purest water you can get, but many do not like the flavor because the same purification process that removes chemicals also removes minerals that give water its flavor.  Reverse osmosis water is often said to taste "flat", and some health gurus even claim it robs the bones of calcium, although these claims are dubious at best.<br /><br />Enter Essentia bottled water.  It claims that after the reverse osmosis, they add back in electrolytes to improve the flavor (listed on label, minerals like calcium carbonate).  In fact, it tastes like reverse osmosis water with some electrolytes added - still not as full and refreshing as spring water that is merely filtered, but definitely better than plain reverse osmosis water.  Afterwards, they add baking soda to raise the pH to 9.5, purpotedly because there are health benefits to drinking water with a high pH.  These claims have not been evaluated by the FDA, and the Mayo clinic website says there are no conclusive studies.<br /><br />Honestly, the flavor did not sit well with me or my wife, and the science backing up the amazing health claims is dubious at best.  It's not terrible, but nothing that special either.  I'm rating it 3 stars because while it is fine water, the taste just wasn't for me.  You can make up your own mind - if you want high pH water, then this would be a fine choice.  But if you just want fresh tasting water, there are less expensive and better tasting options in my opinion.

review/text: Given the claims of the manufacturer I was expecting this to be a really good tasting bottled water. In reality, not so much - it tastes rather flat with a hint of a chalky aftertaste (which I'm assuming is due to the baking soda that is added, as listed in the ingredient list on the bottle). Not horrible, but not great either.<br /><br />I think the price is outrageous for bottled water, but I didn't factor that into my rating - it gets three stars strictly on the basis of how it tastes, which is not nearly as good as the tap water that I filter at home.

Sometimes unfiltered tap water, filtered tap water, reverse-osmosis tap water, well water and of course, BOTH still and sparkling bottled water to avoid stomach upset in under-developed parts of the world.<br /><br />All that being said, I cannot taste ANYTHING better or worse or feel physically better or worse after drinking this bottle of Essentia.  I'm having difficulty validating IF I'm receiving it's advertised benefits after drinking only ONE bottle. I suspect more are necessary.<br /><br />However, it's likeable because it has... no calories, no sugar, no artificial sweeteners, no BPA in the plastic bottle.  BUT it's made from local tap waters! I'd purchase this for my  emergency water stash; a necessity during tornado season when water availability is touch-n-go. Otherwise, I'll continue drinking the filtered tap water at home and filling my non-BPA stainless steel water bottles daily like I usually do.  It's unlikely this product will replace my homemade sports drink, but it's nice to know there's an alternative.

review/summary: My 9.5 pH Sport Drink Alternative...
review/text: I'm no stranger to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HG9ET0">Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water</a>. As an MTB cyclist, my beverage of choice for years had been the good, old fashioned Gatorade, the lime green stuff in the sports bottle that fit in my water bottle cages: one for Gatorade and one for water.<br /><br />At one point a couple of years ago, Gatorade changed, and it seemingly wasn't as effective. A fellow MTB cyclist gave me a bottle of her Essentia, the taste was fine (it tastes like... water), and being a nurse and nutritionist, she told me calmly and rationally of some of the benefits of 9.5 pH drinking water and why I might be 'crashing' from some of the Gatorade. I shrugged it off, but bought a few bottles.<br /><br />Putting it simply, as far as hydration goes, this stuff works. Water works as well, but I found that the Essentia had a comfortable "Gatorade effect" when it came to feeling refreshed and replenished when cycling on hot summer days. I'm no chemist or nutritionist, but I do know from first hand experience that it seems to be absorbed into the body faster and easier, which is a good thing when one is perspiring from strenuous exercise. They have changed their bottles, and the new ones are PET plastic (look for the #1 code on the bottom). These are BPA-free, and are considered to be the safest/most recyclable plastic used in the beverage industry. But above all, it's refreshing as it should be.<br /><br />For convenience when out cycling, I sometimes indulge and pick up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HG9ERW">Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 20-Ounce</a> as it has the convenient sports bottle top, but it's more cost effective to get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HG9ET0">Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12)</a> and refill your own sports bottle from these. It's not inexpensive, but it does sit in the middle of the pack as far as other 9.5pH alkaline water products cost. And there is one of those Subscribe & Save deals here if you want some additional savings. It is cheaper than most highly publicized sports drinks, but still it make you wonder if you do the math.<br /><br />If you do any strenuous exercise, especially during the summer heat, you might want to check into Essentia and see if it works for you. It can easily be recommended to most with an active lifestyle, and has worked for me. Your results may vary, but try a few bottles as a sport drink alternative and see for yourself.<br /><br />8/20/2012

review/summary: Well, it doesn't work miracles
review/text: The product description for this bottled water makes various health claims: in addition to hydrating better than regular water, Essentia is supposed to boost the immune system, help maintain restful sleep and heart health, and so on. There are two justifications for these benefits: the increases electrolytes and the pH of 9.5.<br /><br />These health claims are the sort of thing that really need to be evaluated by scientific trials, not by individual experiences. But a bit of quick googling about "alkaline water health benefits" shows that the scientific literature is pretty thin. There seems to have been one study saying that alkaline water increases bone density, which is a good thing for people worrying about osteoporosis, and another study saying that it improved hydration. Meanwhile, various anecdotal sources say that it can reduce acid reflux, which seems particularly plausible just from a priori reasoning: if you're having problems with acid, you might be able to neutralize it by adding a base.<br /><br />I don't personally suffer from acid reflux, so I can't assess its effectiveness there, but if it's a problem that you do have, then it might be worth giving this water a try since you'll be able to see very quickly whether it works for you. The potential benefits against osteoporosis, on the other hand, are longer-term, so without seeing further scientific studies I wouldn't personally want to embark on a program of drinking expensive bottled water indefinitely, since it would be harder to judge whether it was actually working. The interest for me, then, was mainly in the improved hydration.<br /><br />I'm a casual runner, and I hate to carry water with me, so it's not uncommon for me to end up with a slight dehydration headache even after consuming water when I get home. That happened once this week already, when I went for a 5-mile run just after noon.<br /><br />I drank my 1.5 L sample of Essentia over two days (along with other fluids, of course). On the first day, I didn't run at all, but walked about four miles. On the second day, I went for two short runs, 1.8 miles each way to the bookstore and back in the middle of the afternoon. It was sunny out, so I felt pretty sweaty by the end of it. I drank Essentia before and after the run, though there wasn't much left by the end, and so I also drank about 750 mL of regular water as well.<br /><br />I didn't end up with a dehydration headache, and I also slept well that night, but there are too many other variables at play for me to attribute these good things purely to the Essentia. Maybe the difference from my previous run was the much shorter length, or the time of day, or just the overall quantity of water that I consumed afterwards, regardless of whether it was Essentia. While I'm intrigued with Essentia's claims, I'm not entirely convinced. I'd be willing to try drinking Essentia over a longer period of time if it were provided to me for free, but for the moment, the benefits aren't clear enough to me that I'm willing to purchase it in quantity for myself at more than $2/bottle. I'll await further studies.<br /><br />The one thing I can comment on with confidence is the taste, which seemed pretty average to me. There is something slightly different about it, but I find it hard to describe: it almost seemed reminiscent of carbonated water, except it's not carbonated at all. Anyway, the taste was fine, but I didn't find it unusually good; it was pretty clearly purified tap water (like Dasani), rather than spring water. The taste was better than Dasani, but not something that I'd pay extra for; I'm generally happy enough with the taste of tap water.<br /><br />So with an average taste and health benefits that could use some more research, this isn't something that I'm going to buy any time soon. Still, people with different health needs (particularly acid reflux) may find it helpful to them, and it will be interesting to see whether further research turns up any more relevant evidence.

review/text: i must admit that the best I can describe this water is "heavy water" as it has a bit of a "heavy" taste (perhaps due to a high pH) compared to other water.  I cannot notice any differences of it helping me.  It is a nice taste though.  Difficult to describe.<br /><br />There is no caffeine so it won't wake you up or keep you up.<br /><br />The bottle states it is "doctor recommended" and it goes into no further details about the doctor (specialist, retired doctor, what country the doctor is in, etc.).  Or why he/she recommends it.<br /><br />It is a high bottle, and most likely you will need to  keep it on the door as it's too high for most shelves.  But it's a good size bottle so that if you are thirsty, you won't need to refill.<br /><br />I'm taking one star away from it as there is little details about the water other than it basically stating "a doctor recommends you drink this 9.5 pH  water."  No web link or telephone number for details.<br /><br />But as I said, the water does have a "heavy taste" (to me) and I found it to be a good taste.

I have hydration problems for when a water hits room temperature the taste makes me know longer wish too drink it. With Essentia this was not the case. Regardless of water temperature the water was refreshing, hydrating and tasted good too me. I love this water. This is a water I not only would drink but want too drink. Finally something that quenches my thirst and hydrates me. A winner!

review/summary: Healthy Water!
review/text: It looks like water. It smells like water. It tastes like water. Yet, it's better than most water available. Essentia purifies its water through reverse osmosis, infuses it with electrolytes, and alkalinizes it using Ionic Separation Technology to give it a pH of 9.5.<br /><br />Essentia claims that the water provides unmatched hydration, that it boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system, and promotes better health.<br /><br />While I cannot speak to the health issues, I can say that Essentia has an excellent taste and kept me well hydrated during a recent tortuous hot-spell. The large 1.5 liter bottle isn't the most portable, but it does provide your water needs for the day.<br /><br />The water's ingredients include: purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride to provide essential minerals. Think of it as Gatorade without the coloring and flavoring.

review/summary: Light, refreshing water!
review/text: Essentia is purified water with a 9.5pH. What makes this water different from others on the market are the electrolytes. I conducted a taste test with my teenage boys to compare regular bottled water with Essentia. They loved the light, fresh taste of the Essentia water. They thought it tasted clean and refreshing. Compared to regular bottled water, this water is much smoother. It is purified by reverse osmosis which is a filtration method that removes large molecules and ions from solutions. The boys also liked the size of the bottle. Overall, they preferred the Essentia water. I would definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Seems like normal water to me...
review/text: Since it's the worst part of the summer in Texas, it was hard for me to say no to "free" water from the Amazon Vine program. With daily average temperatures of 105 plus (and no end in sight until September), I am always dying to keep hydrated and it just seems like I never have enough water (and I get sick of buying it so often). So, I thought this was worth a try, despite the seemingly bloated health boasts on the label.<br /><br />First, this tastes like normal filtered water -nothing special. Then, there's the health claims -since I only had one bottle of this and I didn't have the opportunity to see if it makes a difference over time. But let me put it this way: in the harsh Texas heat, this water didn't seem to make a difference at all when it came to hydration, health or anything else. Maybe it's just the heat, but I seemed to have the same benefits as drinking regular (and not-so-expensive) water from the store brand. Perhaps, if I used this over a period of time I would be able to see a difference, but since Vine only sent one bottle it's a little difficult to tell.<br /><br />Verdict: this is an over-priced item that promises more health benefits than it actually delivers. Not worth the price and not the time.

review/summary: Hooray for Hydration
review/text: I compared the Essentia 9.5 pH water with the water that came filtered out of my refrigerator.  There's hardly any noticeable difference to me aside from a slight smoother texture (almost creamy, but don't get the wrong idea...it just rolls smoothly on the tongue) from the Essentia water.  Also it has a slight mineral finish at the end, but I didn't notice it at all until after I compared with the regular filtered tap water.<br /><br />I like that it comes in a 1.5L size because I try to drink about 3L of water daily and it makes it easier for me to drink the desired amount when I have a larger bottle.  If the price is right, I recommend Essentia 9.5 pH water if you're not picky about drinking purified water (which it is by reverse osmosis) versus spring water.

review/text: I have been drinking Essentia for about a month now and really feel it makes a difference in my hydration.  I can tell that more now that I ran out and had to supplement my Amazon purchase with running to the store.  I know a couple of reviewers have said it doesn't seem to taste different but I would beg to differ.  I use a Brita filter on both my faucet and through a pitcher and can tell the Essentia water has a smoother texture "feel" than the filtered water.  I am a big fan and while I won't always shell out for bottled water, it certainly is the brand I will choose.

review/summary: Water that's healthier than regular water? Maybe so.
review/text: A friend of mine who is following an alkaline diet recommended Essentia water because of the higher pH level, so I gave it a try. My usual water selection is either filtered water with Brita system or store-brand bottled water (mostly Perrier). I compared the taste of Essentia water with my usual waters and found Essentia to be somewhat silky, but nothing really outstanding. I like the fact, however, that it provides some health benefit by alkalizing the body's pH balance.<br /><br />For those who don't know, alkaline diets emphasize eating fruits and vegetables, along with proper hydration, and are purported to lead to lower rates of cancer and disease. There is also some evidence that it lowers the risk for kidney stones and might slow bone loss and muscle degeneration, increase growth hormones, and even ease low back pain.<br /><br />I researched what is the pH for other popular water and found a test result from a website. I don't know if the small difference in numbers makes big difference in one's body, but since I drink almost a liter of water every day, hopefully there is:<br /><br />Brand: Source or Feature: pH<br />Essentia: Micro-clustered Water: 8.57<br />Aqua Hydrate: Utah purified water with minerals added: 7.96<br />Evian, France: Spring water: 7.53<br />Dasani: Purified tap water: 7.2<br />Volvic: Natural volcanic mineral water: 7.07<br />Arrowhead Spring water: USA Spring Water: 6.83<br />Penta Water: Micro-ionized: 6.7<br />Fiji Water, Fiji: Spring water: 6.65<br />Deer Park, Maryland: Spring Water: 6.31<br />Perrier Water: Processed water with minerals France: 5.28<br /><br />As for Brita pH balance, I found that Brita purposely decreases water hardness to improve the taste of drinking water. As a result, the pH value of Brita filtered water tends to be in the slightly acid range.<br /><br />With the benefit of Essentia water, its reasonable price and convenience, I will most probably switch Brita system to Essentia water.

review/summary: Ionic Separation to Improve the Taste of Your Water
review/text: Essentia uses a proprietary ionic separation process that removes acidic ions from the water. The result, presumably, is thinner, sweeter water. I can vouch for the thinner part. Comparing Essentia to my filtered water (using a Brita through the tap), I can tell the "texture" is thinner. But I don't taste any "sweetness." The taste is definitely different than my filtered tap water, not necessarily better.<br /><br />The removal of acidic ions and the fact that Essentia is non-source dependent evidences its strong ionic separation process.<br /><br />If you like a thinner water without the possible bitter, acid taste, you should try Essentia.

review/text: This bottled water tastes pretty much just like tap water to me. It has no funny or bitter taste to it. My husband, though, didn't like it at all. He thought it had a chemical taste to it. It is made of purified water to which calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate; magnesium sulphate; and sodium bicarbonate are added. I have a hard time believing all the health claims listed in the product description:<br /><br />"Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance. It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more."<br /><br />It sounds like hype to me. If they can prove all this then I may consider purchasing this water in the future, but for now, I will pass.<br /><br />By the way, I did check out the company's website and they just list general claims of why good hydration is important and what electrolytes do. I could not find anywhere on their website where they site any studies to substantiate any health claims.  I'd like to see some 3rd party, unbiased, scientific studies on the matter.

review/summary: Another fancy bottled water...oh boy.
review/text: Like many others who reviewed this bottled water by Essentia, I was only able to try one bottle, which lasted me a day. As a result, I can't tell you that it's had a positive impact on my health in any way. To do this, you'd have to drink it for a couple of months and really pay attention to how things are going. What I -can- tell you is that this water tastes good, be it at room temperature or refrigerated. The bottle it comes in is much bigger than the standard bottled water found in stores. There's no aftertaste either.<br /><br />Something worth noting is the lack of information explaining WHY drinking this water is beneficial to your health. There's a quick mention on the bottle about how a doctor recommends you drink it, yet there's no explanation as to who this doctor is or what kind of doctor they are. Not even a site or phone number for more info? Man, you can put whatever you want on labels these days!<br /><br />It's good, but I don't see myself buying a pack of this ever since I'm fine with my filter and regular sized bottled waters. I can't say that this tastes any better or worse than any water I've had in recent memory.

review/summary: Pure-Tasting Water, But Health Claims Are Not Proved
review/text: Essentia is purified water, with electrolytes added "for a difference you can taste".  For me, the water is basically tasteless, and I actually prefer the taste of natural spring water (for example, Crystal Geyser or Calistoga).  However, the water tastes very clean, and anyone who is very particular about what he/she ingests will probably love this water.<br /><br />Essentia's selling point is its 9.5 pH.  According to my online research, ordinary tap water is more acidic, with an average 7 pH.  The Mayo Clinic reports that proponents of alkaline water claim it can neutralize acid in the bloodstream, boost energy and metabolism, improve absorption of nutrients, slow the aging process, slow bone loss, and help with disease resistance.  However, the Mayo Clinic also states that these claims have not been verified by researchers.  Debunkers of alkaline water health claims point out that Kansas City tap water has 11 to 12 pH, and that KC residents are no healthier than people in the rest of the U.S.<br /><br />Essentia is purified by reverse osmosis.  Wikipedia explains that reverse osmosis is a filtration method that removes large molecules and ions from solutions by applying pressure to force a solution through a membrane.<br /><br />I rate Essentia water at 4 stars, because it tastes very pure.  However, it is up to the individual to decide whether the water is worth the price, especially as compared to bottled spring water, or to ordinary tap water that is filtered with an attachment (for example, the very good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006WNMI">Culligan Faucet Filter</a>) or a pitcher equipped with a charcoal filter (for example, the excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041LF3HE">3M Filtrete Water Pitcher</a>).

review/summary: High pH Purified Water
review/text: This is probably one of the best bottled waters you can purchase.<br /><br />I have my own alkaline ionizing water purifier so for years I've consumed high pH purified water directly from my own tap.  I think having your own purifier is a superior approach, in the long run it is a lot cheaper and more convenient than purchasing bottled water.<br /><br />It takes a bit to get used to the flavor of Essentia water but it isn't bad.<br /><br />As to the health merits of high pH water, I have discussed this with other health experts. Overall my conclusion is that it is very healthy when consumed alone throughout the day.  However if you have low stomach acid production (which is common as we get older) then it may not be wise to drink a lot of high pH water when eating a meal.

review/summary: This nutrition-nut/water  connoisseur agrees that Essentia Water delivers unmatched hydration, health and taste
review/text: I love this water!  I was offered it on Amazon Vine program but have already received 4 more subscribe-and-save cases!<br /><br />It is always good to know a little about the reviewer and so I should say most people would consider me a nutrition nut and a water connoisseur.  I have spent thousands of dollars on equipment to improve my whole-house water, shower water, tap water, and drinking water.  I do not drink soda more than twice a YEAR and coffee not more than once a DECADE!  I drink water as my beverage of choice and have tried every water carried by my healthfood stores.  Other than my personally treated tap water, I have preferred a couple brands of spring water bottled in glass.  I was happy to see that Essentia is in BPA and Phthalate free recyclable bottles.<br /><br />My diet is the best money can buy and I naturally maintain an 85% alkaline-forming diet with my food selection.  When I agreed to receive this Essentia water on the Vine program, my plans were to drink a couple of bottles to review and save the remainder for emergency situations such as what happened only months ago in San Diego when our county lost electricity and the water became questionable to drink with the water treatment plant not operating without electricity.  However, after my first bottle of water, I desire no other drinking water, and have subscribed to 4 cases which I have already received from Amazon.  BTW, they arrived each in their own box each weighing a little over 30 pounds.<br /><br />Why did I switch to Essentia?  Just like the manufacturer says "Try it for the taste.  Buy it for the benefits", it tastes great!  My diet/water choice criteria is not what tastes best with some health-benefit but rather what is most health beneficial that also isn't unpleasant to drink/eat.  Although my diet/water has been optimum for most of my life, I am going through hormonal changes because I am "of that age" uh-um.  I started having severe hot flashes that wake me up at night and cause me to strip down naked and cold shower during the day.  I tried all the remedies known that are helpful without side effects.  No relief for me!  I was surprised beyond description when the Essentia water resolved my hot flashes!  It feels very cooling and soothing going down and as long as I keep that cool smooth feeling inside, I have merely mild flashes and those only occasionally. I am so thankful to Essentia!  Drinking the water I had on hand that I thought was optimal had not helped the hot flashes at all even when treated to supposedly be alkaline.  So I do not know exactly what it is about Essentia that is working for me as I have not scientifically experimented with it to see if it is one of the ingredients or what.<br /><br />Thank you Essentia for resolving my hot flashes which were really wearing me out!<br /><br />Although Essentia water is a little more expensive to buy it on Amazon, I decided to purchase here.  My local Whole Foods offers 20% off cases and my local Jimbo's offers 10% off cases and I have not asked Henry's, Sprouts, or other grocers what their discounts are; so it would actually be a little cheaper for me to buy it locally but then I have to carry it to the car and from the car to my home and it is much nicer for me to pay a little extra and have it delivered by UPS so I do not have to move the bottles by the 30pound case but only by a bottle or two at a time.  Also, Essentia gives healthcare professionals, such as myself, 30% off but require a 10 case minimum purchase and I do not want to store 10 cases at a time as in California as space is at a premium and in high demand.  4 cases is optimal for me and I am willing to pay a little extra to not have to carry it myself.<br /><br />Thank you Essentia and Amazon!  You make my life better!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Sprouts sells this for $1.89 for each 1.5liter with 10% discount for a case - no sales tax.  If you don't have great spring water locally (google findaspring), I prefer this bottled water to everything else at Sprouts and most local grocers.

review/text: Let me tell you, I have drunk A LOT of water in my lifetime. I'm 41 years old, so you figure that's what? 3 glasses a day times 365 days times 41 years? That's almost a craptillion gallons of water. When I tasted Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water (1.5 Liter) my immediate thought was, "Wow! This tastes just like water!" I tested it against several other brands as well as tap water and water right from the hose. After several very carefully controlled taste comparisons, I'm prepared to conclude that Essentia 9.5pH Drinking Water (1.5 Liter) tastes *exactly* like water. The bottle is also made of plastic, which is awesome because you can hold on to it while drinking the water inside. The lid screws on and off. I would highly recommend this water to anyone who loves water. You could totally replace your current favorite water with this, and you would never know the difference. That's because Essentia knows what they're doing when it comes to bottling water. They bottle it, and they bottle it good. Definitely a must taste for any carbon-based life form that requires a regular supply of H20 to survive on this hostile planet. Get some today. Or turn on your faucet. Either way.

On this water, however, we managed to agree quite well.  For the price, it should contain some secret elixir.  The big additive....basically a bit of baking soda.  Baking soda does work for settling stomach upsets, but you could save a ton of money mixing some into a bottle of spring water or glass of tap water yourself.  I'm not sure of the advantage of 9.5 pH, I do wonder if that is just another marketing concept.  I'm going to stick to my bottled spring water, it has no after taste and is much more reasonably priced.

review/summary: my tap water is 8.6 pH already anyway...
review/text: I tried this water and it tasted just "normal" to me. Not silky or special or anything.<br /><br />I gave my cats two bowls of water, each with 16 oz of water, one the Essentia and one of just tap water. I saw them drink out of both bowls and water disappeared from both bowls at the same rate.<br /><br />I looked up the pH of my local tap water and it tests between 6.7 and 9.7 pH with an average of 8.6, not so different from this bottle of water but a heck of a lot cheaper.<br /><br />It really seems to me like somewhere around the early 1990s we were all duped into buying bottled water. Some water isn't safe to drink and so it's good that we can get bottled water at times, but it somehow became a status symbol and then a necessity. Now people are either realizing maybe it's dumb to buy bottled water when the bottled water industry isn't even as well regulated as tap water, or moving on to other beverages as "plain" water is starting to seem a little boring, so what do the people who sell water do to sell more product? They make it fancier, with caffeine or gathered in glacial melt and harvested from the deep sea, or, it seems, with a high pH.<br /><br />There are all kinds of health claims made about high pH water, but as far as I know there aren't any reputable, scientific studies that back up any of the claims. If there were, I'm sure Essentia would be shouting those claims from the rooftops to sell their product.<br /><br />If you really believe you need water with a pH of 9.5, maybe research what the tap water in your area already is, and if it's not high enough for you there are many options for water ionizers you can purchase in all price ranges.

review/summary: The Best Bottled Water out there
review/text: My kids asked "How can you review bottled water?" While most people think bottled water is a silly I will drink no water but bottled water. I even use bottled water for making tea or flavored drinks and even ice cubes. I have very sensitive tastes and could never stand tap water even as a child. The really funny thing is that when I was a kid in the mid eighties I would freeze and then boil water and put it glass bottles and I loved it. Weird huh? Well bottled water is now a multi-billion dollar industry. My favorites were Aqua-fina and Smart water.<br /><br />This Essentia water is the best of both of my other favorites, it is filtered using reverse osmosis which truly gives the purest taste of any type of filtering process and it also infused with electrolytes for real hydration much like Gatorade is with out the added sugar and artificial colors. It is also alkaline instead of acidic which is suppose to be very healthy for the body and decrease internal environment for disease.<br /><br />It is very fresh and pure tasting, no plastic after taste and no weird spring water taste or heavy mineral taste. This is my new favorite bottled water.

review/summary: Water Water Everywhere...
review/text: After drinking an entire case, I have to say that I am a bit disappointed by the lack of results.  Normally I drink home brewed organic unsweetened mint iced tea & home brewed organic kombucha rather than plain water.  I did not drink mint tea nor kombucha while I was consuming this case of water.  A bit of a change for me, but I stuck with it & now I have my results.<br /><br />I do not feel that this water "enhanced the quality of my health" I quickly became tired of drinking it & noticed I was drinking less & less each day.  I cannot agree nor disagree that it hydrates me better than my normal beverages of choice because I felt no different than any other day.  I know that my normal beverages of choice are beneficial in many ways, one of them being to my digestive system. I'm not too sure if this water can make that claim.<br />If I have a choice in water, I normally select mineral water bottled in a glass bottle.  I also make sure that the mineral water lists the mineral content.  I feel that packaging Essentia in plastic is counter productive.  I do my best to avoid plastics in all shapes & forms.  I understand it is costly to ship glass but using plastic costs a lot in a much worse way.<br />Last, Essentia water most likely is treated municipal water (by treated I am referring to their treatment method, not the various municipalities methods). Essentia makes no claims that the water is "Spring" or "Mountain" water etc.  It is purified water with their proprietary technology as per the bottle.<br /><br />On the plus side: Overall for the amount of water you get, the price seems pretty reasonable.  It is cheaper than what I pay for a bottle of mineral water ounce for ounce.  The large size means there is plenty of water to tote around without worry that you will not have enough.  It does not taste bad.  It doesn't taste extraordinary. It tastes fine.  I have had bottled water that was disgusting.<br /><br />A 3 star rating by Amazon standards means "It's OK"  So while I don't hate it, I don't love it either. As for the health claims, well I don't believe them.  Obviously you want to drink clean water & be hydrated since being dehydrated is unhealthy.  So for arguments sake I suppose if having this water causes you to drink more water when you normally were not consuming the amount of liquids your body requires & now you are consuming the amount of liquids it requires, you will in fact feel a lot better!  Then said health claim is true! Phew!<br /><br />Be good to your body & you will feel good.

review/summary: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water
review/text: I usually only drink spring water and even then I have my favorite brand. I was surprised that this water was really pretty good, especially in coffee; the fact that it has extra electrolytes is icing on the cake. I do think it's a little too expensive. I'm use to paying about $1 a gallon, or so, for these large bottles.

review/summary: Great Tasting Water In Health Conscious Bottles Plus More!
review/text: I really love this water. First, I am so glad that it's in a BPA free bottle as I do worry about the effect of drinking water from regular plastic bottles every day. Second, I do find the taste to be very smooth and pleasant. Its tough for me to get in enough water when I'm at work, even with an Arrowhead dispenser in my own office. But for some reason I am enjoying the Essentia and not hesitating to drink it. I guess it just tastes better to me. Third, I also like the size and it helps me set and maintain a goal for how much water to drink. This is about 50 ounces, or just over 6 cups, and I have been bringing one to work every day and finishing it by the time I leave the office. Fourth, I do feel more hydrated and better. I'm not sure if it's the special qualities of the water (high PH and electrolytes)  or if it's just because I am actually getting in enough water every day but its a good result either way! My husband has been drinking it too and similarly seems to easily polish off a whole bottle over the course of a few hours. Even our 11 year old loves it and he's not a huge water fan. I suspect it is but don't know for a fact that Essentia is better for you health wise than other bottled water on the market and I do know without a doubt that I love the crisp taste of  the water and love the BPA free bottle and enjoy it more than my bottled Arrowhead. At first, the price seemed like this water is a real luxury, but at just over $2 a bottle on subscribe and save it's not any more expensive than what I have been paying for a smaller 20 oz. bottle of Vitamin Water.  Although I was I introduced to this water as a Vine reviewer, I plowed right through a case of it and have already ordered more on my own.

review/summary: Refreshing as long as its cold!
review/text: This water was very refreshing when it was chilled in the refrigerator.  However, I have a tendency to carry a bottle with me til its gone.  That means it might be a few minutes or perhaps a few hours.  I didn't care for this water when it was room temperature.  It had a metallic taste.  However, considering the benefits of ph balance I will probably still buy this again, but only in small bottles

review/summary: Warning: watch my face on this video before you guzzle this water
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:47 Mins<br /><br /></span>I only had one of these bottles, so I only had one take to do this video. I'm someone who routinely guzzles 64 ounces of regular water at a time, so I thought I could easily handle the 50 ounces in this 1.5 liter bottle of water. I'd tasted just a little tiny bit of this before the video, and it tasted like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JVGNP6">Smart Water</a><br /><br />Even though I pretend to like the water in my video, notice the very pained expression on my face, especially toward the end. After the video ended, I fell on the floor, confused and moaning. The pain only lasted for about 5 minutes, but please learn a lesson from me--this isn't your normal drinking water, and you shouldn't chug it like I did. It is very alkaline.<br /><br />What is a 9.5 pH? Well, normal drinking water and purified water have a pH of 7.0. Regular baking soda has a pH of 9.0. Antacids, like milk of magnesia, have a pH of 10.0. And, bleach has a pH of 13. High numbers are bases, and low numbers, like 3.0 pH for orange juice, are acids. If you remember your warnings from your high school chemistry teacher, bases can be as dangerous as acids.<br /><br />This product's #2 ingredient is baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). And, this water is even more basic (alkaline) than baking soda is, thanks to its other ingredients.<br /><br />If I get another one of these, I'm going to do the science experiment where I put some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QD5XHK">vinegar</a> in, because I'm sure this water with just a little vinegar would totally fizz up, like those <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MAICP8">volcanoes</a> that I used to make for a science project.<br /><br />In summary, it's a decent product, but please sip, and don't gulp this stuff.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+If you take a lot of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QMU8">Tums</a> or other antacid products, then this is a great way to get an acid reducer, without taking a pill<br />+Large, 1.5 liter bottles<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Very alkaline. Be very careful in drinking this.<br />-It would have been nice if they made the pH 9.5 by a fancier ingredient than baking soda<br />-If you don't have acid stomach problems, then you probably won't appreciate that it messes with your stomach juices

review/summary: Hmm...tap water is just fine, thank you,
review/text: 'Infused with Electrolytes for a Difference you can Taste' is what the label says...and I guess you can taste a difference: it tastes a bit different than 'regular' water, but not something you can really put a finger on.  It tastes fine, good even, but nothing special from a taste perspective that I could discern.  Ingredients are purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride....really, I think normal water is just fine.  I'm not sure why these added 'electrolytes' make this water 'better for you' or whatever.  I drink plain water from the tap, or spring water from a bottle...I almost feel the need a little to burp after drinking it, which is weird.  I'm not against this water, but not really a fan either: maybe someone else will better discover its purpose but I'd honestly just rather drink regular water.

review/summary: Essentia Water is essential!
review/text: I have been drinking Essentia Water for the past year after a friend introduced me to Ph correct alkaline water. I used to take gallons from her ionic filter, but after a while I needed to find a new source. Another friend sent a list of alkaline waters in which Essentia was one of them. I have been hooked ever since. Not only is it one of the highest Ph waters avaiable, it is highly hydrating so you get more hydration for your gulps. But it also tastes really good and quenches the thirst thoroughly! A case lasts me about a month, so it is also cost-efficient. Now that it is sold through Amazon, the shipping is free. Great water, great price, and you feel great after drinking it!

review/summary: It's water.
review/text: On the bottle's label is the statement "Doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health." The vagueness of that statement--does it mean that one doctor recommended Essentia as opposed to any other water? Or perhaps that doctors in general acknowledge what everyone knows, namely that water is essential to life?--amused me. There are a variety of claims on the label and at Essentia's website (including a testimonial by a "Dr. G.N." from Wisconsin), but it turns out that Essentia is just municipal tap water that's gone through a variety of processes designed, apparently, to provide electrolytes and improve hydration.<br /><br />I'm not in a position to judge these claims, though having reading books such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GAN3G4">Bottlemania</a> and seen shows such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00019PDNY">Penn & Teller's</a> show about bottled water, I am somewhat dubious of claims regarding bottled water. So I did an informal test. I filled three bottles with water: one with this product, one with simple tap water from my kitchen sink, and one with purified water from a generic brand. I put the three bottles into the refrigerator (with little pieces of paper taped to the bottom indicating the source), and shuffled them every day for two weeks until I was--or believe I was--unaware of the provenance of each bottle's contents.<br /><br />The results: A virtual dead heat. I could tell that one of the bottles (the Essentia, as it turned out) was slightly different. There was a slight aftertaste. It wasn't unpleasant, just there. But before I looked at the identities, I did rank the bottles. Tap water won. Essentia was second. And the purified water was third. Oddly, it tasted rather plastic and was the only one that did so despite the fact that all of the bottles were identical. (They were empty bottles of that same water.)<br /><br />In the end, though, I noticed no benefits of superior hydration or the additives. I simply tasted water that was slightly different from two others. Of course, my test wasn't scientific. It wasn't double-blind, though I tried hard to make it as close as possible. It represents, for what it's worth, my experience.

review/summary: Tastes Very Pure
review/text: I have to give them credit for how smooth the taste of this is. They did a good job purifying it ahead of time. It didn't have any lingering chlorine taste or anything like it that I detected.<br /><br />It is obviously more impractical and expensive to buy bottles of this and have them shipped to you than it is to purchase a filter that can handle a much larger quantity. For the occasions when you feel like you really need to have some on hand that has already been purified (and particularly if you've interested in the fact that it has a 9.5pH), though, this works out just fine.

My son and I did a taste test between the filtered tap water from our fridge and Essentia. Neither of us could tell the difference. My daughter says Essentia has an aftertaste and refused to finish her cup. I'm not sure if she was imagining things or not.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think the flavor distinguishes Essentia from other bottled water. If you are looking for alkaline water that tastes like water, this will work just fine.

review/summary: Great taste and refreshing
review/text: I'm an avid drinker of Smart Water because of the recommendation that drinking distilled water instead of regular tap water reduces bloating and helps to tighten the body since it contains little or no sodium. That's why I was intrigued to try Essentia's 9.5 pH drinking water.<br /><br />It's very similar to Smart Water, has a smooth taste, no after taste and is very refreshing.<br /><br />I like that the water is purified because tap water usually contains chlorine, radon, arsenic, and other toxic chemicals that can't be good for you. I know there's a debate on whether drinking purified water is healthy or not since it lacks minerals and ions such as calcium that play key roles in biological functions, but if you're taking vitamins and supplements, I don't see how this would be a problem.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this water.
