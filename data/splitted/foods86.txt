review/summary: Well, if this doesn't wake you up, NOTHING will.
review/text: The folks at Starbucks are not exaggerating when they say their French Roast coffee is "Extra Bold."  In fact, they should probably call it `Extremely Bold'...or maybe even `Ridiculously Bold.'  The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water.  The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn.  If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long.  The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar.  With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week.

review/summary: Different packaging but that's okay
review/text: The product I received came in a different package than what is pictured but that is fine because it was a little bigger than what I expected. The oil doesnt really have a smell so that is good because I intend to use it in a mixture of oils for my natural hair. The delivery was fast and even arrived a day prior to the scheduled delivery date. I've only used it once so far and mixed it 50/50 with Olive Oil as a hot oil treatment, it wasn't greasy at all and left my hair nice and soft. I gave it 4 stars because I haven't had time to use it enough. I will update this review after I have used it for awhile and can make a better assessment.

review/text: My 4 month old female lab/shep/hound mix loves these.  She likes to fling them around like a cat and they keep her busy for a good ten minutes.  They are also a bit chewier than other treats so she takes her time finishing them and considers them an ultimate reward when she does something good.  They can be hard to find in stores but are readily available on Amazon.

review/summary: EXCELLENT LOW CAL TREAT
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK3I0">100 Calorie Packs Honey Maid Delight Bars, Cheesecake, 6-Count Bars (Pack of 10)</a><br /><br />These low cal cheesecake flavored bars taste decadent without adding inches to your waist line.  They actually do taste like a cheesecake bar should taste which is refreshing.  Many of the low cal foods do not live up to their description. When you purchase something and it says cheesecake you should get the taste that your are expecting which is cheesecake.  Not chemical, not overwhelmingly sweet, but just right.  I found these cheesecake delight bars to be exactly as described. The taste of cheesecake was there and the bar more then adequately fulfills my craving for sweets minus that overwhelming unnatural sweet taste that is present in many low cal bars. If you are a fan of cheesecake but not the very high calorie count associated with cheesecake (which I have been told by those in the know, is one of if not the cake that has the highest caloric count) then this is for you. These bars will definitely be part of my shopping list in the future.

review/summary: Overly Sweet, Flavorless
review/text: I guess I'm in the minority, but I really didn't like these much. I was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when I saw it, but these were disappointing. The bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla-ish undertaste. Absolutely NO cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste. The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy. Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods. Similar in price as most granola and snack bars, none of which are ever much of a good value. Overall, while they aren't inedible or anything, I would not buy these again and I don't even think I'll bother with the rest of the box.

I don't know whether it is the cheese she likes, or the over all taste...but she devours it every time....I wish it was smooth instead of strips, as she seems to have trouble chewing it...I wish the grocery stores would stock more of it, as i usually buy for a month at a time...

He loves the shredded turkey and cheese but won't go near this one.  Weirdest thing in the world to me - thought he'd go gaga over it like he does his turkey, but he just won't touch this stuff.  Anyway, this is a bit pricey here so check around for a better price.  At least in Ohio it's a bit high!  Highly recommend!

review/text: This may seem like a treat to my cats, but it really is food.  My two youngest cats prefer Tasty Treasures over all the Friskies flavors.  They sit and and eat until every last bit is gone.  I've never had a cat do that with any cat food.  I've been waiting for Amazon to carry all the flavors...at a reasonable price...so I can stop hauling them from my local Petstore.  I highly recommend this - especially if you have a picky eater.

review/summary: Fantastic gourmet chip - this flavor is one of the best.
review/text: I purchased these chips for my mobile vending cart. Because I have Amazon Prime the cost per bag is really good as far as a reseller goes. Each flavor is really good in its own right. These chips the Asian Sweet and Spicy are just so tasty. Its just the right amount of sweet and the slightest bit of spice that makes these a fantastic tasting chip.<br /><br />Lets talk about details:<br /><br />Chip thickness (+)<br />These are gourmet chips and the quality is there from the moment you open the bag. Each one is crunchy and not too thick but just enough to let you know you didn't buy a bag of Lays.<br /><br />Grease (+)<br />These are NOT greasy chips. Depending on the flavor they are just mildy seasoned and not coated in a heavy grease or oil.<br /><br />Flavor (+)<br />Each flavor stands completely on its own. You could do a blind taste test of each one of these flavors sold by Deep River and I bet you could tell what it was. None of the flavors are overpowering except maybe the Jalapeno flavor which is honestly too hot and I love hot food.<br /><br />Resale (+)<br />You may not resell these but at the current price and using Prime shipping the cost per bag allows you to make a decent profit.<br /><br />Overall:<br />These are great tasting, unique flavored chips that are hands down better than the ones you can get in bulk at a Sams or BJ's. Do yourself a favor and try a bag or two. I bet you'll love em like we do.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

Hits the salty snack craving just right.  I like the size too - it's enough to satisfy a craving but keeps me from eating a whole big bag.  Which I'd probably do with these, if that's what I had.  I'll definitely order them again.  My husband and 16 year old both really like them too.

review/summary: Keep it simple
review/text: Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the "World Market" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3. Not nearly as good as Tim's Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)<br /><br />It's not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3-stars says "It's OK."  There are better, there are worse...to me, these are right in the middle of the pack.

review/text: Before you turn to other name brands out there, give these a try. Although the Maui Onion can be a bit salty at times, i can still say these are amongst the crunchiest and tastiest chips I have ever had. Now i have tried both the barbeque and Asian style flavor, but still I must say these are the best. If you are looking for something to snack on that tastes good, these are the ones for you. Its better than the pringle's commercial, since these are harder to put down once you start.

review/summary: Pretty good, but prefer other jalapeno chips
review/text: I was expecting some "serious flavor" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.

They are very economical. Beats the heck in terms of quality, taste, and price to buying these at work or out and about (I bought the 2 ounce bags). I will be trying some of the other intriguing flavors. Recommended.

What you want in a potato chip: the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil, ending in a surprisingly smoky note.

review/text: These chips are very spicy to say the least, my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag. They have an overpowering amount of some Asian spice, perhaps ginger, but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste. I bought 24 of the small size bags but could not bring myself to like the flavor, it all ended up in the trash.  This is definitely a chip that will appeal to only certain palates. I do like the sweet onion flavor of this brand but this Asian flavor was too much of a good thing!

review/text: I loved kettle chips from the moment I tried them but I felt absolutely disgusting every time I had the Kettle Brand. Though very tasty and crunchy, they were also very oily. With Deep River Snacks, they've got the crunch and taste without that repulsive burst of oil in your mouth with each crunch that Kettle Brand had. I LOVE the Sweet Onion Maui and Mesquite BBQ. The Jalapeno flavor does spicy justice and the Rosemary & olive Oil is very unique for a chip. I wish they had a sour cream and onion flavor but I love them regardless.

review/summary: Delicious, great texture, 3 ingredients
review/text: I did a search on Amazon for Kettle reduced fat chips, hoping to find a good deal on Kettle brand chips.  I stumbled upon these Deep River reduced fat kettle chips, and liked the per bag price (works out to about $1.50 per bag, about half the price of a similarly sized bag of Kettle brand chips at my local grocery store).  I am so glad I ordered these.  I love the taste, and I love the texture, and never would have guessed they were reduced fat.  I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes, Sunflower or Corn oil, and Salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information...so, here are the basics: 12-chip serving (28g) is 120 calories, 6g fat, 1g fiber.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again.

review/text: I love salt & vinegar kettle chips so I decided to try these after reading good reviews. When I received them, I noticed from the very first bag that over half of the chips were inedible due to rotten potatoes! I know how kettle chips should look, and I know what normal marks look like on chips. These were rotten. After waiting over a month for a response from the company, I finally found a phone number and called them, only to be told there was nothing they could do. The sad thing is, the chips that were edible were actually flavorful and tasty. Obviously they just don't care about consistent quality, so stay away from these chips!

review/summary: Nice and Waxy
review/text: I've got to believe these other reviewers haven't actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips. Here they are:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)<br /><br />Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.<br /><br />So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?<br /><br />Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.<br /><br />In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/brownie baker

Well it was the butterscotch chips. I basically took ATK's recipe and adjusted it for oatmeal insead of the chocolate chip by using their base and adding oats, raisins, chopped mac nuts, cinnamon and these chips. It would have been just as amazing as the chocolate chip cookie recipe if I would have ommitted these chips. Now as another reviewer said, the cookies with the chips in it are destined for the trash.

Well, she loved the idea when I finally did it last friday (although, somehow she had me figured out from the beginning lol).<br /><br />Anyway, I wasn't particularly thrilled about the quality of these cookies. The seams weren't completely shut. I could see the word "Will" through the backside of the cookie.<br /><br />Also, a huge warning for someone looking for an authentic cookie to give.... the wrapper is just that, a plain plastic wrapper. I was expecting some Chinese lettering or some kind of design to make it a little more believeable.<br /><br />And last but not least, the price. For the quality you're getting, I'd be more inclined to try the trick (tutorials online) of opening up a cookie and placing the message inside myself. At least then I could put exactly what I wanted. They are way overpriced for what you're getting.<br /><br />Buy only out of desperation.

review/summary: Really is Extra Virgin Olive Oil
review/text: I bought this olive oil because of the testing done by University California Davis in early 2010.  The results showed that this product passed for being extra virgin olive oil for all 3 samples, and it was the only imported oil to the United States of 14 tested that passed all 3 samples.  It seems to be more potent (because it's spicier) than the, Trader Joe's organic brand which cost 40% less.  You do know that about 80% of all extra virgin olive oil products are not 100% extra virgin olive oil.  Five stars because it's a decent price and I trust this product for being extra virgin more than other name brands.<br />This oil is from Italy, which means this oil is milled in October or November or December, as with all northern hemisphere olive oils.  The southern hemisphere olive oils are milled in June and July.

review/text: I have been using canola, sunflower and peanut oil my entire life. But after reading about the health benefits of Extra virgin olive oil or EVOO (anti cancer, anti inflammatory,good for digestive system, bones etc ) I decided to change to EVOO. And according to the UC davis study, this brand was one of the 5 imported oils that was actually 100% EVOO and not a mixture of different kinds of olive oil. and unbelievably, this is even better than whole foods brand EVOO. And the best part is this is the cheapest of the 5 that passed this test. And I would recommend you to buy this at costco, where you can buy 1.5L for $8.99. And I have been told that if you do not have a membership, you can buy a costco gift card and use it to shop for things like this.<br /><br />[The below information is taken from: [...]]<br /><br />The other approved brands are:<br />Corto Olive<br />California Olive Ranch<br />McEvoy Ranch Organic<br /><br />And the brands found to have be fraudulently labeled as Extra-Virgin:<br />Whole Foods<br />Rachel Ray<br />Safeway<br />Newman's Own<br />Colavita<br />Bertolli<br />Filippo Berio<br />Pompeian<br />Star<br />Carapelli<br />Mezzetta<br />Mazzola<br /><br />This is the best EVOO out there and I would recommend this to my friends.

I was surprised and delighted with the flavor and adaptability of Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil and will purchase it again. It's a great bargain compared to the other two or three certified oils, and the taste is wonderful. A general note: The plastic container Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is sold in is sturdy and solid, but I choose to re-bottle the oil in glass when I receive it, as I do not to store cooking or salad oils in plastic bottles. I would gladly pay the extra dollar it might cost to purchase the item packaged in glass.

review/text: I have been consuming olives and olive oil for years and years for its nutritional value. I cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since I need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet. All vegetable oils are processed and diluted including LIGHT or EXTRA LIGHT olive oil which is a highly refined oil without the nutritional value. I use much more expensive EXTRA VIRGIN olive oils which taste very fruity and sharp from EU but I have been to their farms and know the product real well and trust the producer as well. Unfortunately, olive oil being the gold standard of the cooking oil is produced and mixed with other oils and adulterated by many for financial gain but not this one since it is pure olive oil. Only EXTRA VIRGIN, the first round of olives that have been pressed have the 200 antioxidants, not refined or mixed with other oils. I keep the oils in the freezer, away from heat and light all the time. Bravo.

review/summary: These are good.  Very, very good.
review/text: I don't mean "good for a gluten free cookie", or "almost like a normal cookie".  No, I mean, that as a cookie they are good.  No strange textures, odd flavors, or smells.  No sticking them in the refrigerator to help out the texture.  They basically taste like a normal crunchy sugar cookie with cinnamon that just happens to be gluten free.  No milk or butter either so I believe they should be casein free also.  According to the labeling they are vegan and kosher as well.<br /><br />That's a mighty impressive list of good stuff.  You're probably wondering what the catch is, right?  It definitely isn't the taste.  As I said at the beginning, these are very, very good.  I only see two drawbacks.<br />1) Cost.  Most gluten free foods are expensive so this one isn't unexpected.<br />2) Quantity.  The 5.25 ounce package contains 16 cookies.<br /><br />16 cookies really doesn't seem like that many, particularly when enjoying them.  However that could be considered a positive attribute for some of us.  I know I have a tendency at times to munch on something yummy without paying attention to how much I am eating only to find I've eaten the entire bag.  Since the package is a built-in pause / stop point, the smaller size less overeating.  Even so, I still wish there were more in a package.<br /><br />One last note, just because I found it to be unusual.  Normally all the cookies would be packed the same way, i.e. two rows of eight.  These aren't.  Instead, there are two rows of seven cookies each, side by side, and then two more cookies at the end of the package rotated 90 degrees from the others.  There isn't anything wrong with this packaging method since it maximizes usage of the packaging space.  It's just not how most packaged cookies are packaged, nor is it symmetrical, so it sticks out as unusual to me.

review/summary: Good grief, these cookies are delicious!!!!
review/text: Are these really gluten free, because they sure don't taste like it!  There are a few other cookies being marketed as "gluten free" or "diet" but there simply is no comparison to these nuggets of goodness.  Frankly, even given the choice between these and something like a Pillsbury or Toll House oven-baked cookie, I'd take Lucy's cookies in a heartbeat.  No guilt, no high glycemic index to make you feel like you just gained five pounds, no impulse to hibernate.  Just moist, sweet morsels that make you wonder why the bag isn't three inches deeper.  (Seriously, Lucy, you need to make them deeper.)  And the inspiring story behind the creation of Lucy's cookies will make you feel that much better, knowing that you're supporting a homegrown business, rather than a huge multi-national.  I can't recommend these enough.

review/summary: Used to own stock in the company, but changed their formulation, and get a much lower rating
review/text: I used to love EVERY flavor of these cokies. I was the one buying out the entire shelf at WFoods. I started ordering on amazon multiple 8 packs at a time.  I could easily eat 2 boxes a day by myself!  I eat really healthy and my sweets is the only thing I give myself what I want.  I am vegan and "prefer" to eat gluten free, as I am supposed to due to healh issues, but don't always because there are no other GF desserts that are vegan that I LOVE.  So BOY was I disappointed when I had to stop buying them very mcuh because they changed the fat and calories significantly.  I wonder i anyone else noticed.  I wrote to Dr. Lucy and she replied.  I asked if I could still order some from her int he original formulation, or where I could buy them like that, but she said no.  The only reasons she gave were some type of problem with the formulation and baking f the cookie, but I don't understand beacause they were perfect??!  A better explanation would have been nice.  So thus, I am very disappointed in this line, which was the ONLY GF, VEGAN, LOW FAT/LOW CAL, DELICIOUS!!! line of desserts I enjoyed, and now cannot eat them very often at all.  When I am consuming large amounts, I'm sorry but 25g of fat for a whole box vs. 7.5 g fat/box for the old cookies?  Can't do it. Dang Lucy....I miss my sweet yumminess.

review/summary: Dry with after taste
review/text: I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.  I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading.

review/summary: Ecellent Vegan Gluten Free Cookies, No Tummy Aches
review/text: These cookies are very similar to garden variety wheat based chocolate chip cookies, they have similar texture and snap, but these are both vegan and gluten free, which matches my requirements.  My celiac disease makes me very sensitive to wheat and these cookies do not trigger any reaction.<br /><br />The cookies are if anything a little more crisp than most, but not at all hard or difficult to chew.  They certainly contain sugar.  I do not eat these everyday because they are so sweet, but I do like them and may very well subscribe to them.<br /><br />If I were rating these only on flavor and texture I'd give them 4 stars, but Lucy annoyed me by creating a bizzarre nutrition panel.  Each package contains 4 cookies.  They state it is 1.3 servings, then go on to say one serving has 130 calories.  So each package seems to contain 169 calories, possibly over some people's limit for a snack.  But let's be honest, these cookies with lots of organic cane sugar have a lot of calories.  Each cookie must weigh in at a bit over 40 calories.<br /><br />For years we have known that 42 is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.  Now we know it is a cookie worth of calories too, tasty calories.  Will buy again.

review/summary: nom, nom, nom!!! 4 stars from a  *non*-gluten free mom
review/text: While I am not gluten intolerant, I'm trying to reduce my gluten intake for health reasons and snacks seem to be the best way to to try and curb my intake. Since snacks of this type are not a dietary requirement (much as I'd wish they were) I have the ability to chose *any* cookie, gluten free or not, I am lucky in that I can afford to be a little picky. I had tried a few other weird/bland gluten free options and wow- these cookies really surprised me - the are actually very good! Crispy, no weird/off tastes, just like a "real" cookie. Nice size for dunking in a cold cup of lactose free milk without getting lost or soggy. I deducted one star because they could use a few more chips sprinkled in there.<br /><br />They are a little expensive but I don't mind the price point considering that the factory goes to great lengths to protect against cross contamination from allergens and gluten. Plus being a little pricey I am less likely to eat more than one pack at a time :) I'm looking forward to trying the four flavor combo pack next time.

review/summary: Delicious, but something is awry
review/text: These are very very good tasting. Crispy cookies, especially delicious when dipped in milk. They say gluten free, and I totally believe they are, because I did not have a wheat-type reaction. But, I have to say, I always feel MISERABLE after eating these cookies.<br />Someone else mentions how they are too sweet, etc etc. I don't think they taste too sweet, and they have 13g of sugar per serving which doesn't seem like it's that much, considering most other 'sweets' have more sugars per serving (take a look at Gatorade, for example).<br />That said, it does seem to be some kind of a reaction to the sugar, because immediately after eating them I feel like my body is dumping into some kind of sugar coma. I start to feel like lead, and lightheaded. They also mess up my tummy. Maybe it's the type of sugar they use? Evaporated cane juice is the 1st ingredient, and they also contain 2 kinds of cellulose, which I think are sugars also (but I could be wrong).<br />Anyhow, I gave 4 stars for taste, because they are THAT good, but keep in mind you may feel like you need a lengthy nap to recover from eating them.<br /><br />I agree with the previous poster they should do *something* about this ... I don't want stevia or artificial sweeteners in them, but maybe try using less sugar, or a different kind of sugar, like organic brown? I have no idea, but I would never let a kid eat more than 1 of these at a time, for fear it'd make them just pass out!<br />I eat other sweet stuff, and nothing makes me feel this bizarrely over-sugared.<br /><br />I'm not even totally sure it's the sugar that makes you feel this way ... any ideas? It's a shame, because they are so delicious. I've tried them several times, and may keep them on hand for a once-in-a-blue-moon craving, but I definitely won't be eating them often.

review/summary: Just like Snickerdoodles!
review/text: This cookies are really tasty and I will definitely be reordering.  I ordered the package of 16 small bags to be able to have a snack to carry with me to places unlikely to have anything gluten free, and I'm glad I ordered this product. If one is signed up for the autodelivery program the price is pretty reasonable. The little bag of 4 cookies helps me with portion control because if I had the whole box I would probably plow right through them.  They are very flavorful and taste just like cinnamony Snickerdoodles; there is no weird aftertaste as with many GF foods. (I have also had the oatmeal cookies and found them crispy too but much more bland; they would be good with coffee.) I've even considered crushing the cinnamon thins to make a crust for cheesecake but haven't tried that yet (would buy a box to do so to avoid the need to open multiple bags).  The cookies are very crispy, so if that is an issue for you, take note. (I know my false-toothed father would have to soak these in milk to be able to eat them, but I believe he would think they were worth it!)

We believed my breastfed son was sensitive to milk, and having to avoid dairy when you're a chocoholic is very difficult!  These cookies helped to feed my chocolate cravings, and helped keep my sanity in those difficult first weeks with a newborn.  At first, I thought they tasted just a bit different.  They're a lot crunchier than regular chocolate chip cookies and they don't taste exactly the same.  However, after being off of dairy and munching on these cookies, I began to not notice a difference.  My picky husband also said they were good!

review/text: Lucy's is one of the very few baked goods available that omits all the major sources of food intollerances -- gluten, dairy and eggs. More importantly, they are delicious. When we can't find a local source for Lucy's cookies, we always ordered them on-line.

review/summary: They're amazing!!!!!!!
review/text: These cookies have no milk, no egss, no nuts, no gluten and no cholesterol or trans fat, which common sense says should make them taste like cardboard, if not even worse. I don't know how they did it, but these chocolate chip cookies are delicious. They actual taste like chocolate chip cookies should taste. If you've got allergies, try these cookies. You'll love them.

review/summary: thank you dr lucy!
review/text: these are so great for a GF kid (or adult...) and for the whole family! we're hooked on the chocolate chip, but we like the oatmeal and cinnamon a lot too. and its great that they come in individual packs or full-sized cookies.  pretty healthy and all-natural ingredients, what could be wrong? they're great, we recommend them!

review/summary: Very tasty cinnamon thins
review/text: These cinnamon thin cookies looked appealing in the package so I bought some.  I didn't buy them because they were gluten-free, I just like anything that TASTES GOOD, whether it's low-fat, fattening, gluten-free, low carb, etc. and they ARE really good and surprisingly satisfying for being gluten-free.  Make sure that if you eat them while having coffee that you "dunk" quick (if you like to dunk your cookies).  I order 5 or 6 boxes at a time and will continue to in the future because now they are a favorite that I eat practically every day.
