review/summary: Loved the swiss cookies but most were damaged
review/text: When I received my box and opened it, there they were a nice layer of cookies.OOOOO my family and friends just enjoyed the cookies until I got down to the next layer, they were all opened and crumbled. I do love them but I paid for 120 pack of cookies and only enjoyed way less than half. I sent an e-mail asking for a refund or a replacement box but never heard back.

review/summary: Wonderful little bite of delight
review/text: Having lost 120lb with a gastric bypass, I can no longer eat high fat, sugar ladden items.  These little bites (I wouldn't call them cookies, they are more like little confections).  Give me a sweet indulgence without sabotaging my continued efforts at weight loss.  Oddly enough before the gastric bypass, I tried the fat free but sugared ones and disliked them so much that I threw half the tub out.  These however, are well worth the effort to find.  Thirteen little bites for 35 calories and 9 carbs (6 after considering the fiber) and 4 grams of protein.  A wonderful little bite of delight.  The chocolate are just as good.

I wasn't as disappointed with Amazon's shipping as others were- I'd say 80% of the cookies were in 'mint' condition (sorry about the pun) and only a couple that were broken in half.  They are dated for 11 monthes from now, which is wonderful.  Overall these are an awesome treat and a great buy!

review/summary: These are Great!
review/text: I've had meringues before and have not been that impressed with them. Miss Meringue Vanilla Chocolettes are the perfect twist on the idea. they take a well made basic vanilla meringue and drizzle stripes of chocolate on them. The chocolate stripe adds just the right boost of flavor and as the heat of your mouth melts the chocolate it also adds moisture and txeture to the meringues. These are a great treat and not bad on calories either.

review/text: My husband and I love the "regular" (with sugar) Miss Meringues when we do the Weight Watchers diet as the cookies are incredibly cheap in WW "points value" and provide a few tasty sweet bites. These Sugar Free ones, however, taste nothing like the regular ones and are really quite horrible . . . including a gross texture that gums up in your teeth when you bite them (nothing like an actual meringue) + a bad taste. Skip these! (If I could've rated this product 0 stars I would have.) They have no redeeming qualities.

review/summary: Definitely not like the ones with sugar but great for what they are
review/text: Ok, these cookies are definitely not like the meringues with sugar, I agree those taste a million times better. However, when you want to snack and feel like eating a lot, these are great. 1 serving is only 40 calories, 3 grams of fiber and 4 grams of protein. They are very chocolatey. You can eat the entire package for 80 calories and still get some protein and fiber. They do stick to your teeth, that's for sure. So, if you are really trying to limit your calories, these are good. However, if you care less about the calories and rather eat fewer cookies, go for the ones with sugar (they are delicious). I'm trying to eat less sugar and find meringues addictive so I'm happy with these.

review/summary: Great nutritional profile, tastes better than the vanilla variety
review/text: These are made with mostly air and egg white and have a fantastic nutritional profile for bodybuilders and people losing weight or maintaining a weight loss.  I've lost 160 lbs through diet and exercise and like the reviewer who had surgery, I don't want to eat the amount of sugar found in normal meringues.  The fact there's a reasonable amount of protein in there is a bonus.<br /><br />With the holidays coming up I appreciate having a treat to bring to parties and dinners that I can both share AND eat, while staying within my daily nutritional target.  I like to bring them to church for coffee break after the service.<br /><br />I can find the chocolate ones in a grocery store 40 min from my home, but the vanilla ones nowhere.  This price beats the other online offers and you only have to buy 6 containers at a time.<br /><br />The chocolate meringues taste better by themselves than the vanilla meringues, although neither is to die for.<br /><br />Paired with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUIZ9O">TAZO Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion Tea, Caffeine Free, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, however, the vanilla meringues are fantastic.  I haven't tried the chocolate meringues with citrus tea, but I bet they'd be good too.<br /><br />Other citrus teas would probably also work.

review/text: These meringues are very crisp and fresh, with a wonderful little added crunch of the mini chocolate chips that is totally addictive. The thing to be careful of is the weather - if you are eating them in a humid area, you need to double wrap them once they are open, using an additional outer ziploc bag, or they will get kinda chewy.<br /><br />When sent from Amazon, these do break a bit in  transit, but not too badly.

review/summary: Great cookies, bad shipping
review/text: I LOVE these cookies. They are liking eating mint chocolate chip ice cream, but without the calories. 10 calories per cookies, can't beat that! Nice little chocolate chip crunch as well. Those with food sensitivites, beware, the cookies are dyed green using FD&C Yellow No. 5.<br /><br />However... meringues, being the delicate little buggers that are, probably shouldn't be shipped excessively. My 6 containers had a lot of shards and dust in the bottom, but unlike the one other reviewer mentioning this, I would say that 80% of the cookies were still intact. Still, for a gift, might be better to buy them for a bit more money at your local Sh*pR*te or Wh*le F**ds (who generally carry the larger sized mint meringues.)

review/summary: Not bad, for Sugar Free
review/text: Let me say first that these aren't a bad snack food.  They have the all the sweetness and flavor you're looking for in a meringue cookie.  The problem comes in the fact that they don't "finish" well. That is, they tend to leave a gummy residue on the molars, which is easily removed by the tongue but still annoying. It does become an issue if you eat an actual "serving size" as you end up constantly removing that residue.<br /><br />I won't be ordering again.

Not bad if you have a craving for them, but you will want to brush your teeth and floss after eating them and for some people they will hate the clingy fee. It's not really a problem for those who eat them by putting them in their mouth and letting them dissolve, more for those who munch on them.

review/text: I tried this stuff last night, drank it straight from the freezer no ice no mixing.  This stuff is scary good at 100 proof, very smooth and tastes great.  The only way you know your drinking something strong is the warmth with every sip.  I was pleasantly surprised with this, it would be a nice drink on a cold night as it warms you up.  I will say you must heed their warning and drink responsibly or this stuff will bite.

Still, this item seem to be unclear with regard to how many you are actually getting.

review/summary: Great food for my Frenchie
review/text: My Frenchie loves it.  She eats almost all of it (we feed her 2x/day) and stops when she's full.  I usually add 1/2 tsp of greek yogurt to her breakfast portion.  Her stool is firm and she's eats and goes on a pretty regular schedule.  It's pretty stinky when she passes gas, but it's not that frequently.  I haven't found a dog food to solve that problem though!  Overall, I'm very happy with this food for now (we've only been on it for a little over a week).  FYI stats: our pup is 12 weeks, eats 1-1.5 cups per day, about 8.5 lbs

review/summary: Highly Recommend this Dog Food
review/text: I don't usually review items, but I am highly impressed with this dog food.  After much research, I decided to go with Blue Buffalo based on very favorable reviews of the ingredient list.  What I wasn't prepared for was my puppy's response to this food.  We recently adopted a Treeing Walker Coonhound mix from a rescue organization and kept her on Science Diet for two weeks until she got settled in our home and I was able to figure out what we wanted to feed her.  I thought she was a very light and grazing eater because she would not finish her food at feeding time.  Rather, she would come back throughout the day and take a few bites at a time.  When we took her out, she would constantly eat grass.  That is, until we started the switch to this food.  As soon as the bag was delivered from Amazon, she smelled it and kept following me smelling it as I tried to put the food it away -- good sign #1.  Even at the initial 75% old 25% new food mix, she ate her full feeding at one sitting for the first time -- good sign #2.<br /><br />She is now fully transitioned to the new food, and eats her full meals in one sitting. The grass eating has stopped and she was able to transition to this food without any loose stools or other issues -- good signs #3 and 4. Needless to say, she absolutely loves the Blue Buffalo food and having hear eat her food in one sitting has greatly simplified my life as her bowel movements are now regular, greatly helping in the whole housebreaking process.  I haven't noticed much of a difference in her coat, but she's only been on the new food for a little over a week. Based on my positive exeprience with this food, I intend to switch her to the adult version of Blue Buffalo once she gets past the puppy stage.

review/summary: my puppy mutt loves it... give him bad gas though
review/text: The ingredient list is great - no large portion of corn fillers, very high quality protein, and it doesn't smell offensive when I open the bag.  My puppy loves it and wolfs it down as quickly as he can, but he gets some serious gas.  The boy can clear a room now, and I didn't see this with science diet.<br /><br />I have no doubt this is a higher-quality product than science diet, but so far I'm still looking for a solution to the gas issue - he does also have loosely-formed stools occasionally, even several weeks after being transitioned.  I've tried adding a couple types of yogurt to the bowl with mixed results.

review/summary: Generally positive, Got my dog through puppyhood, but take note...
review/text: I believe this food worked for my goldendoodle puppy.  We Bought Blue Buffalo Chicken and Rice for my puppy after acquiring her at 8 weeks of age.  We switched her off Purina puppy because we wanted to go with a food containing no bi-products.  Blue Buffalo fit the bill.  Taste-wise, our pup did not discriminate.  She gobbled up her BB food and wanted more.  She grew up healthy without any problems.<br /><br />Once she hit around 8 months she would have occasional bouts with diarrhea.  I'm not sure if it was due to the food or her adjusting immune system but from that point forward she would have these bouts approximately once a month.  During these times we had to take her off BB and feed a bland diet of chicken, rice, and pumpkin to get her over the hump until resuming BB.  This would always work but the bouts would return occasionally.  We switched her to and adult blend - BB Wilderness (Chicken) at just over one year, hoping that grain free would alleviate this issue; however it still happened on and off.<br /><br />Our dog is now about 1 year and 3 months old.  We are switching her off BB Wilderness over to the Merrick duck and sweet potato recipe (grain free as well).  We never figured out the exact cause of these bouts and don't know if the food switch will fix things either.  The treats we give her were generally high quality consistent with her food and we never give table scraps. One thing we read was retrievers have been known to have food allergies and intolerances, and sometimes have sensitive stomachs.  Then again, young dogs' immune systems are constantly developing just as humans.  Dogs can't tell us what's bothering them so it's us to make our best judgment based on how their bodies react to things.<br /><br />My review is generally positive because I can't necessarily blame this food for my dog's occasional problems.  Every animal's body is different and these types of problems don't always reflect on the quality of the food.  For the most part she seemed to respond well and liked the taste as well.  I think it would be good just to take note if other people experience the same issue.

review/text: My Siberian husky did not agree with this food at all. Aside from horrible gas her poop became very soft and liquidy and she began to go at irregular times and would occasionally throw up. She was put on the food gradually and allowed almost two weeks to adjust before I pulled the plug and put her back on her old food. Even when we mixed in White rice her stomach never got used to the food and she remained sick. May be good food, but my puppy doesn't get along with it.

review/summary: Sickness for 1 week
review/text: We bought this bag for our Welsh Terrier pup the beginning of September and this past week spent over $168.00 in Vet fees for diarrhea and vomit episodes from our little guy. He was tested for everything and nothing came up. The vet concluded it had to be bad food. After we stopped,and put him on a bland diet the sickness stopped. He has been using this B.B. food for a year and never had issues until I bought this last bag, from on here. I contacted B.B. and they took down the info and will be looking into it. Our vet told us he has had multiple dogs with the same issues this past month and the common thread is the food from Blue Buffalo. I am crossing my fingers that it is just the storage or transportation issue of this last batch and they figure it out - our dog was a mess for a week.<br /><br />We are returning 3/4 of the bag for a full refund to Amazon. Please be careful and call B.B. if any symptoms occur - they need to track this for the safety of our pets.

review/summary: best for my cocker spaniel
review/text: My husband and I were looking for the best dog food...Blue Buffalo ending up winning the race :)<br /><br />We first tried Solid Gold Hundchen Flocken, which is a great product. The kibble, however, was too big for our then 3.2 lb. pup. So, we tried Wellness, but he was getting sick from anything by the brand--whether dry or wet food...or even the treats! After that, we stuck with Blue. However, we still wanted to try Orijen...it was just too rich for him, and he was hyper the entire time and had really horrible #2s. We went back to Blue and will not be switching. Conrad loves Blue Buffalo and has been thriving on it--12 lbs. and with a beautiful soft and shiny coat.<br /><br />**We never tried to switch foods cold turkey--always with a week or so of transition.**

I also gave this brand to my 9 year old Great Dane/Sheppard Mix and she's lost 10 pounds on it in the past 2 months. She is way more active than she was before.  Yes this food is expensive but its worth it. If you can buy nice things for yourself then why not for your "best friend"?

Within a week, his coat is much, much softer, eyes brighter, teeth whiter. I feel much more confident he is getting all the nutrients he needs; Blue has about twice as many vitamins and minerals listed in the ingredients than Nature's Recipe does. Never leaving you Blue!

review/summary: Perfect for my poopy puppy!
review/text: My puppy is a pooper.<br /><br />When I first started off with Wellness puppy food, he had shapeless stools 3-5 times a day. After trying some other types of food, I finally settled with Castor and Pollux Organix puppy food. This gave him solid, regular stools 3 times a day. However, he had bad gas and 3 times a day is no good for a puppy's independence. I finally bought Blue Buffalo on a whim since I was running out of dog food and Amazon Prime had a good deal on it. This is the best food for my baby boy. No more bad gas and he only poops twice a day! Something about Blue Buffalo's combination of ingredients is the perfect fit.<br /><br />No two dogs are exactly the same so I would suggest trying a variety of food until you find the right fit. I can't say much about the taste - my little boy is no picky eater.

review/summary: My puppy loves Blue Buffalo
review/text: After research puppy food and receiving numerous recommendations from friends, trainers, and vets I chose the Blue Buffalo formula (she was originally using RC).  Our Boston Terrier mix loves the food and she has a nice shiny coat.  One note, she does get some gas with this formula, but it is also part of the breed (and a dog thing).  The bites are pretty small maybe a quarter inch, and there is no scoop included.<br /><br />I definitely recommend buying the 30 pound bag, it is the best value compared to the smaller bags, especially if you have the room to store it.  I buy on Amazon to have the bag delivered to my apartment in the City, it arrived quickly and was much easier than lugging the bag around.

It has a little tag on each bag that says made in London.<br /><br />After a few weeks I checked my blood pressure and it did indeed go down, the top number.  So I guess it works.

review/summary: Marzetti Fat Free Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing
review/text: BEST FAT FREE DRESSING EVER!!!! Discovered it when I ordered the Almond Berry Chicken Salad at Wendy's!  I, too, was instantly hooked.  Love it!  Haven't been able to find the dressing in my local grocery stores. Just did an online search and found you can purchase the packets online at Amazon and at mybrands.com.  It's more expensive on Amazon. Also, you have to buy a case of 60 packets. Haven't found it bottled anywhere so far, but will continue to look cause I have to have this stuff in my fridge!!!

review/summary: Really Close to the Wendy's Dressing
review/text: Like Kate (the other reviewer), I fell for the Wendy's chicken and berry salad and its terrific dressing.  A week or so ago I found a couple of leftover dressing envelopes in my fridge, so I used them and wanted more.<br /><br />I ordered some from the Amish Foods Company, through Amazon, last week,  and received my order very promptly--within a couple of days.<br /><br />The envelope looked different from the Wendy's package.  It's not see-through, contains 1.5 oz instead of 1.1, is not labeled "Exclusively for Wendy's" and, most unfortunately, is also not labeled "All Natural No Preservatives" which probaly accounts for the difference in taste.  The dressing looks different too (not as purple, more red).<br /><br />Here's a breakdown comparison of the ingredients and pertinent nutritional info (the other numbers were 0)--<br /><br />Wendy's stuff:  sugar, water, red raspberries (including dehydrated), corn syrup, red wine vinegar, acai juice, balsamic vinegar, shallots, salt, xanthan gum, spice, natural flavors.  KEEP REFRIGERATED<br />Cal 50, fat 0, sodium 160mg, carb 12g, sugars 11g, protein 0<br /><br />The stuff you'll get:  water, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, distilled vinegar, cucmber juice, raspberries, salt, xanthan gum, onion*, bell peppers*, natural and artificial flavors, citric acid, sodium benzoate added as preservative, garlic*, spice, red #40, calcium disodium EDTA added to protect flavor, titanium dioxide, blue #1.  *dehydrated<br />Cal 50, fat 0, sodium 320mg, carb 13g, sugars 12g, protein 0<br /><br />Of course I prefer the Wendy's stuff because it's all natural, but I'm not part of the franchise, and neither is Amazon, apparently . . . yet.  Still, this stuff tastes pretty good--for those who like their dressing quite sweet.  I find that one envelope will cover two cereal-bowl-sized salads.

review/summary: A Heavenly Partnership
review/text: I discovered this marvelous dressing by ordering a Wendy's salad earlier this year, and since then I have had two of these salads a day - only because of the Raspberry Vinaigrette. To my surprise not only was it delicious, but I could invite my diabetic friend along for lunch and she became hooked on this dressing. Then one family member after the other tried it and fell in love with it. When we ate our lunch you could hear: "oh, yum, umm, umm, umm." We would giggle at the fact that we were in ecstasy over a salad dressing. Our hearts were nearly broken when one Wendy's after the other began to say it was the end of the season for the berry salad which had the Raspberry Vinaigrette on it, so we loaded up on extra packets where ever we could hoping we could eventually discover where to order the dressing. This is my attempt.

It is just as difficult to find, but the ingredients are the same as Wendy's dressing, except they had a little lemon juice.  It tastes the same and is yummy.  They only place I have found it is Mybrands.  Their shipping prices are outragious, but the bottles are pretty reasonable.  Still haven't found it in the store.  Enjoy!

Using these treats to train your cats to come when called is also a benefit.<br />The only negative is that they're rather expensive.

They can also be used, crumbled, as food toppers if your cat is finicky or ill and having a hard time maintaining a healthy appetite.

review/summary: My cats love these !!
review/text: My two domestic Bengals love this treat.  They scarf them right up, even when they're not hungry.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the price is sky high for what you get.  I understand why I guess.  My son told me that I could can up real chicken and give those as treats.  I haven't canned chicken because the flavor suffers a bit, so I microwave chicken breasts after cutting them into bite-size pieces, refrigerate them and it serves the exact same purpose and is more affordable.  I take some out, microwave them so they're not cold and just serve them on a paper plate to my babies and they love it and it's the real thing AND I can afford it.  Obviously the Liv-a-Little treats are wonderful, if you're wealthy and can afford it.  We're on a fixed income so I am opting to cook the real thing and serve that as their treats.

review/summary: Good as decaffeinated coffees go
review/text: This coffee was actually better than I expected.  Although visually it looks like some robusta has been blended with arabica, the brewed product is rather pleasant with an actual coffee taste.  No, this is not as good as one that has been decaffeinated by the Swiss water process, but I would rate this is smoother and more flavorful than the typical store bought brand in the red plastic container.  Was also delighted that the day I placed the order, this 3 unit can (meaning 3 x 11 ounces) was selling for little more than the one unit plastic container offered for sale in my local supermarket.  In short, a serviceable product for those of us who for one reason or another are restricted in the amount of caffeine we are allowed to ingest, particularly is you catch it on sale

review/summary: These are super skinny
review/text: If you are used to buying the Piggy Twists that are about the size of fat cigars, these are not them.  These come 20 to a pack, but the individual twist is about as wide as a regular drinking straw, and 2/3 as long.  If you have a very small (as in toy breed) dog, they are probably great.  I have two dogs between 50-60 lbs., and these are barely worth pulling out of the bag.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After using all the piggy twists (because I'd bought them), we are now used to this size and actually prefer them to the big cigar-like ones because they don't make such a mess.  I still think they are made for tiny dogs, but they will keep a 50-60 lb dog occupied for a while, too.  Just realize what size you are getting with this purchase, because the product picture does not make it clear.

I'm not a daily wine drinker and am FAR FAR from very knowledgeable about wines at all, but this particular blend quite honestly, tasted like acidic Pine Bark.  I couldn't even make it through a glass.  I took the bottle to work and asked several coworkers to test it (yes, we roll like that at work), and everyone just hated this one.  I'm afraid I'll have to give this one a "pass".  But if you are the experimental sort, note that Sam's Club charges about half of what Cline's own web site does for this bottle.

review/text: We have given our cat tinkerbelle all the fancy feast appetizers. The chicken variety is his favorite and his second favorite is the sea bass and shrimp. He actually likes them all but the sea bass and shrimp is cool because it has a whole shrimp right on top. so cool. It is just a treat not a meal, at only about 35 calories each. Even though this is 2 oz it is at least half water so not enough for a full meal.

review/summary: Makes me feel guilty!
review/text: These appetizers are the bright spot in my cat's day! I don't feed them to her every day. About twice, sometimes three times a week I give her a soft form of food like these or the Wellness packets or Whiskas Purrfectly Fish. She prefers the moist foods over the dry, but it would get extremely expensive to feed these preservative free, all natural forms of food to her all the time! I agree with the reviewer who recommended reading the labels; I am a 'label reader' and I too noticed the "Supplemental Feeding" on the appetizers. These, as well as the other wet foods, are either mixed in to a dry (also all natural preservative free) cat food, or given as a treat between meals.<br /><br />My spoiled rotten Princess of a  cat loves these. It's as the heading states; I almost feel guilty that I cannot feed her one of the three aforementioned forms of moist food all the time!

review/summary: Good, BUT.....
review/text: Great supplemental food, BUT...<br /><br />READ THE LABEL: "Fancy Feast Appetizers are intended for SUPPLEMENTAL FEEDING ONLY. This product may be fed daily along with a complete and balanced cat food diet."<br /><br />DO NOT FEED this as only food source for your cat. These DO NOT contain a very necessary ingredient, TAURINE. Feeding processed/canned or even home-cooked meats and fish to cats requires Taurine as the cooking process destroys Taurine. Lack of Taurine is known to cause eye and heart problems in cats. . Do some research on Taurine! It's in all cat food, by law. I don't know how Fancy Feast got away with omitting it. They assume all cat owners read labels....so not true. . Do some research on Taurine! It's in all cat food, by law. I don't know how Fancy Feast got away with omitting it.
