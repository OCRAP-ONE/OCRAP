review/summary: These are great!!!
review/text: Our dogs have only been chewing these for about a week and a half and they are great for freshening their breath!!! Their breath was so bad that you couldn't stand having them breathe anywhere by you, now their breath is alot better. I think that it is only gonna continue to get better :) Plus they love them and these don't upset their sensitive tummies!!!! I would recommend these to anyone :)

review/summary: Greenies are the Greatest
review/text: I've been giving my dogs Greenies for years now.  Their excitement at receiving this treat never abates.  As expensive as they are, I feel my animals are well worth it.  This is doggie health food at its finest.  And the price here on Amazon is the best I've found to date.  However, I am completely disgusted with the packaging of this product.  The huge box is wasteful and not at all environmentally sound.  Come on Greenies people - put the product in a pouch and call it a day.

review/summary: Great Help for Bad Breath!!
review/text: I tried these on the recommendation of our veterinarian for my 2 little dogs' bad breath. I didn't think they would like them, since the treat is hard & they favor soft treats. But both dogs love them! Within 2 days, their breath was improving. Now, they get their once a day treat to keep their breath smelling fresh.

Keeps their breath very clean-smelling and they really just... love love love their Greenies!

review/summary: Work great!
review/text: My Italian greyhound LOVES these treats, and I've yet to notice any problems as described by so many other reviewers. My Bella (her name) gets one of these treats about every other day since she's very difficult when it comes to me actually brushing her teeth. They definitely do the job.<br /><br />Some people have stated that their dog has choked on these treats or a piece got caught in their intestinal track. Well, I'm not sure how fast your dog tends to eat treats, or how big of a chunk they try to bite off, but that DOES matter when it comes to digestion of anything. My pup eats these treats pretty slowly (as I think she realizes it lasts longer that way), and I make sure I'm in the room while she's eating it. She'll chew off small pieces to eat, not large ones so I'm not sure if that makes a difference but I assume it would.<br /><br />I also make sure she gets plenty of water afterwards, to wash it down. The person at Petsmart told me these are like crack for dogs. While I can believe that, my iggy has several different types of treats and only gets this one every other day. If I gave her this for everything, I could see it becoming an issue.<br /><br />Overall, I think these are great, they help to keep my dogs mouth clean so that I'm not having to brush her teeth quite as much.

review/text: Got these large Greenies originally when we noticed our 60+lb Boxer mix puppies' teeth were getting a little dirty and brushing didn't too much.  We give them each one Greenie in the morning when we leave for work, they love them.  The boy gobbles it down, but his sister savors every bit.  They also keep the buildup on their teeth down quite a bit, they're not going to make them shine, but they'll keep them pretty clean!

review/summary: Greenies for dogs
review/text: Molly and Cocoa, our cocker spaniels, said to tell you that they love these greenies and can't think of anything they would rather munch on.  They have sizes just right for them, are easy to chew and easy to digest.  The fact that they come in "lite" is a bonus as it helps us keep their calorie content down in the winter when they don't get as much exercise.  I would highly recommend greenies for a great treat that helps clean dog's teeth and eliminate bad breath.

review/summary: Saw a difference very quickly...and my dog loves them
review/text: I have an Old English Sheepdog puppy who was developing inflamed gums and awful dog breath way younger than he should have been.  I started feeding him these, and within a very short time (weeks?  Maybe even less), the inflammation had gone away and his breath was much better.  I buy a size smaller than recommended for his size, and that way he can have more than one -- it breaks the treat up.  Since he loves these, I can use them as a reward.  Next box, I'm going to buy an even smaller size so I can divide the treat up even more throughout the day.

review/text: I have two Peek-a-Poo's and just say Greenies and they go crazy.  These are the reformulated Greenies are made with gelatin compared to the old ones that had harmed some dogs and were pulled from market.  These are easily digested as I started them out slow and made sure they chewed and not swallowed them, which could be harmful. I trust Amazon to sell me items that will not cause harm.  I personally thoroughly check for anything foreign which is due to the manufacturer and not Amazon.

review/text: When we adopted our 6 year old Basset Hound from a foster home, her back teeth had so much build up that they were actually brown.  Now after four months, they are not completely back, but they are about 75% better. Although they are not inexpensive, I think they do a good job.  And she also enjoys them very much.  I have checked many places and have found Amazons prices to be the best so far.

review/summary: The only way to go, unless money is not an issue!
review/text: Our three dogs love Greenies. They are very expensive (usually $32.99, but marked down to $29.99 sometimes). Then, on top of that you have state tax. So ... if I buy 4 boxes: two Petite and two Teenies in a store that has "Pet" as part of the name, it'll cost me over $135.00. If I do the same thing through Amazon companies prices it costs me about $85.00. That's a difference of $50.00 (for the Math impaired reader ...). Go with free shipping because it, literally, gets here the same time frame. Use the $50.00 and take your spouse out to dinner!<br />The product is great. I did notice that two in the same day was a bit tough on my Pomeranian's digestive system and caused a little diarrhea. The dogs love the taste and would eat them all the time. We get the small ones despite having two larger dogs because they will chomp them down in a heartbeat. With the smaller sizes the dogs still get a treat and the boxes have a lot larger amount of Greenies in them.

review/text: When my dogs see me reaching for the Greenie box they immediately sit on their bottoms and behave wonderfully. One of the dogs will even do a little dance when we finally give her the treat. We give our dogs one greenie about every other day and they just love them. They take a lot of time in carefully chewing the greenie, so it doesn't appear they are swallowing them too quickly. I usually get the Petite or Teeny varieties for our two 10 lb dogs, but since they like them so much I moved to regular. Hopefully I'll see a change in their breath soon as they hate getting their teeth brushed.

These treats are so small that I doubt my dog is getting the benefits of tartar control/removal.  On the bright side, she likes the taste, so they certainly work as regular daily treats.

Only problem is once you start your dog on these it will be a continuous treat and even from Amazon these are not cheap.  As quickly as they are devoured the per minute price is astronomical.  But it is hard to deprive a dog you love of such a tasty treat!

She loves Greenies and they're healthy enough for us to feel comfortable. Yeah, they are pricey but if you buy them on Amazon with the free shipping they are alot cheaper than buying them in stores! For all she gives us, the treats are still a bargain!

They are very soft and easy on her teeth but also rub the leftovers off to keep them clean.  I really recommend these to anybody who has a dog and they also make cat greenies which also work for my barn cats and they love them.

review/text: I have been feeding Greenies to my 9 year old Schipperke since she was old enough to eat them.  She loves them, her teeth are exceptionally clean which I attribute to having fed these to her all of these years.  My Boy Schipperke is now 6 and I have feed them to him also.  My Vet remarks every time I take them for appointments how clean their teeth are.  I also brush their teeth most nights so a combined effort and my dogs teeth have never needed to be cleaned which has saved their little bodies from the trauma of anesthesia. Feed the right size and ALWAYS watch your animal with any treat.

review/text: EDIT: I had been giving my dog a half of one of these every day, and he was having digestive issues with them. I stopped giving them to him and he recovered. I will have to lower my rating on these, even though he loves the taste.<br /><br />I have a havanese dog. He is very picky about treats and food. He LOVES these things. He goes crazy for them. He sometimes won't even eat his regular food (EVO Chicken small bites) because he wants one of these first. I'm not sure if they are actually helping his teeth though. His teeth are looking kind of gnarly and he is only 3. I don't mind the smell of these treats either.

Her doctor has always commented on how clean and healthy her teeth and gums are and has never had to put her under for a cleaning. Her breath is nicer, too, since we started giving her Greenies.<br /><br />We give her one every day or so and she will carry it around 'protecting' it for an hour or so before settling down and devouring it. We tried other brands but she will only accept the best. She is terrified of thunderstorms and will come out from under the bed only if we offer her her favorite treat: a Greenie.

We were so pleased to find them on Amazon at nearly half the price.  Every dog owner should try them, they come in all sizes for all dogs and really do keep their teeth in great condition.

review/summary: Dogs really like them
review/text: My dogs love these. They start drooling everytime they get these. Not really sure if they do anything for their teeth/breath. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars just because these are alittle pricey considering they are gone in like 30 seconds.

review/text: Very quick delivery and same quality goods!  Cheaper than buying them at the actual pet store.  So, I'll be ordering again when I run out.  My dogs love them and their breath is a lot better.

review/summary: Great price on an item he's crazy about
review/text: My 60 lb Ridgeback-mix is just crazy about these.  By about 10:30p he starts anticipating getting his nighttime treat and he won't leave me alone until I give him his Greenie.  I had a Sheltie-mix who didn't care for Greenies but this guy loves 'em.  The vet says they're good for him and we've never experienced any problems digestively speaking so if your four pawed friend is a Greenie fan, too, this is certainly a great price.  Shipping was reasonable, as well ... particularly when ordering several boxes ... and quick.

review/summary: Greenies Lite - Not for dogs who had the taste of regular Greenies
review/text: My little dog who's rather picky about his treats absolutely loves Greenies REGULAR.  As he's getting older, I thought I'd go for the LITE since I'm sure regular Greenies have a lot higher calories.  So I bought Greenies LITE (teenie, 96 pack) and he sniffed at the first one and literally pushed it away with his nose and several more attempts have gone unsuccessful and I've been just handing them out to my friends' less-picky dogs.  Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.  So if your dog already had a taste of regular Greenies, I suggest you stick with the regular.

review/summary: Greenies Dental Chews
review/text: My postman started giving Maddie Greenies when she was about a year old, when he stopped I had to purchase them myself, she has one each day, she is now 13 1/2, she loves them I feel they are good for the gums and teeth, she has had very few pulled, looks good for a Senior.  I would highly recommend them to any one who has a pet.

review/summary: For now fine, will know more at next physical
review/text: My dog really enjoys these as a daily treat. However, until she has her next physical I really can't evaluate these properly. I will try to remember to update after her physical so I can report back if her tartar build-up has been reduced or eliminated. Our vet said they work IF your dog chews them slowly. Our dog goes through them pretty fast, so I am not sure if they are going to be effective. We decided to give them a year and see what happens.

review/summary: Great for Treats and Teeth
review/text: These Greenies are a great buy. I used to get the Petite size for my Bicon/Poodle and my Bichon, but found that you get more treats with the Teenies and the dogs enjoy them just as much. So, if you have small dogs up to say 25 or 30 pounds, the Teenies are the best. I don't think you can find them any cheaper.

review/summary: Puppy loves the Greenies!
review/text: This is a favorite treat of our 7 month old standard poodle puppy. He is an aggressive chewer, so we need something which will occupy him. The Greenie really seems to satisfy  - after chewing through it (which, admittedly, only takes a few minutes) he will lie down and stop bothering us during dinner.<br /><br />I wish these were less expensive. Each Greenie costs about $1.50, so it pains me a little to see it evaporate so quickly. But that is a function of my dog, not the product.

review/text: My dog Sadie loves these bones!  They are her absolute favorite! Usually after I give her a different bone, she just likes to be chased around the bedroom, alot, but with these, one quick chase and she lays right down to chow on it. Once a week or longer is all I spoil her with these making them even more special.

review/summary: Our Dogs Know When it is Time for their Greenie
review/text: Every evening, about the same time, our two dogs know when it is time for their Greenie treat. They will both come and sit in front of us and patiently wait for us to get their treat. If we are busy and ignore them they will give a soft cry to get our attention. Each one only gets one a day, but other than walks, petting and their dinner, the Greenie is a highlight of their day.

review/text: Finding this product on Amazon was like finding an unexpected Christmas present!<br /><br />Highly recommend by the vet, because of price, I save it for special occasion (always once a day) and, by far, the treat my dog just loves.  True story.  Since I am not able to walk my dog, when the mail lady delivers my mail, she often leaves screen door  open so Scrappy can take off and run for exercize.  She leaves screen door open, whe he has been out running when he should be back, the mail lady hollers "Greenie, greenie" and this 15# of black fur runs full speed ahead, into the patio and the door inside (which I left open.  A good testiment for a fantastic product!!

review/text: No doggie breath for our dog.  People are always commenting that she doesn't have bad breath and her teeth look so clean.  A friend of ours who runs a veterinary and rescue clinic recommended them to us when our dog was very little, and we've sworn by them ever since.
