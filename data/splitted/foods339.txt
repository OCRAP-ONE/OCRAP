review/summary: Not My Favorite
review/text: I've tried several Dr. McDougall's vegan soups.  This is not a favorite.  It is really too thick for soup.  It is also on the bland side.  A little hot sauce helps.

review/summary: Hits the spot
review/text: I was initially skeptical of this type of packaged soup, but was pleasantly surprised. Not only does it taste good, but the big deal with this McDougall soup is that it has minimal fat content (there are no added oils), and it has reasonably low sodium content which is rare in pre-packaged soups. So all in all, it's a great package that is worth having as an easy & healthy snack/meal on the go or part of your lunch at work.  It also goes well as a gravy/sauce over brown rice. Really good and worth a try.

review/summary: McDougall's soups are the best "Eat to live" type soups
review/text: If you follow a plant strong, no added oil diet this is the soup for you! I like the lentil couscous soup as it has 12g of protein and only just over 300mg of sodium. It is filling and it tastes good. I can even taste the small garlic pieces. This soup does not take the full 5 min to become fully hydrated which helps if you are in a rush. The price is also very good, if you do subscribe and save can't find it cheaper!

review/summary: Bland tasteless thick like porridge
review/text: First off my "soup" boiled over at about 1 minute and frothed out of the little cup all over my plate. So then I let it sit and calm down and then I gave it another 30 seconds (trying for the 1 min and 40 sec instructions) and it boiled over again. At this point I just let it sit in the microwave for 6 minutes and then tried eating it. It was not soup though, it was very thick. Also it had no real flavor and it needed salt badly though I know it is supposed to be low sodium. But only some salt could make this blandness appealing to ingest. The texture was like couscous. Too bad I got the 6 pack. I felt compelled to eat some of it but frankly, I think I will just call this a loss and see if anyone at work wants the rest of them.

I put some of this in my dog's bowl to see what he thought of it after I forced three spoonfuls down.  I swear to God my Jack Russell dry heaved.  He walked away with half of the spoonful still in the bowl and he eats EVERYTHING.  If anything, this purchase was worth it just to see my dog do that.  I will never forget the look he game me that said 'Oh man, what did you just give me?!'.  Utterly hilarious.  The five left from the package are in the garbage.

review/summary: Restaurant coffee at home
review/text: This coffee is rich, dark, flavorful and aromatic, from Holland.  The taste stands out among all the other available brands of coffee, in all forms.  It has the perfect pure, full coffee flavor and it tastes just like it smells.  I first tasted Douwe Egberts coffee at a friend's home.  I had no idea what she had given me, but it was good enough to ask her what it was.  She had given me a cup of instant Douwe Egberts coffee, from a jar she had purchased in Germany.  The taste was so good and it didn't in any way resemble any instant coffee I ever had.  I thought she had brewed a pot of something special for me.  My next experience was at a restaurant, when I ordered a cup of coffee after dinner.  It was amazingly good, and when I asked the waitress what kind of coffee it was, she told me Douwe Egberts.  I noticed a pattern here.  I then began my search for the coffee.  I couldn't find a store that sells Douwe Egberts coffee, so I found it online at Amazon, and ordered two bags of whole bean.  I experimented with amounts, and finally produced that perfect cup that I had in the restaurant.  Douwe Egberts provided the best morning coffee I've ever made. Since the price is not prohibitive, I will be ordering more.

review/text: This is my favorite coffee to make at home. It is great in a drip machine, a Keurig, a French press, etc... The taste is full and rich without being bitter, burnt, or too strong. It almost has a slight chocolately flavor to it. Even the beans make the whole house smell good when I put them in the grinder. I have been on auto delivery for years and the bags are always fresh and come within two or three days of shipment. It does take a few tries to perfect your cup of coffee, not too much, not too little, etc... but once you do and you can duplicate it you won't be sorry.

review/summary: A nice cup of coffee, but still searching for the right blend
review/text: Let me start by saying that I LOVE my coffee.  I'd been looking for Douwe Egberts coffee beans since first experiencing the very smooth, full-bodied cup about 5 years ago.  The coffee I tasted then, and in one other restaurant since, was quite distinct--the best cup of coffee I had EVER tasted.  (Those were the only two times I'd ever asked a waitress what type of coffee they served.) Until recently, I could not find Douwe Egberts coffee beans online nor in gourmet specialty shops.  The Arome Excellent that I recently found and purchased on Amazon, is pretty good, but not as full-bodied or as creamy-smooth as what I had before. (I still go to that restaurant for their great DE coffee.)  I just ordered the Arome Rood and another blend, in hopes of finding the one that most closely tastes like the cups I've had at the restaurants.<br />Overall, this coffee is amongst the best I've brewed, but I'm still searching for the smooth blend that I had before.

Gladly Amazon is a lifesaver and we were so happy to have found it on here and such a GREAT price. We receive 2 bags every month through the subscription option. The house smells so amazing everytime we brew this coffee. Even though the package is in a different language, I think it's their middle strength of coffee but it is SO FULL of flavor better than Maxwell or Folgers anyday!

review/summary: Ahh... the flavor!
review/text: First off, I'm not a huge coffee drinker, maybe one or two cups a month, and I only drink it when it's GOOD coffee. This stuff is awesome. Not bitter at all. My husband is the coffee drinker in our house and always says that when I make his coffee it's better... that's because I make this when I make his coffee, and he just puts a breakfast blend k-cup in the Keurig. Anyway, I use my Magic Bullet to grind enough of this for about a week, then I reuse some of the old k-cups that I have cleaned out. Usually, about 1.5 tbsp of coffe or a little more will fit into the k-cup. I found some great little plastic lids here on Amazon that snap right on and Viola! Awesome single-cup coffee, which is MUCH cheaper than shelling out $11 for a box of 18 k-cups! I actually use the same coffee grounds twice to get a bigger cup of coffee. Anyway, I hope this helps. This is great coffee, and it's very smooth. Definitely worth trying.

review/summary: This may surprise you
review/text: Having recently got a Superautomatic I was looking around for some nice but not overly pricey COffee Beans.  I wanted to try out several before settling down on the ones I like best and decided to try this Dutch Coffee Brand.  Generally one hears about the South American or African or Hawaiian grown coffees, or other coffees where Starbucks is trying to sell a story along with the coffee etc etc. So I figured I'd be a contrarian and try out this unheard of brand, but I am very satisfied with the Douwe Egbert Beans.  When I got it was about 25% more on Amazon than it currently is, even then I thought it was an excellent choice.  Not a Barista Connoisseur by any stretch of imagination but I see great Crema every time I make an espresso, so the beans must be very good in my mind.  As I try more beans if I find a striking difference compared to other brands, I will update this review as appropriate.

review/text: There are a lot of great coffees around, but this is simply the best. It is smooth and buttery with subtle nutty undertones, there is no bitterness. It is a medium roast that is full of flavor - perfect for that everyday cup. The beans are so aromatic, they will make your mouth water in anticipation of that great cup of coffee. You can find this coffee in restaurants, but the flavor is a bit different. The restaurant version has a very sweet taste. These beans don't have that sweetness, but give a much fuller flavor - similar to the flavor you would expect of a gourmet blend.

I love their coffee the most becasue it is delicious, and smells the best. This 12 pack of individual 2 oz. jars, is very convient in price for coffee, becasue most jars cost about $5.00 in price. Although I just wish they could've packaged bigger jars of the instant brand, rather than the small, tiny ones. I absolutely recommend Folger's coffee the most, and if you haven't tried their coffee, get this coffee, and smell the aroma yourself.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: A<br /><br />Overall: A-

review/summary: Excellent Food Ignore Bad Review
review/text: I started using this food after much research. My cat was diagnosed with stomach cancer. She needed a food that did not contain grains and was high in protein. It also had to be good for cats with sensitive stomachs. I also had a cat with diabetes. She needed a no grain food. This food met the needs of both cats. They have both since passed away but I continue to use this food. My 7 month old cat loves it as well as my 2 ferals I take care of. Yes it is pricey but greatr for cats with health problems. Cats do not need wheat or gluten. They need protein. Cat food or dog food should have chicken or fish as the fist ingredient not chicken meal or some by product. Add some of this food to your existing food at first and slowly change them over.

review/summary: Great cat food!
review/text: My cats are picky.  They will not eat wet cat food if it's grilled, diced, or sliced.  It has to be the classic cat food "mush" and it can't contain tuna.  Luckily, they love Blue Buffalo chicken and turkey, as well as their salmon variety.  Great product!

review/summary: cats wont eat it
review/text: Not one of my 5 cats will touch this food which is supposed to contain good ingredients. I bought a case of this because of amazon reviews; I was looking for "healthy" food for my guys when Friskies was dissed a few times. My guys like chicken and turkey so I thought this would be met with wagging tails and slurpy eating...it was not.<br /><br />Most cat food can be left out for about 12 hours (so say several cat food guides). This one starts to STINK badly within a few hours. Can you blame the cats for not liking it??<br /><br />Unfortunately I cannot return it since I opened 3 different cans, thinking that perhaps just one or 2 were tainted. The cost to return would be high since it's a heavy case, so I'm stuck...will probably just chuck it...maybe my chickens will eat it, since they will eat icky things from the ground, like worms in dirt.<br /><br />I would NOT recommend this "stuff." I am out $34+ and not very happy about that!

review/summary: These are the BEST sour gummies!
review/text: I thought the five-flavor sour gummies(in the green bag) was fantastic. Then I tried the mix o reds, and now the red ones are all I want.  This is my addiction - they are SO good!  Perfectly sour, and perfectly juicy... perfectly addictive!  I'd buy them here, but this is a ridiculously high price for this candy.  The grocery store usually has them for $1.50 or $1.75 per pack, and occasionally, $1 per pack.  Now do the math on these (divide by 12, and...whatever!).

review/text: I make this product, not as a sauce, but as a seasoning for steak. I first add a little olive oil, then I add the Au Jus and end it with soy sauce (instead of salt or pepper as they dries and bitters your steak if left on too long during marination). Afterwards, I marinate in the fridge from 4 hours to overnight.  Then I pan sear + oven cook the steaks.  The result: the taste is just as good as any steak I've eaten at any of Bobby Flay's restaurants.  It's that good.

review/summary: My favorite Olive hands down.
review/text: So, at first glance, these just look like any other Olive stuffed with pimento. But they're not! Both the olives and the peppers used are unique varietals and they go together beautifully. I thought the "buttery" description was just ad copy when I first got them, but something about this olive variety really is more hearty and buttery than the typical martini olive. And the peppers use have a more vibrant, sweet character than pimento that really pops and complements the olive. They are easily my favorite olive, and furthermore the only brand I've tried that stands out among martini olives.<br /><br />The only problem with them is that I snack on them too much, so they never last. Even worse: the only local store that carries them always runs out of the pepper variety almost immediately, so they're never in stock. The citrus ones are tasty too but the flavors don't complement each other as well, so you really want these ones in particular.<br /><br />So let's put it this way: I'm on Amazon today because I'm willing to pay a $2.00 premium per jar to get these olives shipped to me, THAT's how good they are!

review/summary: WTF Reseller...
review/text: First:  You've got to be kidding me, $50.00 for one damn bottle?  This reseller has no business sense and believes in ripping their customer off.  I can't believe you would actually sell this and say it's pricy but try to back it up by saing it's rare.  IT's NOT RARE!  many local stores sell this in my area and at $1.50 a bottle.<br /><br />Now, this is a pretty good product, it's okay.  I love drinks in aluminum bottles, they just seem to carry more flavor over and contain their "crispness".  I have to admit though, it's still made with corn syrup and the small bottle doesn't justify spending that kind of money ($1.50) on this drink.  I'd rather spend the money on a 12oz glass bottle, mexico coke.  Mexico coke is made with real sugar and also tasts better.  3 stars for the product considering taste/value.<br /><br />0 stars for this worthless company gouging your wallet.

review/text: Don't let the previous negative reviews fool you. This peanut butter ROCKS! It's as peanutty as can be, making the texture slightly thicker and a bit stiff. Not a big deal, just take an extra 15 seconds to spread it. As far as fillers go, there aren't any, just (in order) roasted peanuts, ONLY 3 grams of sugar per 32 gram serving, with only 3.5 grams of saturated fat and only 6% sodium. The nutritional values are very high, including substantial levels of Niacin, Magnesium, Vitamin E, Iron and Calcium. Of course there will be a bit of naturally occurring oil, but it's minimal and does not need stirring like other Natural peanut butter. My daughters and I, sometimes eat it right off the spoon! If you enjoy baking peanut butter cookies, you'll never use any other brand of peanut butter. TRY IT!

review/text: I assumed that, like most natural peanut butters, this would contain peanuts and nothing else. Wrong! After tasting the first sugary bite, I checked the ingredients. Not only sugar, but salt and palm oil! One of the reasons I eat peanut butter is that the real kind has no cholesterol. Palm oil, on the other hand, is a tropical oil that is high in saturated fats. I'm very frugal and it takes alot to make me throw something out, but this stuff went in the trash. Unhealthy and unpleasantly sweet!

It had a thick layer of oil on top. Also, it didn't spread well at all, it rolled around on the bread and tore it up. I went back to Jif Natural. I'll sacrifice the extra 2g of carbs for peanut butter that is easy to spread, slightly better tasting, and really doesn't need stirring.

After reading the ingredients on the label: peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt I was skeptical but because of the low bargain price I decided to try it. Very disappointed. Oily taste, faint taste of peanuts. I always buy Maple Grove Farms at my local Pathmark or any brand with the magical ingredient of just peanuts, sometimes with some salt. I am frugal but the taste of 100% peanuts is worth the price and I don't think its any more expensive/or perhaps just a little more expensive than the poorer quality brands. Far superior to this disappointment.

review/summary: Salty - these are better with unsalted butter
review/text: I bought this cookie mix locally and have made it several times.  The first time I used regular salted butter and the cookies were too salty (I like salt, but this was too salty even for me or my family)... I've used all of Betty Crocker's cookie mixes and none of the others have ever been salty tasting.  So after that first time of making the white chip macadamia cookies, I've made sure to use unsalted butter (and of course I use a large egg as instructed on the package) and I add a packed tablespoon of brown sugar.  Everybody loves these cookies this way!  They are really good.  I used the medium size OXO cookie scoop, and bake on a parchment paper-line baking sheet at 350* for 11 minutes.<br /><br />I think I paid two or three dollars per package for this cookie mix locally.

review/summary: My loud mouth cat loves it.
review/text: My Cat is coming up on his 13th year and suddenly when we are home he never stops yowling. There is nothing wrong with him medically, he just began demanding an insane amount of attention (he already gets more attention than most children) and begs for food even when he is not hungry because he wants you to come in the kitchen and pay attention to him. So as much as I love incessant meowing while I am trying to read, type, talk or think.....<br /><br />Anywho we didn't want to reward the yowling with treats or feeding him at times other than his normal meals but ignoring the behavior as per the vet and other people instructed simply did not work. After months of his crying we chalked it up to old age and wound up just giving him treats and snacks of his wet food so we could have a phone conversation without the person on the other line thinking we were killing our animal. He mostly ignored the extra food and would gobble up the treats but we knew it wasn't a perma fix. So we tried the cat milk. He loves it. Laps it up like me at a $2 martini happy hour. It appears to have a soothing effect on him because he stops meowing for a while after he gets it. Plus we feed him premium food and he was still a little flaky. (I think due to the dry heat in our home) The cat milk seems to help with the flakiness and his coat seems smoother. I would definitely limit it to a small serving once a day, I gave him a leetle too much when I first got it and I paid for it the next day when I was scooping the box. Other than the one incident it actually seems to help his poop. cheers!

review/summary: Saved my cat's life
review/text: My cat kept getting sick and refusing to eat.  He would go anorexic and become lethargic I had to keep taking him to the vet.  The last time it was so bad that he was put on IV's for dehydration.  He also had a high fever and some other weird stuff going on.  I was really afraid he was not going to live very long (he was only about 4 years old).  After he was back home from the vets and feeling better, it started up again within a week.  He stopped eating and became lethargic.  My husband bought Whiskas Milk because we were trying to get him to at least drink something.  I was going to bottle feed him if I had to, but as soon as he sniffed the Whiskas Milk, he cleaned out the dish and he has not been sick since then and it has been about 2 years.  I give him a small amount several times a week or whenever he asks for it.  There must be some kind of nutrition in it that he needed that he was not getting.  If I forget to give it to him, he'll meow in a different tone so I know he wants it.  It's really a miracle, he went from being a very sick cat to very healthy.  I have not taken him to the vets since I started giving him the milk.  My other two cats who are healthy will not drink it at all, but that's okay, they don't need it.

It's 98% reduced, in lactose ... and contains malt and calcium (of course), for the health of the feline. Use this, and alternate with a helping of "regular" milk, in doses .. and you shouldn't be disappointed with the results.

review/text: My cat is seventeen and in the early stage of kidney failure. She barely eats anything, mainly justs sucks juice out of her canned food. She barely touches her dry food or treats. She was getting so bony and I worried about her. So I decided to try the whiskas cat milk and she loves it! She also put on weight and looks healthier. She likes it cold from the fridge, I keep it in an empty pb jar and use disposable paper bowls, because she begs for it all day. Yes, if you need some extra nutrition or hydration or just a tasty treat, I'd buy some whiskas cat milk. Dogs love it too!

review/summary: Try Cat-Sip Real Milk
review/text: I bought this one time when PetSmart was out of Cat-Sip Real Milk. My cats wouldn't even try it. They ran up to it excitedly, expecting it to be Cat-Sip. They each sniffed it, and literally turned their noses up! Then they just walked away. It didn't go to waste as my dogs were excited to have it. Passed the dog taste test, but that doesn't mean much. After reading the ingredients, I probably shouldn't have even fed it to my dogs. Full of random stuff: guar gum, corn syrup solids...just to name a couple. And it is completely watered down too. I'm going to stick with Cat-Sip, and I recommend you try that brand as well. Cat-Sip has only 3 ingredients; low fat milk, lactase enzyme (to help the cats break down the dairy as cats are naturally lactose intolerant), and taurine (an essential nutrient for cats). Also, Cat-Sip is usually a few cents cheaper than the Wiskas stuff!

review/summary: overpriced, full of fillers
review/text: After buying this once, I realized how full of junk it was, like hydrogenated oil, thickeners like guar gum, and corn syrup solids, plus stuff I can't spell, let alone pronounce.  So now I just buy lactaid milk and it works fine.<br /><br />I was hoping for something that had extra vitamins in it and maybe omega-3s, but no such luck. Whiskas missed an opportunity here.<br /><br />Update:  I've upgraded my kitten lactaid milk to include taurine from capsules (jarrow), and whey based amino acid digest, I think it's called Amino Gold or something, meant for sports people.  I also add a little bit of "miralax" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OZGG0K">Kirkland LaxaClear, 90 Daily Doses, Polyethylene Glycol 3350 (3 Pack), Compare to Miralax Active Ingredient</a> but only a little bit.  Of all these things, I add a tiny tiny bit.  My cats weigh about 10 lbs each, so figure 20 lbs of feeding, that's about 1/5 of a 100 lb teenager.  I also water it down about 1:3 parts water:lactaid.<br /><br />They LOVE it, beg for it.  Two cups of it is gone in a day.  Be prepared to clean the litterbox every night though.  But it's good for them to be hydrated.  I haven't decided how to get more Omega-3 into this yet.  Maybe add almond milk?  They seem to like almonds and are after me if I eat them.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VKIK0">Jarrow Formulas Taurine 1,000mg Capsules, 100-Count</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GJZV86">Ultimate Nutrition Amino Gold Capsules, 1000 mg, 250-Count Bottles</a><br /><br />They drink it between meals.<br />Did I mention cats like parmesan cheese?  I'm considering adding parmesan as a flavorant to make it even more irresistible.  They already get "chicken parm" every other day:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XQ6RNK">AvoDerm Natural Chicken Chunks Entree in Gravy Cat Food - 24 3-Ounce Cans</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H8R00M">Kraft 100% Real Parmesan Cheese - 24 oz. container</a>

review/summary: Better than "real" milk
review/text: As most cats can not digest the lactose in real milk this is a great substitute if you want to give your cat a milk like treat.  I have one cat who loves to play in the water dish but is not really found of drinking it.  As he eats a predominately dry diet this ensures he gets an adequate amount of fluids each day.  I also use this when giving liquid medicine.  It is easy to mix a liquid medicine into this and as all 3 of my cats like this product it is much easier to give meds this way than to fight with a cat that doesn't want a syringe in it's mouth.

review/summary: One of the many highlights of my kittens day!
review/text: My 7 month old kitten loves this milk! He actually begs for it every single day at the same exact time each day, sometimes more but I only give it to him once a day.  There are 3 to 4 servings in each little container and he really seems to like it. Even though cats have a love for milk,they are actually lactose intolerant, because they don't have the lactase enzyme(which I believe is present at birth). This milk is specially formulated, just like the milk for people who have lactose intolerance so it doesn't give them an upset stomach. This product is definitely worth trying!

Many of the stores in those shopping centers suffered so much damage, they still have not reopened.  One of those stores is the Kmart and the only place within an hour's drive that I can get Cat Milk.  They only get a tiny bit in the morning, but 2 of my 6 rescues beg for their milk when I'm having my morning cereal.  They often remind me that I haven't yet eaten my breakfast by sitting by their little milk bowls and crying. I was glad to be able to order it on line, and I'm sure so were Spooky and Leo!

review/summary: Save yoursefl some money and use lactaid
review/text: Most cats have a hard time digesting cows' milk, as much as they love it.  The problem is the lactose, and Whiskas Catmilk is a reduced lactose milk product with taurine and other vitamins added.<br /><br />Cats need taurine.  Most mammals can make their own, but cats can't.  They have to eat taurine.  However, powdered taurine is cheap, and you can find it right here on Amazon.  These little boxes of brown milk will cost you more per ounce than grass fed organic milk costs.  For me, it makes sense to keep them handy, because my geyser cat can keep this stuff down when no other food product will stay in her, and that keeps her out of a fatty liver crisis.  But if what you are trying to accomplish is as simple as giving your cat who eats normal food a treat?  Try having a carton of lactaid on hand.

review/summary: Smaller package, still 200mL
review/text: The picture on the product page still shows the older, rectangular packaging. What arrived was 24 of the new, smaller containers but they hold the same amount of Whiskas Cat Milk. I applaud Whiskas for reducing the packaging but, since I'm a bit slow, I ordered this based on the picture of the old rectangular boxes. My local store started carrying the new packs and I, without bothering to read the fine print, thought they were selling less product for the same price. I'm glad I did though because this was a great buy (of course I now have over a 6 month supply but the "Best By" date is beyond the 6 months).<br /><br />I started giving this to my little IBS kitty every day because she was on a course of medicine that, although it was supposed to be tuna flavored, she wouldn't take. I mixed it into the Cat Milk and she lapped it up. After we'd finished up the medicine, she still asked for her Cat Milk treat so now I give it to her while I dish out everyone's canned food. It's a perfect distraction 'cause she used to try to "help" and be in the way "testing" each bowl as I dished out the canned food. I guess you could say the Cat Milk is a bribe but either the medicine worked or the Cat Milk helped (or both) 'cause she's put back on the weight she'd lost during her last Irritable Bowl bout (and when my vet weighed her he said keep on doing whatever it is you're doing).

review/text: The charming picture on the box was reminiscent of the more special momments in your childhood. Unfortunately, the crude sludge contained within was not as enjoyable. With an odor which served only to offend my delicate nasal passages, slightly akin to that of burning vaseline. The taste was generally harsh, and burned my palate. A taste which one could only relate to stale nachos and burning pig ovaries. The texture could only be comparable to liquified chalk, with a hint of sand. An after taste of goat rectum and pepto bismal lingered in my throat, only going away with copious amounts of whiskey. I denounce this drink. Avoid.<br /><br /> -My cat on the other hand loves the stuff.

review/text: Now I don't consider myself a genoa salami expert, nor do I really know what separates genoa salami from any other kind of salami, but I do eat a lot of cured meats and love them. I have eaten everything from the cheap presliced salami in the grocery store sandwich supplies to boars head to high-end, "fresh" artisan products. This is the worst thing I have tasted. Slim jims are better than this. It smells exactly like canned dog food and tastes exactly how I would expect canned dog food to taste, but saltier. Maybe this is what genoa salami is really supposed to taste like, but if you don't know exactly what your getting don't buy this.<br /><br />Update: I let it sit out of the plastic package and air out over night and it was actually decent. Nothing special but edible at least. It still had the dog food smell. I made three other guys at work eat it and the one who eats anything said he loved it (although he wouldn't give me $5 for the whole case). Another guy walked around with a sour look on his face for 3 hours and the third agreed with me that it was decent and would be OK with crackers and a sharp cheese, but was nothing special. Because of these experiences I have updated my review from 1 star to 3 stars.

review/summary: Great Little Snack !!
review/text: Like the previous reviewer I am not a Salami expert but I love all forms of Salami. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that it smells like dog food but the smell is not so pleasant but it's cured meat most don't smell too great and what can you expect from meat that has been aging in a cellar. I enjoy these little Salami chubs as a little snack to tide me over til Dinner or whatever. Flavor wise it can be a bit salty. My main gripe about this Salami Chub is the oily-ness that's on the outside. I usually dab or wipe the chub with a napkin before eating to remove some of the oily-ness. Overall it's a great snack to have on the go. It's perfect for a romantic picnic @ the park. A bottle of wine, some cheese, crackers, and fruit with this Salami chub can make a great park-side brunch. (n_n)

review/text: After buying this zucchini, banana and amaranth on the package, you would NOT expect that apple puree is the 1st ingredient on the menu.  How do they get away with not listing apple in the name of the product.  Variety is important so it would be nice to know if you are just buying another apple puree.

review/summary: Apple is first ingredient
review/text: I was really excited to see some organic baby foods with vegtables as the first ingredient, unlike so many others with fruit. Well, not really as apples are the main ingredient. So much so I could barely even smell, see, or taste evidence of zucchini. Most Plum Organics baby foods are like this unfortunatly. I'll never buy anything of theirs again.

review/summary: Another great flavor
review/text: My sons just loves these Plum Organics squeeze packs. I started giving them to him around 6 or 7 months and he's done great with them. He struggled with acid reflux for most of his first year and I found that having a grain included in the food seemed to help with that. He is now 1 and still eating these as a supplement to solid foods. This particular flavor we only use on occasion as banana seems to constipate him a bit.

review/summary: So easy, so yummy!
review/text: I'm not a big lobster fan, but I do make a few dishes using lobster base that my hubby loves. I decided to experiment with this base and I made a lobster cream sauce that was to die for! Hubby loved it and requested it the next night for dinner too.<br /><br />Now me... not being the lobster fan, I usually turn up my nose but this was yummy. Very smooth and not overpowering... super simple to measure get the right amount. It's yet to get nasty inside the jar.
