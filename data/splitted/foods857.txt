review/summary: My cat only eats this now- Great quality
review/text: We used to buy cat food from grocery stores - but the top and most expensive ones. Then I found bumps and rashes on our cat's forehead and for a while we couldn't figure out why. Then we tried to switch his food to Royal Canin. It took more than half year to see his forehead back to normal, but it worked very well. Royal Canin cat food ingredients are good quality and no other suspecious add-ons. Our cat now only eats this and it is favorite, the bumps and rashes haven't come back so we are all happy.

review/summary: Not actually made in America
review/text: The good: SUPER fast shipping!<br /><br />The not so good: With all the problems with pets becoming ill from ingesting non-American made rawhide products, I wanted to be certain this rawhide was made in America, for the health of my pets.<br /><br />The FRONT of the package has a big seal that states "American Raised Beefhide"...however, on the back, it clearly states "Made in Mexico". I am concerned about quality control, but feel pretty safe with the Hagen brand name on it. So far my dogs seem ok after eating it.

review/text: As an inveterate flavored coffee drinker, I have tried many different egg nog flavored coffees.  I enjoyed this coffee, but I did not think it tasted much like egg nog. Pleasant, but vague is my best description of it. I think it may have lacked a rum flavor, so it seemed pretty bland. I would not say not to buy it, but I cannot heartily endorse it, either. Maybe I will give it a year and try again.

review/summary: Can food is a 5-star, packaging was a two-star !!
review/text: After I opened the big main box, could smell a rotten food smell. Removed pouch stuffer wrap, removed two affresh pouches. Reached for cat-charmer toy, the outside bag felt damp, slick/slimy. The two boxes of can cat food were packaged together, wrapped tightly with seal plastic. As I reached set out, a rotten food smell became worse. Cut off plastic wrap and a corner of this can box was wet and slimy. Opening the 12 pack, sickening smell! 12 cans into sink to wash off. One can CHICKEN, in a box, the metal top was open, pushed into the can, and where wet, damp, stinky, rotten smell came from - Tossed the one can not usable! After rinsing, reached 2nd box - also damp, wash cans also search for another broken can. Because 2-12 packs sealed wrap, this metal can was surely open BEFORE placed into box for shipping, made packaging wet, damp, sticky and rotten smelling! Not worth returning for one damaged can, but if any more would have sent the stink and all, lol ... will think twice before ordering again by mail.

review/summary: A BIT WORRIED
review/text: I was a bit worried when I bought this three variety pack of nine loves food for my cats. I have four cats who live indoors and they have been spoiled with pricey wet food for a year: Newmans, Tiki, Fancy Feast and Pro Plan for starters.<br /><br />As I began to go over my food budget I noted that the kittyies were eating veal and shrimp and I was dining on peanut butter and jelly. SO I decided to give this nine lives a try. My four indoor cats generally are fed six of the 3 oz cans of various cat foods at 5:00. They cannot be too hungry, because they have been looking askance at the likes of Chicken Tuscany and Turkey Primavera. I though I might look for more expensive foods to nudge their taste buds back into line, but after a financial check, I decided to find a less expensive brand which was tasty and met their high requirements for eating fare.<br /><br />This Nine Lives have done the trick. The pieces of meet are actually cut into small chunkis that look quite delectable. The Turky, beef and chicken have all been enjoyed, though I DO get a questioning look from time to time.I also found the following food in 5.5 oz cans and they really lap THIS up<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HUW182">Prairie Homestyle Chicken & Tuna Stew Canned Cat Food by Nature's Variety, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. So I have determined that my finicky creatures can be fooled by a delicous type of food generally sold in the less expensive 5.5 ounce cans.<br /><br />Gabriella, Triity, Wisdom and Mercy request that you give this to your kitty kids and feel that they will also be happy with it. When my ktties are happy, I am happy. So I also suggest this "big time." It is much cheaper than the little cans and stretches the grocrry budget quite nicely. I wish you the best on fining foods for the kitties! Amazon DOES make it easy!

review/summary: Decadent!
review/text: Stunning flavor! Accurate to the core on how almond tastes only in a sweeter version! Close to amaretto but there is a difference and I do love both! I am glad I got both as well because I contemplated if they would be too similar and not worth the cost of both however as much as I love both flavors, I had to do it and I have no regrets!<br /><br />This Almond matcha is sweet and nutty. The aroma is captivating!! My daughter was in the process of making macrons and decided she will add some almond matcha to them. Unfortunately we had to stop because we were out of parchment paper - can't use waxed .... so anyway off to the store we shall run and I am going to pick up more sparkling water because I want to make an Italian Creme Soda with this almond matcha which will be AMAZING! Frothed up lovely even in milk.<br /><br />I love that Red Leaf uses natural flavors!

review/summary: Like Liquid Marzipan
review/text: The prepared matcha is probably one of the best-smelling prepared matchas I've come across. The almond-extract aroma is mitigated and it now smells actually nuttier, sweeter, more like marzipan or an almond paste cookie. First sip... wow, yum. This is so almondy and sweet on its own (I haven't added any sugar), it's like eating an almond cookie, or a big hunk of marzipan. You can still taste the matcha, though, and it's a flavor that goes well with the almond. I do think. Ok, I couldn't resist adding just a touch of sugar (half teaspoon), and holy crap, is this like almondy matcha candy. It makes me think that this would be a good addition to a sugar cookie as opposed to almond extract to make a matcha almond cookie. This has been my favorite matcha so far, and I will definitely be back for more when I run out.

review/text: I tried these yesterday and liked them so much Im forking over the big bucks to buy a whole case.

review/summary: So healthy and good for you, pumpkin is a great flavor!
review/text: Of all the "raw" bars I've tried this one is the most completely raw.  No cooking just drying under 105 degrees and everything is sprouted.  You can get a sample of 5 flavors under "specials" on the website although with a very hefty shipping price but much cheaper than buying an entire box, especially of a single flavor.<br /><br />I've tried 3 of 5 flavors and this is one of the best.  Big seeds, very chewy like fruit leather and no tummy problems after eating.  You can taste the goodness.  Those of you used to these bars tasting sweet and dessert like will not like this, it's very basic and tastes like pure health food.  The dates add the only sweetness.  It's incredibly expensive (the most expensive bar I've tried yet!) so I'm not sure I'd ever repurchase without a good deal on them or just stick with something more reasonable.  Worth trying, however, so get your samples on their site and figure which one is for you. :)

review/summary: The best prepared raw snack
review/text: I have eaten a number of prepared raw snacks, and this one is my favorite. It is much less sweet than any of the others, which I like. The primary ingredients are sprouted seeds, which are sweet and delicious enough for me alone, plus some date, agave and Celtic sea salt for enhancing the flavor. One bar lasts me a long time as I chew it slowly to savor all of the goodness.<br /><br />I am especially delighted that it is 100% certified organic. I am further delighted that the package includes a statement, "With our new solar production facility in development and our eventual transition towards biodegradable packaging, we are looking forward to becoming an entirely sustainable operation." I hope these projects proceed smoothly!

review/summary: Right Ingredients But Poor Texture
review/text: Go Raw Organic Live Pumpkin Bar has the right ingredients to become a great food bar. Organic ingredients checked, sprouted seeds checked, raw foods checked, gluten-wheat-and-nut-free checked.<br /><br />But unfortunately, it doesn't taste good, at least to me. It's hard, dry and difficult to chew. Yes, it fills your mouth with the flavors of pumpkin seeds, but the tough texture makes eating difficult and spoils the eating experience. With each bite, you've got to chew really hard and long. Even then, I'm not fully convinced that I've thoroughly broken the food down in my mouth.  Going healthy doesn't mean eating foods such as this. There are much better tasting healthy food products out there. For one, the company's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027YVUOM">Go Raw Pizza Flax Snax</a> tastes much more palatable and easier to stomach.

review/text: I have been buying this at our local health grocery store for more per bar until I found Amazon carried these and for a good price. They are so satisfying, crunchy, & just a touch of sweetness added. I appreciate the 9 grams of protein, only 5 grams of Agave Nectar for sweetener & low carbs. I'm pre-diabetic/Hypoglecemia, so I have to eat protein every few hours and carry one w/me when I'm out and about. They are even more filling w/a glass of water. I hope more companies will start getting away from using cheap fillers and regular sugar in their bars and make quality products that are actually good for us & healthy to eat.

review/summary: Crunchy!  Tasty!  Nutritious!
review/text: For fun, I went to the nutrition store tonight and bought about 2 dozen different protein/nutritio bars. My daughter and I decided we would do a taste test of each one so that we could buy the ones we liked in bulk off Amazon. It was a rather expensive endeavour, especially since we threw out over half of them after the first bite.<br /><br />Well, as you might imagine, there were quite a few BLECH! bars - virtually inedible. There were maybe a handful of bars that we deemed 'edible if really hungry and there were no other healthy options', and then there were about 3 that were really really tasty.<br /><br />The Go Raw Live Pumpkin Bar is full of yummy crunchy nuttiness.  I loved the taste and texture of it, just bursting with pumpkin seed flavor and lightly sweetened.<br /><br />It has more calories than any other bar I tried - 276.  But it also comes with 14g of protein, 8g of fiber, and 18g of healthy fats.  It's the kind of bar that's going to leave you satisfied for a long time.  I will definitely get these again.

I have tried other raw bars, and while I appreciate the raw, healthy ingredients I am not a big fan of the soft, fig-newton texture.  This one surprised me, since it is mainly seeds and nuts it had a crunch to it, albeit still a little chewy, but I thought it was marvelous.  You can taste that it is good for you.  I will be traveling to Europe and will be purchasing a case of these to take along.  I am even going to try the banana bread one too (don't typically like banana bread products as they usually use some sort of "fake" banana flavors)

review/summary: If you like to eat cardboard - this is the product for you
review/text: My expectations for these bars were honestly not very high. I expected a very healthy filling bar that would be a good meal replacement if I was short on time. The problem is, these bars have little to no flavor and the texture of cardboard. (Not that I have ever eaten cardboard, but I can imagine.) If they had a good flavor, or were salty or anything really I would give them a higher rating; as they are definitely filling & good for you. The only reason I even gave them 2 stars was due to the fact that they do not have a bad flavor.<br />Due to the texture, which is the main event of this bar, and the only thing you notice without any flavor, I could not even finish one bar. Really a shame, as I have  whole box of them. Maybe I can feed them to birds, as a very expensive treat.<br />Final notes, this is not a general comment against the GO RAW company, as I am a big fan of their spicy seed mix, salted sunflower seeds and chocolate granola. I will definitely try other products by this company, but I can guarantee you that I will not be purchasing any more bars, of any kind, from them. Truly a waste of money.

This is really a problem when you are having a boys party.  Now, I don't have enough to give out at the party because several are pink, so it was really a waste of money.  If you are having a party that includes girls or else boys that are so young that they don't mind pink, this is a good choice.  Otherwise, I recommend you skip it.

review/summary: Disappointed with this kit.
review/text: This is the first Aerogarden kit that I have not been pleased with. My two Cilantro pods did not sprout at all. I contacted Aerogarden and they said there is a known issue with the Cilantro and they are investigating ways to fix it. I would not recommend purchasing this kit until they work out the problem.<br /><br />The other herbs are growing just fine. The Epazote is growing like crazy- although I'm not sure what to cook with it.

review/summary: Gourmet Herb - mixed success - poor selection
review/text: My herbs initially grew far slower than the instruction book indicated. However, once they did get going - wow! I am having to clip every few days. I am using the classic aerogarden.<br /><br />There are a few disappointments, however. The choice to replace cilantro is really a disappointment, as it is an herb I use far more frequently than thyme. The basil is very overwhelming - two varieties are just too much. I can grow this one outside no problem, so I would have appreciated more delicate herbs. In any event, I feel like I am really wrangling with it to keep it from shadowing the others. The parsley has failed to grow very thickly, which gives me only a little every few weeks. The biggest disappointment are the chives. Only a few sprouted, maybe enough for 1 person every few weeks. Now that I think about it, the basil and mint are the only plants that have truly grown satisfactorily.  Honestly, I would hesitate to buy this particular kit again. Instead, I will stick with the cherry tomato kit for the winter and probably the salad greens in the summer.

review/summary: Romaine lettuce was easy to grow and has very large leaves now
review/text: I have enjoyed my Aero garden.  Everything, I have planted in it has done very well.  I never have to worry about pests that you normally get in an outside garden.  It involves a little maintenance but its worth the fresh edible food it provides!  The romaine lettuce I recently planted has flourished well is large and tastes great.  If you've never owned an Aero garden then I would say its worth owning.  Also, keep in mind that it's light is shines bright most hours of the day and part of the night so find a place in your house you wouldn't mind the bright light.  The garden, also provides a water trickling sound which is kind of zen.

review/summary: I must be doing something wrong
review/text: I love the idea of this product but I am definitely doing something wrong. I've tried 3 seed kits and I haven't had a terrific amount of luck. If all that you're interested in is basil, you have it made. Not much else seems to grow very well. My chives were a failure as were my purple basil, cilantro, and parsley. I called and complained to the company and they were kind enough to send to me another seed pack. The sweet basil flourished but everything else pretty much floundered.<br /><br />Truth be told, I would recommend growing your own basil, parsley, rosemary, cilantro, and chives during the warmer months. If you're fortunate enough to live in a large city, you can buy herbs from your grocery store for a relatively low price during the off seasons. I live in Houston and our Central Market sells organic herbs for $.99/bunch. I wrap my herbs in paper towels and bag them in plastic bags the day that I purchase them. They last for a few weeks. I definitely get my money's worth without having to spend a bundle on an Aerogarden. One caveat though, buy basil and use it within 3-4 days. It's great in salads too!

review/text: I am SO NOT happy about purchsing this item. It is NOT as described. What the description says is "Italian Basil, Purple Basil, Chives, Dill, Mint, Parsley & Thyme," what I got was Genovese Basil, Thyme, Mint, Lemon Basil, Oregano, Dill, Global Basil. I'm EXTREMELY angry that I did not get what I ordered. If they were going to make a substition, they should have asked. If automatic substitions are their policy, they should state that in the description. If the description is wrong, THEY SHOULD FIX IT. This item has been listed with this description for MONTHS before I purchased it. If I had wanted 3 kinds of basil, I would have purchased the basil mix. I expressly wanted the chives and the parsley. Buyer beware.

review/summary: Great Herbs, when you want them
review/text: Well, this is my fourth garden for my Pro-100, and so far I have more herbs than I can use.  The Basil always seems to do well, and this garden is no exception.  Tons of basil!<br /><br />The Cilantro has done better in this garden than it has ever done for me.  The parsley is growing nicely.  The only herb in this garden not doing so well is the chives, but to be honest I never use them anyway.<br /><br />Overall this is a great garden, if you are growing it, just keep pinching the tops of the basil off instead of raising the light, until all of the herbs catch up with the basil.  Otherwise you might have trouble with the mint and cilantro.<br /><br />Overall, this garden has been worth the money for me.  You can buy more herbs for the money at the store, but then again there is a convenience factor with these gardens.  You will always have some herbs available when you decide to cook a certain meal, without going to the store.

review/summary: Not quite as advertised
review/text: While my green bean garden hasn't yet made it to the blossoming stage, I'm somewhat disappointed with this kit for a couple of reasons, but mainly because the included accessories don't match the instruction booklet.  There are no holes in the seed pods to insert the support coil wires, which has resulted in about half of my bean plants falling over and breaking once they got more than about 6 inches high.  I've grown green beans indoors hydroponically by other methods, and the plants required lots of extra support.  I just don't see these plants reaching the harvest stage with the included equipment.  Also, one of the seeds failed to sprout - although the do give you a few extra, the one I replaced it with didn't sprout either, and by then there was no point in trying again as any further sprouts would be too far from the lights.

Every single seed has germinated and the plants look really healthy, they are starting to get flowers on them now, the only negative that we see is that we also use Cilantro in our salsa mix and if this had a Cilantro section that we could use would make it 10X better.

This way I can have them fresh all year even in the winter! This is great since I live in Ohio.<br />There is a good number of alternative kits at their website.I have purchased the Mexican herb kit also.<br />The original kit that came with the garden is growing very well and will be ready for harvest in a couple of weeks.<br />Very easy to set this up and care for.Mine is located in a dark corner of my dining room. It brightened up that room and easy accessed from the kitchen.<br />It does have an on time of 16 hours,but I have it set to go off at bedtime and it comes on early morning.<br />I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it highly for anyone who likes to grow their own herbs or lettuce etc...

review/summary: Tasteless, limp lettuce
review/text: I must say that my 3yr old and I have really enjoyed watching our Aerogarden grow.  It really is a lot of fun, and it's the first time that my 3yr old ate lettuce.  She has always refused to eat lettuce but I'm guessing  that actually planting it and watching it grow has encouraged her to try it.  So the garden is worth it from that point, but from a seasoned lettuce eater - yuck.  The lettuce is limp meaning there is nothing crisp about it at all.  It also has no taste.  I have tried a few different leaves from the garden and it doesn't taste like anything.  Maybe that's why my daughter likes to eat it.  My seeds are new so that's not the problem.  It's just tasteless and limp.

review/summary: tasty lettuce
review/text: My husband loves having salad greens so I thought he would be pleased when I bought this. However, at first glance he thought it wasn't going to produce enough lettuce for the huge salads he likes to eat and he said he wished I had bought herbs instead like we did last time. So far we've harvested twice and the taste of the lettuce has been lovely. The first harvest was small, enough to decorate the side of two plates. The second salad was much larger, enough for two American style side salad plates. The chef pack comes with enough pods to grow an Aerogarden full of lettuce twice. I pulled off some lettuce for a sandwich once, and that seems like a good use of this thing (concerning the volume issue).

review/text: I got my areogarden as a gift a little over a year ago and was ecstatic. I live about 12 hours away from my family so when I  go home for Christmas or any other trip that takes over a week of being away from my aerogarden it dies because I cant add the water.<br />  My aerogarden came with the general herb kit and I found out the only herb I used from it was basil, so when my first batch starved from a lack of water I decided to get the master gardener kit. Because of my obsession with basil i planted an entire 7 pods of basil. I couldn't trim it back fast enough, I wound up tossing handfulls of basil because it was burning on the lights.<br />  Once again I had to starve my poor plants and go home for about a month, this time i planted only 2 basils and 5 flowers about 2 or 3 weeks ago and low and behold the basil is more than big enough to eat. None of the flowers have bloomed yet, but all are growing nicely.<br />  Honestly I want to buy another areogarden just to be able to play around with another master gardener kit. Its a very good value as well, $40 for 3 full rounds of plants (obviously you need to buy your own seeds). I've also heard that the dirt refills for the seed starter kit works with the master gardener kit too. 70 pods for $20 plus nutrients will get you 10 full rounds on a 7 pod areogarden. I love it ! !<br /><br />ps.. I kill every plant I put in the garden.. i an the true black thumb.. so if i can do this anyone can

review/summary: Fresh Salad Greens
review/text: I started my salad pack approximately 3 weeks ago and have just started to harvest.  The kit includes 5 different kinds of greens.  I mixed it up so I have several of each kind. Everything is growing nicely except for the baby greens.  The one seed pod I planted hasn't grown as well the others.  The only thing that would make this better is to be able to grow the tomatoes and the greens together but according to the directions you're not supposed to do that.  Its so nice to have fresh salad greens in the middle of the winter!

review/text: I planted the first mixed set two weeks ago, and so far everything is coming up well except for the arugula which is kind of stunted. The salad greens, mesclun,and romaine are all doing great. I think that the arugula might still catch up. So far I would recommend the set.

review/summary: Happy with the herbs
review/text: We've been lucky with the herbs, so far. They grow well and we grow enough of them to have all the herbs we want, when we need them. We find it difficult to grow tomatoes and impossible to grow them in any significant quantities. Everything else is in-between. We never tried flowers but we might this coming summer because we have a real outdoors garden that produces everything we need during the summer months.<br /><br />So, go with the herbs, young or post-young woman or man :)<br /><br />The basils are fantastic and we got good oregano and arugula too.

review/summary: Overall AeroGrow
review/text: Purchased prod w/standard seed kit and regular basil was 2nd to sprout, but after 2 weeks it had a clear fungus...fury mold to all of it.  Out of remaining seeds in kit (my kit had cilantro which was replaced w/thyme)...thyme so far is producing the least.  Thyme was actually the 1st to sprout but is faltering in the long haul. The most aggresive growth is the mint.  Next it is neck & neck w/dill & chive.  I find myself cutting dill & chives to "clear the shade" in the hopes that the rest can catch up. I will say that I left a hydroponic tomatoe in the light of the machine...and in 2 weeks the fruit still looked fresh & the skin had visual bubbles or pimples in it.  When I opened the tomatoe nearly every seed had sprouted...yes SPROUTED within the tomatoe (so cool to see by the way - actual leaves inside a tomatoe!).  So I transplanted 4 seedlings into the empty basil "herb pod" and moved it to the back corner of the unit.  AeroGarden says the nutrients are different for herbs vs. vegetables...but if I can keep these sprots alive for another 4 weeks...I am in business with 4 REAL tomatoe plants.  No matter any results, it has been a blast watching the growth, especially the tomatoes which bursted as a seed inside a tomatoe that I had to cut out and now is an entitiy with leaves (and will soon need to be separated). And in the end I have a LOT of mint frozen for our summer Mojitos!!

However, when I ordered this International Basil seed kit, despite following the re-plant instructions to the letter, after about a month, I have just one basil sprout, approximately 3 cm above the label. The package says they're "guaranteed to grow" but says nothing about how to redeem that guarantee if they don't grow. Now I've spent over $20 on something that didn't even work. What a waste!

He still loves the outdoor activity of his garden (at 92) but is having a good time with this as well.  He shows his great granddaughters how it works, shows them when the plants start growing, has them help harvest, and makes tasty treats for them.  Now, how much more fun could you want?

review/text: Bought both the aerogarden, and master gardener deluxe kit, for my sister with the brown thumb. Fit and finish seem good, ease of use can't be faulted, and she's already got plants growing in a remarkably short time, which given her success at converting seeds into little blobs of mold is nothing short of miraculous. OTOH, a quick review of what goes into it, from the perspective of a mechanical engineer, suggests  that it's vastly overpriced. I do hope they'll be bringing the price down in months to come. There could be a huge market for it at a  more reasonable price.

review/summary: Looking Forward to the New Kits
review/text: I have to agree with previous reviewwers comments about the selection of herbs in this kit.  I would have preferred parsley, thyme and rosemary to some of the herbs in the kit.  Two types of basil is just overkill when there is a separate basil kit.<br /><br />With that said, the green basil grows really fast.  It was ready to harvest within three weeks.  The purple basil is the next best, followed by the mint and the oregano.<br /><br />The chives are the most delicate -- they dislodge and curl back into the sponge.  After more than a month of growing, I have two thin sporuts, not even enough for one potato.  My biggest disappointment was the cilantro --mine never sprouted.  I called the company and they shipped me a replacement, which also never sprouted.<br /><br />I can't wait for the new herb varieties to arrive in September.  I will be experimenting by mixing herbs from the various kits to get the combination I want.<br /><br />If you've ever tried to grow herbs indoors and not been happy with the results, this is the product for you.  It's very easy to take care of and the instructions are detailed and easy to understand.  It's unfortunate that some herbs work really well and others don't.<br /><br />Revised 10/13/06:  I spoke with someone in cusotmer service last week.  Aerogarden determined that the problem with the cilantro was that the water pump was too strong.  I was sent a free replacement pump.  When my new kits come in, I will try cilantro again.  The basil in this kit was wonderful.  The dill was fine and the oregano and mint were just okay in terms of growth and yield.  The chives were too delicate and the cilantro never worked.  Hopefully the new pump will fix the problem.<br /><br />The new kits will arrive next week.  The new Gourmet Herb kit replaces the oregano with parsley.<br /><br />Revised 11/21/06:<br />The cilantro in the new kit works beautifully!  I now give this kit four stars.

review/summary: Tasty herbs, but why these?
review/text: Well, this is the kit I tried first, and the back row of plants & center front are doing the best.  Both basils shoot right out of their pods.  The Dill and Cilantro are growing tall, and there is lots of mint, but it is tiny.  The chives are looped back into the sponge & have yet to try to stand up straight, and the Oregano is sprouting within the sponge, but has yet to come out of hiding.  And this is at the beginning of week 2.  I believe I could probably harvest a little basil at the end of week 3.<br /><br />The big question is, where is the Parsley?  People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano.  I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil.  I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil.  However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do.  Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks.<br /><br />This is an easy, low maintenence kit.  You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks.  It comes with 2 starter nutrients, 2 sprouting nutrients & 12 regular nutrient tablets  They ask you to place the pods in the order they came in the box.  Possibly because of slightly variable light levels.  The light is on 17 hours and it only waters when the light is on for this setting.<br /><br />Parsley will be part of both the Italian & French herb kits that will be available in September.

review/summary: Salsa Garden Seed Kit... More Work than the Herb Kit
review/text: I purchased the Aerogarden system and a few kits last year.  On Jan 1st 2009 I took out the remnants of the herb kit and planted the Salsa Garden kit.  This particular kit has several extra steps - plant selection, pruning, growth stabilization, and pollinating.  I will mention each in detail here to help others.  The herb gardens are the easiest - just cut off what you need as you go, once mastered you might find yourself wanting to try something else.  Salsa Garden and other kits like this - i.e. Chili Pepper, Cherry Tomato, Snow Peas, Green Beans, etc. - will require a few more steps.  These steps are the main changes for Salsa kit vs Herb kit.<br /><br />1. Plant Selection -  With the Salsa Garden, you must first make a selection of the plants themselves.  After several days of growth you will see the small sprouts.  There will most likely be more than one sprout in each pod - you must cut back to just one plant per pod.  There will be only 3 pods total in this kit - 1 pepper, 2 tomato.  There will be spacers to fill in the other pod slots, this will allow growth of these plants.  Plant selection is important, so make sure not to let those extra sprouts keep growing - doing so will eventually overrun your pod space.<br /><br />2. Pruning - This kit's instruction uses the 5th branch system.  Read that section carefully before your first pruning.  Then afterwards you will continue to prune throughout the life of the plant - to prevent growth to close to the lightbulbs and to trim wandering branches that are unable to reach the light.  Eventually those branches will die and you can cut them afterwards if you accidently forget to prune them earlier.  You will continually get dead leaves, especially near the base of the plant - do not fret, this will happen a lot as the outer edge of the plant gets more of the light.<br /><br />3. Growth Stabilization - This kit will eventually require a string or twine, etc.  After your plant grows big enough, the weight of the plant will eventually cause it to begin leaning over, especially after fruit / vegetables begin to appear.  Each plant will need a string to stabilize it to the light post at the back of the Aerogarden.  I personally used 3 nylon strings that I removed from a shopping mall bag's handle, similar to that of an athletic short's draw string.  You can also get twine or other thick strings, like yarn, from almost any hardware store, crafts store or supermarket.  Some other sets like Green Bean kits have their own support devices, but for the Salsa kit you must provide your own - so be prepared.<br /><br />4. Pollinating - This might be the easiest step... or possibly not.  As each plant begins to flower, pollination by bees or insects will not be likely.  As per the instructions, you must gently shake the plants to cause the pollen to move about and eventually end up on one of the other flowers.  Read this section carefully about how vigorously you should or should not shake the plants - in my oppinion, not very much if at all.  I tried this step and it worked fine for the tomatoes, but not the peppers.  After several waves of blooms appeared on the mini jalapeno plant still no amount of shaking worked.  Eventually I tried to shake a little harder, which didn't work and also caused many of the under leaves to fall off.  My advice - use a feather.  This isn't the most practical method, but it works.  When you see several blooms open at once, lightly brush the interior of the first flower - then the second, third, etc.  Do not forget to come back and brush the first flower again at the end of the cycle.  The pollen will stick to the feather then stick back onto a different flower - similar to the hairs on an insect's legs and body.  You may have trouble finding a feather - which I recommend using a very clean one at that.  DO NOT grab a feather from a your yard that came from a wild bird or from a farm animal.  You sure don't want lice or other problems in your house.  Try a crafts store or you can pull the feather out of a cheap household duster.<br /><br />My final opinion, the tomatoes grow easily and without much trouble except for the stabilization.  The peppers on the other hand stabilize well enough and keep themselves fairly self pruned at the base, but pollinating these bad boys can be a little bit of a trick at first.  Overall this was a fun kit and it produced all the way until the end, eventually I ran out of nutrients and decided to remove the plants.  If I hadn't, they'd be still going.  I got about 5 months of produce - which over time was a lot, but I only got 2 or 3 tomatoes at a time or 1 pepper at a time for lots of those weeks in between.  This was fun, but may not be for everyone.  If you mastered the herb kit, then this would be an interesting next step.  On the other hand if you had trouble with the herb kit, then you might want to pass on the Salsa Kit.

review/summary: Meh...
review/text: First of all let me state that I love my Aerogarden.  HOwever, there were some issues with the herb kit.  For one thing, I think it's sort of impossible to grow a reasonable amount of each herb in such a tiny space under fluorescent lighting.  IF I grew this again (which I won't) there are certainly some things I'd do differently.  The manual advised not to thin the plants when they sprouted--mistake #1, especially for the basil--one basil took off and shaded the others, which were never able to catch up.  My purple basil and chives grew pathetically.  In fact, the entire time I grew this kit the chives had maybe four sad little stems.  Flavor left a little to be desired as well, especially for the dill.  Barely three months after planting, my herb garden virtually self-destructed.  This I blame on the fact that the company advises you to just keep throwing nutrient tablets in every two weeks, never rinsing out the bowl to keep the salts from becoming too concentrated/imbalanced.  Flushing the system is just basic maintenance with hydroponics!  In my bigger hydroponic garden, I have lettuces that are still going strong after four+ months, so there's no reason this should've burnt itself out so soon.  I think it's a bit of a deception on the part of Aerogrow; properly maintaining the garden would extend it's life greatly and you wouldn't be coming back to buy a new seed kit so soon.  But I was willing to let my herb garden go so I could try the cherry tomatoes.  So far so good with that kit, they are just now getting ready to bloom and I have high hopes for what seem to be very healthy looking tomato plants.  Next time though, I'll probably just buy the master gardener's kit, which gives you everything you need for one year's growth, except seeds, for $40.00.  I have amassed quite the seed collection, so I really don't need any more overpriced seed kits.  Plus, isn't it a lot more fun to experiment on your own instead of following the instructions in a manual?  Like I said, I love my Aerogarden, but sometimes it's a little too "idiot proof."  EDIT:  Having grown the tomatoes to completion, I can't recommend that kit either.  I didn't get very many tomatoes.  The ones I got tasted pretty much just like grocery store cherry 'matoes, so okay, but this was more of a novelty than an actual productive tomato garden.  Also, even though I pruned the plants at 5 weeks to make them stronger, they were in need of support.  I tried to tie them to the lamp arm as suggested in the manual, but the angle is all wrong; it doesn't help at all!  One of my plants fell over and died anyway, still loaded with it's meager crop of 8-10 underripe tomatoes.  I think you need more vertical space, a stronger light source, and some sort of growing medium to give tomatoes the support they need.  That said, I STILL LOVE THE AEROGARDEN!  It's cool, and I'm not giving up on it yet.  I just know it's perfect for something, but I haven't found the right plant yet.

review/summary: Doesn't produce with 2 foot aerogarden
review/text: Don't buy the cherry tomato seed kit unless you own the newer, higher aerogarden!<br /><br />I own the "standard" Aerogarden.  This version has a maximum distance of about two feet from pods to lights.  I had previously had a great experience growing the herbs.  The tomatoes just needed a lot more headroom that my aerogarden provided.  My harvest was a meager eight (if great-tasting) cherry tomatoes.  I've noticed that since my experience, Aerogarden has introduced a new version with a four foot headroom.  I think the tomato seed kit should be clearly labelled as requiring the four foot version!<br /><br />Also, make certain to read the directions--you'll need to pollinate the tomato flowers by hand, which is a straightforward process that is clearly described.<br /><br />I'm now planting another round of herbs.

review/summary: Very good kit... practical... high production....
review/text: There is a lot of detailed information in some of the reviews below, so I won't repeat what they have to say.  However, my experience overall is excellent and while it's true different plants grow at different rates, the output of this thing is prolific.  I cut the herbs every few days and give away a lot.  It grows right back and the taste is delicious.  The lettuce from the lettuce kit is also very good and I have found the company to have excellent customer service, documentation on their products, etc.  While this unit isn't prefect, I can't imagine it being much better.  I am seriously considering getting a second one because I am so happy with the results.

review/text: Don't bother spending the money. Re-use the pods you already have. I've picked up Rapid Rooters and Dyna-Gro 7-9-5 plant food from a hydroponics store, and I've had no problems growing two batches of lettuce and herbs from my own seeds.

review/summary: Common sense
review/text: I have owned my Aerogarden since last Christmas. The first thing I planted were the herbs. The dill grew the best. The others did very well except the chives, which only sprouted about a dozen. Next, I planted the romaine, I had one that didn't sprout, but it grew for well over four months, and every time I pruned it, I extended the life a little longer. Now, I have the chili peppers, and they are huge!<br /><br />I have a very brown thumb, and was dubious as to whether I could make this work. It has far exceeded my expectations. A few things to note from the other reviews...... A good dose of common sense serves well here. Some seeds don't sprout. This is true in EVERY type of garden no matter what you do. While annoying, the yield is still so bountiful, that it is well worth the money. Growing the chili peppers, I now understand why you only get three tomato plants. This probably should have been the case for the peppers as well. The large plants are overshadowing the super hots, and the root systems are incredible. I have found that I need to add water every few days now since the plants have gotten so big they are drinking a lot more.<br /><br />Finally, one of the biggest keys I have found is diligent pruning. Every time I pruned my herbs, they got even fuller. The same is true of the romaine, and one of the most important things to remember with the peppers is shake the plants daily to pollenate them.<br /><br />For those who expect this product to "work perfectly" and require no effort whatsoever, you may be a bit disappointed. With a little effort, and some good old fashioned TLC this system works beyond my greatest expectations. When I think of how much money I have spent on fresh herbs through the years, even a plant that doesn't sprout now and then is tolerable when the yield of all the others is so good.<br /><br />I would recommend this system to anyone. I am very very pleased!

review/summary: Not the right plants for the AeroGarden!
review/text: Ok, I love the Aerogarden and it worked great with my last batch of herbs. But the tomatos grow very fast and even with tons of trimming, I can't seem to keep them away from the lights. But that is not the biggest problem. Since the roots are not attached to anything, the tomato plants fall over in all directions. You can TRY to follow the instructions to tie them up somehow but the reality with the garden is that it is not easy to do so. There is only the one hood support to use. So even using garden ties, velcro, etc, the plants are always flopping around. If Aerogrow is reading this - I have a suggestion for you: Use the four "unused" holes in the tray to hold some sort of support towers for plants that get that big or need to climb. There could be some sort of snap in cone or something to help hold plants up.

review/summary: Looks like 70% of Cherry Tomato Reviews are NEGATIVE
review/text: I am working on my second Cherry Tomato seed kit. After about three months, the first crop provided about eight Cherry tomatoes. Hardly a bumper crop. During the growth I had to clean out the pump which got clogged with roots (more on that latter). So I figured, ok, I had to disturb the root system when I had to clean out the pump, so perhaps that was the problem.<br /><br />I started a second crop of Cherry Tomatoes about three months ago. So far, I have had one marble sized yellow tomato. I also have an additional two, marble sized, yellow tomatoes ripening. I have not even seen any flowers on the two red tomato plants. The red tomato plants grow, but no tomato production.<br /><br />I am running out of plant nutrients. I checked AeroGrows site, and they want a ridiculous price for an additional package of plant nutrients. Corporate greed at its worse.<br /><br />I have read all of the reviews, and I see that about one-third of the Cherry tomato reviews are positive. That leaves two-thirds of Cherry Tomato reviews as negative. Adding my negative Cherry Tomato review drops the positive Cherry tomato reviews to 30% positive, 70% negative.<br /><br />Given that we are all growing these things under pretty well controlled conditions, I suggest that the Cherry tomato seed kits might have a limited shelf life, and AeroGrow could be selling their old kits.<br /><br />My negative review of AeroGrow's cherry Tomato seed kit on their site was NOT PUBLISHED. So I published my review on Amazon.<br /><br />With respect to the AeroGrow garden, in my opinion, the location of the pump is flawed. It should not be located at the bottom of the tank because that is where the roots want to go. The pump should be located higher up on the tank, and it should be located in a position where it can be easily maintained, without damaging your crops. I hope someone else comes out with a competitive product. Frankly, I don't like the way AeroGrow does business.

review/summary: The herbs were great...but the cherry tomatoes...not so great
review/text: The herb kit that came with my Aerogarden was superb and I enjoyed caring for my little garden. Once it was time to replace it, I purchased the cherry tomato seed kit. These also grew rapidly, but one day I noticed that they had completely fallen over...how would I stake these on an Aerogarden? And yes, the lights were as close to the plants as possible. I kind of leaned them against each other to keep them upright. But they still fell over several times. So they grew and grew but I never got any tomatoes. :( I also did follow the directions to ensure that they had complete darkness for proper flowering. Fortunately we have several tomato and cherry tomato plants in our outdoor vegetable garden. Unfortunately, I spent $20 on 3 cherry tomato Aerogarden plants and got zero yield.
