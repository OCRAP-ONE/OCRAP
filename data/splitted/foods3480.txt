review/summary: Oily, much!
review/text: The 'regular' version of this biltong is mild all around. It's mild on flavor, not much coriander, salt, or vinegar taste. The texture is nice, typical biltong. The taste though is extremely oily, and extremely mild. If you like the taste of fat or oil, you're in luck. If you're looking for a strong biltong taste or healthy protein snack I'd look elsewhere.

review/summary: Use with caution
review/text: We were eager to try this product, in a household with one diabetic and more than one person trying to lose weight.<br /><br />This product is intended to take the place of pasta or rice (depending on how it is cut) and is really a pretty decent substitute. Some people are put off by the appearance or odor when the package is opened, but you'll find after you rinse with water that there is really no odor and it is perfectly bland. It derives its taste and smell from whatever you add to it. In texture, it's more chewy than pasta, a bit hard to bite through and easy to choke on. Again, this can be overcome by choosing a kind that's been pre-cut into small pieces. As a substitute for pasta, you may not do any better than this.<br /><br />And now I must come to the reason I titled this review "use with caution." With one exception, everyone in my household liked this product but had severe stomach cramps within a couple hours of eating it. We're pretty hearty and not inclined to have easily upset tummies or food allergies. We liked this product and wanted to use it so we gave it several tries, but with the same result each time - severe stomach cramps within a short time after eating. We eat other foods that have a high fiber content with no difficulty.<br /><br />So - I wouldn't suggest avoiding this product, because many people eat it without a problem. I do recommend that you try it with caution and don't order a lot of it until you know that you're able to tolerate it.

review/summary: Give it a try... you might like it :)
review/text: Konjac (often also called shirataki) noodles are fairly new to the American market, so don't be turned off by negative reviews, learn about this product, try several different varieties, maybe several different brands, try to cook it with different meats and veggies, and I believe most of you will like this product.<br />DO NOT expect it to taste like regular (made out of flour) pasta because it won't. These noodles are made from yam root plus fiber. Konjac noodles have no taste and will absorb any flavor you introduce into the dish. They tend to be kind of "rubbery", so if you're offended by that, try tofu shirataki noodles (these are original konjac noodles with added tofu). They are softer than original konjac noodles. They also look white which makes them look more like regular pasta. Try both kinds and then make up your mind.<br />Both kinds come water packed and both have to be rinsed THOROUGHLY before use. I, personally, prefer original konjac noodles because (to me) tofu shirataki noodles have a fishy kind of odor, it takes longer to rinse it out of them and the smell still lingers sometimes (or maybe my nose is too sensitive). Konjac noodles can be stored at room temperature and shirataki tofu noodles need to be refrigerated.<br /><br />In any case, check out the many sites dedicated to this great product and I am sure you'll find a recipe or two to your liking. This product is as close as you'll get to zero calorie food. That said, let me give you one more friendly advice:<br />this type of food is NOT nutritious, so make sure you are taking your vitamins and/or get the necessary nutrients from other foods. This product would definitely be beneficial to people looking for a low glycemic impact food.<br />Here's just one of the sites you may want to check out:<br />[...]

review/text: I ordered this for a Anniversary dinner that was Italian cafe style and these were going to be gifts for each couple. They weren't at all what was pictured or advertised to be.....there were NO colorful herb inside ( as pictured) and NO red seal...the whole thing came in a plain clear glass bottle with nothing special in it or on it. Pretty deceitful on the advertisement!! I can only hope that the flavor in the bottle will be oregano flavored as described. This cost me with shipping almost $30.00, not much of a discount there for what I received, pretty disappointed!

review/summary: Perfectly Balanced For My Palate
review/text: I found these cookies to be surprisingly delicious and decadent.  They absolutely fooled my taste buds in to thinking I was eating traditional butter shortbread.  Yes, they are slightly less dense and a little more crumbly, but I found that to be a bonus.  Traditional shortbread is kind of a gut bomb if you have more than a couple bites.  And that would be my one caution with these--it's quite easy to eat more than one or two.  Prop the nutritional information up against your cuppa tea to remind you that it may be wheat and gluten free, but it is NOT without calories....<br /><br />I think these cookies are a find and I will definitely buy more Pamela's Products. I also appreciate the company's history and dedication to gluten-free.  This isn't some corporate giant getting on the gluten free band wagon in order to take advantage of America's latest foodie focus.

They are really good when you add your own mushrooms, edemame beans and Morning Star chicken like strips to it. Lot of soup for the price if you know where to shop.

review/summary: Full of veggies, low-calorie, delicious, easy to prepare
review/text: I have been searching for the perfect instant noodle to eat as an easy, low-calorie meal at work, and I think I may have found it!  First of all, I love harusame (bean-thread/glass/crystal) noodles.  In my opinion they are tastier than standard ramen noodles, plus they are SO much healthier!  Now, my personal tastes aside, I am very impressed with this brand of instant noodles because the package of dehydrated ingredients is so large and FULL of good things.  In this "Vegetable and Eggs" bowl, after you put the water in, the top of the bowl is literally covered by baby bok choy and eggs.  I really feel like I'm getting a full serving of vegetables when I'm eating this.  And the baby bok choy is bright green and delicious even though it has been dehydrated.  IMPRESSIVE!!!  Some other reviewers have complained about these instant noodles being expensive, but when you think about what you get, this bowl of noodles is totally worth its price.

review/summary: Great noodle bowls!
review/text: After finding these fantastic noodles at Big Lots for a whopping 60 cents, I fell in love with them.  Originally, I purchased the mushroom flavor.  Those were the best.  However, when I went back to buy some more, they only had the veggie flavor.  After reading the ingredients, I found that by adding a generous helping of black pepper, the broth for the veggie was just as good as the mushroom variey.<br />Only drawback is that they are hard to find.  Amazon carries them, but at a much higher cost.  After writing the manufacturer, I was told that Amazon is the cheapest.  Since I bought out the local Big Lots, I'm limiting myself as to how many I can indulge in.  Too bad they are so expensive!

review/summary: Great product for emergency baby/toddler meal. Beware of quantity!!!
review/text: These taste great and are an easy meal or snack when you are out and about and need a healthy quick fix for your kiddo. The grains add a bit of heft and longevity in the tummy that the fruit only variety offer so it will satisfy your tots hunger for a good amount of time.<br /><br />We went through a phase for a few weeks were DD was not napping, falling asleep at 5:00 PM for the night but waking up crying because of night terrors and hunger at 11:00 PM. She'd be tired, grumpy and in no mind to go to the table and eat a meal.  It was hard to get her to eat something since she was so upset.  I tried the pouch meals and it worked so much better than trying to spoon yogurt into her mouth.  I would comfort her on my lap in a rocking chair and feed her one of these. She calmed down so much quicker as she slurped it up and was able to fall asleep and sleep until morning. YAY!<br /><br />These are also easy to toss in the diaper bag.  No glass jar to break if it gets dropped or kicked which is a great relief since I used to keep Earths Best jars wrapped in a ziplock in my bag before these pouches and was a little worried that one day one would break. I have not had a pouch explode on me, but I still pop it in a ziplock just to be safe.<br /><br />I ordered one pack of these, shipping weight listed as over 3 pounds, so for the price it was for a 12 pack.  I got one single pouch, not one 12 pack as described so beware of that! Amazon made it right, but not getting what I ordered was frustrating.  Very good product though.

review/summary: Great Alternative to Oreos and Other Sandwich Cookies
review/text: I thought these cookies were a bit pricey, but with Subscribe and Save, the price is comparable to other organic sweets on the market. Luckily for me, the taste was NOT like other organic sweets on the market, and that is a good thing. While other organic cookies can be very dry and crumble after a single bite, the Late July cookies have a creamy filling that isn't greasy like Oreos. The outer cookie has a good crunch and texture that holds up well and doesn't crumble. There is no such thing as a healthy cookie, but if you get an occasional sweet tooth, these cookies are a great way to satiate that tooth without completely blowing your diet, and are organic to boot.<br /><br />There is no taste, smell or look of green tea in these cookies, you would never know they had green tea if it wasn't for the label. That is also a good thing, and knowing that you can get some of the great benefits of ECGC without a strong tea taste is a nice added bonus to these treats.<br /><br />These cookies are now my official sweet treat splurge that, in moderation, won't blow my food routine.

review/text: These (the Dark Chocolate flavor) are really delicious. I have no desire to ever eat an Oreo again - these are much better. The chocolate taste is fresh and full-flavored without that chemical taste that you find in supermarket cookies. My whole family loves these cookies, too. I get extra hugs from the kids when I pack a couple of these in their lunchboxes.<br /><br />I do think I should warn people that the box is not kidding about these being "intense and decadent." If you like intense dark chocolate in the cookie *and* the filling, there's an excellent chance you'll love these. But if you  prefer a milder milk chocolate flavor, you may wish to look elsewhere. But for a dark chocolate lover like me, these are really awesome.

These are so much better there's really no comparison. I saw these in a store and the box caught my eye. When I saw the ingredient list it looked like something I would like with unusually high quality and healthy ingredients. I thought they were pricey but I thought I'd give them a try. Now they are one of my main foods I ALWAYS keep in stock. I highly recommend these. They are not too sweet but definitely sweet enough. I could easily eat an entire box in one day but usually struggle to keep it down to about half a box a day. Yes they are very addicting!! If you like chocolate I don't see how you wouldn't like these. These are really good!

review/summary: They changed the recipe. Thye're not as good now.
review/text: Late July recently changed the recipe for their Dark Chocolate Sandwich Cookies without any direct notification on the packaging. They disappeared from the shelves in the Denver area and when they reappeared, they were different. The new recipe isn't nearly as good. There's less of the intense cocoa taste that we enjoyed. They're drier. The cookie is more like a dry, less tasty cracker now. Sure they're marginally healthier - a bit less fat, more whole grain and fiber, less sugar. That's fine, but the taste of the cookie has been compromised such that they're just less tasty, empty calories now at 50 calories a pop. We originally switched from Newman's chocolate creme filled chocolate sandwich cookies to Late July's because they were so much better. Now they're not as good. We live pretty far from the Denver area so we stock up occasionally. Since there was no obvious notification of the recipe change on the packaging, I bought our usual supply for a couple of months. Mistake! I'll be donating several boxes to the local food pantry. Hopefully, someone will enjoy them!

review/text: I used to love these cookies, but now they changed the recipe and they taste bland and uninspired. These used to have that certain something. Tasting these cookies for the first time was like finding a taste that was a beloved childhood experience rediscovered. Now they taste like every other mass produced chocolate cookie.<br /><br />When will companies understand that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Another disaster reminiscent of 'New Coke'.<br /><br />We used to seek these out in the grocery stores. Sometimes we'd make a special trip to a grocery store we knew stocked them, just so we could get our 'Late July Fix'. Sadly, I see no need to ever buy these again - unless they change the recipe back to the way it was. But how are we to know, and if they do change it back, can we trust them to keep it that way?

review/summary: Why did you change the recipe?  They are now awful!!!!!
review/text: I have been an avid fan of these cookies for years.  My family went through dozens of boxes a month for our use, taking to functions as our donation, giving as gifts.  They were a dark, rich, wholesome, deep taste experience.  In May, 2012, I couldn't find them on the shelf in any of our normal stores.  After a few weeks, they were back.  I took them home and opened them and was surprised to find that the inside container was different.  It used to be three rows that ran the short end of the box.  Now it was two rows that ran the long end of the box.  No big deal had that been all that changed.  I took a cookie out and popped it in my mouth expected the same dark, rich, wholesome experience, and the cookie tasted so bad I almost threw up.  It was sickly sweet.  It tasted like a combination between an oreo and a health food bar.  All they did was move to the middle ground where those who like health food bars won't like the oreo sweet taste and those who like oreos won't like the health food bar taste.  They are awful.  And, I'm so sad, because before they changed the formulation, these were the best cookies on the market.  I turned so many people on to them.  Now that they changed the recipe, none of us will ever be buying them again.  They are now the worst cookie I have ever tasted.

review/text: I always eat cookies in bunches... 2-3 large cookies, 20 small ones, though I am health focused. When it comes to cookies I can't help it. I tried a vanilla bean with green tea cookie today and stopped at one. It was so special, I didn't need more. The two chocolate biscuits are the perfect combination of cocoa and sweet, and so crunchy. The vanilla bean filling is soft. When you eat the cookie you get the feeling it was home made last night, cooled, you took them out of the jar. No after fullness or taste, that you get from non-organic, super market cookies. Until now I'd only buy the mini white chocolate cookies from Late July, now I'll be buying this one too. Perfect to serve with tea! Amazing product. Must buy!

For you health conscious folks out there who can't resist sandwich cookies try these. They are not overly sweet and taste great.

You cannot taste the green tea either. I put a case of these on my repeat shipping order for every six months. Well worth every penny and not all that artificial junk in them either.

review/text: These cookies were great with milk.  And it took less, only 3, to satisfy my sweet tooth or chocolate craving rather than the conventional name brand version's eight before stopping.

review/summary: Delicious...but buy the dark chocolate for portion control!!
review/text: I wrote a similar review for the dark chocolate.  I bought both flavors from amazon at the same time, and I still have 5 and a 1/2 boxes of the dark chocolate and only 2 boxes of the vanilla and green tea.  I think that says it all.  They are both very tasty, but the vanilla and green tea are just like oreo's to me...I want to eat them all like the cookie monster.  If you are concerned about portion control...go for the dark chocolate.  Less is more.

review/summary: Crisp, lovely filling--a delicious organic cookie!
review/text: I've had my share of iffy organic treats. Late July, however, has won me over with their consistently quality snack foods. I've tried the crackers (very nice crispiness and flakiness, even), and their cookies rock.<br /><br />I thought I'd stick with the decadent dark chocolate ones (which I love), but these are a nice change. Both are excellent organic cookies--meaning they are hardly all-out healthful, as they are after all a treat, a sweet, carb-filled product that isn't a natural fruit or veggie, etc. But when it's time for you to sit down with a glass of milk or you want a sweet yummy thing after a good meal, these are totally delicious.<br /><br />I do taste some different taste than in chocolate with vanilla cream cookies that I've had before--Hydrox, Oreo, etc--but unlike the really awful Newman's sandwich cookies, these are superior. Very crisp. Sweet. A clean aftertaste, almost fresh.<br /><br />The texture is very satisfying to the teeth, and it just seems to be a product that care is taken with.<br /><br />Thumbs up.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: Hate 'em--But my coworkers LOVE them!
review/text: I had high hopes for these cookies because I adore Oreos and I love other Late July products (my favorite is the mini-peanut butter crackers).  I was disappointed, however.  These cookies taste stale and greasy to me.  They are way less sweet and less flavorfull than Oreos.<br /><br />So I took them to work to get rid of them, and coworkers went wild.  They were gone quickly, and I know some of them plan to buy these regularly now.<br /><br />Each cookie has 55 calories, by the way.<br /><br />I recommend trying to find them at your local grocery store before buying them in bulk on Amazon.  Here in Minneosta, Cub Foods sells them in a 9 oz box for a few dollars.

review/summary: Hard to not eat the whole box!
review/text: These are the best tasting organic cookies we've tried so far!  The cookie has a nice dark chocolaty flavor and good crunch and the filling is creamy and tasty.  I must admit I was hesitant about the "green tea" aspect but you can't taste any tea in these cookies.  By far better than any Oreo in our opinion (not greasy like Oreos).  The worst problem with these cookies is putting the box down and not eating too many!  My 6-year-old's comment after purchasing one box in the grocery store?  "Mommy do they have them on Amazon so we can get a whole case?"  They ARE that good!

review/summary: Fabulous and Out of this World Delicious Cookies
review/text: OMG! The first bite I had I am hooked addicted to those cookies forever. If you eat Oreo then you have this cookie, I bet you'll buy this Late July product from now on. What a difference! I totally love the dark chocolate taste in my mouth. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, it's "rich" though. One pack is just right. I tried to eat 2 packs at one time, then it ended up too much for me. They were over-killing my taste buds. My 15 months toddler likes it too. But only for a little little piece, otherwise, it's too much. I am so happy that I try Late July's products. They are so GOOD!

review/summary: I love Late July products, but this one is dookie.
review/text: These dark chocolate cookies were dry and lacked any flavor. They were very close to cardboard. I payed regular price for them because they would never go on sale. I regret buying them; these were pretty bad and took me and my husband a couple weeks to finish the box. It was more of a chore really. We should have returned them to Sprouts where we bought them, but we were too embaressed to return a box of cookies.<br /><br />I had tried Late July's Green Tea sandwhich cookies and those tasted just like Oreos. They were awesome and that is why I expected these dark chocolate ones to be amazing. Oh well.

review/summary: I really wanted to like them
review/text: Considering I am a huge dark chocolate fan--and I don't mean the Hershey's dark chocolate. I typically like to eat chocolate with 65-70%  cocoa content, and was excited to see the dark chocolate cookies. I tried them and actually (sort-of) liked them at first. The taste was not sweet, but not bitter either. However, after eating a few of them, I had to admit to myself that they just weren't anything special. I tried to give them away at an office party and absolutely no one wanted to take them home after tasting one. I had essentially purchased a case of cookies that I couldn't give away. I typically don't ever leave reviews that are negative; if I don't like something, I just don't review it. However, I tried several other Late July products because I liked the company's stance on many (food-related) issues, and they all left me feeling that same Blah. While others may enjoy these cookies, I just can't recommend them. If you're looking for great-tasting, organic cookies, try Country Choice (also available on Amazon). They are vegan and delicious.

review/summary: Bad
review/text: I was attracted to this box of cookies because of the "brand". "Late July" sounds like a wonderful brand name, and late July does bring back wonderful memories for me: it sounds like a fish fry with homemade french-fried potatoes and cole slaw and hush puppies, an ice bucket, iced tea, a cool breeze blowing from the fan, a porch, and lots of love. That's what I thought of when I saw this brand. Also, it is natural and therefore, vegans can have this product.<br /><br />Vanilla bean with green tea:  The cookies didn't taste good. The flavor idea was pretty good. There was a hint of good flavor. Vanilla bean with green tea sounds wonderful. Possibly, the bad taste was due to all the soy and soy products used.  I managed to eat this whole box (of vanilla bean with green tea) without throwing any out.<br /><br />Dark chocolate:  Horrible.  I couldn't even finish the whole box; I had to throw out most of it.  (And I'm the queen of conservativeness.)  The "dark" chocolate was so dark and so horrible, that it was too much for even a chocolate lover.  The chocolate had a horrible taste.  Not to mention the horrible taste it left in your mouth.  (Possibly too much soy, and whatever was in that chocolate.)  I literally had to go and buy some lemons and ate two, and also some potato chips, just to get that taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />Never again.

review/text: I almost ALWAYS limit my reviews to just the product but to warn others from making my mistake; BE CAREFUL ABOUT ORDERING THIS ITEM!<br /><br />If you purchase from Amazon Warehouse (based on my experience), you end up with just ONE single pack of gum. The photo is of an entire box and the price is practically the amount of an entire box at what I paid for but you receive one single pack of gum in the most ridiculously un-eco-friendly large box. I mean, the box I received it in had more packaging and air bubbles than the actual gum and I could have fit my head in the box. Really ridiculous of Amazon.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />The actual gum? It taste fantastic. It has the gooey inside that sort of oozes out when you bite into it and has a refreshing taste to it, not at all weird. Very down to earth and the citrus flavors are subtle and not overbearing. It won't last long but is something good to chew and that's mainly what I use it for while I'm doing work so my mouth isn't idle and keeps me from wanting to munch on something unhealthy.

I also used to buy some from different packers like Twinnings among others but they became harder to find in stores in my area.<br /><br />I ordered this not only based on price but mainly based on the good reviews on this site. I must admit I was a bit disappointed. This tea isn't bad but *to my taste* it's not as good as the others I am used to. It's not as bold or as tangy and the smokey flavor is quite different from the others. It's hard to describe the difference but if you're used to some other Lapsang tea, you might one to try a smaller quantity of this one first.<br /><br />The description says it was smoked using oak while most lapsang use pinewood, maybe that's what causes the difference.<br /><br />Now I mix it half and half with regular black tea, it's not as strong or as bold as I would like but at least I get back some of the tarriness this tea is lacking.

review/text: Cee Cee kitty loves this and pretty much dives into the plate before I can finifh putting it down in front of her. I hear that the chunks of meat help scrape the tartar off cats' teeth -- whether this is true or not, I don't know. But anyway, this is a good addition to her diet and a variation from the usual "smooth" types of Fancy Feast that I also feed her. And of course, since it's wet (canned) cat food, it helps add fluids to her diet, other than what she drinks from her water bowl -- cats, being descended from desert kitties, take alot of their fluids from their "prey" - in this instance, their food -- so I make sure I feed my cats mostly canned (wet) food in addition to some dry, and of course, their bowls of fresh water.<br /><br />Cee Cee's been eating Fancy Feast for the past 7 years.
