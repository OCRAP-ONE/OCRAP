review/summary: Absolutely Delicious!
review/text: I switched over to a gluten-free lifestyle many months ago to alleviate some health problems, and it's been quite a challenge. My body feels healthier, more alive, and no more digestive issues- but buying gluten-free mixes and prepared items are really hit or miss. You could end up with something that tastes almost exactly like it's wheat flour equivalent, or you could end up with something rubbery or super grainy.<br /><br />I've been experimenting with making all my gluten-free items from scratch with my wide array of starches and flours, but I was suffering from a sweet craving and just did not feel like playing around with recipes to get something yummy. So, I bought this mix. I cannot believe how amazing it tastes! It tastes almost identical to regular chocolate chip cookies! It has a very *slight* grainy texture, but nothing worth complaining about. I love that they don't skimp out on the chocolate chips either! The chips are a bit harder, but It tastes the same as anything else. I'm not sure why another reviewer said they tastes rancid. He/she might have gotten a bad box?<br /><br />Very sweet, moist cookies. I recommend only eating one at a time due to the sugar content. Also, I find this easier to mix with your hands! It worked better than my electric hand beater.<br /><br />This contains soy, which might be an additional issue for people with food intolerance. The mix itself does not contain dairy, but the finished product will. I bet you can find a clever butter substitute that works with mixes like this,though!

review/summary: Modify...and Enjoy!
review/text: As with many gluten-free packaged items, they are adequate out of the box, but with a little modification, they can be great.  Here is what I have come to do after several different iterations. Add:<br />1. 1 tsp potato flour (not starch)<br />2. 1 Tbsp tapioca flour/starch<br />3. 1 Tbsp water<br /><br />You end up with cookie dough and cookies that are nearly identical to their gluten counter-parts and have a longer shelf-life without becoming so dry and crumbly. I often add another 1/2c or so of chips as well. I have a hard time keeping them in the house after I make them. Take 2 and put some frosting or ice cream between them and...you may have to make more. I hope that helps.  Enjoy.

review/summary: You have to really be in a pinch.
review/text: Good, but not good enough.  The people developing these either are producting for those that do not need to be Gfree the rest of their lives and obviously have never tasted Gfree foods.  Chocolate Chip Cookies should not have an aftertaste from the flour blend used.  Do yourself a favor and invest in the book Cooking for Isaiah (found on Amazon).  There is the most awesome recipe for your own Gfree All Purpose Flour and from there you can make the most awesome chocolate chip cookies of your life.  My non-gfree family members will eat down my gfree cookies before they will finish off a bag of Chips Ahoy.

review/summary: Helpful hint
review/text: These cookies are great right out of the oven but left to sit for more than a day or 2 they tend to get this sandy, crumbly texture.  The Betty Crocker brownies taste great and keep much better.  Might I also suggest that if you don't know how some of the gluten free products taste to begin with and to save money and probably waste, see if you can find it at your local store.  If you like it enough then buy it in the bulk that Amazon sells.  I have read a few reviews of customers who have purchased in bulk, don't like the item(s) and have been left with a product they don't want to use at all.  Buy one package (if possible and if it is available in your area) and then decide to buy more.  I hope that helps!  And donate the rest of the unwanted product to the food pantry etc.  Thanks!

review/summary: delicious cookies
review/text: I was so surprised that the cookies were as good as they are.  If you like crisp, crunchy cookies that taste great, these cookies are what you are looking for.  They stay nice and crunchy for several days.  I put them in a tupperware container and keep the container in the refrigerator and the cookies stay as fresh as the day they were baked.  I don't like chocolate chips and will sift them out next and add walnuts instead.  Great going Betty Crocker, it's nice for gluten sensitive people to be able to eat cookies again.

Everyone in his household loves them.  My one thing special that I do is use parchment paper. The cookies slide right off to the cooling rack, no sticking, and no mess.

review/summary: Good taste, crumbly texture
review/text: I am definitely going to buy these again.  The taste was on par for non-gluten boxed cookie mixes, if a bit crumbly in texture.  My very picky gluten eating kids loved the cookies and said they would eat them again.<br /><br />A couple of notes on making them.  First, I added about a 1/2 teaspoon extra of vanilla, about a 1/2 tsp of additional water.  The extra fluid made the cookie dough more pliable and allowed me to use my cookie scoop.  The vanilla flavor was excellent in the baked cookies.  I ended up with about 2 dozen cookies using my larger cookie scoop.  I made the 1st dozen using my silpat - and the cookies did NOT turn out at all. They were not cooked properly and they didn't brown up at the edges.  I made the 2nd dozen using parchment paper and they turned out great!  They spread nicely and browned up beautifully at the edges.  So, next time, no silpat - parchment paper only!

review/summary: Pretty Good For a Mix
review/text: If I was just judging these as gluten-free chocolate chip cookies I'd give them no more than 3 stars, but going against other mixes they are easy to make (even by children), and are relatively inexpensive, making them a 4 star product as long as people aren't comparing them to homemade.  They are slightly gritty from the rice flour and they don't hold together exceptionally well, plus they fall apart the next day.  But they do well when eaten partially frozen and actually make a decent cookie for a GF ice cream sandwich.  For slightly less spreading use Spectrum shortening instead of butter.

review/text: Thank you Betty Crocker.  These are by far the best GF cookies from a mix we have tried.  The taste is very similar to its wheat counterpart.  They are just a little bit crumbly, and the cookie dough isn't nearly as good as the end product. The convenience factor is great. This is a must for our pantry and once you try them, yours as well.

review/summary: A nice treat, but a bit sweet
review/text: I was so pleased that these cookies were good tasting and soft.  They were extremely crumbly, but stayed fresh in a plastic airtight container for a week (yes, they lasted that long because my kids didn't love them).  As an adult, I found them to be a bit too sweet.  If I were baking from scratch (as I always did before I went GF), I would have given them a bit more complexity with brown sugar and less sweetener overall.

review/summary: Tasty Mix
review/text: Though I have no issue with gluten, I do have a dairy allergy. The mix had no dairy and it has more natural ingredients than many commercial mixes.  I had good results w/minor modifications to substitute butter  I used 1 egg, 1/2 cup of vanilla soy yogurt instead of butter, a couple tablespoons of extra flour (to compensate from the extra moisture of the yogurt), and a bit of vanilla.  They came out puffy, light, and very tasty.  Not chewy or dense like some cookies, but still good.  The mix has a pretty generous portion of chocolate chips too.

review/text: I had initially given this a so so rating. I have since found out the secret to making good cookies from this mix. It take 2 EGGS - not ONE.<br />I had noticed that most of my gluten free recipes called for 2 eggs.<br /><br />If you add the extra egg, they are delicious and do not crumble so easy. They taste very much like the Toll House cookies that come in the tub or roll.<br />So I am giving it a much higher rating - enjoy!

review/summary: Not a favorite
review/text: Rather stingy chocolate-chip to cookie ratio. 2 of my finished cookies had fewer than 3 chips in them. The texture is dry and crumbly, and the flavor is bland, thanks to rice flour. It could be that I'm still mourning my old chocolate chip cookies, which were dense and chewy, thanks to high-gluten (lol) flour. I just can't get into these, sadly. Things that help: (a) gently brown half the butter in a skillet, then add the rest of the butter to cool the browned butter, so it doesn't overcook; (b) vanilla.

review/summary: IF your Vegan like me, this may help...
review/text: I make GF cookies the vegan way, with apple sauce and baking powder in replace of the egg, and smart balance instead of butter. Now I have made this same vegan variation with King Arthur's brand. The Betty Crocker version has the similar crumbly grain texture as King Arthur, but King Arthur brand has a nice sweet taste along with spreading out in the oven, neither of which this brand does. I tried adding a tad bit of water and it does help to make a more "dough" texture, these still aren't as good as KA brand of flour.

review/text: I just made up a batch of these cookies and I think I'm going to throw them all out. I bought a box, only because it was on sale. I thought it would make a quick fix for when I crave a cookie (I'm gluten free) and I know now I should just spend the extra time making my own. I know you can have wonderful gluten free cookies, so something is wrong with the mix. It's horrible. The texture is bad, they are gritty, the taste isn't good and the dough is gross. That should be the first clue. The dough is nasty.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, don't waste your money. Make them from scratch, look and find for yourself a decent recipe and use asian rice powder.<br /><br />Yuck, yuck, yuck.

review/summary: Excellent with a slight modification
review/text: This is a fabulous mix. I made a slight modification and they turned out very moist and were not at all crumbly. I did 1/4cup vegan "butter" spread, 2 mashed bananas, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 egg, and 1 tsp vanilla. I baked them at 350 for about 12 minutes-14 minutes. They puffed up nicely, did not spread out into thin cookies. I did let the batter sit for about 20 minutes at room temp before baking. I modified a recipe I saw on the Betty Crocker site that used 3/4 cup pumpkin in place of the 2 mashed bananas. Adding the pumpkin or banana makes the dough much more like a traditional cookie dough, thick and sticky. This is a good base to give your own homemade flair. The cookies were not grainy like many other mixes I've tried. The recipe I used gave them a very nice texture. They did turn out slightly cake-like, so if you don't like your cookies like that, I would not recommend my version.

Yet when I ate them still slightly warm from the oven they didn't have such a problem.<br /><br />I am happy that I bought this mix to try out, and the kids are asking for these again for their lunches!

review/text: I found these initially at Target and even though they were over $5 a box, decided to try them.  Because when you're desperate for a chocolate chip cookie, you'll pay over $5 for a box, I discovered.  I'm also dairy and egg free so I substituted with egg substitute (flax and regular egg subs both work but the flax is a little heavier) and they worked well.  I also had to use Smart Balance butter subs or Earth Balance subs and those work well also.  I love these cookies and though I've been scouring my Targets and other stores for more of them, they're just not carrying them anymore.  Well, guess what??  Found them tonight on Amazon for waaaay cheaper...more like $3.50 a box, which is much more reasonable.  Try them, I promise you won't be disappointed!

review/text: Being that I have a son with celiac disease, I love having this mix available to buy.  They turn out better than my gluten free cookies made by scratch, they aren't painfully expensive and are easy to prepare.<br /><br />That being said, they are lacking something.  I'm not quite sure what it is.  They are a little gritty and taste slightly too sugary.  It might just be me though because my children (and hubby) LOVE these and I've never heard a single complaint from any of them.  Because I'm so grateful to have this product available, I don't feel right taking any stars away on my review.  My children and I would be extremely disappointed if this product were discontinued.  These are better than nearly all the other gluten free cookie mixes and definitely better than any GF boxed ones.

review/text: This cookie mix was very easy to use and the cookies came out fantastic! The recipe calls for the addition of one egg, one stick of butter and 1 t of vanilla. In addition, I added 4T of creamy peanut butter and some chopped peanuts. The dough held together nicely. I baked them on parchment paper and let them cool completely before moving them - as they are very fragile when they are hot. They were moist and perfectly sweet - very difficult to tell the difference between these and regular (wheat)cookies. I recommend this mix highly!!!

review/text: My Dad has celiac and I've tried a couple of chocolate chip cookie mixes before, but these are the best! He likes his chocolate chip cookies frozen-- don't ask me why, tho I agree that when they are frozen they are delicious! The first time I made these, I put white chocolate chips in as well and he fell in love. the white chocolate chips actually make the cookies more moist and adds alot to the flavor. I was going to make these again for Thanksgiving, but I couldn't find the betty crocker mix (or any chocolate chip cookie mix the was GF) anywhere in the Giant we went to down here in Maryland so later my Grandpa took me to Whole foods and we picked up a pack of Pamela's mix. Hopefully they are just as good! They will of course have the white chocolate chips in them as well! Need to hope that these mixes just keep getting better and better because I refuse to make GF cookies from scratch! WAYYYY TOO much work!!! (Although Macarons are totally on my list!!)

review/summary: Great cookies mix - even better with alteration to box recipe!
review/text: This is a very delicious GF chocolate chip cookie mix but I have found that I like it even better when I add an extra egg - it gives them more hold.<br /><br />Also tastes great if you add that extra egg PLUS add 1/2-3/4 cup peanut butter.<br /><br />I definitely recomment this product! I have it on Amazon auto-ship :)

review/text: I am grateful to Betty Crocker for producing several gluten free mixes!  The brownies rock too!!  Even if you dont have to eat gluten free like me, you will enjoy these cookies!!  I've made them for a ladies church event and for contractors working at my home.  No one could taste the difference, and they disappeared quickly!!!  These are easy to prepare too!  Suggest using parchment paper on the pan and to slightly underbake bya minute so they crisp up nicely onthe outside and remain chewy on the inside. Why not make yourself a scrumptious little treat today!  Happy gluten free baking!!!  :-)

review/text: Just started a GF diet a week ago and wanted to try this mix to assure myself cookies were still an option for me.  I was thrilled to see the mixes by Betty Crocker and immediately went in search of this.<br /><br />These turned out really well.  I followed 2 different reviewers' advice, one said to add a 2nd egg and another said to let the dough sit for a bit to let the flour soak up the moisture.  The cookies are delicious and moist, no crumbling the day after here.  The texture is slightly off but it really doesn't take away from the cookie at all.  Very very close to the wheat version.  Give it a try.

review/text: I never use cookie mixes for baking but a Celiac/GF diagnosis in the family made me look twice at a Boxed Mix.  Glad I did.  The are tasty and one can make adjustments, such as flavorings, add more chocolate chips, etc.  Make them "by the book" first so you know what the consistency is...baking GF is different and it takes some getting used to.  I hope that Betty Crocker continues to expand the line of Gluten Free.  This makes life sooooooooooooo much easier.  The cookies crisp up in a cookie jar, but if you like them soft, microwave briefly and they taste fresh out of the oven.  Best GF boxed mix I have tried for cookies so far.

Yes, the consistancy is a little different from wheat-based cookies, but rolling the dough between your palms into tight balls makes them hold together better after they're baked.  For people trying to live GF it's great to have this mix in your pantry when you feel the need for a treat.

review/summary: Exactly what I want from a chocolate chip cookie
review/text: I tried these yesterday for the first time, and I am thrilled with them! They are made in a dedicated facility and exactly what I want in a cookie - crispy around the edges, and chewy in the middle, and lots of chips. These, along with the other BC GF products, require that you add your own GF vanilla. I'm not sure if they left the vanilla out to keep costs down, or if it's because the mix needs just that little bit of liquid, or both. The advantage is that you could use any GF flavoring you wanted - banana, coconut, etc. I might try cutting some of the butter next time and replacing that with peanut butter and see how it goes.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, mine held up beautifully the next day after being sealed in an air tight container once they completely cooled.  I baked them on parchment, which may have made the difference. Held together nicely, still chewy in the middle and slightly crispy around the edges. Because it's just me, I only made a partial batch and refrigerated the rest of the dough. I'll update once I've baked some from that batch. If that works, I'll roll it out into a thin roll and freeze, then just slice off a few lumps so I can make a fresh cookie without the temptation of eating the whole pan!<br /><br />If you like a soft cakey cookie, this won't be your thing. If you want a classic "tollhouse" style crispy-chewy cookie - this is it! If you want a crispy cookie, try baking this for a little longer, possibly add some extra butter, and/or not using parchment. Great to have a real cookie fresh out of the oven!

review/text: I can bake almost anything I want to gluten-free with good results. I have made many GF cookie recipes from scratch and loved them. However, these are awesome!! If you bake them according to the package directions, they are perfect. Your butter (and use real butter) MUST be softened (and not melted!). They are really really good. They will stay soft and chewy or you can bake them longer for a more crisp cookie. And the convenience rocks! Grateful for these.

The cookies can be made so quickly and are great for unexpected company but mostly for me !  This is just one more product that my non-gluten free family enjoys with me.

review/text: While I agree that homemade chocolate chip cookies, gluten-free or not, are the best, this is my favorite gluten-free cookie mix so far. I do a lot of gluten-free baking, and I am completely satisfied with these cookies. They exceeded my expectations. My gluten-eating husband ate so many that he got a stomach ache.<br /><br />After making this mix twice, I do have three comments about making the cookies.<br /><br />*I added walnut pieces to the second batch (I love nuts in baked goods), and it made for a more fulfilling cookie.<br />*I doubled the vanilla, because I love vanilla. It worked well.<br />*Use completely softened butter--especially if your egg is straight out of the fridge. The first time the butter was only semi-soft and when I added the cold egg--the butter hardened too much to mix well with the egg. The second time I used butter that had been out of the fridge for about eight hours. Perfect cookies.

review/summary: Almost as good as mine
review/text: I don't buy a lot of GF mixes because I like to bake and just do my own GF recipes, but these were recommended by a friend.  I have to say they came out very tasty and my daughter who does not have to eat GF loved them and said she would eat those instead of the "regular" ones if I just wanted to make those.  They are a little on the grainy side from the rice flour, but that happens with most GF baking.  My son has Autism and we follow the Gluten free/Casein free diet, so I did make the modification of using Spectrum non-hydrogenated shortening in place of the butter.  They came out just fine and I can't tell a difference.  Watch your baking times VERY carefully, and the second the edges turn brown take them out.  They will still look puffy and underbaked, but they will continue to cook on the cookie sheet once you take them out.  They made about 35 cookies using the Pampered Chef small size cookie scoop.

I have turned so many people on to these chips after I first tried them in Cabo San Lucas.  Sadly, they are not sold in KY, so I found them here.  All 6 of my kiddos and my hubby love them.  They are light, with a unique flavor that only causes that yearning for more.  Never have they arrived stale; however, you need to keep the bag sealed when not in use, like any other chip.  Outstanding by themselves, with guacamole or with salsa.  We are SOLD on these chips.

review/summary: Cabo Chips are Absolutely Delicious
review/text: Cabo Chips have a unique taste because everything is all natural. A lot of the tortilla chips out there taste fake but with Cabo Chips, they taste real.  They have a solid crunch but that's what I'm looking for in a Tortilla Chip. I don't want a soft tortilla chip.  Another good part about the chip is that they are thin and crispy. Usually with the crunch you get out of them you'd expect a thick chip, but these have the perfect size.<br /><br />I've given chips to my roommates and parents and all agree that they are delicious. You can taste hints of the flavor although it is not overpowering which for me, is important. I hate getting a flavored chip and you forget that you're eating a tortilla chip.<br /><br />I would definitely get again (and am going to)

review/summary: Yummy, Not Oily
review/text: I first discovered Cabo Chips this January when we vacationed in Maui - found them at Mana Foods in Paia. After we got home I looked them up on the Web & ordered them from Amazon (where I found the best price for a box of 12). I like them even more now! Next to Mexi-Snax (a local brand here in the San Francisco Bay Area), Cabo is my favorite tortilla chip. They are very similar to Hav'a Corn Chips - same size bag, and both are seasoned with soy sauce, not salt. But I now prefer Cabo Chips, which are a bit thinner & less oily than Hav'a and, IMO, have a finer flavor. You guys really know how to make a gourmet tortilla chip! I hope your fame spreads far and wide, so that I can buy Cabo Chips in my local supermarkets (Whole Foods and Safeway).

review/summary: Outstanding chips!
review/text: I've yet to find store-bought chips that can truly accent my homemade salsa. The typical variety just tastes store-bought; perhaps it's the added preservatives and such, or the processing, or whatever--they just don't taste like fresh chips and they add too much sweetness to the salsa.<br /><br />Cabo Chips, on the other hand, are much lighter and fresher, and although they have a twist of lime, they don't overpower the salsa. I'm certainly happy that Amazon carries them, because they're might hard to find, even here in the San Fernando Valley.

review/text: Great taste with the flavors of soy sauce and lime. Not as greasy as other chips. My bad experience is mishandling my order. All eight 24oz bags were crushed.....two-thirds of the chips were broken into crumbs. It was either the shipping or delivery service. A "negative" five stars for mishandling my order.

review/summary: Once a favorite - now far too sweet
review/text: This apple ginger bar was once a favorite - it tasted like an apple & oatmeal cookie with just a bit of zing (from the ginger). Unfortunately this latest batch is excessively and disgustingly sweet. It's lost the punch from the ginger and seems to be super soft with fewer oats and the addition of sweetened apple bits.<br /><br />The bar changed once before, having become smaller (from 61g to 54g). Now it seems to me that the recipe has changed too. From a somewhat nutritional snack to a brown sugar cookie.<br /><br />The Earnest bars (formerly Honest bars) were once a favorite snack item. Not any more. I just made my last purchase.

review/text: I bought the gum for a habitual chewer. The price alone makes this a great deal in compared to buying a stick a time at a gas station.  The flavor is delicious but does dissipate way too quickly for my taste.  Since this is a problem shared by gum in general it isn't a deal breaker.  Regardless it is a unique taste that is reminiscent of cotton candy.

review/summary: Awesome for Blowing Bubbles
review/text: There are so many different kinds of bubble gum on the market today that I would be clueless as to how to list them all.  On the other hand, with a bubble gum such as Dubble Bubble, who cares?<br /><br />Dubble Bubble has a long and glorious history.  The gum traces its history back to a bubble gum called Blibber-Blubber developed by Frank Fleer in 1906.  That gum was never marketed.  Other people at Fleer's company continued to work on the bubble gum, with the formula finished by 1928.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest change from the original Dubble Bubble to today's Dubble Bubble are the variations in flavor.  Double Bubble retains the original flavor along with a variety of other flavors, though the flavors are relatively mild.<br /><br />Dubble Bubble has two features that make it one of the superior bubble gums.  First, the gum gets softer as you chew it (more on that in a moment).  Second, the gum makes excellent bubbles.  I like the fact that the gum gets softer as you chew it, though it can be quite hard initially.  There are other brands that begin soft, but seem to get chewier and stiffer the longer you chew it.  I suppose the goal with those brands is to chew the flavor out and then toss the gum.  However, with Dubble Bubble you can chew the gum for a long time and the gum remains soft.<br /><br />I have made bubbles with Double Bubble gum a long time after I started chewing the gum.  Thus, the gum maintains its softness as well as its cohesiveness for making bubbles.  For even larger bubbles you can add a second gumball once the first one has been chewed for a while.  However, I recommend you abstain from a third gumball; the size of the gum becomes cumbersome at that point.<br /><br />In spite of the huge array of bubble gums on the market today, I continue to choose Dubble Bubble Gumballs as one of my favorites.  I suspect that I always will.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Gold standard...Years of research on my part...
review/text: When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my "baby" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE "health" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept "treating" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and "cured" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.

review/summary: No meat by-products, good and safe, Turkey & Chicken Dog Food
review/text: Everyone knows about tainted pet food from China.<br /><br />Newman's Own is a branding that I can trust, and this one is a real winner.  Newman's is what I would make if I were making it for my own family, as in you can trust that it is great tasting, good for you and safe to eat.  I'm very pleased that the Newman's line was extended from people food to pet food.<br /><br />When it comes to moist dog food every single choice on the market has meat by-products except Newman's Own.  My 3-month old puppy goes crazy for this, as well as for the Chicken-only Newman's canned dog food variety.  In fairness he would probably go crazy over meat by-products too.  While they *may* never hurt his health, I won't give him any, that lucky dog.<br /><br />One other finding:  When you open almost any moist dog food you smell "dog food".  When you open Newman's Chicken or Chicken & Turkey you smell meat.  It actually smells good.  Imagine that.

With my vet's okay, I started mixing just a little of other types of canned food with the prescription but after a few days I could see he wasn't feeling well and his problems began to return.  Finally, I picked up a can of Newman's organic and mixed that with his prescription.  Not only did he like it, he was fine!  I can't give him this alone - he still must have the prescription - but as long as it is at least half the prescription mixed in, he can eat it every day and he is fine!  I was so happy!

review/summary: Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.
review/text: UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping. They replaced it for me at no charge. Everything is good. The replacement food is great.<br /><br />Here's my original review after a little editing, including further details of the resolution:<br /><br />I have been buying the "Organic Liver for Dogs" from my local store. The consistency (firmness and uniformity) of the product had been good. So I ordered a case of it from Amazon. When it arrived, I opened two cans immediately, excited to give my dog some more organic beef liver. However, both cans contained small pellets of something (liver?) and water. It was nothing at all like the same product that I have been purchasing locally, even though the label is the same and it is sold as the same product.<br /><br />I wasn't even sure if it was safe to feed it to my dog. The cans from Amazon are simply liquid plus a handful of pellets.<br /><br />As I look through the reviews now, I see there is a consistency problem with Newman's Own Organics pet foods. Some batches appear OK, but some are not edible (even by dogs). I sense a serious quality control problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow returns of this product. I opened two cans. Now I have the rest of the case that I'm afraid to feed to my dog. I can shake all the cans and hear that they are all liquid plus pellets (as opposed to the firm liver puree that was in the cans I purchased locally).<br /><br />UPDATE: I wrote the company and they quickly resolved the issue for me by sending me a new order at no cost. The new order has arrived now and the product is fine. It has the proper consistency. It looks exactly like the very good quality dog food that I was used to when I purchased this brand locally. So everything is resolved for me.<br /><br />I give the food itself a 5 star rating. Where else can one find certified organic beef liver for dogs in a convenient form and at a fair price? I think this product is the best available to me at this time, so it has to be rated 5 stars.<br />I give the customer service from Newman's Own Organics a 5 star rating as well.<br />I have a few reservations about quality control, based not only on my own experience, but on what I read in other reviews here. Fortunately, the company will stand behind its product and resolve any issues. Therefore, the lowest rating I could give for quality control would be 3 stars.<br />Overall, I think I would rate the product 4.5 stars. Since the customer service was so outstanding and the product is the best I have found of this type, I'll round up to 5 stars.

review/summary: Must have been a contaminated batch
review/text: We bought a case of 12 12 oz cans back in April. Just now opened the first can. Wow. Consistency of vomit, grayish tinge, and a vile odor. Opened a second can -- exactly the same. No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA.

review/summary: Perfect Dog Food
review/text: My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction.  Until this canned food ----- that is.  He loves it and it is made so well.  You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture.  In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try.  Your pooch will be glad you did.

review/summary: The Organic Beef Canned is Inconsistent....
review/text: I've been buying the Newman's Own Canned Organic BEEF for my 9 year old Diabetic Rottweiler to add more protein to her diet since she has been losing weight since her diagnosis 3 years ago.  During the last 6 months that I've been buying it, the consistency of the canned food has been all over the place.  Sometimes it's quite firm and I really have to dig in with the spoon to remove it, sometimes it's a good average firmness, and other times it's extremely mushy.<br /><br />Most recently, the last 2-3 12-packs I've purchased from Amazon or Whole Foods (at different times, not from same lot) have been so soupy that I could pour it out of the can and onto her special diet which is Honest Kitchen Embark.  In the bottom of the can, half the time there has been a thick gelatinous layer and the rest of the time, it is a yellow liquid layer instead so it's pretty gross.  I've been shaking the cans before I open them to mix it up before I pour it out.<br /><br />I've decided not to purchase the Canned Organic Beef any longer.  My dog has been having loose stools lately and I think it's from the soupy canned food.<br /><br />I did buy some of the Newman's Own 100% Liver Canned at Whole Foods and the consistency was very good so I'm going to try ordering this one from Amazon next time instead.  I hope the Liver Canned will remain the right firmness and consistency because I'd rather give my dog all meat without veggies or grain carbs that will affect her sugar levels.  She gets some of those things in the Embark already.<br /><br />Not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the Beef Canned but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this particular type of Newman's Own canned.  I can't speak for their other canned food items.

review/summary: Newman's Own pet food
review/text: I have an extremely fussy little Shih Tzu who won't eat dog food.  I discovered she will eat Newman's Own Turkey and Chicken formula of which I found 2 cans at a pet store.  After searching on line for a better supplier I discovered Amazon not only carries the food but would send me a case a month on an on-going basis.  The price is the best I found and I even get free shipping.  Every month I get an email allowng me to opt out of that month's supply if I wish.  I am happy and my dog is very happy.  I strongly recommend checking out Amazon's pet food.

review/summary: My dog loves it
review/text: Unlike the other reviewer's dog, mine loves "Newman's Own" canned food.  I gotta believe that if a dog won't touch this, the dog is not only extremely fussy, but not very hungry as well.  Having this delivered to my door cheaper than I can buy it at my local supermarket sure is handy.

review/summary: SUMI LOVES IT AND IT'S GOOD FOR HER!
review/text: After tiring of making my dog's food from scratch I looked for an all natural product.  Everything on the ingredients label of this canned food is recognizable as real food; no "powdered protein" or other questionable substances.  My dog loves it but to be honest I have to tell you that she practically inhales anything that she thinks might be food. I have the reassurance that this product won't hurt her.  The turkey and brown rice from Newman's Own is also excellent.

review/summary: Diarrhea
review/text: My rescued GSD loves this Newman's Own; however, every time I feed this to her, every time she gets diarrhea. The first time I took her to a vet and after a few days of prescribed diet and med she got back normal. So I resumed her normal diet (this Newman's Own). Soon her diarrhea started to come back. I took no chance and immediately switched to home made boiled chicken and steam rice. After a few days her stools got much better. I gave this Newman's Own a last chance and... I just finished cleaning up my carpet.<br /><br />I have no idea of why there are so many good reviews. Is my dog just happened to be sensitive to this or I got a bad batch?

review/summary: Newman's Own for Puppies/Dogs Canned Food
review/text: I love this dog food. I eat very well myself, being a vegetarian for over 20 years and try to eat organically as much as possible. I did a great deal of research on commercial dog foods and I was disgusted when I discovered the amount of chemicals and pesticides they contained. I tried my puppy on many different natural dog foods and she would have gas and the runs with every type, but Newman's Own.  So I am back to my first choice since she never had negative effects with it. Unfortunately it was a little hard to find locally, but now I can order it through Amazon and get it delivered every month. Thanks Newman's Own and thanks Amazon for making my puppy and I very happy :)

review/summary: great food, but the seller is mishandling the merchandise
review/text: Our dog loves this food, but this seller keeps shipping me damaged goods. In each shipment we get at least one or two severely dented cans. This is not due to shipping. The box it's shipped in arrives without a dent. It's only inside, therefore, the dents are happening before they ship.

review/summary: Greatest food ever!
review/text: My dogs have food allergies and I tried a holistic brand and they would not eat it. I tried the Newman's Own dry food and they loved it so I decided to add a little of the wet food. This food is not your standard wet food it looks more like mousse. It isn't a jelly loaf with yucky bits like some others. My dogs love it and lick their bowls clean.

review/summary: Excellent Product!
review/text: I am very pleased with the Newman's Own Organics products - my pups all agree that it is very tasty stuff!  Though my roommate has to leave the room every time I open the can (he is a wuss who makes a big deal about the smell!), you can tell just by looking at it that it includes many healthy ingredients. Take a look at the ingredient list and you can't help but be impressed!  Great taste, organic, healthy...it's just a great product!

review/summary: Food is great, some cans came damaged
review/text: My Bichons love the food.  And, the price cannot be beat.  But, when I previously wrote about a can that came without a label, I never heard back.  I have also had a problem with dented cans.  Of course, if air gets into the cans, the food will not be safe to eat.  Makes me wonder if they are selling "seconds."  Would account for the great price.  Would have liked to have heard back from them.

review/summary: This one is an obvious winner at our house - for my lab mix!
review/text: I offered my lab mix his new DRY dog food yesterday. He refused it. It was one of the Newman's Own dry dog food. No matter what I did, telling him it was a treat, holding some of it in my hand, breaking some of the in two so he might get a bit of aroma from it, nothing worked!<br /><br />Then I read one of the previous reviews that talked about a dog or dogs having the same reaction until they mixed it with the canned food.<br /><br />I had also bought some of the canned food for my large, slow-eating, finicky eater, so I decided to try adding some of it to the dry food. I opened up the can, noticed that he was standing by me all of a sudden, mixed it in with the dry food, and gave it to him.<br /><br />Next thing I knew, the bowl was empty. But then I heard him licking the bowl, the bowl being drug all over the utility room floor!<br /><br />Now, a few minutes later, he is telling me in no uncertain terms, that he wants MORE!  That is an unusual reaction for him. He doesn't get more right now because he had quite a bit.<br /><br />I'm grinning all over because this worked out so well for him. He's an older dog with somewhat fragile teeth, and I'm glad he's happy.<br /><br />EDITED the next morning to say that he ate way too much and kept me awake all night because he needed to go out. I'll have to use better judgement for him than he is obviously able to use for himself regarding portion control. I should have added only enough of the canned food to give the dry food the taste he wanted. The whole can was WAY TOO MUCH for his system when combined with the amount of dry food he ate with it. Portion Control. I will have to keep reminding him, or in this case, I will have to make those decisions for him. He would never know when to stop if I left it up to him. EDITED weeks later to say that PORTION CONTROL has worked well. He really loves these little cans, better than treats, and he loves treats!

review/summary: Newman's Canned Chicken & Brown Rice
review/text: I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her...twice. My vet and I had run out of ideas to try; nothing seemed to be working for any length of time; hospitalization, IV's, all kinds of meds, etc. and I was desperate! I even stayed home from work with her because I was sure she was not going to make it through that day. It was horible, but I didn't give up even though family members hinted around the suggestion of putting her down. After researching everything I could think of, I stumbled on the thought that maybe her diet was the culprit. I began to search for a food that would fit all the criteria for all of her problems, and found Newman's Chicken & brown rice formula. She's been on it for two month's now, and ALL her symptoms are GONE! Bloodwork-GOOD, Kidney Function-GOOD, Thyroid-GOOD, Allergies-GONE. I cannot believe she's back to her old self and acts like a puppy again. I still give her meds for her Pancreatitis, but that's all! I contribute it all to her food, it saved her life, and all is well for the first time ever! Please, please look at what you feed your pets! I have found that very few commercially prepared foods meet the standards they brag about. Newman's definetely does! Thank you for helping me save my baby girl!!!!!

review/summary: All beef wonderful
review/text: My pug was having skin problems and after 6 months a vet tech mentioned it might be chicken and corn that is giving her problems. So I began looking for something else that was organic and was pleased to find the beef and liver from Newman's Own. The liver was not her favorite and was a little strong smelling for this vegetarian, but the beef was great. She loves it, I steam some veggies and mix them in, then put a dry food on top and she scarfs it down. I do wish Newman's would put out an organic beef treat and a dry food that does not have chicken and corn but am very happy with the beef.

review/summary: Newman's Turkey and Brown rice formula
review/text: My dogs love Newman's turkey and brown rice. I have been feeding it to them for about a year. I mix it with Flint River Ranch kibble so they have some crunchy food also. They are spaniels (a breed prone to allergies) and have had no allergy problems and have shiny, sleek coats. They are healthy and love the food. I strongly recommend it. It is a high-quality, human-grade dogfood.

review/summary: Even finicky eaters will eat it!
review/text: My little toy poodle had digestive problems a few months ago and just didn't want to eat dog food. All he wanted was cooked chicken breast, and so, that's what he got (so he'd at least get some food into him).<br /><br />Happened to find the Newman's Own canned chicken dog food, and he absolutely inhaled it! He finds it irresistible. I am so thankful this food is on the market -- it looks and smells like cooked chicken (which he likes), and has helped him get back on track nutritionally (which I like :-)

review/summary: Newman's Own Organics Canned Dog Food is NOT made in the USA
review/text: I was not aware of and was not told the country of origin when I purchased a case of Newman's Own Organics Canned Dog Food..  This product is made in Uruguay not the USA!! It made both of my dogs sick with severe diarrhea.  Blue Buffalo was out of stock so I thought "Newman's Own" indicated it would be a good product made in the USA.  WRONG!!!
