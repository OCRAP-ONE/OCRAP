review/summary: Best no sugar gluten free we found-but light and expensive
review/text: Tastes pretty good. Not many "no sugar added" gluten free cereals to chose from. We all like the taste. Down sides are that not only does it cost more than regular cereal, there are very few servings per box. The serving size is 1 1/4 cups but it is so light weight, it is not very filling. Still, a good item.

review/text: This cereal is not at its best just in the bowl.  I stick it in a food processor with fresh basil and sea salt and grind it up to use as a coating to deep fry or bake chicken.  It turns out delicious!  Everyone wants to eat the chicken nuggets, not just the child who needs to due to allergies!

review/summary: The taste of olden days...
review/text: I really was so excited to discover this brand. I do not enjoy sweet cereals at all and am limmited by the type of grains I can eat. This brand I had never heard of, having not grown up in this country and I love the crunch and the unsweetened feature. It is incredible to me how often sweet disguises the myriad of foods that are just not good and healthy. Whereas my husband still prefer Kellogs Corn Flakes, I am happy to make the change to this brand. I eat organic and unprocessed foods as much as possible and I know in time, there will not be two brands of Corn Flakes in the cupboard. I mix the Erewhon Corn Flakes with Mesa Sunrise (Nature's Path) which is delicious but can be a little to sweet for me on its own, even though the sugar content is no where near other cereals). A delicious gluten free combination.

review/text: This is a great cereal for people who maintain a gluten-free diet and who do not want added sweeteners to their cereal. I add raisins and sliced almonds,  and with this combination find this cereal more satisfying than other brands that rely on evaporated cane juice for sweetening. Those other cereals are just too sweet for me. Also, I enjoy the option of eating something other than rice cereals.

review/summary: Tasty, sugar-free and gluten-free!
review/text: I had been looking for years for a sugar-free, gluten-free cereal that isn't high glycemic puffed grains. I love this cereal. I put some sweetener, nuts, and sometimes cinnamon or fruit on it.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the other reviewers were expecting. It's flakes, so it's crunchiest if you eat it right away and don't let it sit and get soggy. And it's sugar-free, so don't expect it to taste sugary and flavored. But you can add all the flavorings you want. I suspect that people who think it's too bland don't realize how much sugar and additives the regular cereals have.<br /><br />I have eaten almost all of my first 6 boxes and Amazon is out of stock. I sure hope they get more soon!

This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought.

review/summary: no lemon. not much green tea
review/text: If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled "lemon ginger green tea." It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.

review/summary: Great Green Tea and Great Company!
review/text: This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several "natural" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using "natural" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them.

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!
review/text: I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional "Gyokuro" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.

review/summary: Interesting blend
review/text: My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct "earl grey" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.

review/text: I love this tea! Not only because it is organic, but also for the health benefits on another vital level... The information is really out there how great green tea is nutritionally, but I truly love the richness and strong flavor of black tea...So, with this  Chai, which has both,  I can't taste the green tea at all because the black truly dominates it completely...Also, the spice combination is really subtle, smooth and well rounded. It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!

review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy.

This mint tea tastes like it was grown and dried within the week. I prepare the tea with new water each time (I don't re-boil the water). I also make my tea using spring water vs tap water which contains chlorine. The tea is sweet tasting and I find I use less honey than with other mint teas. In addition to the high quality organic mint tea, I will comment on the subscription service I use to obtain this mint tea. I have subscribed to automated replenishment to make certain I am never out of this wonderful tea. The Amazon automatic replenishment service is very reliable and easy to adjust quantities and delivery frequencies. ENJOY!

review/text: I drink loose-leaf tea while I'm at home, but bags are more convenient when I'm at work, so I drink this. It's not the best green tea I've ever tasted, but it's inexpensive (especially via Subscribe & Save) and has a good brand reputation. If you're a casual fan of green tea, this will do nicely.

review/summary: Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little mild and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker!<br /><br />Stash Tea has been around for about 37 years, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****

review/summary: This compares to chamomile tea
review/text: I was a little skeptical at first, but that thought was soon halted.  It is almost like a two for one deal. I get the relaxation of chamomile tea while smelling lavender.  I was so impressed I brought some to work and had everyone try.  I received mixed reviews.  What I did notice was that tea drinkers that preferred milk or sweeteners in their tea did not like.  While those that used honey loved it.

review/summary: Bitter Green Tea
review/text: First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .

review/summary: This tastes like CINNAMON OIL, not a traditional chai blend
review/text: Wow, was I looking forward to this after the great reviews. I got it today & made a cup right away. What a huge disappointment. The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way. I cannot taste or smell any other spice. The green tea does come through a bit.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish the cup. I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise. It was not worth the effort, it was as if I'd never put them in the cup.<br /><br />If you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds, this is NOT for you. Stay away from this stuff.<br /><br />Even from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor, this tea is not pleasant. I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels, so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea, I guess this would be acceptable.<br /><br />I can't send this back, so I'll be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri. I wouldn't even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />Stash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils. Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash. I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil. I'm hoping it won't taste like a cup of clove water.<br /><br />Very, very disappointed.

review/text: I tried this brand of green tea after drinking both Celestial Seasonings and Twinings green teas. This one had a very strong, very strange flavor. It almost tasted like a meat broth rather than a tea. I think another reviewer who described it as a "burnt" flavor may have gotten it right. I tried it once, and immediately switched back to Twinings. I recently tried a second bag, thinking maybe I overreacted the first time, but had to pour it away.

review/summary: This is a staple at my house
review/text: I love this tea!  I'd underestimated that, however, when I subscribed to the Stash organic sampler.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDAQ">Stash Premium Organic Tea Sampler, Variety Pack of Eight Flavors, Tea Bags, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  I (mistakenly) figured that I'd still get enough of this to suit me, but was wrong.  Yes, I do enjoy the options, but even so, was too soon out of this one.  That's why I came here to subscribe to it.<br /><br />Many times only this particular tea will satisfy, such as first thing in the morning, or when I want an afternoon lift.  I was brought up with the old German custom of "tea time," where black tea was daily served at 4 pm., and so I've been a black tea fan for most of my life.  That tea was OK (it was all I knew), but this black tea is significantly better!  I'm attached to the taste, which carries the familiar acidic "bite" of black tea, but balances it with the alkaline health effects of green tea.  Like some others, I'd been initially put off by the black/green combo, wondering what to expect.  Now, however, I can say to anyone considering it, that if you like Earl Grey tea, then you'll love this version!<br /><br />For me, the flavor is best when the tea is piping hot (and less enjoyable if allowed to cool).  Consequently, I tend to brew it in an insulated stainless steel mug, which is then topped by a silicone cup lid (similar to the one at this link).  [...]<br /><br />Currently I'm exploring infused tea, being curious about why gourmet tea drinkers will tend to disdain bagged tea.  I just may discover flavors unexperienced!  Even so, I doubt this Earl Grey version will lose its high placement on my favorites list.  Simply put, it hits the spot.  Anyway, teabags are very convenient to use first thing in the morning!<br /><br />I've been a long-time fan of Stash (even before I switched to organic tea only), and so I've welcomed Amazon's prices.  With the addition of the "subscribe & save" option, this is an especially good deal.

review/text: I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment.

review/summary: Excellent Mellow Tea, Hot or Cold
review/text: This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.<br /><br />I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)<br /><br />Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet.

review/text: I was looking for an organic green tea that had not been grown in China or Japan.  I contacted Stash and was told this tea originated in Japan, but was grown in Brazil.  This organic green tea is amazing.  My first impression was that it contained a more generous amount of tea than those I had previously made tea with. When I pour boiling water on a tea bag, the green tea blossoms out even without dunking the tea bag.  I found the taste to be smooth and not at all bitter.  A single bag will easily make a small pot of tea.  If you were to seep a single cup for a while, it you might find it a bit strong. This is a notably lovely organic green tea that is grown in Brazil.

review/summary: My 'everyday' tea. :c)
review/text: I love the idea of having green tea everyday.<br /><br />...However, I thought this could never happen to me because I couldn't seem to enjoy it on it's own.<br /><br /> This is the first 'real' tea I have been able to honestly say; I LOVE. The smell alone makes me smile. It was my answer to wanting to be a 'real' tea drinker. I used to buy boxes and boxes of differing types of herb teas. But those are usually so boring. Almost like Kool-Aid without the guilt. *sigh* Peppermint used to be my 'safe' go to, when out with friends, but often times I found them to be weak or lacking. Stash organic black and green chai, really does it for me, and nearly everyone else I introduce this tea to, feels the exact same way: They wanted to be 'real tea' drinkers, couldn't stand the taste, found this and voila!<br /><br />I do add sugar so, it tastes more like desert than tea... but even when I don't add a bunch, this tea can actually take the 'less sugar' test. Can it hold up, without sugar?? Yes, even then, but, sugar is pretty much a must for me.<br /><br />All that said: Because of this tea, I now enjoy green tea on it's own! How that came about: Getting familiar the 'green tea flavor' when it tastes this fantastic, helped me familiarize with the flavor of green tea. After trying this, I moved on to Stash's 'Green Chai' so now I'm quite familiar with the green tea taste. Thus, I sometimes surprise myself and just drink plain old green tea! Hooray!!<br /><br /> TMI? Likely, but maybe someone will find this helpful and take the leap. :c)<br /><br />PS Thank you Amazon for making this available here!!! I could only find it in one store in my hometown (I store, I otherwise NEVER go to) and NEVER anywhere else! Imagine my joy finding it readily available here. :c)

review/summary: Time for Tea!
review/text: I have been buying this tea for a while from a local grocery store but it must be popular b/c it was often out of stock on the shelf so I decided to start buying from  Amazon to ensure I would not have a tea shortage.  Like one reviewer mentioned the bergamot or earl grey flavor is not as strong as some brands but this particular combination of earl grey black and green together is difficult to find especially in an affordable organic tea.  Prior to discovering this tea I used to use one earl grey tea bag and one green tea tea bag, but this product just makes it simpler.  This is also a great tea if you're like me and really prefer the taste of black tea but want to get the benefits of the green tea too.

review/summary: Better than Bigelow's Earl Gray Green
review/text: I was disappointed as I could not taste the bergamot like I can in Twinings Earl Grey. It was much better than Bigelow's Earl Grey Green and there was no bitter aftertaste. Maybe I expected it be more like the original Earl Grey. I was hoping that I'd like it as I would get the green tea benefits with the black tea taste, but the flavor still fell flat for me as it did not have the delicacy of Twinings. I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive. Also, Celestial Seasonings has a Mandarin Orchard green tea that's really good.

If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!

review/text: This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews.  It does not appear green, nor does it taste "green" (ie: doesn't have that fresh "grassy" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea).  Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste.  Yuk.  Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one.  What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.

review/summary: Cuppa Green
review/text: Like many regular tea drinkers I prefer the loose-leaf variety when I am at home, but the afternoon cuppa at work calls for something a little less complicated.  I am OK with sacrificing flavor for convenience, while saving some pennies at the same time.<br /><br />So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by Stash's brands of Certified Organic green teas.  I have drank both this straight green tea and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQIDK6">Stash Premium Organic Earl Grey Black and Green Tea</a> combination.  The teas come from the Yamamotoyama Brazilian tea gardens, which were initially planted with Japanese seedlings.  The processing methods and standards are all based on Japanese system.<br /><br />The flavor of this Premium Green Tea is really nice, with a subtle grassy flavor that I enjoy in decent green teas.  I find that too many American-produced green teas are "watered down" in flavor, lacking the oomph that one finds in a true Japanese or Chinese green tea.  This cup, however, is close to the real thing. It also gives off a nice green color, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />By no means the best tea you will ever drink, but this Premium Green Tea might just possibly the best inexpensive tea-bag style green tea on the market.

review/text: I love salt water taffy and thought I recognized the Sweets brand name. It comes in 3 nice 1-lb boxes and is melt-in-your-mouth soft - no chewing required. The colors are bright and unusual for taffy. But this is not traditional taffy as far as the flavors. They are almost all a little weird, hard to define and kind of awful, in my opinion. I can tolerate the blue, the chocolate and peppermint taste accurate but the others are kind of unnatural, some with weird petroleum/chemical aftertastes. They are all much sweeter than I had expected as well. So I won't be reordering this brand. I like the flavor and price of the Energy Club brand sold on amazon, so I'll probably just go back to that.

review/text: I have read the previous review comments and as my title states ... To each their own. As everyone is entitled to their own opinions and tastebuds. But I have to say that I like the Sweets Saltwater Taffy and find their balance of sweet and salty to be in harmonious balance and their quirky flavors adds a extra more bit of enjoyment with each taffy. Normally I don't like cinnamon flavored candies but the cinnamon flavors taffy has become my favorite. I enjoy the ten(10) assorted flavors : Neapolitan, Grape, Cinnamon, Orange Vanilla, Peppermint, Blue Raspberry, Chocolate, Banana, Pear, Licorice. I have not experienced any strange after tastes as some of the previous reviewers stated. I enjoy each flavor uniquely and find this batch of Saltwater taffy to be one of the best I've tasted in my time and I've eaten quite a few saltwater taffy in my days. I hope to share a handful in my halloween treat bag for my Sister and Niece to enjoy. I'd recommend this when you're looking for a chewy taffy that isn't too sweet and has lots of flavor. It'd be great if they have 50+ flavors like the JellyBelly beans.

review/text: I used to be able to purchase this locally yet, not found it recently until I checked here. It's as good as it ever was. Thing I'm curious about is, it's just long-grain brown rice and a small bag of "natural" flavor. Why the high cost?<br /><br />Will I buy it again? Yes, cuz I love it and I can. What else to say?

review/summary: Best Rice I ever tasted!
review/text: We happened across the Konriko Rice Company in Iberia, LA last Spring on a trip.  Bought a bag of the rice after tasting a sample at the company store after a fun little tour of the 100-year-old mill.  We're hooked for life!  So happy to find it on Amazon since it isn't sold in stores in our area.

review/text: I have made many calls and searched many stores for this rice. It is no longer available in my area. I'm so glad to find it here on Amazon. Yum! Twelve boxes will not last long. I'll be back for more.

review/summary: Wild Pecan Rice review
review/text: Good taste - but at least 2 of the 12 boxes we received had some larvae growing - i.e. looks like fine webbing holding the rice together - had to toss it.

review/text: Absolutely the best rice on the market!  If you like a little more flavor just add some ground pecans and extra wild rice.....or not!
