review/summary: Hope they never stop making these.
review/text: I hope they never stop making these Coco Mints, or their Licorice Mints.  I use xylitol gum and candies a lot, and I get awfully tired of the choices of cinnamon-fruit-mint-fruit-cinnamon-fruit-mint-fruit-cinnamon. . . offered elsewhere.  I like the fact that these are made of simple real ingredients: xylitol, cocoa powder, and peppermint oil.  The fact that they crumble a bit never bothered me.  When I finish off a tin, I dump the sugar at the bottom into my coffee.

How hard is it to make it hard mints. I think they are trying to copy altoids, but managed to make it much more crumbly.

review/summary: Not really a mint
review/text: If you're expecting a nice, hard candy to slowly dissolve in your mouth, while bathing your teeth in healthy Xylitol, this ISN'T it!<br />The "mints" I received have a mottled brown-and-white color. They were double-saran-wrapped, so I can't see how they could have absorbed any moisture. But they have the consistency of a Rice Krispy (yes...ONE rice krispy). You can't suck on them at all...they just disintegrate in your mouth in a few seconds.<br />As a result, one stays in your mouth about 5 seconds, and you don't get that clean, fresh taste (as you would with Smints, for example) at all.<br /><br />Very disappointing.<br />If this batch was defective, I hope the manufacturer contacts me with replacements.

review/summary: The Only Bouillon
review/text: I've been cooking with Vegetable Oxo Bouillon Cubes for a number of years.  It's the only bouillon cube worth using!  My grown sons order their own, as do several friends who asked what I did to make my soups and stews so flavorful.  It's also a wonderful 'food' to have around when someone in the house is ill.  My only complaint is the high cost of shipping.  Maybe Amazon can solve this problem.

review/summary: This new formula in the white box is terrible.
review/text: This used to be my favorite cereal, but since they changed to this new formula in the white box (old formula came in a golden/light green box) it is terrible. This new formula has a gritty hard dry texture, does not stay crunchy in milk like the old formula, and it taste artificially sweet.  The old formula had a great malty, honey like flavor and stayed crunchy in milk longer.  I would go out of my way to buy it, special ordering it in cases from my health food store because they didn't carry this one at the store and it's so hard to find cereals without wheat.  But now with this new formula ... forget it, I will no longer be buying it. Health Valley ruined a good thing!

review/summary: wonderful tea
review/text: Lipton Decaffeinated Tea is the perfect thing to drink when you want a soothing hot--or cold--beverage. It works wonders to combat laryngitis as well. Moreover, the tea bags contain decaffeinated tea which means you'll never lose a night's sleep to this tea! SMILE<br /><br />Moreover, there are no additives nor are there preservatives. You can use these tea bags a very long time after you bought them in a store or here at Amazon.com online.<br /><br />Yes, you can serve this tea iced with lemon; but I normally find it most useful for those nasty winter months when I inevitably catch a miserable cold. I boil water; I add the tea bag and then I let it steep for a few minutes. I add milk and one packet of "sweet and low" and it's absolutely delicious!<br /><br />You can use a tea bag twice if you wish but after two uses the tea bag has probably served its' "tour of duty."<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine quality tea that will not over stimulate you with caffeine. It is an aromatic hot beverage for when you have a cold and it also makes a delicious iced tea drink on a baking hot summer's day. Pick some up and try it--you will not be disappointed.

I did my research on the best brands, and found this.  I was irritated , red and swollen when sutures and steri strips were removed. I started applying honey daily and covering with a sanitary napkin. Within 2 days, the swelling and redness were completely gone!!!

review/text: Have been using these for a while now.  They're ideal in lieu of a fresh lemon to make water more interesting, or to sprinkle on fish.  On a normal day, I use 3-5 packets.  A great product that's gotten a bit expensive with it's "new" tube packet packaging.  A great way to save for heavy users like me is the 500 count box in the "old" flat packaging.  As long as they're not exposed to humidity, they're great.  No sugar, no calories, no nothing - just great flavor.

review/summary: Astounding true lemon taste
review/text: I don't use lemon that often, and any attempts to buy a bag of the "real" stuff ends up with moldy and forgotten citrus at the bottom of my bin. However, I do occasionally need it, so when I saw this product I was ecstatic.<br /><br />The first time I used it, a few years ago, the taste was wonderful but there was an issue with clumping. While I appreciated that they wanted to keep it as natural as possible, most of the packets contained a wet little mass that I had to peel away from the packet. Messy and not convenient. I contacted the company and learned this was something they were working to correct.<br /><br />I tried again some time later, and the results are everything I wanted. Pure lemon taste (unlike those nasty concentrated bottles of so-called lemon juice you find in the produce department) with nice free flowing crystals. Bear in mind that one packet equals out to a teaspoon of lemon juice, so this isn't something I'd recommend getting if you are looking to make a pitcher of lemonade. However, if you're like me and like the occasional hint of lemon in a glass of water or a bit of lemon in your tea, it's fantastic.<br /><br />Just how lemony is this lemon? Well, the other day a friend brought over some huge raw oysters. Personally, my favorite way to eat them is with just a dash of lemon juice. I had no lemon juice but got the idea in my head to open a couple of packets and mix with a couple tablespoons of water. My friend took a sip and was shocked because it tasted like we'd just squeezed some fresh lemons. We downed all the oysters with nothing but the True Lemon and didn't even reach for the hot sauce. Fantastic product.<br /><br />Other favorite uses: Sprinkle on cubed steak and serve with avocado salsa. Place sliced apples in a ziplock bag, add one packet of True Lemon and one packet of stevia (or any other sweetener)...keeps the apples from browning and adds a bright hint-of-lemon taste. Sprinkle on fish right before serving. Great on a cream cheese bagel with a little dash of powdered sugar. Great for when you want to add the taste of lemon but perhaps not the water content of lemon juice.

Some of the other powdered drink mixes on the market have strange chemicals and even stain my water bottles!  I like TrueLemon because it adds just enough flavor to make the water drinkable.  The little packets are so convenient... I always keep a handful of them in my purse.  They work great in tea as well (iced or hot).  I saw a suggestion to sprinkle TrueLemon on top of popcorn instead of salt.  I haven't tried this idea yet, but it's intriguing.

review/summary: Surprisingly good and authentic tasing
review/text: My wife (a real lemon lover) and I are very happy with this.  It is the closest thing to real lemon juice that I've ever had.  It has none of the off taste of concentrated lemon juice.  In my iced tea or in plain water I cannot tell that it's not from a real lemon.  I've never done an side-by test taste and would not be surprised if I could tell the difference then, but just using it as I do I don't notice any difference.

I think I will stick to buying either lemons or a bottle of lemon juice from here on out...as that is much more potent and tasty!!!

review/summary: BEST Korean BBQ sauce
review/text: I discovered this stuff at the local Korean market.<br /><br />I developed a fondness for Kalbi / Galbi barbecue beef flanken ribs, and after experimenting with several brands, I found CJ not only to be most affordable, but by far the tastiest sauce available.<br /><br />The difference is the Korean pear and apple puree, which gives the marinade a mellow sweetness without the sulphury quality other Korean BBQ sauces tend to have.<br /><br />The one improvement that can be made, is I recommend adding roasted or fresh minced garlic.

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: Actually, the average of 3 stars that this has currently is about correct.<br />Here's what to expect if you buy this:<br />4 or 5 peices of lobster meat/claws in a brine wrapped in a parchment paper<br />As most canned seafood it is a bit salty<br />The amount of meat can be eaten in 4 or 5 bitefuls<br /><br />While this product is OK, it really just leaves one wanting fresh lobster as so many canned items end up tasting about the same. I think that this is a good product if for some reason you need or want canned lobster meat that has a long shelf life, in that regard it makes sense. If you are looking for something to make a great lobster roll, though this is not it, pretty much for your money you be better off to just go pick up a few frozen lobster tails, or even better a live lobster and go from there. You could take two of these cans mix it up with mayo, celery, and so on, and have an OK lobster roll, but a very expensive one that would be more than $30 for a sandwhich you could eat in 5 minutes. I still give it a few stars though because the taste is OK, and the meat is a fairly whole claw that is just without shell. You can't really substitue for a fresh product when it comes to seafood, esp. crab or lobster.

review/summary: Disgust in a can
review/text: As a broke college student, I ordered this product in an effort to save my boyfriend and me the money of going out to dinner on Valentine's Day.  I was going to cook with the lobster meat I ordered.  When it came in I was surprised by how small the can was, but I figured though small for 30 dollars it would still be very tasty.  When I got online to find the perfect recipe I found some bad reviews, so I decided to open one of the cans to see for myself.  I almost gagged as I pulled back the parchment paper because it smelt disgusting and the meat looked grayish and nasty.  Out of curiosity, I poked the meat and it was mush.  I felt like crying.  I cannot believe I wasted my money on this rancid product.  Please don't waste your money on this item, I would rather eat pigs feat than that smelly gray mush.  Now it's two days before my fancy home cooked dinner and no lobster :(

Without being redundant I suggest you read the other one star reviews and then spend your money wisely on some other form of lobster.  In fairness to Amazon I did not open the first can until long after purchase and way too long to expect a refund.  The second can sits unopened and may possibly be a $15 mistake to be thrown in the trash.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I purchased this product expecting a high quality lobster meat, most likely a whole lobster tail crammed into a tuna can - the best way I like it! I usually open the can and dump it in a saucepan full of butter and herbs and boil the meat for about 3 hours. While this lobster meat looked all oily and gross, like a Philip Seymour Hoffman sex scene, it was quite edible. I was getting ready to serve it on a bed of cornflakes (saw that on the Bigfoot Contessa) and to my amazement, found the product was full of hair, teeth and lobster bones! I knew I couldn't serve this to my guests, who were coming over for a very special dinner party to celebrate Casimir Pulaski Day. Instead of the lobster, I thawed some spinach, wonderbread and breakfast sausage meat, processed it in the food processor with a bit of egg and mayonnaise for binder, and stuffed the delectable mixture into halves of cling-peaches. I chilled them and served with a dash of cayenne pepper and a dusting of powdered sugar. While Ina-Garten-da-vida may not have approved, my friends did not complain, and I had TONS of leftovers!

I had a Korean fried, and am forever searching for the kind of seaweed sheets she always had at dinner. They were just a little salty, and tasted fabulous with rice. Guess I'll keep looking. My seven year old, incidentally, liked this stuff and didn't care about the lack of seasoning. He was pretty sad when we ran out.

review/summary: Korean Seasoned Seaweed
review/text: I must admit I was skeptical about ordering this seaweed, but decided to try it and use it for sushi if I did not like it as a snack. I don't typically eat seaweed, but I know it contains an extraordinary wealth of mineral elements from the sea, including (a) the mineral macronutrients, such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, chlorine, sulfur and phosphorus; and (b) the micronutrients, such as iodine, iron, zinc, copper, selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, manganese, boron, nickel and cobalt. And so I thought I'd give it a try. My order was delivered earlier today, and I just can't stop snacking on this seasoned seaweed. It is a complete surprise to me, but both its taste and its texture make for a great guilt-free snack. I love-love-love it, and I wish the package had more than 12 sheets in it.

review/summary: Fantastic flavor and heat if you get a good batch
review/text: I've been on a hot sauce kick for a while and worked my way up to some of the 'ultra hot' sauces.  I love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ITPE54">Blair's Death</a> sauces, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PZY08U">Mad Dog 357 Ghost Pepper</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033P2RN2">Satan's Blood</a> (for cooking), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DID5R">Dave's Insanity</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BVY02M">Ultimate Insanity</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00170OV48">Mad Dog 357</a>, and various other extract-based sauces.<br /><br />When I tried this sauce, it really blew my mind.  Where this sauce really stands out is flavor.  It does not use extracts, but is still extremely hot.  This sauce is like a fine Bordeaux compared with extract-based sauces that are like fortified wines (or in some cases like vodka).  This sauce has an amazingly pleasing and complex flavor (aroma) that lures you into believing that you are tasting a wonderfully flavorful but mild sauce.  Then the heat kicks in.  It slowly builds up over the course of a dozen or more seconds and produces an intense but wonderful pain and endorphin rush.  I was shocked and amazed that a sauce could be this flavorful and still be this intense.<br /><br />I also really love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LBNUUU">PAIN 100%</a> because it has a wonderful and complex flavor, but it is significantly less intense.  Mongoose Hot Sauce is hotter than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZSRWM">Blair's Ultra Death</a> (at least, based on my subjective taste comparisons with the bottles I got).<br /><br />The packaging of this sauce is really cool and includes an outer box, so it would make a nice gift.  The small bottle is compact enough to put in your pocket and take to restaurants.<br /><br />From the label, the ingredients are:<br /> * Bhut Jolokia Chiles<br /> * Fatalii Chiles<br /> * Vinegar<br /> * Natural Flavors<br /><br />If you are looking for something that is cheap and "stupid hot" for a practical joke, then look elsewhere.  If you are used to eating ultra hot sauces and want one with an excellent and unique flavor, then this is definitely worth trying.<br /><br />Edit: 11/25/11 -- I just started on a new bottle, and it is much milder and less flavorful than the first two bottles I tried.  It is even a different color and consistency (lighter color and much more watery).  Apparently some batches are a lot thicker and hotter than others.  Based on the 2nd batch, I am taking away a star.  The first batch was 5-stars for sure, but the 2nd is more like 3 stars since it isn't hot enough to be worth the high price for such a small bottle.

If you decide to give it chance make sure that your cats are real seafood lovers or try a few cans before buying it like a did; I bought 2 cases of each flavor (turkey, chicken etc...) so they are going to have eat it at some point.

review/summary: Hull filled Popcorn
review/text: This Orville popcorn should be sold with a warning. "Lots of hulls, choking hazard". Yes it pops up nicely with few unpopped kernels. It tastes great. But, it is dangerous. Those hulls get caught in your throat and are very difficult to wash down or cough up. So you choke on it until you can get it to move.

review/text: Even on the small cup setting of the elite, these are a little weak for me.  Make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak.  I also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them.

review/summary: If you like the taste of artificial sweetner it is ok.
review/text: I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,"It wasn't bad." Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself.

review/summary: highly recommended hot chocolate
review/text: They have some really good hot chocolate. I got a single pack before and it was so good that I reordered some more. I like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee (use a big cup).<br /><br />One thing to note: these dont have a strainer inside, the entire contents are meant to be used (unlike the coffee Kcups) so it will feel empty once done. I would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings. Use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out.<br /><br />Also, kids may not like the peppermint flavor.... But that is my favorite one. If you don't want to get the variety pack, they sell the individual flavors too.
