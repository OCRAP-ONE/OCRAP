review/text: I will keep this short and sweet because we all know that good products sell themselves. But I need to spread the word about this awesome hot sauce! The best thing I love about it is of course the taste, but also the ingredients!! For someone with food allergies (like me) I love a product with healthy ingredients that I can pronounce and know are good for me! You will not be disappointed with this hot sauce and while purchasing it you are supporting a great local business and community! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! Two thumbs up and 5 stars!

review/text: Picked this up at our local Christmas tree farm. If you lived in Everson you would understand. All of us loved it! I like that you can taste all the flavors that go into it and how nicely they blend together. It's the perfect amount of hot if your not looking to burn your mouth but looking to compliment your food. Goes well on burittos,tacos and even the scrambled eggs!

review/summary: My Cats Will Not Eat the New Formula
review/text: I chose to switch my cats to Felidae after the food they'd been eating for five years was discontinued and I had trouble finding something they liked that was safe for them to eat. Felidae seems to be one of the only brands not involved in the constant pet food recalls. I did start them on the non-senior variety and then moved to this when it was time to more closely watch their weight. They are healthy and shiny with fewer hairballs than they had in the past. UPDATE (June 13, 2012): I just got a new bag of this food. The formula seems to have changed (indicated by a new food shape), and my cats will no longer eat it.

review/summary: My cats LOVE this food....
review/text: I was very happy to finally find a food that my senior and overweight cats can share.  It tastes good enough that my finicky senior cats like it and will eat it.  And my 'fat cast' like it as well, but not so much that she gorges on it.  Not only have the overweight cats lost some weight; the coats on all four of the cats are nice and silky now.  I'd recommend this food for anyone with either senior cats or ones that need to lose some weight.

review/summary: Mary Kate the CRF feral kitty NOMMED it all up and nipped my finger to get more
review/text: If you sift through my other cat food reviews, you'll see that one of my cats is a feral queen who stayed inside with me after I tnr-ed her colony seven years ago.  In the last 6 months, she's been sick with what her vet has pretty much decided is CRF (she would have to be sedated for a confirmatory blood draw and the evidence from the dietary interventions is pretty strong).  So, I've tried and reviewed a number of kitty foods for price, quality, whether Mary Kate will eat them, and, if she will, whether she can keep them down.<br /><br />The Felidae Dry Food for Senior and Overweight Cats succeeded where the canned version of the same food failed.  Mary Kate absolutely refused to eat the canned food, wouldn't go near it, which was upsetting, because the quality of that food was amazing, especially for a lower protein selection.  While dry food is not generally the best choice in CRF, especially with a cat who cannot be hydrated with sub-q fluids, this particular dry food seems to agree quite nicely with my particular cat.  So far, knock wood, she keeps it down.  That's important, because once she vomits up a food she likes, she doesn't like it and won't eat it until she forgets the experience.<br /><br />And she really really loves this stuff.  More than sardines.  More than tuna.<br /><br />Weird.<br /><br />But the ingredients are of excellent quality.  Much better, actually, than the renal diet dry foods the vet suggested.  And the nutritional ratios are within the ranges the vet said were okay; we may want to use a phosphorus blocker at some point, though.<br /><br />If you're dealing with a kitty who's got CRF or another condition where you don't want to stress his or her kidneys, first, my sympathies (it's so hard to have someone you love be so sick), and second, try a small bag of this.  Introduce it slowly.  And, if your cat will eat it, see how it works.

review/summary: Excellent results with older, finicky eaters
review/text: I have 2 Maincoons - When they were young I gave them Iams thinking it was good food for them. Later after extensive research I switched very slowly to Felidae regular with good results (coat, energy, lack of urinary problems for one cat who tends to get them).<br /><br />In their 10th years I switched to Felidae platinum but I did it again very slowly - probably over a period of 3 to 4 months. First mixing a quarter platinum with 3/4 regular, then 1/2, etc.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the Platinum version: the food bowl is always available but the cat that was too plump lost weight and the cat that was too skinny gained some. One day I ran out and gave them some regular Felidae from a sample but that lead to quite a messy litter box (too much fat for older cats).<br /><br />I highly recommend this brand - a slow transition is key though.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: Not being an avid tea drinker, I typically shy away from continuing to try new tea products. I was browsing the organic section of a local store and saw this and thought maybe it was time to try getting back on the horse. I purchased it 2 days ago and a few minutes ago is the first time I've tried it - all I can say is WOW. I bought the TAZO packets of Chai Tea previously and was tasked with heating milk on a stove top, mixing perfectly, only to get a pretty terrible result. 1/2 cup skim milk + 1/2 cup of this concentrate, 1.5 minutes in the micro = heaven. This is definitely going on my permanent shopping list.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: I bought several different brands of the Chai concentrate from Amazon, as there are few options in my rural area's grocery stores.<br /><br />The Tazo Organic Chai is my favorite.  It most closely matches that served by Starbucks.  Only difference is it doesn't have the foam.  I've been told it is what they use.<br /><br />Tazo decaf is my second choice.  Strangely, it is not as good as the Tazo Organic Chai... not as spicy, but OK for drinking in the evening.<br /><br />The Oregon Chai Original is not as good in my opinion as the Tazo.  It is missing something.  Not enough cardamon or pepper or something.<br /><br />The Oregon Chai Sugar-free was very disappointing.  I was hoping there was a good sugar-free option out there as I'd like to avoid the daily calories from my Chai habit.  It just takes like plain tea with mil in my opinion.  It seems to mostly lack the complex, spicy flavor or the Tazo Chai.  Not sure why that is.  The sweetener should have no bearing on the other ingredients.  I have been unable to find any suitable concentrated, sugar-free Chai tea options.  Post if you find one.

review/text: Oregon Chai Tea Latte is my absolute favorite (yes, even better than Tazo's), and getting it in the sugar-free version means I can still enjoy it while reducing my calories and carbs. Their Original flavor is the best, but they have done a great job on making this sugar-free version. It is very rich, so I mix mine in this ratio: 1/2 cup concentrate, 1/2 cup fat free milk, 1/2 cup water. It comes out perfect that way!

review/text: I've had the regular Oregon Chai and I really loved it.  Decided to try a 'healthier' alternative with this.  I don't know how using Splenda to sweeten it changed it so much, because compared to the regular Oregon Chai, this Sugar-Free one is very watery and very sweet tasting.  I can't taste any of the spices in it at all, I even drank the stuff straight to check if it was the milk I was using.  After I've gotten through these 6 cartons I'm going back to regular Chai and just going to try to cut down on my consumption.

review/text: I love the Oregon Sugar Free Chai. I really prefer Oregon chais to the Starbucks chai -- the Starbucks Tazo chai is very peppery, which I think actually overwhelms the complexity of the other spices. The Oregon chai, on the other hand, lets you taste the cinnamon and the cardamom, which I love. And it's great that it's available Sugar Free, so if you're looking for a low-calorie chai, this is a great choice. I really recommend it, and with the Subscribe and Save offer, it's a great deal!

review/text: What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.

review/summary: Happy Cat
review/text: My cat will only eat the Whiskas Choice cuts with beef.  My local stores quit carrying this product and I bought any cat food similar to it, regardles of price.  My cat ate only dry food for two months or more.  He lost weight that he can't afford to lose. I am so happy that I found this Whiskas item on Amazon.

review/summary: My cat's favorite flavor
review/text: It is hard to get just one falvor of this product. I was very happy to order 48 pouches. However, when they arrived the out side of the box label was turkey in gravy but they contained mixed grill instead. I could not return but Amazon gave me a total refund. If you are ordering this, wait about 10 days (after 9/1/12)so you don't receive Mixed Grill like I did. It was labeled wrong from the factory so it will take them a while to get new shippments.

review/summary: They run me over to get their Cod and Shrimp...
review/text: Another popular seafood flavor that Sophie and Samson won't share.  When I bend down to place their bowls in front of them, they are on their back legs trying to get to it before I can put the bowl on the floor.  They act like they have not been fed in days. Nothing will disturb them - not even their favorite UPS man who brings them treats.  Can't beat Amazon prices !!!

review/summary: My cats go crazy!
review/text: Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store.

review/text: Cats love this stuff. One pouch doesn't go far so it is more of a treat than a meal (unless you feed according to recommendations on box).<br /><br />Pouches are easy to open and a little messy, always seems to get on my fingers.<br /><br />My cats come running if they see me reach for the pouch or they hear the sound of flicking it back and forth before opening.<br /><br />All the yucky stuff (think fast food for cats) must be addicting because they seem to listen for the very quiet sound of the rustling pouch.  We give pouches as a treat.

review/summary: Tasty food for a picky cat
review/text: Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.

review/summary: My cats come running
review/text: I have two big cats that are over 15 lbs. each.  For breakfast, I give them each a packet of Whiskas Choice cuts.  They inhale the food in about 2-3 minutes.  This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.  There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Cat Food Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> are more expensive and very similar.<br /><br />I have these on Subscribe and Save so the price is pretty good.  Based upon my cats reaction, they really like this food.

When cooled,add some vinegrette dressing(I like to use roasted walnut oil by Roland,red wine vinegar,s+p) chop some sweet onions,effortless and healthy side dish,goes well with chicken, fish, or red meat.  on meatless nights i like it along with quinoa or basmati rice.

review/text: There are a number of dry dog foods that are nutritionally similar to this. We've tried several of them. My dogs like most foods, but they get bored eventually so we try something new. They love Dogswell Vitality! In fact, I bought this and two other new foods. They immediately preferred this one. No corn/wheat means my dogs won't have digestion problems. Also, one of my dogs needs more bulk, and this food has more fiber than others we've tried.

review/summary: Dogswell Products.....
review/text: We have a Lab/Retriever Mix that we rescued from a shelter about six years ago.<br />Baxter (the dog) developed an allergy to the food he was eating and began to lick and chew on his paws incessantly.  It was beyond annoying.....keeping us up at night..  We were given a suggestion to try Dogswell Vitality.  This was the best advice we had ever been given.  The licking and chewing stopped.  We were not feeding him cheap dog food to start with, but he did develop an allergy to it.  We have been using Dogswell for about 3 years.  I wish we had known about it sooner.<br /><br />Dogswell Vitality did cost more....however it lasts longer...considering the fact that you feed your dog less per meal.  I am very happy with Dogswell products.

review/summary: EXCELLENT FOR DOGS WITH ALLERGIES
review/text: This food is wonderful for our Shar-Pei mix.  He suffered from terrible skin allergies until we pinpointed the source as a food sensitivity.  The Dogswell food doesn't contain the ingredients (wheat, corn, etc.) that other foods contain that tend to be an irritant for sensitive dogs.  Not only has this alleviated his skin allergies - he seems to love the taste too!  Our other dog who does not suffer from allergies eats it too and she loves it. Being able to order this directly from Amazon has been wonderful and is SO much more cost effective than in the specialty pet stores!  Thank you Dogswell and Amazon!

review/text: This is great food, quality ingredients and apparently delicious. Sydney, our Aussie mix usually struggles when we change her food, however that was not the case when we switched to Vitality, she loves this stuff.  The best thing about this food is how it is processed by her body - the resulting poop is small, solid and easy to pick up - while all poop stinks there is a huge difference between using a quality dog food like Vitality and something of less quality that you pick up off the grocery shelf. The other advantage to a higher quality food is I don't have to be overly concerned when my toddler decides it would make a yummy afternoon snack.  Overall we are very happy with this food.

review/text: My dogs LOVE this food.  They had a lot of intestinal problems before we started feeding them this food and all of those problems seem to have cleared up.  It is VERY expensive, but it is healthy and rated as one of the best dog foods.  Our boys love it and they seem to be doing better now that they are on a better diet.  The only complaint I have is with Amazon because the subscribe and save price has risen $5/bag since I started ordering the food from them 5 months ago.  But the price is mostly worth it because my boys are happy and healthier.

review/summary: My Husky's favorite food
review/text: We love this dog food. When our Husky was adopted, he was underweight, had a dull coat and was lethargic.  After some trial and error with getting him to eat, and all the dog food recalls, we found Dogswell. Now his coat is absolutely beautiful, his weight is perfect and he has a ton of happy Husky energy. We get compliments all the time about how soft, shiny and pronounced his coat is. We also notice less year round shedding and just deal with the seasonal coat blow. He is a finicky eater, but always excited for mealtime on Dogswell food. He also used to scratch and lick his one leg raw in spots. Once we started Dogswell,his itches and rashes never came back.  He never gets an upset stomach, poops less often because there is no filler. I cannot recommend this food enough. We've tried other brands such as Blue Buffalo, AvoDerm, Organix and nothing has compared to how well our dog does on Dogswell foods. We go back and forth between Vitality and Happy Hips, depending on what Amazon has available with no ill effects.

review/summary: The only dog food my dog eats without salmon oil on top
review/text: I've had dogs my whole life and I've never seen such a picky eater as my pooch Sofia.  She's now 2, as healthy as can be, but won't eat.  I've tried tough love, going 5 days taking her bowl away when she refused food and I sorta believe she didn't like her food du jour for a reason (allergy, taste, something...).  I've tried at least 20 different kinds of high quality and expensive brands.  I had taken to squirting Salmon oil on the top of her kibble to make it more appealing and that generally worked for the types she was 'ok' with.<br /><br />However, Sofia eats this Vitality product without Salmon oil, days of starvation or visiting dogs which would sometimes prompt her to action.  For me and really for Sofia, this is the best food made.  Honestly I really can't believe a dog won't eat but she loves this!!!<br /><br />**2/20/12:  Updated Review<br />The picky dog is back, I had to buy more salmon oil so I can finish the bag.  Oh well it was nice while it lasted....It seems she liked the smaller bags much more than the large (22.5 lb) bags.  She didn't even give that food a second look but always ate the 4 lb bag food.

review/summary: tastes good but could have wheat in it
review/text: I ate these pretzels for years and loved them and YES they are a great value.  I am wheat sensitive so spelt products are what I use for a substitute.  A law was passed a few years ago that requires companies to label their spelt products in the ingredients section as:  Spelt flour (wheat flour).  (I'm not going to get into why they do this here).  BUT this allows the companies to cut the spelt flour with 50% or less wheat flour and still call it spelt.  This was a nightmare for me, and after attempting to contact Vitaspelt to ask if they did cut the product with wheat flour, they never answered me so I don't eat their product for fear it will make me sick.  If you aren't wheat sensitive it's a great product, if you are BEWARE.  There is another great alternative, Newmans Spelt pretzels.  They do not have the wheat label on them and I switched to eating those years ago...very tasty!

review/summary: Old fashion fresh taste
review/text: This was a bit of a surprise to me.  I've been working at eating healthy for 20 years, I'm from the era where "white" meant pure and healthy.  So I make the best choices I can with the info I can find yet still eat somewhat "mainstream".  So for a crunchy snack, that meant whole wheat pretzels, and I enjoy them, the sweet wheat taste is nice.  However, I saw these and I was curious, the price is certainly reasonable compared to purchasing locally so I gave them a go - how bad could they be? They are amazingly like the fresh crunchy pretzels of my youth which included bleached white flour.  So much like them that I re-checked the ingredients.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was expecting something different, perhaps that might take some getting used to but these are just great.  I would change brands for one with sea salt, but for now, I'm happy that my snacking can be a bit healthier.  If you are looking for wheat free, healthier or just wanting to try something different, I think you might enjoy these.

review/text: My daughter and I have been on a 'wheat free' diet for several years now.  WE are thankful for the health benefits that these choices have opened for us.  One top food item I've missed the most have been good, crunchy pretzels!  These Spelt pretzels fit that niche wonderfully!  Wow!  The bags are a good size that keep us going for snacks and dipping.  They are fantastic!!!<br /><br />I just came back to Amazon to order more and I was shocked at the price change.  Only two months ago, I paid just over $2 a bag....  and now it is about $3.60 a bag!!!  What's up with that?  I suppose then I'll have to look in stores to find a better price.  I sure would have ordered more in a heartbeat had I know the prices would change so much....  now I feel like I'm 'back to the drawing board'.

review/text: These came a bit to soft and mushy.  The ones that were dried better were delicious.  I would say the bottom half of each bad were spoiled.  The peaches were not fulled dried.  They should be soft and somewhat moist but half of these were mushy and beginning to spoil.  I emptied them into a large container without fully inspecting them then tossed the plastic packaging.  I immediately tossed them in the fridge but quickly learned half were spoiled as I ate them.  If had kept the packaging I would have returned them and probably would have given them a chance at replacing them instead of refunding my purchase price.<br /><br />If you purchase these inspect the product fully before storing.  Maybe I just got a bad batch,that is why I gave them a 3 out of 5 in stead of  1.

review/summary: Too costly on Amazon
review/text: This is a really good oolong tea. I love the sweet flavors that are inherent in the leafs. It is good for at least 4 brews if not more. I just follow the instructions on the packaging and It comes out tasting great every time. I use just over a teaspoon of leaves because the leaves are not balled up like some teas, they are more loosely dried.<br /><br />I bought this directly from the company, and I did the math. On Amazon 1.75 oz * 3 cans sells for $24.61 as of 9/6/11. However, if you were to buy directly from Rishi-tea.com you would actually save money per ounce. This is the link - [...]<br /><br />On Amazon: 4.69 per oz and you get 5.25 oz.<br /><br />At Rishi: 4.25 per oz and you get 1/4 lb.<br /><br />If you want even more of this wonderful tea, you can buy in bulk and get the tea for even cheaper!<br /><br />The only reason to get this tea on Amazon at the current price is if you have free Prime shipping, want to share with 3 people, like the tin cans, or like to burn money.

review/text: This is one of my two "afternoon" black teas (the other being Twining's Afternoon Tea.) It isn't nearly bold enough for my morning palate. I love hot beverages, including coffee, tea, chocolate, and even herbal coffee substitutes. I wouldn't describe myself as particularly sophisticated in evaluating them, however.<br /><br />This oolong really does lack the astringency I associate with black tea. I would describe the flavor as mellow and smoky, but not aggressive in any way.<br /><br />I think the bit about this being a weight loss tea sold me on trying it, though I'm feeling too lazy to diet, so I can't really say whether this Wuyi Oolong could help in that regard.<br /><br />If I'm not in the mood for green or white tea, and I'm not feeling too lazy to deal with loose leaf tea, then this is what I take in the afternoon.

review/summary: Solid, Affordable Oolong
review/text: Every product I've tried by Rishi thus far has been of good quality. Granted, there is higher quality to be found but it will come with a higher price tag. In my opinion, this is one of the best wuyi oolongs in the price range. The flavor is a bit hard to describe. It is very toasty and there is a little hint of pleasant smokiness. It is light in body while still being rich and robust. There is a definite caramel/chocolate-esque sweetness to it, and flavors slightly reminiscent of honey. If you're new to loose teas and interested in trying a wuyi oolong, then I highly recommend this as a good place to start. It is very soothing and comforting, and makes a great pair with carbohydrate-rich meals such as pasta and bread. This is good stuff.

review/summary: The Horror...
review/text: I've championed a number of Rishi's Chinese teas (and their chais) because they're excellent. This, unfortunately, was my introduction to Wu Yi oolongs many moons ago. Had I not looked farther, I'd have dismissed the entire category.<br />Wu Yi "rock" oolongs are processed from bushes that thrive in mineral-rich soil. They tend to be on the "dark" side, i.e., rather highly oxidized. The best of them are sublime; however, that's not to say that there aren't good rock oolongs to be found that won't require that you refinance your home.<br />In general, though, you get what you pay for. I trusted my previous experiences with Rishi, plus their description of this one's profile sounded right up my alley (someone over there writes very good copy). At the price, I figured that I couldn't go wrong.<br />I was in error.<br />The only thing I taste in this tea is smoke; it tastes like the leavings of a campfire. This is fine for a Lapsang red tea, but it's totally out of place in an oolong. Quite frankly, this is the worst "specialty" tea I've ever bought, and I don't believe it's due to a mere matter of taste--it's just bad, like Liquid Smoke. The fact that it's organic in no way compensates for the fact that it's almost undrinkable.<br />I wasn't going to review this tea given that "if you can't say anything nice, ...," etc. However, Amazon made the point of recommending this to me, so I felt I had to set the record straight. Bottom line: look elsewhere to become acquainted with Wu Yi oolongs...unless you're a pretentious Finnish ugly-boy stalker-troll with liver-lips, of course.

review/text: This could possibly be the best tasting chip I have ever eaten. It has a nice smokey bacon flavor. I would make sure this item was always stocked in my pantry if the price was not so high for the amount you get, or if they would sell this "AMAZING" chip here in the states. I would highly recomend someone paying the price one time just to try this.

review/text: The crisps are awesome. Give me English crisps over american chips any day! I recommend them to everyone. The smoky bacon are my favorite but the cheddar bacon are almost as good.
