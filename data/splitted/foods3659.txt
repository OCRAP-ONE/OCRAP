review/summary: Good taste
review/text: This is my favorite of the Senseo pods I have tried. It is only 10% Kona so I didn't expect it to taste as good as the 100% Kona or Kona peaberry  I'd bought from coffee growers in Hawaii. I was surprised, though, because it was fuller and richer than I had expected. It's my new go-to pod coffee. :)

review/text: As the only coffee drinker in my house, I find the Senseo Pods (and coffee maker) a wonderful convenience. I love the taste of the dark pods; the coffee taste is bold and never bitter. And I love that crema layer. I am so happy these are back in stock.<br /><br />I'm hoping once the supply becomes more stabilized, Amazon will, again, offer these with the subscription service.

review/text: I had Senseo Columbian coffee pods on a subscription for some time, and then suddenly it wasn't available any more...anywhere.  Just recently, I noticed that this brand and type of coffee were again available through Amazon, so I quickly ordered some.  I'm enjoying it now, and just this week placed another order.  I like the flavor of this coffee very much and hope it continues to be available, even though a subscription is not.  During the Senseo hiatus, I tried several other pod brands, but every one was too weak for my taste.

review/summary: Love the Kona Coffee
review/text: Senseo was pulled from the shelves at all the local supermarkets.  Everything seems to be going K-Cup.  Thankfully Amazon continues to carry Senseo.  Still making this in our $20 Senseo one-cup brewer, and with the senseo pods we are paying $0.37 a cup compared to $0.94 a cup from a K-Cup.  That is less than half (almost a third) of what you have to pay for a cup from a Keurig.<br />Able to make a single cup at a time, at a very reasonable price, and really like the Kona.  Plus I know that when the pod ends up in the landfill it probably won't last the hundreds of years a K-Cup will..Could not be happier!

review/summary: Easy to prepare, full rich flavor
review/text: I purchased two Senseo machines-one for home and the other for a vacation home-in 2004.  The ease of preparation, excellent price point and wide availability of the pods sold me on Senseo.<br />Sadly, it's now impossible to purchase pods in a common grocery store.  Although the coffee is quite good, the hastle of mail ordering has made me regret my choice.  If I must order online I would prefer a true espresso machine.  I am purchasing 2 Nespresso machines soon.  Senseo really failed me.

review/summary: It's good to have Senseo back...
review/text: I'm not a food critic, and I don't differentiate subtle differences in prime coffee, but still, Senseo is MUCH BETTER than K-Cup.  It is just a no brainer - foamy coffee with rich flavor equipped with convenience makes Senseo a second to none.  I was very disappointed to see that no stores carry Senseo any more, but Amazon brought it back.  Thank you so much!<br /><br />Last night my wife and I found Senseo medium roast makes a great iced coffee as well.  Just pour coffee into an ice-filled cup, then put it in the freezer for about 5 min.  You'll see all those foams frozen!  Very cool. :)

review/summary: Do not buy Keurig, you are only helping them
review/text: Apparently, I am unhappy with the price jolt of this coffee, which I use daily. I am even more unhappy with the discontinuation of the coffee makers and the fact that the coffee pods can only be found on Amazon or on the senseo website for this new higher price. However, I really believe that even though disappointed, we should not simply go and buy a Keurig system. This heavy impractical and not-tasting-so-well system that flooded the US market in the past 3-4 years should not benefit and celebrate the pushing away of its competitor. I kind of believe that the whole thing is a scheme done on purpose so that Keurig can monopolize the market. And if everybody who is frustrated with not finding the senseo pods, jumps to Keurig, that just fulfills their goal.<br />As a cheaper alternative, use the Melitta pods. I just ordered them, have not tasted them, but the reviews said they are pretty similar. Let us hope so. And let us hope that Senseo will find a way to stay in the US market and even reclaim some of its lost presence.

review/summary: Good ol' Senseo
review/text: I have a Senseo single serve coffee maker that has been working beautifully for years.  It uses recyclable paper pods that are like tea bags -- so there is no metal or plastic waste associated with the coffee.  The Senseo Dark Roast coffee pods make a very good, hearty cup of coffee.  My only concern is that the Senseo coffee pods are no longer readily available.  Most supermarkets no longer stock the packages of pods -- they allocate their shelf space to Keurig products.  I am happy that Amazon still sells them but only in bulk (a box of six packages, 18 pods each).

review/summary: Dark Roast Production Problems
review/text: Having used the Senseo Dark Roast pods for years, I was happy when Amazon got them back in stock.  But the coffee is now undrinkable--it is incredibly bitter; I ended up throwing it out.  To make sure it was not just me, I made a cup for a friend who LOVES the Dark Roast, and she also said that it was very bitter.<br /><br />Called Senseo.  The rep said that he had gotten other complaints of a similar nature: that the new blend was bitter.  He said that it might have been a problem at the factory, since the new batches were supposed to taste the same as the older batches.  (The former factory has closed down, and they are manufacturing the new batches in a different factory.)  However, the new bags also say "French Roast' not just "Dark Roast" so this may account for the difference--but French roasted coffee should not be bitter.<br /><br />For those who are concerned that the pods no longer say "Senseo" on the top, they are not counterfeit.  I was told that Senseo decided to eliminate the printing, since it made the pod fractionally thicker and some customers had problems with the top of the pod tearing.  Removing the printing would hopefully do away with this problem.  However, this is the least of my worries, since these pods will have to be thrown out and I do not have any of the older Senseo Dark Roast pods remaining.<br /><br />UPDATE: The following day, having written the scathing review above, I decided to open another bag and see if those pods were as awful as those in the first bag before I threw out all remaining five bags of pods.<br /><br />To my surprise, these pods were fine and the coffee tasted just like the older version.  Clearly there is a problem in the production in the new factory.  I did not want to open the other four bags now, since they would lose their freshness, but it is still possible that the coffee in some of those is also horrible.  But at least I feel better knowing that Senseo did not change the formula for the Dark Roast.  Now they just have to get their production kinks worked out.<br /><br />Amazon, of course, was great in dealing with the problem.

review/text: We ordered 4 boxes of Senseo pods, which came out to 24 packs. We love the Senseo machine and these flavors, but we had a defect in the product shipped. In almost every single pack, there were 2-3 pods in which ground coffee was leaking out of the seams. Not only were those pods unusable, but every other pod was covered with fine grounds. I'm not sure if it is a manufacturers defect or reflects rough treatment of the product during shipping.

Doesn't that mean sipping Chardonnay and wearing turtlenecks?  But on opening the package, we found three generous pieces of cheese with interesting names my wife knew, but I could not pronounce. When we opened them on Thanksgiving, everyone enjoyed tasting them and were impressed with the quality -- uh, including me.  So I learned that fancy cheese really does add to the enjoyment of a gathering and enhances the taste of my other favorites -- those IPA's and Cab's.  I don't know if it was just an accident, but it arrived the night before Thanksgiving -- perfect timing.  And there was a chill-pack in the box which kept the cheese in perfect condition.<br /><br />What a nice gift!  Thanks, Son!

review/text: This seasoning is good for anything.  Chicken, fish, pork, beef, veggies, you name it.  Also purchasing it in a 3 pack - we will have this for a long time.  The stores only carry the small ones... When you live far from a store, it's nice to have the option to purchase in a larger size.

review/text: I first discovered this product by chance in Walmart on my visit  to The United States in September 2009 from Nigeria.<br /><br />I have used several spices and seasonings in the past but since I discovered this Badia complete seasoning I have not used any other. It is truly complete. It is good with and for everything, seasoning, salads, marinade and whatever else one needs it for.<br /><br />I am delighted to find it on Amazon.com.<br /><br />It makes life easy for me as I can always get it whenever I need it.

review/summary: Great Seasoning!!!!!
review/text: A lady I made friends with on a recipe website turned me on to this stuff, and it is all of that!!!!  I use it when I make Chili, and other recipes that have a Latin twist.  I can taste the cilantro, and it has a very nice balance of herbs and spices.  It will be an excellent ingredient for Indian Curries, because the flavor profile suits it nicely.  So, glad I took her advice.  The Amazon price is very economical.  I kept two bottles for myself and gave one to my son..(I cook a lot more than he does).<br /><br />  You won't be disappointed.  This stuff is really good.

review/summary: Surprisingly artificial for something all natural
review/text: There used to be a small tea store near my house which sold a blend called Mango Melange, which was absolutely amazing.  After they went out of business, I tried to find it online.  This product had the same name and a very similar ingredients list, but it is not nearly as good.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, expecting a refreshingly tangy aroma, I instead felt like I'd been hit in the face by someone spraying perfume samples at a department store.  There was no complex blending of ingredients, just a wall of cloying extract.  The effect is a little better once the tea is brewed.  I plan to drink it all before I go looking for my next tea, but the next one won't be from adagio.<br /><br />Their flavored rooibos teas have the same problem -- the hazelnut and apricot extracts were so overpowering and cloying I couldn't taste the rooibus.  In their chocolate chai, you can't taste the chocolate, the ginger, or the tea; it's just a wall of cinnamon extract.  I may actually throw out the chai without finishing it.<br /><br />So the mango melange is drinkable, (and their dewey cherry is actually pretty decent) but stay away from adagio if you care at all about the complexity of flavor in your tea.

review/summary: Could grow it WAY cheaper...
review/text: Honestly... certain things are a huge rip off, and this is one of them. Horned melons you can grow yourself, in almost any climate zone. I live in northern Wisconsin, planted some seeds in doors in about March, and moved them outside in June... had fruit this summer. They have almost the same growth pattern as cucumbers... fast, viney, thorny and whatnot. If you want to have this fruit, buy a pouch of seeds from somewhere online, grow them yourself, eat some... and save some seeds for the following year. I also had success having it fruit in a five gallon pot, in my bedroom next to a east facing window... Took a little bit longer, but they did it!<br /><br />ALSO, these pictures don't show the truth behind the horns... they are sharp, they hurt, they will make you bleed... I suggest getting some thick winter gloves on and just take scissors and cut the points off.

review/text: My title does not refer to the price, although kiwanos are becoming more common in grocery stories.  Rather, my title asks why pay for an expensive fruit when you can just eat the seeds of a cucumber?  Sure, everyone should try a kiwano at least once if only to discover a fruit that tastes like a vegetable.  Or you might want to use one or two for artistic effect in a fruit bowl.  But its certainly not going to replace the orange as a common fruit.

review/text: I eat organic candied ginger for an upset stomach or when I'm craving something sweet and it's the only thing I have available. I think these ginger mints taste much the same except for the texture. I was surprised at the pepper comment since candied ginger has a peppery spice flavor which is expected. They remind me of Altoids only slightly less intense. To my knowledge this is the only brand that makes organic mints in this flavor. At Amazon's current price point these would be a bargain even if they were not organic.

I bought them to help settle my stomach on long car rides. They do help, but after trying both... the ginger Altoids are better. If you're looking for a strong ginger candy without a ton of sugar, these things are great! If you're looking for a nausea remedy, try Altoids (one of those packs about the same punch as four of the Newman's). But Newman's gingers taste better than Altoids.

review/summary: Love the tin, hate the taste.
review/text: I'm adventurous when trying new foods and the fun, graphic tin definitely gave me the extra push to try these organic ginger mints. Well, lets just say they're not going on my 'Most Awesome Foods Ever!' list.<br />I'm not a huge fan of ginger, but figured I'd give these a try anyway. They're not a 'smooth' candy like some mints are (slightly gritty) and have a sharp ginger 'bite' towards the middle-end that lingers for long after its dissolved. They're so potent, I tasted it for a good hour after just one had been finished. I  gave it to family members who don't mind the taste of ginger and they too were disappointed in how they tasted. While I'm not going back to these, the other flavors do interest me.<br />Points though, for the hinged, reusable tin (I'm thinking they'd be great for the LUSH Cosmetics line of soap chunks and solid shampoo slices that are sold by the pound and dissolve in the shower if they're not dried, tinned and moved out of the bathing area. Also great for use when traveling with the soaps/shampoos and cheaper than buying one of their branded tins).<br />Made in Mexico, mine contained about 40, beige-colored mints.

review/text: I LOVE Newman's Ginger Mints. I like them much better than Altoid's ginger mints because: better and stronger ginger flavor; and consistency of the mint (Altoid's are hard as rocks, though I guess that's not a big deal since they're supposed to be dissolved slowly in your mouth).<br /><br />This 6-pack is also the best price I could find and I use the "subscribe and save" delivery option, so save a few more $$ that way. I have had trouble finding them in my local health food stores, so I just keep coming back to Amazon to purchase them. I have a tin in my purse, one in my car, another on my desk. Like I said, I love these things.<br /><br />Plus, I carry an extra tin in my purse to give away, which I do about every other week. When I offer a mint to acquaintances or friends when I'm helping myself to one, almost all say "yum ... these are good - where'd you get them?" Then I whip out the extra tin and give them a little gift. So, I get to spread some love and we all get to enjoy these :)

review/summary: Mexican Vanilla Beans Live Up to Their Reputation
review/text: Whole vanilla beans come in three "flavors":  Mexican, Tahitian, and Bourbon-Madagascar.  Because Mexican beans are reputed to have the boldest, best vanilla flavor, I had to try some in my favorite "speckled vanilla" ice cream recipe.  Usually I make this recipe with the more common Bourbon-Madagascar beans.<br /><br />The Mexican  beans did not disappoint:  they produced an especially delicious, full-flavored vanilla ice cream.  In the future, Mexican vanilla beans will always be my first choice for making plain vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />The Mexican vanilla beans that I purchased from Arizona Vanilla were plump, moist, and beautiful.  Although they were a little more expensive than Bourbon-Madagascar beans, they were still far less expensive than the whole vanilla beans sold in spice jars in grocery stores.  The Mexican beans were a little shorter and smaller than the Bourbon-Madagascar beans that I purchased from a different seller, but this is probably a characteristic of the different plant types.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great book of ice cream recipes, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060187654">The Best Ice Cream Maker Cookbook Ever</a>, which includes the "speckled vanilla" recipe.  (The "speckles" are the tiny vanilla seeds that you scrape out of the whole vanilla bean pods.)

review/summary: Didn't seem very fresh.
review/text: These beans were not plump and soft and poignant, like the other beans we ordered from a different seller.  They were quite expensive, considering their quality.  That being said, it is harder to find Mexican Vanilla beans--the other buyer we bought Madagascar beans from doesn't sell Mexican vanilla beans at all.  I'm sure our Mexican Vanilla is still going to turn out well.  I was just spoiled with the other beans, I guess.

review/text: The Mexican beans that I ordered from Arizona Vanilla Co. came from a company called Halal Everyday. Halal means lawful or clean according to Islamic law. I am not Muslim and feel that failing to disclose the fact that food/food products are prepared according to religious laws that I do not accept is a fraud. Arizona should state that their products are Halal for the benefit of all their customers Muslim and non-Muslim.

Fast and friendly service.<br /><br />"Just a spoonful of black rice bran contains more health promoting anthocyanin antioxidants than are found in a spoonful of blueberries, but with less sugar and more fiber and vitamin E antioxidants," said Zhimin Xu, Associate Professor at the Department of Food Science at Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in Baton Rouge, La., who reported on the research. "If berries are used to boost health, why not black rice and black rice bran? Especially, black rice bran would be a unique and economical material to increase consumption of health promoting antioxidants."[...]

review/summary: Hummus on Crackers
review/text: Since this is/was  my first experience tasting hummus, I have no basis for comparison. It was with some trepidation that I took my first bite of Wild Garden hummus in the individual squeeze packet.<br /><br />I liked it. I liked it. After the first cracker spread with hummus, I ate another and another until all of the hummus was gone. The tast reminds me of the Frito Lay bean dip we sometimes have, but the tast of the hummus is a little milder.<br /><br />The size of the packet is perfect for an individual's lunch or a nice pick me up snack. The user is directed to refrigerate any leftover hummus, but with the size of these packets I doubt there will be any refrigerating done around her.<br /><br />It may not be potato based, but I can certainly recommend this product based on taste and convenience.

review/summary: Disappointing snack
review/text: I love hummus and this had an OK taste albeit, in my opinion, too lemony. I had an issue with the little container, however. It really took scissors to open and the way it was shaped, I felt like I left a good portion of the hummus in the container when I could squeeze no more out onto a pita chip. Didn't seem like much of a portion, anyhow. Frankly, I was irritated at the price. I guess I didn't shop carefully enough but today it is for sale at this Amazon vendor for $10.95 when I paid $19.00 for same amount. Big price swing! This price is more like it!  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00759MFUC">Wild Garden Traditional Hummus Dip</a>

review/summary: Very pleasant alternative to stronger, pricier Roquefort
review/text: Having received some Blue D'Auvergne along with several other artisan cheeses this Xmas, I was very pleased with the smoothness of this Blue. Unlike the more famous roquefort, D'Auvergne is slightly milder, with less of an after-flavor.  It does not overpower one's tastes and is a good choice for those looking for the strength of a french Bleu but wishing to avoid offending delicate palettes.  <p>This cheese is made from Sheep's Milk and contains the famed veins of blueish bacteria that give the cheese its signature flavor. This Blue was not wet nor sticky as many of the trendier Blues of late seem to have become. Neither has it the overly dry texture of say an English Blue Stilton, a traditional holiday Blue cheese on its own or in combination with the English Gloucster Cheddar and referred to as &quot;Huntsman&quot; cheese, whcih is very pretty, but suitable only as a dessert cheese or for afternoon Tea owing to its dryness.<p>Blue D'Auvergne, on the other hand, has a subtle creamy texture without being overly moist. Some Bleus err on the side of moistness now to the point of being more similar to a triple-creme.  Not so this Bleu. D'Auvergne slices well with the proper cutlery and can be crumbled if you'd like it that way.  It melted well atop a pear tart we made and complimented the sandy sweetness of the pears wtihout overpowering their delicate flavor &amp; scent as a Bleu such as Roquefort would have easily done.  This is a fine addition to the French Bleus and it was a pleasure to have on hand at a time when rich foods were bieng served and the D'Auvergne could be used to sprinkle atop a lightly seared Filet mignon with a sultana reduction sauce or tossed into a simple salad of dandilion greens, leftover crushed walnuts,and nasturtium vinegrette. The possibilities are endless.<p>This cheese was not too rich but was just rich enough to enhance any dish it graced. It's light tang was never overpowering, rather it added a gentle dash of excitment to the foods with which we paired it. Although there was none left over for a simpler dish, I would have loved to have tried it on its own either with wine or as part of a fruit plate.  I look forward to getting more of this fine cheese.

review/text: Ooooooo-aaaaaah!!!!  Finnao was right on with his assessment of Blue D'auvergne. It is fantastically and surprizingly sophisticated for an aged blue.  I picked some up at my local specialty grocery.  They rotate their cheese selection fairly often, and this time, they just happened to have the Blue D'auvergne. What with my being lactose intolerant, I'm always looking for any aged cheese - but I was seriously craving some blue.  The B D'A. was suggested to me, and I didn't go wrong.  The initial flavor is distinctly blue, yet subtle in the aftermath, leaving a craving for more.  This cheese is gonna get me in serious diet trouble!

review/text: I LOVED this cheese. I am not always a fan of all blue cheeses but I found this one to be very balanced, a little butttery with just a hint of that pungent 'bleu' flavor. I found it worked best with a slightly sweet wine. Also great as an appitizer with walnuts, apples, pears, crackers and grapes. It works well on a salad and I could imagine making all kinds of things with this cheese. I reccommend letting it reach room temperature to bring out the subtle flavors.

review/summary: I'll take the orchid please!
review/text: Bought this tea as a result of being captured by a salesperson who made it impossible to say "no" and I am 100% to blame.  Never been a pushover but now, I have joined the club.  This tea is terrific and that is all that is important.  Our family has about 7-10 teas available at any one time and the Shanghai Orchid is a great "accent tea" to the plain teas...take a straight jasmine pearl or the Darjeeling or the silver needle and add some of the Orchid...wow!  The smell of flowers translates to taste beautifully.  Of course the price is high and I find it is confusing to purchase tea in the shop because of the "ounce" pricing...however if you use this tea as an accent rather than a straight tea, the idea is it will last longer.  My favorite is using this tea with any plan jasmine.  Amazing!

My all-time favorite ice tea has been the tropical passion one until now.  Shangri La ice teas are very aromatic; just a drop of stevia (a natural herb sweetener) enhances the favor tremendously. Shangri La is not skimpy with their tea leaves. One bag makes enough ice tea for about 10-15 servings! I love it!

Amazon offer free 2-day shipping for a total price of tea & shipping together cost only $11.99. Republic of Tea cost 21.00 to ship 2-day Air shipping and that doesn't include the price of the tea!

For the summer months I make a lot of sun tea and use Lipton regular orange pekoe tea as it comes in packages of 100.  Found that Bigelow has Ceylon tea in the 100 package box and decided to try it out even though it is a bit more in price.  What a complete difference in the taste!! Very nice flavor!  Everytime I have served someone a glass of iced tea at my home they always commented on the taste and flavor of the iced tea and I told them it was Bigelow.  Most of the time, hardly anyone knew that Bigelow made a 100 packet box of tea and they are now ordering from Amazon their regular tea.  Bigelow Ceylon tea is well worth the extra cost as the flavor is exceptional!
