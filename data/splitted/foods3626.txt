review/summary: Best Chai Tea Out There!
review/text: Chai tea sold in coffee shops usually entails something very sugary or fattening with whole milk, but it is delicious!  I can totally understand why people buy them at all the coffee shops.  However, I try to stay away from beverages that have a lot of calories; I would rather eat my calories, thank you.  So I tried this chai tea on a whim one day and I was SO glad I did!  I put Splenda and fat free coffee mate in it and it is DELICIOUS!  It tastes as good as any of those coffee house chai's but with hardly any calories at all!  I'm addicted!  I have tried Twining brand Chai and Bigelow brand chai and they do not compare at all to this one.  This one tastes like the real deal, what you would get if you ordered a chai at the coffee shop.  If it tastes great with Splenda and coffeemate, I can only imagine what it would taste like if you put real sugar and cream in it!  YUMMY!

review/summary: Better than Tazo Chai
review/text: "We live in a wonderful world that is full of beauty, charm and adventure. There is no end to the adventures that we can have if only we seek them with our eyes open." ~ Jawaharlal Nehru<br /><br />I'm sorry to have to say this but Celestial Seasonings Chai tea is better than Tazo's. Normally I get a chai tea at Starbucks but lately I've been making a lot of tea at home. Now that the weather is cooler I'm trying out lots of teas. This chai tea is in little pillow bags so there is not waste. Since there are no strings, tags, staples or wrappers the company claims that they save more than 3.5 million pounds of waste from being put into landfills. This is really something. Anyway, this tea is made with black tea, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper and star anise. It also contains some chicory and vanilla. Now I have to say I've been enjoying this tea but didn't realize its full potential until I drank it while eating a piece of banana bread. The flavors were perfect together. I'd recommend you really stock up on this tea because it is so delicous.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Authentic chai flavor + caffeine punch!
review/text: I am an avid fan of Indian chai. I've even tried to make it authentically (heating up the milk, combining spices into cheesecloth and adding to the boiling milk). Very good homemade, but a lot of work, especially weekday mornings under a time crunch.<br /><br />So I resorted to trying Indian chai loose-leaf and bags (read somewhere that the term "chai" actually refers to a type of prepared tea, so "chai tea" is redundant). Must have tried 3 or 4. Either too weak, too peppery, or too sweet.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai Tea is the closest I've experienced to authentic chai. Flavor is full-bodied without being overwhelming or acidic; spicy without being pungent--more spicy than sweet. You can distinctly smell the spices (cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper, Chinese star anise, and--vanilla bean) in the tea bags. A wonderful aroma in the kitchen after it's brewed, too!<br /><br />Since I prefer a bit more caffeine and body in my tea, I "double-bag" and brew the following:<br /><br />1 English breakfast tea bag<br />1 CS India Spice Chai tea bag<br />5 oz water<br />5 oz milk<br /><br />Microwave for 3 minutes; continue steeping to desired strength. Chai recipes suggest adding honey (optional), but like other reviewers, I find the spice blend doesn't need added sweetness.<br /><br />Happy to see CS India Spice Chai Tea on Amazon, since local supermarkets seem to have stopped carrying it in favor of flavored green tea. Great deal too!

review/summary: Use in My K-CUP!!
review/text: I typically buy the K-cups in this flavor. I love to make starbuck-like lattes by adding half and half and sugar. Amazon went up on the price of the K-cups, so I decided to give this a try by using the My K-cup that came with my machine. It works WONDERFULLY!! I place 2 teabags in the My k-cup filter and brew normally. It makes for easy clean-up since this is bagged! If I want my latte a bit stronger, I will take the tea bags out of the filter after brewing and let them steep in my cup a little longer. So, now I figured out a way to get 60 K-cups (2 bags at a time) for just over 13 dollars (subscribe and save). LOVE IT!!

Too bad I can't find this at the store despite all of them carrying the celestial brand.  If you love Starbucks chai latte you will love the flavor of this tea.

review/text: Just bought this for the second time for my mom who has been drinking this tea for awhile. The first subscribe and save shipment last year was great. This time around the taste of the tea has changed. For some reason the Celestial Seasonings has changed their 'recipe' and my mom did not like this as much as the old 'formula' and will not be ordering this again. This is a warning for other long-time drinkers of this tea.

review/text: I agree with the reviewer that the vanilla flavor in this is very prominent. In fact, it pretty nearly wiped out any flavor of the "Indian Spice" that is in this tea. Barely a hint of the cardamom, cinnamon, black pepper and other flavors that are supposed to be in here. I have been drinking Chai for years and have never come across a single one that had vanilla. Now I know why. Stay away if you want a traditional Chai.

review/text: I've been trying to find a good chai tea after my favorite online supplier ran out. I was looking for some more available and cheaper. I bought chai tea from Twinnibgs and Stash from my grocery store and they were terrible! Undrinkable. On my next shopping trip i found Celestial Seasonings Indisn Spice Chai. I almost didnt buy it after the last two store bought brands. But i decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. Its really good, especially for the price. And i lice that i found it at my lixal store. Although i like it enough to purchase in bulk from amazon if the price is right. Give this one a try. You won't regret it!

review/text: New Year's resolutions often include the hope to lose weight.  Substituting this tea for late night snacking is one way to feel you are drinking a decadent cup of forbidden froth, while really sipping on very few calories.  OK, I use half and half, which DOES add some calories - but it also adds the froth!!  A little stevia powder(try the NOW brand - no additives, totally pure) to sweeten, and who needs brownies?  One caveat - if you are very sensitive to caffeine, you may want to test your evening tolerance for this tea.

review/text: This tea is delicious...a perfect blend of spiciness...I'm beginning to break my coffee habit with this tea! Celestial Seasoningss is a great company, kudos to them as mentioned earlier for responsibly packaging their product with recycled paper, and using less resources by no individual wrappers.<br /><br /> Also, don't throw the teabag out after making a cup---I use a tall coffee cup, and it makes4 or 5 of those cups for me...first cup, heat water and steep teabag partway with a few dips, second cup, heat water and steep teabag a bit more, 3rd time heat water and let teabag steep for a minute or so, 4th and 5th times, I put teabag in water before heating in microwave, and when taken out, stir around for awhile...and still end up with dark, spicy tea!  I keep using the teabag this way unti it's not so dark, and time to get another! It's a good thing the teabags make lots of tea per bag, you probably won't stop at one cup!<br /><br />As good as it is, I'm probably going to make it iced for those hot summer days--I can tell that will be good too...

review/text: I got turned on to Celestial Seasonings teas when I visited the factory in Boulder. I bought a box of this Chai tea and was immediately hooked!  I have bought other Chai ta bags only to throw them away because they were disgusting. This one has just the right mix of seasonings and a hint of vanilla. Like another reviewer said, milk is a must for Chai tea.( I know--I had never put milk in my tea in my life and it sounded gross!) Vanilla soy milk is great and enhances the hint of vanilla in the tea. I also sweeten mine (honey is recommended but I use sweetner). This tea frequently replaces my morning coffee, and the decaf version is just as good if you want it at bedtime. I like it so well that I have ordered it by the case from Celestial Seasonings when I couldn't find it in the store! Kudos to Amazon for carrying it!!

review/text: Celestial Seasonings has a nice chai spice mix.  They combine ginger, cardamon, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, pepper and black tea.  Spicy and tasty with cream.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"Our deeds still travel with us from afar, and what we have been makes us what we are."  George Eliot.

review/text: Well, I am the usual old guy with prostate problems so I have been trying various herbal remedies because I don't like to take prescription drugs.  This is another one of those things that is supposed to help your prostate so I am just going through the list and trying them all. One bottle of this did not seem to make any difference to me. Perhaps I need to take it longer, but I am just going to the next thing on my list. For me, this didn't do any good. It might work for someone else. At least I had no reaction and it didn't kill me so on to the next prostate helper on the list.

I emailed Apple and Eve, and they very nicely responded that it was available from Amazon. I ordered it and it was delivered promptly to her house.

review/summary: A Breakfast Tea That Doesn't Disappoint!
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Morning Rise Breakfast Blend Black Tea is a fine premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Keemun black tea, fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea, fair trade certified organic Ceylon black tea, anfair trade certified organic Assam black tea. A powerful black tea blend indeed! There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi perfects the classic breakfast tea with this organic black tea blend, Morning Rise. Four of the most extraordinary black teas compose this hearty, complex, and exciting morning cup. Ceylon, gardened in the small and exotic country of Sri Lanka, bestows its strong yet smooth profile, while Indian grown Assam imparts a malty and robust depth. Keemun, from China, offers deep burgundy notes that complement the natural floral finish and fruity Muscatel of Darjeeling, cultivated on the mountain peaks of India. This rich, bold black tea blend has an unrivaled smoothness and a magnificent aroma resembling dawn's early warmth. Let the morning greet you through the radiant daybreak of Numi's superior Breakfast Blend."<br /><br />It tastes strong and and is perfect for people who want a black tea that is not flowery or herbal-y but tasty, complex, and superb high-quality in the morning.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: I first discovered this tea at Whole Foods at a very expensive price.  I love the blends of different teas to make this a delicious hot drink in the a.m.  I find that I can make two cups of tea with one bag, thus, making the price not so bad.  However, after discovering Amazon offers it thru the subscribe and save plan, the cost really has gone down.  Plus, I love not having to remember to buy it - I always have it in my pantry now.

review/summary: Dee-lish! But only in moderation!
review/text: I bought these for my darling mom; but, of course, she ended up sharing them with me! Heh-heh, after all, that was the plan... Anyway, Marzipan (a confection consisting predominantly of almonds and sugar) is one of those candies that you either love or hate. Everyone in my family happens to love it. However, as these faux "potatoes" are sweet little rascals, I can only eat a few at a sitting... which, when you think about it, makes them the perfect candy! They satisfy your sweet tooth, but any more than one or two pieces and you go into sugary overload.<br /><br />At the time of this review, this particular packaging of Schluckwerder's (how can you go wrong with that name?) was available from the Amazon.com sponsored seller, "Touch of Europe," a very friendly and prompt vendor. But, since I only ordered this one small item, the shipping ended up running me more than the product. The solution? As "Touch of Europe" sells a variety of treats here (and many more on their own website), my advice is to peruse their wares and see if you can't buy several items in one sitting, since shipping is free if your purchases surpass the $50 mark. And, no, I'm not plugging them because I secretly work for them! If I did, there would probably be candies missing from their inventory on a daily basis! And I would be suspicously bulging out of my skinny jeans!

review/summary: Good -- but no longer organic
review/text: I first bought these at Babies 'R' Us, and the bag was marked USDA Organic. I was thrilled to find that my daughter and I both loved them, that they were healthy, and low-calorie/low-fat. A perfect combo! So I ordered them on Amazon in bulk.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as of today, Amazon still has the wrong ingredients list. What arrived was the new formulation of this product, which is no longer organic. The company now uses the label "all natural" instead, and most of the ingredients are not organic.<br /><br />Excellent customer service on Snikkidy's end; they were forthcoming about the issue and apologized that Amazon hasn't updated the information yet, even though I understand they have no control over that.<br /><br />I will probably continue buying these snacks despite that they're no longer organic. They're very tasty and better for you than most of what's on the market, at least!

They are very light, have a nice crunch to them and are pretty cheesey. Although the cheese flavor tastes more like real cheese then the processed fake cheese taste of cheetos, so they dont taste exactly like cheetos, but we dont mind we actually like these way better. The only negative comment that I have about this product is that once you open the bag they go stale fast.

Ya' know how you feel so guilty when you read labels and then proceed to have just a little more than a serving of something that may not be really all that good for you?? Well, not too worry with these little puff balls. The Nutrition Facts don't read like a death sentence. It's so nice when something good for you tastes like those foods we use to love, but just can't bring ourselves to put in our mouths anymore. Yesterday, I also sampled the Baked Fries, Classic Ketchup (I don't eat ketchup with my fries)and, darned if I didn't come home with a bag.

These have great crunch, cheesy flavor and are suprisingly low in calories and fat.-- 120 cal. 5 gm fat per one ounce serving. Comparatively, an ounce of Cheetos contains 10 grams of fat per serving.<br /><br />Can you say "yum?"<br /><br />Best yet: For those with wheat/gluten intolerance these are fabulously gluten-free.

(On the other hand, the Whole Foods Bakery cheese biscuits and cupcakes, Heinz Cream of Tomato Soup from Britain, Ian's and Amy's gluten-free frozen entrees, Blue Diamond Pecan, Hazelnut and Almond crackers, Tinkyada pasta, newer Bob's Red Mill Flours (post-2007 when they got the new mill), and Pacific Foods broths and soups that are in my pantry, are gluten-free, and yummy.)<br /><br />These cheese puffs are a welcome addition to the relatively short list of, "tastes good, won't make a celiac sick, kid-friendly items."  They are not expensive, either.<br /><br />Did I mention they're really gluten free?

review/summary: I wish they tasted like Grilled Cheese
review/text: I've been looking for a natural cheese puff that did not have all the additives and preservatives in it to make one's stomach upset.<br /><br />I thought I found the right product with "Snikiddy Snacks Grilled Cheese Puff".<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was wrong.<br /><br />When you eat one, they do taste good. However after eating a few in a row, there is a bad after taste that can upset your stomach.<br /><br />They are also not very cheesy and the product does not resemble the taste of a grilled cheese in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />I'm still looking for the perfect cheese puff, but these will not be on my list.

review/summary: Great product, higher priced than local stores!
review/text: Firstly, I've used this product with both my younger sons and have never had any problems with it.  We started it on the advice of our pediatrician to use as a supplement because he suspected my son had acid reflux and it worked as a charm!<br /><br />Secondly, I find that the smaller containers are better since you are meant to finish it within I think a week after opening, which means that you are better off with the smaller container, depending on how much your child eats obviously, but even price-wise it's smarter.<br /><br />Thirdly, and I know this may not apply to everyone, but it is Kosher and DAIRY FREE (Parve), which is VERY VERY VERY hard to find in formula, which pretty much makes this an only choice for many special need kids, or even many who aren't special needs but need formula that isn't dairy.<br /><br />And finally, I am surprized that [...] prices are actually higher than all the local groceries, [...], etc.  I hope they bring their prices down so that all of us can happily buy it from them in the future.

review/summary: Good for babies who have problems with lactose
review/text: I've been using this formula from day one with my son.  He was born 6 weeks early, and I was unable to breastfeed him due to medication I was taking.  He was having problems with lactose-based formulas, and it was crucial that he gain weight, so the doctors in the NICU switched him to Prosobee.  He's nearly 5 months old now and he's almost 15 pounds!  He was 4 lbs. when he was born.  If you want to give your baby soy formula, I would recommend this one.  I tried the Similac version, and it made him very, very gassy.

review/summary: Amazing difference in 24 hours!
review/text: My daughter was using Enfamil Premium Lipil following weaning. After a full week on just formula she was a gassy baby who spit up a lot, but then the runny stool started. The Dr. said to wait it out for another week or two so she could 'adjust' to formula. I was worried about dehydration because she was have a least 10 poopy diapers a day and its the middle of a heat wave. Finally a friend suggested that I try a soy formula because my daughter was having the same issues that her son had when he was being weaned. I consulted the Dr who said to try it if it made me feel better, but that it would not hurt her because all formulas are safe for babies. SO we tried it and in the first feeding she had no gas. The next day only 2 poopy diapers and a little spit up. A whole different baby now! What a difference this formula has made!

review/summary: You'll be spoiled forever
review/text: If you are going to go to the trouble to bake something that requires brown sugar, do yourself a favor (it may actually not be a favor, now that I think of it) and try this sugar instead.  It is (naturally) more expensive, but the results will justify the expense.  This is a moist, rich sugar with strong molasses flavor.  It will spoil you forever.<br /><br />I am accustomed to spending $3.00+ for this, so if you bake with any regularity, splurge on this package, store it tightly sealed in a cool place (not refrigerated) and enjoy it.  In molasses cookies, this is unparalleled.

review/summary: Give this Molasses Sugar 6 stars !
review/text: Oh yum!<br />This sugar is divine and so versatile.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Muscovado sugar and this Molasses sugar is almost identical in flavor and texture to that but I'd say it has a deeper molasses flavor than the Muscovado we have been using.<br /><br />Natural dark brown sugar adds wonderful flavor to many dishes made with beef such as chili, beef stew and such.  It's also truly delightful when added to a glass of milk (hot or cold) - just stir it in as you would with a powdered chocolate milk mix but just use less than you would of those mixes.<br />Mix it up in a blender until it's foamy and kids LOVE it -<br />Add a sprinkle of nutmeg or a bit of grated chocolate to the top for a pretty look and an extra layer of flavor.<br /><br />A tablespoon or two substituted for white sugar in a chocolate cake mix enhances the chocolate flavor.<br /><br />It is also knock your socks off good in when mixed into heavy cream and whipped -<br />A dessert all by itself.<br /><br />Try a spoonful in your coffee instead of white sugar.<br /><br />Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about this often hard to find sugar.<br />It's the real thing and it's wonderful.<br /><br />Please keep it stored in an airtight container or it will turn into a brick.

review/summary: Best Brown Sugar Ever
review/text: This brown sugar is the real deal - cane juice processed up to the point of bown sugar (not highly processed white sugar with a bit of molasses added to resemble brown sugar). The taste, texture and nutritional values do not even compare to the alternatives in the grocery store. If you've never tried real brown sugar, you're missing a delightful treat. We bake with a lot of brown sugar and eat it on oatmeal, cream of wheat and cream of rice. We like the molasses flavor it imparts and the nutritional benefits it offers as well. Molasses is GOOD for you and it tastes good too. Well worth the price. Product arrived quickly and in excellent condition.

review/summary: Molasses sugar
review/text: It is what it says - molasses sugar.  To me it tastes more like molasses than brown sugar, which I suppose is a good thing if one happens to like the taste of molasses.  The label says "NATURAL Dark Brown Molasses Sugar" and it is indeed a very dark brown, much darker than the C&H "dark brown" I am used to, but it would be a mistake to expect this sugar to taste like regular brown sugar only more so.  Rather, it tastes much like molasses, perhaps with a hint of a brown sugar undertone.  Not what I yearn to put on my oatmeal in the morning, but I AM fond of molasses cookies as I recall - guess I need to dig out my wife's recipe.<br /><br />The 10 1-Lb packages were nicely packed, the sugar inside each 1-Lb box wrapped in plastic film rather than wax paper.  The shipment arrived in only a couple of days even though I selected the free super-saver shipping.

review/summary: Order it a little before your holiday baking begins.
review/text: I ordered this for the first time last year around the holidays. I wanted to make Nigella Lawson's guinness gingerbread recipe but had no idea what muscavado sugar was. I was thrilled with this product and will order it again this year before the holidays begin. It was fabulous in the gingebread and in homemade wheat bread. I used the last bit of it in some sticky toffee pudding for Christmas Eve dessert, heaven! It is great in oatmeal and I did try it in cookies but didn't care for it as it made the cookies crispy vs. soft and chewy, the way I like them, but if you're a fan of crispy cookies, the flavor is great. Also, didn't care for it in my coffee as several other reviewers recommend. I read the 1 star reviews and they were given because the sugar hardened, my sugar was soft and fresh but does harden quickly once opened if not stored in an air tight container. I have one of those terra cotta  clay pieces that help keep your brown sugar soft and it works quite well.

review/summary: Amazon to the Rescue!
review/text: Amazon to the rescue once again! I've been buying this sugar at my health food store for about $4 for a one-pound bag, and now they haven't had it for months and neither has anyone else in my area. Amazon's price works out to half that, if you adjust your order to get free shipping or are a Prime member.<br /><br />Billington's "Natural Dark Brown Molasses" sugar is better -- much better-- than any other kind I've tried. Its wonderful clean flavor is completely different from the rank flavor of other brands of "dark brown" sugars I've tried. The flavor is reminiscent of maple sugar, perhaps. Another reviewer suggests "toffee." Whatever the flavor is, the sugar is great on oatmeal, great to bake with, and I wouldn't think of making Linda Greenlaw's maple baked beans without it. (The best and easiest baked beans ever, my most-used recipe from her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YFE8AY">RECIPES FROM A VERY SMALL ISLAND</a>)<br /><br />Cookies, spice cakes, gingerbreads, and anything else with dark brown sugar for an ingredient are a whole different concoction with this sugar. Even Sticky Chicken Wings, baked swimming in half soy sauce and half dark brown sugar, taste better with Billington's. (There's a bit of mustard and butter in the sauce too, but you can taste the Billington's difference through it all.)<br /><br />The sugar is in a box, packed very tightly into the inner bag (a perfect presentation for a gift: the box is bright and attractive). I can understand how the sugar might collapse into itself and cool into the hard brick one reviewer complained of, if it sat for a long time in a shipper's superhot warehouse.  I revive hardened sugar in a double bag system (sugar in the inner bag, top slightly open, an outer bag that I'll seal tightly, with a barely damp paper towel folded several times between the two), and I think I'd try this before sending a shipment back.<br /><br />The other Billington sugars are very good too. If I were less anti-sugar and did more baking I'd consider ordering the three kinds together. An assortment of the three would make a great gift for my baking relatives.

review/summary: Toffee/Molasses Sugar is the Best in the World!
review/text: I made a scratch coffee cake utilizing a mixture of Big Tree Farms 'Ginger-Coconut Palm Sugar' along with palm sugar from Thailand. The taste of the batter WAS INCREDIBLE! Additionally, the crumb topping was a mixture of this particularly russet-colored sugar along with Billington's dark brown sugar, which has a deep and wonderful toffee/molasses flavor because it's grown on volcanic ash off the island of Mauritius...somewhere close to the continent of Africa! My house church members who sampled this cake found it quite remarkable. They relished it, loved it, saying it was wonderful and rich. Beige/brown in its coloring make-up, the cake had a solid texture and density to it. The cake was made with goat butter and raw goat's milk, to boot, adding to its special uniqueness. It will be one of my mainstay cake recipes and a cake to make and sell (if anybody's interested!!). I LOVE to make authentic cakes (which are always prayed over and blessed) using authentic ingredients, because mine are heavenly 'Cakes Like Grandma Made!'

review/summary: A flavoring I can't reproduce from scratch
review/text: I used to be able to buy this near my home, but now it's inexplicably disappeared from the supermarket shelves, though other Asian Home Gourmet products are still sold.<br /><br />My habit in buying from the supermarket was to simply sweep every single package into my basket whenever I came across it. It's that good.<br /><br />The sweet and sour flavoring works deliciously when mixed into a batch of fried rice. Start by frying in a teaspoon of olive oil srimp and fingernail-size chopped vegetables, add 2 cups or so of cooked rice, and, following that, two or three raw, beaten chicken eggs. When the dish is almost ready to serve, mix in one package of pineapple rice paste, cook a further 2 minutes or so, and serve.<br /><br />Everyone I've served this to (including some eaters of wide experience) has remarked on the unique flavor. Strongly recommended.

review/summary: Austere as is; save for baking
review/text: My experience with Vivani organic dark chocolates so far -- regular, espresso, now green tea -- is that they are purist to the point of austere. If just snapping off a square of two to savor, a little goes a long way.  While the espresso bar had plenty of espresso flavor, however, I can barely detect a green tea taste in this green tea bar, at most a very faint herbal bitterness, although the ingredients list (not on Amazon's product page) does cite "green tea (2%)."  I do trust this 2%, since Germany, where this is made, is very strict with food inspections and labeling.  But 2% doesn't sound like much.  As someone who loves green tea and its sundry flavoring applications like mochi and soymilk, I was disappointed.<br /><br />Loath to waste, I began baking with it, grating between half and a full bar's worth into my usual chocolate cake recipe.  Wow.  For some reason it adds such dimension to the cake's sweetness.  Still not quite "green tea" but subtler and more intriguing than straight-up dark chocolate.  Have already made (and been complimented on) three of those cakes.  So I'm now quite grateful to have it on hand, and might even repurchase, but strictly for baking.

review/summary: Good Coffee Taste with Vanilla Flavor Added
review/text: Great coffee for someone looking for any basic cup of coffee in the morning. I think the vanilla taste could be a bit stronger but still a great, smooth cup of coffee.

review/text: Wild rice flour looks. tastes, and smells like sand. I haven't found any recipes that I can use it in that it actually tastes good. Any ideas?

review/summary: Tastes EXACTLY like the original GUM I grew up with!
review/text: I saw this Juicy Fruit gum at my local Target store in the same area as the sugarfree gums I was familiar with (Dentyne Mentos and Ice Breakers).  I checked the label because I remember Juicy Fruit gum from my childhood, and it was that sweet, sugary flavor that made it taste so good.  But I've avoided sugary gums since I was in my 20's, and decided that I wanted to keep my teeth a while longer!<br /><br />This product turned out to be sugar free (and didn't contain saccharin), so I decided to give it a try.  Wow, is all I can say!  Tastes exactly like I remember the regular Juicy Fruit used to taste, except that it's got a "candy coating" (sugar free) instead of being dusted with sugar, like the regular gum was.  Try this gum, you'll be hooked and your Dentist will congratulate you to boot!  It's a popular item to keep in the cupholder in my vehicle, everyone always want a piece.<br /><br />P.S.  The sugar-free Doublemint Gum also tastes just like the original, and Eclipse, Mentos & Dentyne all make great sugar-free gums!
