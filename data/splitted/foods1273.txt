review/summary: Pina Colada best cold
review/text: This matcha smells like Hawaii in tea form!  I've only been there once and have missed it ever since.  I'm sitting here in 60 degree weather drinking matcha that will take me to a warmer place.<br />My first impression of this matcha was heaven!  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep in the yummy goodness.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I could not wait to dig in to this matcha.  If I had a piece of pineapple in the fridge I would have paired this matcha with it.  I think that next time I will try preparing this iced and be sure to have some pineapple on hand!<br />I always make sure to warm up my bowl and chasen under a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  My matcha does not cool down as fast when warming the bowl.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha, water and my sifter!  I didn't forget it this time.  I think I might need to get a matcha preparation bag so that all my tools are handy.  I tend to get excited and forget a key item.<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar and 5 oz of water.  I added a bit less water this time as I wanted the matcha to be thicker.<br />The smell of this matcha once mixed with water takes on different notes...almost a chemical smell.  I did get notes of coconut and a touch of pineapple but it's almost a fake smell now like an airfreshener.  I'm surprised that the smell would change from the powdered form to when water was added.  The quality of the matcha is very good, I think it's the flavoring that is throwing it off.<br />I'm just so sad that this flavor will not make my keep cupboard.  My plan for the rest of Pina Colada is to mix it first as a latte, then try it over ice.  I might try cold brewing it in the fridge, but I'm not sure you can do that with matcha.  If all else fails, I will add it to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  I'm hoping that maybe it'll be perfect one of these ways so I can add it to the keep cupboard!<br />To try Pina Colada Matcha from Red Leaf Tea visit here:<br />[...]

review/summary: Like a tropical vacation in matcha form
review/text: Pina Coladas are my favourite tropical boozy drink! Okay I'll also drink them without booze, but that kick of rum keeps me happy. Haha! I love the creamy texture of ice cold, slushy coconut milk with the tang and sweetness of fresh pineapple! A drizzle of grenadine and I'm taken to my happy place. To be fair, I haven't had a pina colada quite like the ones in Cuba. That was my only hot resort holiday, so it has lots of good memories and good drinks.<br /><br />I was hoping to recreate that deliciousness by making a slushy, creamy, matcha smoothie with this matcha! To be fair, that was the best result, after trying this hot and as an iced latte - slush was the way to go!<br /><br />My Pina Colada Matcha slush might have been better, but I used waaay too much matcha by accident, so it was a bit too strong in the flavouring department. I just crushed some ice with agave and milk to make the slush, so as the ice melted it did become more palatable. I really think the trick for this one is to make sure to use around 170 degree water (that tempers the bitterness) and use a little less matcha powder that you would usually. With other flavours, I could go crazy and dump 3 tablespoons into a cup and it was palatable (and energizing!), but less is more with this particular blend!<br /><br />When I'm out of this tea, I think I will order some coconut and pineapple separately and do some blending of my own! I still have total faith in Red Leaf Tea - they hook me up with delicious matcha, and I can't wait to try more flavours!

review/summary: Fine Powder, Easy to Mix
review/text: I prefer this hemp powder over the Living Harvest brand.  The Navitas hemp protein powder is a much finer grind, almost a powder, which makes it much easier to blend into drinks and smoothies.  I also appreciate that it has a higher protein content: 50% rather than the 43% the Living Harvest brand boasts.  It costs a little extra, but I think it's a much better product.

review/summary: best hemp powder I've found
review/text: I've tried many other hemp powders and I found them far too grainy, but this product is nice and fine so it mixes easily and while I wouldn't drink it straight with just water, I find it adds a nice nutty flavor when mixed with almond milk or rice milk.  I usually blend 3 tbs. hemp powder, 1 banana, about 8 oz. almond milk and a dash of cinnamon for a good vegan post-workout drink.

review/summary: Very good stuff
review/text: Unlike other suppliments and health foods I've got I actually make a point of using this every morning, the protein is just great and my body can definitely tell when I haven't had this, just adding a tablespoon or two to whatever I'm having for breakfast makes me feel so much better, it's quite filling and the feeling lasts for hours.<br />I don't particularly care for the taste it adds to my smoothies so I generally don't add it to those anymore. I really love using it to make berry pancakes, muffins and scones; I just sub out some of the flour and I've got an awesome breakfast (oat flour makes the best hemp baked goods by the way, the two flavors really work nicely together). I've actually gotten in the habbit of subbing out some of the flour in pretty much all the recipes I do. I really love this brand of hemp powder and I will most definitely continue to buy it.

review/summary: Good for others maybe, not for me
review/text: I put two tablespoons (two-thirds of what the package describes as one serving) in my morning oatmeal the day after I received it.  It turned the oatmeal an odd greenish-black color, but I did not find the slightly herby taste at all unpleasant.  I felt great for a couple of hours, and thought I'd found a good way to add more protein to my largely vegetarian diet.<br /><br />A little over two hours after I ate breakfast, I started to feel very warm and then became violently ill.  I had chills for a few hours afterwards and spent most of the afternoon resting and gradually starting to feel better.<br /><br />Since I didn't eat anything else new and no one around me has had similar symptoms, I can only attribute this to a very bad reaction to the hemp protein powder.  No one else mentions having such a reaction, so it may be too unusual for anyone else to worry about.  But please, if you're going to try this product, start with little and make sure you can tolerate it before trying a full dose!

review/text: I do cat rescue work, which means I get to keep the special needs cats.  Most of my gang is over 12 years old.  I started them on this because it sounded like a better cat food than the commercial stuff I find on sale, and the money for it was in the same ballpark.  Since I have put all 15 on this food the "Hawking up Hairballs" has went down to a small fracture of what it has been for years.  And they eat much less, which means litter boxes are not as busy, and they are more healthy.  Its a good deal for me, and a great deal for their health!  For the price, its the best I can find!  And I would know after 30 years of cat rescue.

Maybe not so for humans, but healthy for the digestive tract of a cat. My five year old Siamese neutered male is stupendously healthy, satisfied and very happy. He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy. If you have questions, please consult your vet. A cats digestive needs are much different than a humans. The ingredients may sound awful to us, but it's not our health we should be concerned with when buying pet food.

review/summary: My 3 cats eat it...  guess it's good.
review/text: My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.  As a pet owner I looked more at price and quality.  Decent price, decent quality.  I am on the fence weather I like this product or the new Purina One Beyond better for my cats.  I think I will stick with The Goodlife Recipe primarily because it is cheaper through amazon and it is just a lot easier to have food automatically at my doorstep when I need it.  Believe me, you don't want to run out with three cats swooping around like vultures at food time!  If amazon starts carrying the Beyond with Subscribe and Save, I could be swayed.<br /><br />In the past, when my oldest cat was younger, I would buy the cheapest cat food money could buy.  This caused him to be over-weight and his coat was dull and he just didn't look good.  Once I got him to a normal weight with a high protein food of Purina One Healthy Weight Formula, I began looking for a lower price food to maintain this new lower weight.  They have been eating this food for over 6 months now and coats are great and all three cats look very healthy.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because, although it is a decent food, I know there are better out there, just not as convenient as this item on amazon in my price range.

review/text: When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.  They are healthier and more lively than I could possibly hope for.<br /><br />Plus, with Amazon's Shop N Save program, I never run out of food for my feline best-friend.

review/text: I have two boys...well first we had one. He was a little panther zipping and yowling around our house and would anything, especially bagels...I still can't keep bagels in my house. Then we decided he need a playmate. That's when we came across Octavious or "silky" as his current human called him. And he was silky, such much so in comparison our first cat felt like velcro when petted. We couldn't afford Science diet and they seemed to hate the plain taste of it. We started mixing the good life with it and we have noticed more energy, more love from them and softer shiny coats. Less itchiness too.<br /><br />Yes it has corn, but guess what so does half the things you eat. I am not concerned on wheat/corn debate as my cat goes after my bread, my bagels or anything tasting like wheat.

review/summary: Very Happy with it!
review/text: We have 4 cats a little over 1 year old. We started out feeding them Blue Buffalo but they were always very gassy and 2 of the cats were getting plump.. while another was too skinny. So we ventured into trying other brands healthy or otherwise. They can be a bit picky but they eventually got used to anything. "Their" favorite was the Purina stuff... but that's just like us loving junk food isn't it...while the 1 skinny one did attain a normal weight the 2 plump ones became quite fat! So eventually we picked up this Goodlife brand, for indoor cats. They took to it well and before we knew it the 2 fat cats are down to a healthy weight. The skinny cat is looking a little skinnier too but she has maintained a healthy weight with this stuff. It's been about 5 months now and they are all still very healthy and I am very Happy with this brand and this particular recipe (indoor). It has been a perfect balance for all 4 of our cats. We did try the all ages a couple of times but it doesn't seem to satisfy them as well and they eat a lot more of it.

I used to feed them Iams, but at 17 bucks a bag I knew there had to be a food out there that was comparable!<br /><br />Goodlife Indoor with Chicken has high quality ALL NATURAL ingredients that taste good (well I dont know that they taste good but my cats LOVE it)<br /><br />Inside it has:<br /><br />*REAL chicken and skim milk for strong bones and teeth and lean muscle mass.<br /><br />*WHOLE grain brown rice that has alot of good vitamins<br /><br />*Natural Garden Peas and Spinach with Iron and Folic Acid that helps metabolism<br /><br />*High quality protein and taurine needed for a healthy heart and eyes.<br /><br />*Whole Grains rich in fatty acids and fiber for healthy digestion and a shiny coat<br /><br />*Colorful veggies that provide antioxidants for a good immune system<br /><br />My cats have a clean bill of health, shiny sleek coats, no plaque on their teeth, and my oldest one who is 12 has a healthy urinary tract system which we all know is the number one killer of senior cats!

review/summary: Mixed feelings
review/text: I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.

review/summary: My Sensitve Stomach Cats Love it!
review/text: I want to start by saying I am not a professional, just an average cat owner. I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it.

review/summary: Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities
review/text: One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!

review/text: My cats love this cat food.  It is the only cat food that I have ever used that they seem to digest well. There is seldom any "throw up" with this cat food.  Anyone who owns a cat knows what I mean about this.  I used to call my cats the "throw up queens" but since I've been using this cat food it very seldom happens.  They have been eating this cat food for over 2 years so I think this is a good test.  I highly recommend.

Not sure if it's the yummy aroma, or just the sound of it being poured into their bowls, but they sure come running!  I feed our cats canned food, but always have a bowl of dry food available. Some of our cats prefer dry food, and this recipe is a winner! I like the fact that it's high in protein and has fiber and veggies too.<br />Try it- you won't be disappointed!!<br />Pricing on Amazon is great, the automatic delivery is a godsend- and free delivery is a winner!

review/text: I tried this cat food for my 5 month old kitten.  we used this for about two weeks thinking that her stomach would get used to it.  We were wrong.  This cat food made our cat crap like a 300 pound man.  And my gosh did it stink.  This cat food turned our cute little fur ball into a feline ball of gas that you no longer wanted on your lap or for that matter in our house.  I kid you not, after two weeks of this cat food the cat's butthole was actually protruding.  We went back to the cat food we were giving her before and within two weeks she was back to normal.<br /><br />Never again.

review/text: My two cats are both over 10 yrs of age - and they are different in how they eat - but one thing is for sure - they don't and can't digest CORN!!!  My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!

review/summary: It's Corn. Cats can't live on corn.
review/text: This food is primarily corn: ground corn and corn meal. That food pyramid above the cat's head definitely doesn't represent what's in the food. I don't think most people would knowingly go out and buy corn for their cat. We associate cats with eating fish or poultry or mice. Definitely not ears of corn.<br /><br />And most of the meat is a byproduct, which is a low grade and questionable ingredient. So is "animal fat." It also contains wheat, which cats can easily be allergic to. This brand may be better than the bottom of the barrel cat foods, but it's still something to totally avoid. Purchase a cat food that is low in grains/carbs or has none at all. If it contains any then they should be wholegrain, like brown rice. No corn or byproducts.<br /><br />Your cat may seem fine on this food, but like a person eating fast food at every meal, you have to know there are healthier options out there and such poor dietary choices will catch up with you sometime.

review/text: Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.  This is one of the worst foods out there along with meow mix, science diet, friskies, most purina products.<br />Would you let your kids eat french fries and fritos for all their meals?  this is pretty much the same thing for your cats.<br />Read the labels -  main ingredients should be meat, not corn, not byproducts.  Glutens are allergens and used as filler and should be avoided.  Look around, there are affordable good foods available -  some warehouse clubs sell their brands which are very good (starts with a "C").  Check pet food ratings, dot net.<br /><br />Ignorance is no excuse for torturing your animals with terrible food

Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!

review/summary: Not up to the hype, caused bloody stools in my puppy
review/text: I purchased this food upon recommendation from my vet. They told me that they had previously used the Holistic brand but it had merged with this company & they did not have experience with Eagle Pack but that they thought it was the same. I slowly added the food to my puppy's old food over the next week and she seemed to like it just fine. Well, she started having a lot of loose stools, many of which were completely liquid and even bloody for the next couple of weeks. I decided to try another food and everything completely resolved. I have since tried a couple of puppy foods equal in quality/price/reputation with no problems. Her stools are completely better, now soft but formed (like they should be!) with no sign of blood whatsoever. She has not had any gastrointestinal problems on numerous different kinds of treats either. She has been fine on 3 puppy foods, a dozen different kinds of treats...you do the math.<br /><br />I have been trying to figure out what the problem may have been from the ingredient list and my concern is the "triple animal proteins" combining chicken, pork and fish meals. This is just an invitation for food intolerance because there are more potential allergens. I think the pork is the problem. I know she tolerates chicken & chicken meal fine, not sure about fish but I've seen that frequently in other foods while I have yet to find another quality food that contains pork meal. Pig does not seem akin to a domestic dog's "natural" diet anyway. If they got rid of the pork, I might consider trying it again but until then I'd recommend you try another food for your puppy. I think (hope) they are generally a good company and I do see that some people's dogs have been fine on this brand, but I'm not sure this is the safest food for baby animals. I will NOT be purchasing this again & I will be contacting my vet recommending that they no longer carry it in their store. There are so many better, safer options out there. If you care about your puppy's health and happiness, save her weeks of misery and buy something else!

review/summary: 95% bananas & only 5% strawberries
review/text: It's delicious as expected but don't expect to see much of the strawberry.  It is mainly banana.  I know that it's random where one package may have more strawberry than others but still the ratio is not anywhere near 50/50. For every 10 pieces of bananas you will find about 2 pieces of strawberries.

review/summary: Bad on flavor and on environment
review/text: Anyone who has done some research into environmentally responsible foods knows that buying local food is, on whole, more important than buying organic food. That being said, shame on Bionaturae for trying to market their products as being so green when they're shipping from Italy.<br /><br />Also, this fruit spread is sweetened with apple juice concentrate. That's too bad, because the label would make you think that the spread tastes like sour cherries. It really doesn't. It tastes sweet, and the flavor of the apple juice completely overpowers the cherries. I definitely won't be buying this again.

review/text: I am new to buying raw honey.  This honey has stuff floating in it.  I am not sure if this is normal or not.  Also, this honey smells and tastes fermented.  This is something I was not expecting and I am not sure this is safe to eat.  Does all raw honey taste and smell fermented?  Or, did I get a bad jar?  In addition, I was not too impressed with the companies seal.  It was basically a small strip of tape on the side of the jar going up to the lid.  Can anyone provide some insight to these questions?

When the item arrived, I received ONLY Diego cookies, no other characters.  While the cookies are REALLY cute, I was disappointed to see that we only got the Diego character.  There was another item on Amazon that sold similiar Diego cookies for a cheaper price.  I would have bought that if I had known that I would only be getting Diego...

review/text: Ferrara Pan Candy Company is the only Atomics I know and they have been around since the beginning of time. They are consistent in quality.<br /><br />I buy around 200 each week for people at work. Some people just live on these animals. Others just see how long they can suck on them before changing to the other side of the mouth. It looks like people are going around with fat jaws. When the red coating wears off it seems that they just get hotter. And you can hear the tell tale sound of people crunching to get it over with. Then they come back for more.

review/text: The Teanee Beanee is a delicious and very moorish jelly bean.  Strong licorice flavour in every bean but the small size makes it very tempting to have more than one.  The real disappointment in this product is the packaging.  Bag is supposed to be resealable with "zip lock" tabs included in the bag.  Should be able to cut off the top seal and then reseal each time you go to the bag.  Unfortunately my experience has been that the ziplock fails to work and so far that has been the case in 6 out of 6 bags already opened.

review/summary: false Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, corn cannot be completely digested, it is just a filler and causes dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: Happy to find it here
review/text: I'm a long time user of this product and was unhappy when my local stores stopped carrying it.  For me, it provides just enough sweetness in a convenient, easy-to-carry tablet format.  I have a little dispenser for it and it goes with me in my purse wherever I go.  So glad to find it here on Amazon at bulk rates from the manufacturer.

review/summary: HARD TO FIND PRODUCTS
review/text: It's difficult to find several items in todays market if insufficient demand for them exists. My Wife and I have exhausted our normal sources for saccharin. Not even the drug stores carry it anymore.<br />Our Son suggested Amazon. I'm a real Dinosaur when it comes to anything electronic, but I got in to the Amazon website and it was so simple! The correct product; the correct brand name ( known to us as reliable) and best price we ever paid for this product! NECTA SWEET has a huge following and now it has an easy access to its' customers.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8ESB4">Necta Sweet Sugar Substitute Tablets, 1 Grain, 500-Count Bottle (Pack of 12)</a> If I could let the world know where to go for the hard-to-find products I would.
