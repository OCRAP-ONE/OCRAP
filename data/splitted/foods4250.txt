review/summary: Really Very Good Diet Hot Cocoa! Recommended!
review/text: "Swiss Miss Diet Hot Cocoa" is a very good Hot Chocolate drink mix! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for sweet tasting snacks and drinks that will not effect my blood sugar levels.<br /><br />Like most diet products, this does not taste quite as good as the regular version, but it is as close as we have found. It is really very satisfying and low in calories as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: NOT worth the cost for  the mess I received....
review/text: I ordered this item in order to get the supposed substantial savings as this item was a special offer.<br />The box arrived and after opening....<br />it was as though there had been a powdered chocolate EXPLOSION inside the shipping box.<br />It was ALL over the place!<br />None of the actual drink mix boxes were opened NOR did they appear to be damaged upon first inspection<br />Upon further inspection, I found that in several of the 6 boxes included in the shipment that  the individual packages of beverage mix had  NON sealed sides on the product envelopes inside the sealed boxes. Apparently during shipping these envelopes leaked out most of the chocolate drink powder which then leaked out of the boxes...<br />Perhaps this is WHY they were on sale as a special?<br /><br />Had to throw 3 of the boxes away...<br />NO savings on this order!!<br />and, apparently no compensation for that either...per Amazon rules.<br /><br />Very disappointed & am contacting the Swiss Miss people accordingly.

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious!
review/text: I saw this flapjack mix at a local Ross store and it was marked down to $2.49.  I like to try anything at least<br />once, so I bought it.  I knew my husband would like the fact that it had whole wheat.  I made a few for myself the next morning and couldn't believe how delicious they were. I never even thought about using syrup but since I always use butter in the skillet, they were plenty rich.<br />The following weekend my daughter and son-in-law came over and I told them I wanted them to try a healthy flapjack. My son-in-law was skeptical at first, but said they were delicious!  My 3 yr old granddaughter ate them off the plate with her fingers like it was a snack! I made the batter a little thicker than normal so they would be heartier.  I would definitely recommend this product!

review/summary: Good taste, average as a coating.
review/text: I was looking for something that would be a natural chocolate for my holiday candy making. While this tastes great and has a nice smooth, creamy mouth-feel, it isn't particularly great as a firm coating. I found that after melting carefully to properly temper it, it was somewhat soft at room temperature, with no discernible snap when eaten. I however, would always use this over candy coatings, which are full of garbage that I wouldn't consider using on my candies.<br /><br />As a general rule, Ghirardelli is the best chocolate available at my grocery stores, but they stopped carrying this variety. I will continue using their product for my other baking needs, but will opt for a higher quality couverture chocolate for candy making if I can acquire it.

review/summary: Medium? Somewhat.
review/text: As the title says, this is an awkward "medium" roast. It looks like a dark and oily roast but when you drink it, its got no hint of a dark roast. Furthermore, it glides through my Hario Mini Mill with ease so there is a good amount of oil but it simply doesn't taste charred/dark as I typically hate it. Don't expect to open this up and see Illy light brown beans.<br /><br />As far as taste, its a good every-day thing. I brew in a Moka and its not harsh. Haven't tried it in my broken French Press (Just the wire plunger is broken hence why I hardly use it nowadays). Chocolate but not a sweet chocolate taste, more of a real raw cocoa taste which is nice, I hate very heavy and sweet toned coffee. Still a very solid and straightforward coffee taste, no surprises. I bought the tins because A) They look nice and B) Somebody threw away my old Illy canisters so I needed something to hold the beans in. I'd suggest getting the cheaper bag as its got more beans per your dollar.

review/summary: Smooth & Tasty espresso
review/text: I like the Kicking Horse coffees and the Cliff Hanger espresso is a good choice. This is definitely an espresso blend of beans, dark & oily fresh. I have used the beans in a french press, an Aero Press, and a moka espresso pot. All three methods delivered huge flavor and some serious wakeup!! The moka espresso was a bit over-the-top with syrup-like consistency, so I probably overdid the grounds! A little cream & sugar and it could have been a morning dessert! I like this company and the blend - just entered a subscription! Yes, the tins keep the beans really fresh! I also get the 3 Sisters blend for a gentler thermos-load.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I discovered the Cliffhanger Espresso a month ago at my local Safeway, deciding to try something new.  Using it in my super automatic machine, I found it delicious - a medium espresso roast, well balanced, chocolate overtones. It was not excessively oily and easily fed through my machine.<br /><br />I was hooked.  So I subscribed to a 2-pack of 12.3-ounce cans.  They were horrible.  The beans were sour smelling and tasting. The expiry on the cans was April 16, 2013.  (Unrelated, one of the cans also had a fine animal hair between the lid and the seal, but this could have slipped in anywhere, including at the Amazon warehouse.)<br /><br />This may be just a batch problem - bad beans - however I will not purchase this product again.<br /><br />What a disappointment.

review/summary: Stale coffee with rancid oil
review/text: Coffee like any other food will spoil when not consumed fresh and this is case with this coffee. You are buying coffee that was roasted 6-12 months earlier and all oils in it, and this is roasted to such degree that oils are plentiful, simply went rancid long time ago. And when you smell it you can really notice this. Coffee should be consumed up to 4 weeks after it has been roasted, not bag opened, not the date coffee expires, but the day it was roasted.<br /><br />I got cheated every time I try these stale blends hoping to discovered that somehow magically they stopped staling process but alas, it is fools errand.<br /><br />If you live in USA you are lucky because I think that we have the best coffees in the world available to us today. And there are plenty of roasters that will ship you the coffee the same day they roast it: Klatch Coffee, Terroir Coffee, Red Bird Coffee, Counter Culture Coffee and tons of others. Please give fresh product a try instead of this old, stale composting material.

review/summary: Weight Loss Benefits of Green Tea!
review/text: Weight Loss Benefits of Green Tea<br />=================================<br /><br />If you drink green tea you can-<br />* Lower Cholesterol<br />* Increase Thermogenesis (the body's rate of burning calories)<br />* Enhance fat oxidation<br /><br />Burns Fat Naturally<br />Green tea contains high concentrations of catechin polyphenols. These compounds work with other chemicals to intensify levels of fat oxidation and thermogenesis, where heat is created in the body by burning fuels such as fat. Drinking Japanese green tea regularly will increase your metabolism and help burn fat safely and naturally.<br /><br />Lowers cholesterol and increases energy expenditure<br />Green tea also causes carbohydrates to be released slowly, preventing sharp increases in blood-insulin levels. This promotes the burning of fat.<br />The thermogenic effect was originally attributed to its caffeine content. However, green tea stimulates brown fat thermogenesis far greater than a comparable amount of pure caffeine. It appears that the catechin-polyphenols, in particular epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and caffeine that naturally occur in green tea work synergistically to stimulate thermogenesis and augment and prolong sympathetic stimulation of thermogenesis. It has been shown to increase 24-hour energy expenditure and fat oxidation (caffeine only increases metabolism during the time you take it).<br /><br />Weight is gained as excess sugars and fats are stored in the body as fat cells. Green tea catechins can help prevent obesity by inhibiting the movement of glucose in fat cells. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has been found to be especially effective. There is now good evidence that green tea catechins are related to reductions in body fat.<br />EGCG is a powerful antioxidant with positive qualities but a balanced diet and exercise, lots of it, are of paramount importance to any weight reduction program.<br /><br />Green Tea and Weight Loss<br />=========================<br />by: Kathryn O'Neill<br /><br />There's recently been a LOT in the weight loss news concerning green tea.<br />Green tea's weight loss effects have been causing more and more people to start sipping the ancient Chinese or Japanese brew.<br /><br />But just how does green tea help you lose weight? And does it really work or is it all just hype? This article gives you the real facts about drinking green tea to lose weight.<br />Advantages of Drinking Green Tea for Weight Loss:<br /><br />1) Green tea revs up your metabolism<br /><br />A study reported on in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that green tea extract resulted in a significant increase in energy expenditure (a metabolism `boost').<br />The researchers also concluded that that over a 24-hour period, green tea extract increases the metabolic rate by 4%. These effects are probably due to the high concentrations of catechin polyphenols found in green tea. These work to help intensify levels of fat oxidation and thermogenesis (the rate at which your body burns calories).<br /><br />2) Green tea inhibits fat absorption and helps glucose regulation<br />Experts tell us that the catechins in green tea help to inhibit the movement of glucose into fat cells. Green tea may also act as al glucose regulator. It helps to slow the rise in blood sugar after a meal. This prevents high insulin spikes (lots of insulin promotes fat storage) and the subsequent fat storage.<br /><br />3) Green tea may help reduce appetite<br />Scientists at the University of Chicago found that green tea caused rats to lose up to 21 percent of their body weight. Rats injected with a green tea extract lost their appetites and consumed up to 60 percent less food after seven days of daily injections. This may have something to do with the blood sugar regulating effects of green tea.<br /><br />4) Green tea can help you save calories on your morning brew.<br />We are a nation hooked on our java. Be it the regular double-cream, double-sugar standard or that mocha, dappa, frappucinno, the calories we ingest just to get our morning caffeine is wreaking havoc on our waistlines.<br /><br />If you want to save mega-calories in the morning but still get your caffeine fix, try substituting green tea for coffee. Or have a green tea in the afternoon instead of that 700 calorie mocha-chillate dream. You'll definitely notice the difference in your waistline after a few weeks.<br /><br />So there are 4 ways that green tea can help you with weight loss. But how much do you actually have to drink to get these amazing metabolism boosting effects?<br /><br />Experts vary but the general consensus seems to be that 3 - 5 cups of green tea per day is optimal. Doing this can help you burn an extra 70 calories per day which amounts to 7 pounds per year. Pretty good for not exercising or cutting calories, right?<br />However, 3 - 5 cups can be a lot for some people, so you might also want to consider green tea extract, green tea pills or a green tea patch.<br /><br />Disadvantages of Drinking Green Tea For Weight Loss:<br />#1) Green tea is not a magic bullet<br />While some people will tell you that green tea is the be-all-end-all for weight loss success, I think the keyword here is balance. You're not going to eat 5000 calories a day, drink a cup of green tea and make it all go away - it just isn't going to happen. A healthy diet and increased exercise will go a long way in helping you lose weight and keep it off.<br />#2) Be cautious of the caffeine if you have health problems<br />For some people that have heart troubles, high blood pressure or stimulant sensitivities, the caffeine in green tea may not be the best idea. If you're worried about the caffeine from green tea, try taking green tea extract. Most green tea extract is made from decaffeinated green tea so you can still get the weight loss benefits without the caffeine.<br />If you think the caffeine may be a problem, make sure to consult your doctor before starting green tea for weight loss. Also make sure to consult your doctor before starting green tea if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.<br /><br />*** Bottom Line ***: Green tea helps you with weight loss by boosting your metabolic rate, regulating your blood sugar, suppressing your appetite and giving you something else besides that high calorie, high sugar coffee beverage to drink in the morning. While it's not the magic bullet, it can definitely give you a boost in weight loss and in your overall health!<br /><br />Green tea may benefit some more than others<br />-------------------------------------------<br />At the recent International Research Conference on Food, Nutrition and Cancer sponsored by the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR), scientists presented new evidence about phytochemicals in green tea that may help prevent normal cells from developing into cancer and spreading.<br />Yet people may wonder if drinking green tea is worthwhile, because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to allow a health claim for green tea on labels this summer.<br />Although more evidence is needed to justify a strong statement about green tea's ability to lower the risk of cancer, it is not a bad idea to include this beverage in a healthful, mostly plant-based diet.<br />Black tea is the most frequently consumed tea in the U.S., but green tea contains far higher levels of the phytochemical EGCG. Both oolong and black teas, including the common orange pekoe, lose some of their EGCG as they are processed. However, green tea leaves are steamed or baked before they can oxidize, so their EGCG levels remain high.<br />Since it is a powerful antioxidant, EGCG may help prevent both heart disease and cancer. It helps to stabilize highly reactive molecules known as free radicals that can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease, or alter the DNA in our genes, promoting cancerous changes. In addition, EGCG may protect against cancer development by increasing the self-destruction of cancer cells and by affecting enzymes and the signals between cells, slowing the growth and multiplication of cancer cells.<br />Related content<br />* Scientists find how green tea fights cancer<br />* Green tea doesn't lower cancer risk, says FDA<br />But while the evidence of EGCG's ability to deter cancer is quite strong in laboratory studies, population studies show much less consistent benefits. The inconsistent population evidence is one of the primary reasons that the FDA recently refused to approve a health claim on the labels of products with green tea that would link its consumption with lower cancer risk.<br />Benefits some more than others<br />In the FDA's view, the effectiveness of foods in laboratory studies is merely background material. Consistent evidence among populations is key to supporting health claims. However, researchers point out that the laboratory studies, which are overwhelmingly positive about the health effects of EGCG, are necessary to explain the results of population studies. Without them, we would not know what EGCG is or what it can do.<br />Furthermore, inconsistent results from population studies do not mean that there is no benefit to drinking green tea. Human studies show that the antioxidant capacity of the blood does increase about an hour after drinking green tea.<br />Other studies show that markers of DNA damage decrease after drinking even black tea or decaf green tea, both of which contain less EGCG than regular green tea.<br />The differences in health impact that are seen among green tea drinkers in population studies may mean that green tea benefits some people more than others. Genetic variations, varying exposures to risk-producing substances like tobacco, or different diets could all help explain the differences seen in these studies.<br />One study, for example, suggests that tea and soy may produce contrary benefits. Eating one of these foods may decrease the potential benefits from the other one.<br />Drinking massive amounts of green tea will never be able to save us from the ill effects of overeating a poorly balanced diet and living a sedentary lifestyle.<br />Eating a mostly plant-based diet, maintaining a healthy weight, keeping physically active and avoiding tobacco are the most effective steps we can take to lower our cancer risk. However, for those of us who would like to do a little more to reduce the risk of cancer, replacing three or four cups of coffee or soda per day with green tea is a reasonable step that may bring a variety of health benefits.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K2MUUY">Lipton Green Tea - 100% Natural, 2009 New Spring Green Tea, 50 Fresh Tea Bags from China by A2AWorld Green Tea</a><br /><br />&lt;the end>

review/text: I first tried this stuff in Japan, after a long flight there.  My husband and I were dehydrated from the traveling, and I was feeling terrible as a result.  Water wasn't doing it at all, and I couldn't find gatorade/powerade anywhere (found it later on in the trip, but it's not super easy to find).  Anyway, to me it tastes like gatorade, sweetish with a little salt, but without the added fruit flavoring.  I liked it a lot, and best of all, I felt a lot better nearly immediately--kind of odd, but my stomach made all kinds of strange noises after drinking it (I think it was because I was so dehydrated) which freaked me out, but I really did feel much improved.

review/summary: It's hard to ruin chocolate...
review/text: But this concoction manages to do just that.  The taste is neither coffee nor chocolate nor cake.  German chocolate cake has those two tastes plus big dollops of grated coconut. Tim's brew lacks the coconut too. What it does have is an artificial taste that's unpleasant and lingers on the palate like an oil slick.  I was hoping for dessert in a cup and got a caffeinated science project instead.<br /><br />A better alternative is Vietnamese coffee, which usually has a hit of dark chocolate in its composition.  Brew it your usual way (but do it in one of these small single-cup Vietnamese coffee filters if you want really really good). Add some sweetened condensed milk and just enjoy. It's like the grown up version of a chocolate chip cookie.  If you have a very sweet tooth, add sugar.  Or drop a few pieces of chocolate into your cup and microwave them until they melt. Pour in your coffee and say "aaaaaahhhhh."  But leave this ersatz chemical composition alone.  It's just not good.  I'm giving it two stars because if you were desperate for coffee and the nearest supply was a 3-day hike away, this might be a somewhat acceptable substitute. .

review/text: I ordered this b/c I love German Chocolate Cake hoping that this would taste like it.  If you drink your coffee black, this doesn't really taste like the cake very much.  However, once you put a little milk/cream in it, the flavors come to life.  The first time drinking it I was amazed!!!  It is also calorie free so why not have this instead of the cake itself.  Highly recommended!!!

review/text: I was excited to try this coffee and was so sure I'd like it that I buy the pack of 18 cups. Had my first one and I hated it. Doesn't taste like chocolate at all, but instead tastes a lot like coconut, which I hate!! I gave it thwo stars because if I did like coconut I am sure I would enjoy it.<br />I am looking for a chocolate-flavoured k-cup that's not too sweet. Seems impossible to find...

review/text: These are my guilty pleasure k-cups, as they're not exactly cheap.  But they're worth the splurge from time to time.<br /><br />I'm utterly amazed at the smell and taste of this coffee (and it tastes just exactly like it smells).  The other reviewers weren't joking - you can smell and taste each distinct flavor in a German chocolate cake: the chocolate, the coconut, and the caramel.<br /><br />And they aren't chemical-tasting, like many other flavored coffees.  Honest-to-goodness chocolate, coconut, and caramel flavor as if they distilled the dessert and added it to coffee.<br /><br />In this case, you do get what you pay for.

review/text: Pretty good flavoring, but it doesn't have distinct flavors like other K-cups such as green mountain coffee or starbucks k cups. The biggest problem with these k cups is, after you are done brewing and take out the kcup it leaks!!! I've never had that with any brand, I believe the filter they use is sub-par since I occasionally also find some grinds in my coffee when I use Brooklyn k cups.<br /><br />Pros: Great brooklyn heritage printed on every k-cup<br />  Alright Flavor<br /><br />Cons: these Kcups are leakers!<br />  Filters used are probably tissues or something because they really aren't doing their job well

review/text: We ordered the sample pack to help decide which flavors to get down the road.  So far the ones we've tried tasted great, but the packaging itself seemed to a bit off from all the other Keurig cups out there.  There seems to be an extra pleat near the top of the cup making the top wider than the other cups, which in turn is causing some of the cups to explode upon brewing and leaving grinds in the coffee.  I'm not sure if this has been corrected in the newer batches, but the sample pack contains these flawed cups which is making the experience less than ideal.

Okay, so now it came time for me to give it a whirl!  I thought they were pretty good - kid friendly and everything. The only reason that I could come up with for the kids not taking to it is because they were expecting something different (like a drink?) when they squeezed the pouch. I think it's a great product!

The Mandarin Avocado had such a sweet flavor that was followed with a nice bite to the taste buds.  The salsas were full of real flavor and not overpowered like other salsas and their "hot" flavor.  The Berry Mango was amazing.....I wish the jar had been 10 times bigger as that went too quick!  And the Black Olive was absolutely wonderful as well!  I can't pick a favorite as they were all delicious!  Bring on the chips and the Arriba! for a great snack and it will bring tons of compliments at any party.

I would have maybe been able to deal if that was the extent of the problem but as far as I can tell, all three jars were leaking after I opened the box.  Salsa all over the place is not my idea of fun!  I find this interesting since I'm not the first person to complain about this.  No expiration codes on jars have me wondering if it's still fresh even if they weren't leaking.  Does quality control exist at Arriba?  I do not recommend this product until these issues are resolved!

When I found these at Whole Foods, I was thrilled they were organic and contained no taurine.  I like the berry flavor.  I have not tried the lime flavor yet.  The diet version (no chemicals, just 9 grams pure cane sugar per can compared to 23 in the non-diet Steaz)tastes ok, like watery ginger ale.  But the orange flavor is the BEST.  It tastes like a really sweet Orangina drink.  Plus, I have never had Yerba Mate before (it is in the Steaz drinks), and I felt very euphoric for about a half hour.  I am hooked, will definately be a returning customer!!

He says the natural caffiene gives him a better energy boost than the synthetic caffiene they use in commercial sodas without as much withdrawl. We've tried many other natural energy drinks and this is by far his favorite!

review/text: Steaz is an every day staple for me.  Both the orange and berry are good though I typically get the berry.  I have had both the zero calorie and the one with sugar.  I am not fond of the one with zero calories.  The flavor is not appealing.  Consequently, to help lower sugar intake, I still buy both but mix them half and half.  Frankly, I think if they came out with a Stevia version, I might have a reason to give this product a 5-star rating.

review/summary: An acquired taste
review/text: I absolutely love this drink, but everyone else I know cannot understand why I do.  They all say it taste like medicine, but to me its delicious liquid crack. I suggest trying one before buying a 24pk because it is an acquired taste.  I love it and have been drinking this for years.

review/text: My go-to energy drink if I'm ever running on fumes and don't feel like reaching for coffee. One can and I'm good to go for the rest of the day. Personally, I get more of a refreshed feeling from drinking this, which is much better than the tweaked-out feeling from drinking super-strong coffee. Taste-wise, it's a lightly carbonated beverage with a reasonably sweet berry flavor. In my opinion, very clean taste without the medicine-like or chemical aftertaste that may be more common in other energy drinks. Definitely one of the top energy drinks out there.<br /><br />Side note: Amazon made a mistake with my original order but quickly fixed the issue with no hassles. Specifically, when I ordered this, I was expecting to receive 6 boxes, with each box containing four cans of the drink. When my order came, I got 6 boxes, but 2 of the boxes ended up being the zero calorie version of the drink. Immediately notified Amazon of the error and they sent me a new case free of charge. This time, it came as one sealed box with 24 cans of the regular drink (probably to avoid any possible mix-up again). So in the end, small mistake made, but Amazon came through in a big way! Can't speak highly enough about their customer service!

review/summary: A Subtle Boost
review/text: I took a sip of this and was promptly grossed out. Then I realized that it was supposed to be a "Berry Tea" drink rather than just a "Berry" drink and it didn't seem so bad. The flavor sort of reminds me of a better, sweeter version of the Berry 5-hour Energy. To be honest though, it's not my cup of tea (ha!).<br /><br />With Red Bull or most of the other more available energy drinks I usually get the shakes and am on hyper-alert status for a certain number of hours. Drinking this, however, gives me a more holistic boost; it increases my mood and motivation a bit to go along with the increased energy. But at times it can be hard to notice, which isn't something I will tolerate from a $2 small canned energy drink.<br /><br />I can see that this is objectively a good product but I'm just not a fan of it myself for the aforementioned reasons.

From the fine peanut form, to the oh-so-creamy and delectably sweet/salty center, to the vintage advertising (who doesn't want yet another Nutter Butter Peanut Butter Sandwich cookie?), the only other competition in the field is Oreos. And only if you replace the chocolate cookie with a peanut butter one. And the disgusting white stuff with peanut butter. And change the boring circular shape to something more reminiscent of an infinity symbol.

Not a whole lot more to say, if you like the product and you need a large amount, or want to use them over time, it's a pretty good deal.  If not, look elsewhere!

A great tip - if  you love chocolate and peanut butter together, smash these up and sprinkle them on some chocolate ice cream!  Anyway, be sure to try these if you love peanut butter cookies - they're pretty hard to find here in Ohio! Recommend!

review/text: I had never used pink peppercorns before and must admit to my surprise that they are actually a very good addition to my spice rack.<br /><br />These are very mild peppercorns and as described, they do indeed have a sweet, somewhat fruity flavor mixed in with a wonderful peppery taste.  Let's face it, they also look pretty cool.<br /><br />I have been using them on different fish dishes (I use it as a rub) with quite a lot of success.  I also used them with several other spices and herbs in a bottle of olive oil for salads.  They added much to the flavor of my mix.  Do take warning though, you use these rather sparingly as the flavor can overwhelm other spices you may be using.<br /><br />This is not a spice that I use everyday, but it is one that I am glad I added to my cooking arsenal.  The same old spices dish after dish gets a bit old and it is nice to be able to dazzle things up a bit from time to time.<br /><br />I like this product.

(Thus, I cannot compare them to others' of the same type.) So far, I have found that pink peppers can be used anywhere greens can be. Their taste is slightly lite with a little snap and a great aroma. I'm guessing that this first-time purchase will be repeated. However, one pound of peppercorns will last a long time. The price from the single vendor, JR Mushrooms, seems very good. I'm guessing (due to lack of experience with the pink) that this purchase was a good bargain.

I attempted to eat them with laughing cow cheese spread and it didn't work, the taste was still nasty.<br /><br />In the end the only way I was able to them was by dipping them in soup like regular toast, and even then they were hardly bearable, or dipping them in cheese soup or fondue.<br /><br />I would suggest skipping them, they are a waste of time and money, unless you like hard, crumbly, oily, over flavored chips.

review/text: I usually rotate between several brands of moist dog food to keep breakfast interesting for our JRT.  This product is wonderful to have on hand and our dog loves it.<br /><br />It's the moist food I normally stock up on when we plan to be away and our friend tends our pet.  It's extremely quick and easy to tear, empty and toss the individual packets.<br /><br />I'm glad Amazon sells it since many of our grocers seem to offer only individual packets.

review/text: My dogs absolutely love this stuff. I put it over their dry food and they eat it all because everything is coated in gravy. I only wish I had bought a larger supply!

review/summary: Great option
review/text: Since I know I will be needing this item on a regular basis, it is quite beneficial to me to order this through a subscription. Plus, I get the reduced price. The reduced price is better than any I can acquire from any store (except when on sale). The packaging is great because I can stack the unopened boxes in the pantry. I can also use the opened box as storage with easy access to the packs. I use this as a "gravy" for my dogs' hard food so do not use a full pack each time. The box allows me to sit the opened pack in the box to prevent spills.

review/summary: Great wet dog food
review/text: We always feed our Boston Terrier this brand of wet food....she likes a variety and this fits the bill since each packet has either beef or chicken in either sauce or gravy. She loves to eat them.

review/summary: SMELLS SO GOOD THAT EVEN A HUMAN'S MOUTH WATERS!  LOL
review/text: Now this is a 5-Star meal in a little pouch! When I tear open a pouch of Pedigree Little Champions Grilled Flavors Variety Pack for Dogs it smells so yummy that I think I've just made dinner, but my 5 rescue dogs know better .... they know those little, delicious, mouth-watering pouches are for them! Easy to order online at Amazon, easy on the pocketbook, easy to store in my cabinets, easy to tear open and pour over kibble, and so easy for even the most stubborn eater to gobble down their dry kibble and think they are getting a Thanksgiving Dinner at every meal!

review/summary: Little dogs love it
review/text: I have two little dogs - one Boston Terrier and one picky Miniature Dachshund.  The Boston Terrier tends to eat anything, and produces the gas to prove it.  The Miniature Dachshund is very, very picky.<br /><br />Both of them eat Pedigree Little Champions, and it produces *less* gas in the Boston Terrier than other foods (I serve this product with kibble).<br /><br />I'm pleased to be able to purchase this from Amazon, too, on the monthly order schedule. :)

review/text: On Sale for less than ELEVEN bucks and Super Saver Shipping Eligible what's not to love? Oh, the dog enjoys it very much! An issue with his usual dry dog food caused me to find "mix-ins" to get my pooch to each his usual grub. This fit the bill well, his tummy issues do not permit having canned type dog food by itself. Therefore I can't tell you about his reaction to eating this by itself.
