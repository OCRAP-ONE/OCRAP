review/summary: Good food!  My cats love it!
review/text: I had much difficulty finding a cat food that my fussy cats would eat.  They love this Royal Canin.  It was an easy change from the Science Diet cat food.  After reading about the ingredients in Science Diet and how it was not good for the animals, I decided to try this Royal Canin.  It's good for the animals and nutritious and not only that but they love it!  This is what we will buy from now on.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I switched to Royal Canin foods while my cat was still a kitten.  It didn't seem to be a difficult transition for him.  With the Intense Hairball formula the size of the hairballs has been dramatically reduced.  One bag seems to last a really long time so I think it must be filling for him.  I like the way the Indoor Beauty 35 makes his coat feel, but I think the Intense Hairball 34 is a better choice for him.

review/summary: All four cats like this and no longer have hairballs
review/text: I use several Royal Canin kibbles for my four cats who range from 7 to 15 years. They had hairball problems and some trouble digesting kibbles in the past. This intense hairball variety works fine and they all like it. They no longer have a hairball problem, and are healthy and active. Since I use several Royal Canin kibbles together I must give them all credit for my cats good health. Very pleased.

review/summary: Helped my siamese with hairball issues
review/text: My young siamese cat was having major issues with hairballs because he grooms both himself and my older cat.  The old cat has a thick, beautiful, soft coat of fur but the young cat couldn't digest all that fur naturally.<br /><br />I used to feed them Royal Canin Siamese food and slowly combined the foods for a while so that it wouldn't be a big switch for them.  Now we've been on Hairball food for a while.<br /><br />It's really helped the young cat or so it seems.  There's much less of the painful, heart-wrenching coughing up of hairballs.  His hairball problems had become so bad that I was afraid that he'd get blocked one day and die.  I also give them a dose of vaseline each week (not too much and its recommended by my vet. They see it as a treat as they like the taste.).<br /><br />I will add that my cats don't really like this food as much as their old food.  When I go in the kitchen since they've been on only hairball food, they meow at me now for different food.  They never did that before.  But, they eat this and I think in time, they'll get over missing the rich Siamese food.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: I have a 3 year old Ragdoll female housecat. She was raised on this food & will not try canned food. She does on occasion try cooked chicken breast pieces. After the first year I introduced a 50/50 mix of hairball 34 with her regular indoor Adult 27. The food is available 24/7 & she is not gaining weight. Presently about 10.5 lbs. I have never seen a hairball in our house. She is regular in her litter box. I have seen hair in the stool but not often. Don't know if this normal. She checks out fine with yearly vet visits. My present provider is Amazon.com.

Yes, these are a bit more substantial, but the taste is almost exactly the same. There is definitely nothing "luxury" about these cookies. I bought these because I loved the Cadbury Oatmeal and Chocolate Chip cookies. Sadly, these did nothing but disappoint.

review/summary: Good Choice for a Tassimo Tea Disc
review/text: I've tried several brands of Tassimo Tea Discs and in my opinion prefer the Twinings Earl Grey Tea.<br />I don't drink coffee so I strickly rely on Tea (and Tassimo Discs) for my warm liquid refreshment and whatever health benefits tea afforts.  Plus, I can brew each of these Earl Grey Tea Discs twice without much noticable loss of flavor and/or body the second time around. If you like drinking tea, I recommend that you at least give the Tassimo Earl Grey Tea Discs a try.  I think you'll be refreshingly surprised.  And, No, I don't work for Twinings!

review/text: As a preferred tea to coffee drinker, I was happy to note Tassimo has added more tea offerings to their selection. I don't typically like Earl Gray tea, but this one has a really nice flavor.  I look forward to having it at the end of the day without having to brew a whole pot. It does have a taste (and I even added extra water), so I'm not sure what the other reviewers mean when they say it does not.  My advice: try it for yourself.

review/text: I like these t-discs for their convenience but like others here, I would rate these a step below the flavor you get with the tea-bags. I gave the English Breakfast a 5-star rating because I think the disc makers got it right with that mix. To be fair, the Bergamont flavor that makes Earl Grey so appealing has to be hard to reproduce in a quick-drink type machine. Twinings does it well enough. I would still purchase these discs and can taste the flavor in the tea. It's just not quite as strong as what you get when you brew the tea conventionally. I'm certain Twinings will continue to work on the mix and soon, this will likely not be a problem.

It could have been dirty dish water I was drinking. There is no flavor at all to this product. I tried 3 more and they are all tasted the same. Waste of money, and tea drinkers will be clearly disappointed. Twinings should be embarrassed that Tassimo is representg their product in a low standard way! I now wonder if I should even bother with another type of tea!<br /><br />Don't waste your money. Stick with tea bags. My son got this for me for a gift so I could enjoy an easy cup of tea. Guess the family will continue to drink their coffee instead

Found these were cheaper on amazon so I offered to help and ordered a case of 36 (to give some away to grandkids and such for easter) Well upon arrival I was very interested in trying these, I have to say, I think they are awful. Doesn't even remind me of chocolate, I tried each flavor and the horrible chocolate was so bad I could't even tell the difference between each flavor. I literally spit it all out after biting into them, and I do not consider myself picky in any way. I would stay away from these if you have never had them before.

review/text: The cookies were tasty but 90percent of the 12packages of cookies were crumbs.  They are not a soft cookie so I was surprised at how broken up they were, but none the less this is one very tasty cookie if you do not mind the crumbs.

review/summary: Delectable, Filling Cookies With Low Calories Make a Healthy Snack
review/text: These are are crunchy, delectable cookies that come in a variety of flavors, of which, I find The Original & Gingerspice tastier than others - 5 stars. What I find very puzzling is that Amazon has different flavors under Amazon Prime at different times: last week it was The Original and now it is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZM7H0">Almondina Almond Cookies, Choconut, 4-Ounce Package (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FJCXX6">Almondina Almonduo with Pistachio Biscuits, 4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>. Almondina also makes an assorted 8 cookie flavor giftbox but for some reason Amazon does not carry it, as of March 2010. If your favorite flavor is not under Amazon Prime, keep checking, next week it may be!<br /><br />Each cookie has 35 calories and the package lists the serving size as 4 cookies. For me, usually 2 cookies are filling enough and satisfy my hunger. Cookies have roasted almonds, pitachios and resins. Each cookie has 5.5 gm carbohydrate approximately half of which is sugar, but the company claims it to be "All Natural". I guess they consider sugar to be natural!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40">Biscoff Family Pack</a> are also delicious cookies, with 25 calorie per cookie and roughly the same amount of carbohydrates and sugar per cookie as Almondina, but they are't as filling and you end up consuming more calories. May be it is not possible to make delicious cookies with any less sugar. To give you perspective and comparison, Oreo Cookies have double the sugar and carbohydrate and each serving has 160 calories; and they are not filling so you end up consuming a lot more than one serving at a time. I have't found any other delicious cookies with as low carbohydrate content as Almondina. For me, they make a very healthy snack that satiates my hunger and craving for food.

review/summary: Great cookie ...when fresh
review/text: I love these cookies!!<br /><br />But when I received my 6 pack from Amazon, they were slightly off in crispness and flavor.  They still had 4 months before they expired, WTH!<br /><br />I wrote a letter to Almondina suggesting the re-evaluate their freshness calculation.  They responded that they do not sell to Amazon, so they could not comment on any product handling that may have impacted their product's flavor, crispness or freshness.  They offered to replace my cookies.  Which I thought was excellent customer service.  I will buy my Almondinas directly from their website in the future.

review/summary: Rose Flavor WIthout the Perfume
review/text: There are a lot of exotic and fancy offerings from Red Leaf, but sometimes you just need something basic, simple but lovely. Rose is that flavor for me, I love it in tea, cakes, candies, anything! So I really wanted to try it out with matcha. I really like perfume-y flavors, but most people don't. In the bag this smells like a perfume store, seriously strong! But once mixed up into a nice iced latte, the rose is smooth and really only slightly floral. It's like rose candies: sweet (the most naturally sweet matcha I've tried) and with a good rose flavor but with no perfume notes. I think people who only kind of like floral teas would even love this!

review/summary: The price is right
review/text: We have a little Maltese that we spoil to no end.  These treats are the perfect size for him and he loves them.<br /><br />He can be a little picky.  Among his daily treats are Greenies and since we found these on Amazon, Zuke's Jerky Naturals.  I will say that we tried two different kinds.  Along with these, we tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MLKXOU">Wellness WellBites Chicken and Venison Recipe Dog Treats, 8-Ounce Pouch</a>.<br /><br />The Zuke's are really potent.  When you open the bag, you catch a big whiff of how strong they are.  They're probably real flavorful because of it (I didn't try one).  The Wellness treats seem a little dryer.  While our little guy likes both of the treats, the Zuke's win over the Wellness.  Plus they're cheaper so that's even better.  He can't get enough of them.<br /><br />We also tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a> made by Zuke's.  He doesn't like those as much as the Greenies.<br /><br />I would say that this product is one of the best we found for our dog.  Plus we were able to take advantage of the free super saver shipping as well.  These are highly recommended.<br /><br />[Edit: August 14, 2011]<br /><br />He still loves them!<br /><br />We've had to start giving our little guy Remedel for a little shoulder injury he had.  These Zukes make it real easy to give him the pill.  Since they're moist, we just put the pill inside and press it all around the pill.  That way he doesn't even know he's taking it.  Trying to give him pills with the Wellness treats doesn't work so well since they're dryer.<br /><br />[Edit: September 29, 2012]<br /><br />Anyone else notice that they seem different??  The last couple packs we bought were dryer and brittle.  They also weren't as potent as the other ones were.  He doesn't seem to like them as much any more.  I don't know if the bags we bought were partially opened so they dried out by the time the were delivered or if their recipe changed.  I'll buy some more and see how they turn out.  A little disappointed...

review/summary: Tough, brittle, completely dehydrated, and unsafe.
review/text: I bought two bags of these, thinking it was the same product that I used to buy in different packaging (light blue, with a see-through dog shape against a grass green background). Unfortunately, it was completely not the same thing! These treats were actually like jerky-- tough and brittle. I give my dog soft treats because he doesn't chew the damn things, and he choked on these horrible things; I had to toss them out.<br /><br />Note that the "Zuke's Jerky Naturals" with the other packaging (http://www.amazon.com/Zukes-Jerky-Naturals-Beef/dp/B00008DFPY) have always been moist and soft, and I've never had a problem with those. I suspect that this batch was not new packaging, as I had thought, but very old packaging; these may be the same treats I usually feed my dog, just having sat on a shelf for years. In any case, these were COMPLETELY different treats, and not safe to feed my dog.

review/summary: Lab loves them
review/text: I'm constantly looking for healthy dog treats that are not crazy expensive.  These are one of the better deals I could find when considering cost/ounce.  My Lab absolutely loves them and they are good for him too.  The treats are soft and moist, which is a plus for my dog.  They could easily be broken into smaller pieces, but I generally just give my dog a whole one when he does something good.  I wouldn't keep them in my pocket because they do smell a bit.  It's not an overly offensive smell, but strong enough that you don't want to carry it around with you all day.<br /><br />I definitely recommend these for all dogs.

review/summary: Dogs love these!
review/text: We normally don't buy expensive treats (tend to stick to dry biscuits), but we got these for all of the family dogs as stocking stuffers for Christmas. They were a huge hit! Our dog is willing to do anything imaginable to get one of these. My boyfriend's mom, who totally spoils her Portie, hadn't seen these before, and her dog loved these like crazy as well, so she went out bought a bunch more when they ran out. Also, they're natural and there are no shady ingredients, so they are good for your pooch!<br /><br />Just to clarify, these don't actually have the consistency of jerky. They are little squares of what looks like pressed meat product. Clearly, our dogs do not care and consume these with great enthusiasm, so still very highly recommended!

review/summary: The only treats I'll use.
review/text: These treats are excellent. I have a chihuahua who has done obedience training and is now in agility training. I use the treats to aid with his training as they are easy to break into small pieces yet big enough for me to carry in my pocket and grab easily.<br /><br />They have NEVER made him sick no matter how many he eats during a training session and he goes absolutely NUTS when he hears me open the bag.<br /><br />I've purchased the smaller sized treats by Zukes, but they seem to be harder and are too big to offer a small dog as a treat, yet too difficult to split into smaller pieces. So, I find the square shaped ones to be much easier to use for training.<br /><br />They CAN get hard if the bag is left open so you need to make sure to close the bag immediately. I read another poster mention that putting a damp paper towel in the bag will restore the moisture to the treats, so I'll have to try that if I forget to close a bag, which happens.<br /><br />Overall a healthy and practical treat! I'm really glad I found these.

review/summary: My picky dog loves these treats!
review/text: My dog is very picky, to say the least. He's super cute, but is very picky about treats. He won't eat any biscuits, doesn't like most fake "meat" treats, and won't eat bacon. Because of this, he has hurt many an eager pet shop employee's feelings. However, he LOVES these treats. We just adopted him from the shelter, and his previous owners didn't teach him much. These treats are making training so much easier. He'll do almost anything for them.<br /><br />They're pretty big, so you can rip them up into much smaller pieces. They will dry out if you leave the package open, so they have to be sealed each time.<br /><br />I know I'm echoing most of the other reviews when I say this, but these are fantastic treats.

They were a big hit and continue to be one of my little schnoodle's favorite treats.<br />Soft jerky squares (approx 1") can easily be split into 3-4 pieces.  We use them for her training/play sessions and she seems to especially love it when the reward is the Zuke's soft lamb jerky.<br />Although she performs just as eagerly when the reward is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00292BM7C">Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats, Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz</a> or the Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken n' Cherry.

My dogs love them and they are made without corn fillers or by-products, which are 2 things I check for when purchasing any treats.

review/summary: Not Really "Jerky"
review/text: It's difficult to tell from the pictures and the description, but these aren't really jerky (dried strips of meat) but are smallish, moist, chewy treats made from meat and other ingredients - I suppose meat goop formed into a shape.  Think Pringle vs. a potato chip.  Anyway, our dog seems to approve - not sure it even touched the sides!  The beef, lamb and salmon varieties she tried all disappear in the blink of an eye.  A tasty treat for your dog, made in the USA, but just not the jerky I was hoping for.

review/summary: Good brand, good size bags
review/text: When my husband first got our cat a few years ago, he started feeding her cheaper cat food.  She threw up one day all over the carpet, and it was really hard to get the "red" stains out from the color in the cat food.  He then switched her to Iams, and now on the rare occasion she has those problems, the carpet isn't stained like it was before.  Iams is a little more expensive than other brands, but it's definitely worth it.  Your cat doesn't cost that much money to keep anyway, so you might as well feed them better quality food.<br /><br />I defintely recommend buying this product from Amazon (the pack of 8 2-lb. bags).  You pay more up front, but it averages out to about the same, or maybe even a little less, as buying the 4 pound bags from the local stores.  Plus, your cat gets "fresher" food more often, which is especially good if you only have one cat and don't go through the bag as fast.  Yes, our cat is a little spoiled.

review/text: I had a cat with renal failure who had 1 kidney removed several years ago. The doctor recommended the KD dry for her post-surgery. She live nearly 9 years on one kidney and this food alone! I now have three rescued cats of diverse backgrounds, including 1 longhair. They all eat the Iams dry food at will, with no portion control. None are overweight and though the longhair gets frequent hairballs, that is not a result of the food, but rather how frequently I brush him. More brushing = less hairballs.

review/text: GREAT DEAL, CONVENIENT TOO.  Much cheaper than WalMart and I don't need to lug it home, it appears on my doorstep.  Cats hack up fewer hair balls and instead of adding petroleum products (ie-vaseline) like most HAIRBALL formulas, which causes diarrhea and blocks vitamin absorption, this one has probiotics, which make the digestive tract work better, thus eliminating most of the hairball problem in a healthy way.  (Nothing can prevent 100% of hairball hacking, it's just something all cats do once in awhile.)  A great deal on a great product, plus free shipping when you order over a certain amount.---Coos Bay Sandra

review/text: I have been feeding my cat all sorts of cat food.  She has long fur and hasn't had any hairballs.  If she gets hairballs on Iams Proactive hairball formula, I would definitely update this review.<br /><br />This food is different from any cat food I've ever bought because the kibble is shaped like tiny balls.  Up until now, my cat has eaten foods shaped like starfish or "Y" and "X."  She doesn't seem to mind the shape, though.<br /><br />My main beef with cat food is some of them smell so horribly bad (dead fish).  This one is fine.  That's what I buy for -- that and price.  If it does what it says, make my cat lose weight and controls hairballs, I will be a happy cat owner.<br /><br />Will come back in the future to update.<br /><br />____________________________<br /><br />UPDATE:  Well, this formula must not work.  After being on it for two months, my cat suffered her first hairball.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND! or your pet too can start getting cysts on their body.. no good

review/summary: Works for multi-cat families (Chicken Flavor)
review/text: If you have a multi-cat family and are struggling to find common ground to minimize digestion disturbances amongst all of them, this is a good bet.  My cats don't *love* this food, but they all tolerate it well and don't run away from it immediately after I pour it.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are unbeatable too, even for the small (2lb bags).  While it seems weird to get so many small bags, my cats appreciate it because the these bags don't reseal well, so with smaller bags, the food is fresher in general.<br /><br />As mentioned in the subject, this only applies to the Chicken flavor, my cats don't care for the others.

Suddenly after years of good health & a beautiful coat we have to find something else she likes besides occasional raw fish or shrimp.

review/summary: Pretty finicky for a rescue!!!
review/text: We rescued a Cairn Terrier (Toto, Wizard of Oz, was a Cairn.) We found out he had tested positive, and even with the cost of heart worm treatment, you could look in those dark eyes, and know 'someone is in there. The dog has a personality. And I'm a terrier junkie.<br /><br />We adopted him from the rescue group. Got him treated, good to go. But he is really fussy. We went through 4 brands of dog food until we found what he'd eat. (Royal Kanin) He's scared of the BIG water stations, and alot of other things. The first time we went to get a drink, it burbled, and he RAN away from it. Now he has to have his own bowl.<br /><br />TREATS? I was very happy that our pet store has bulk dog treats - tried them ALL. Nope. Did not want any of them. I picked up a 9" Bully Stick, & a 3" braided and he was dancing on his hind legs. And that was just when I brought the BAG in the house. He went BONKERS. It took about 3 days to go through a 9" stick, & 6-7 days on the braided. SO, we're Red Barn for life. Malcolm hasn't had diarrhea from the Bully Sticks. He had a 'stomach bug' and THAT was DEFINITELY diarrhea! He was kinda floppy, groany, I want on the chair with YOU, Mom kind of bug.<br /><br />(Free tip from Malcom's Mom - Moshie, terrier cross 1985-May 2000, and Duncan, brindle Scottish Terrier 1996- Mar 13 2009. They would both tell you I don't buy junk for my dogs. These are GREAT sticks.<br />The hubby wanted to try another (cheaper) brand. Malcolm took it, sat down, and laid it on the rug, like "Come on, Mom. You can do better than THAT.) So I'm ordering more Bullies TODAY.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014GDRSQ">Red Barn 9" Bully Stick (10 Count)</a>
