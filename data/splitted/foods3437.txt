review/summary: Great!
review/text: I couldn't find this pasta anywhere in the grocery stores around my home, so I was pretty happy to find it on Amazon.  It comes in a package of 5 boxes, so now I have lots of it to last for a while.  I made Frog Eye Salad with it and it was great!

review/text: The only warning that you may need is to not burn yourself on the stove when cooking the pasta.  This is the way to go when buying pasta because this is a great price and you don't have to go to the store and wait in line and waste gas.  Great pasta, tastes great, buy and enjoy the food!

review/text: I put De Cecco Acini di pepe in my home made chicken soup.  After several hours in a hot thermos, the pasta is still al dente.  When my local supermarket stopped carrying it, I tried several other varieties and brands, which all turned to mush by lunch time.  De Cecco makes the good stuff.

review/summary: Tasty and healthy no-stir, low-sugar peanut butter
review/text: As most nutritionists and weight lifters will tell you, peanut butter is a near-perfect food. High in protein, relatively low in saturated fat, and easy to eat in a hurry, it's probably the healthiest quick protein-fix outside of a protein shake. And as far as peanut butter brands go, Jif Natural Creamy Peanut Butter is one of the best.<br /><br />A single 2-table-spoon serving (which, to be honest, is probably a smaller serving than most people eat) contains a good amount of protein (7g), a fair degree of fiber (2g), low sodium (80 mg), and very little carbs (8g). Like all peanut butters it's somewhat high in fat (16g) but relatively low in saturated fat (3g).<br /><br />It should also be noted that though Jif Natural peanut butter contains no artificial flavors or preservatives, it does contain a small amount of added sugar (3g) and is, like Skippy's natural peanut butter, made with palm oil in addition to the natural peanut oil. Die hard natural food-eaters will object to Jif's peanut butter on both of these counts, but from a usability perspective most consumers will probably prefer Jif to "truly" natural peanut butter, which (because peanut oil, unlike palm oil, separates and rises to the top of the jar) is messy and requires frequent stirring before use. Jif's natural peanut butter, on the other hand, looks and tastes exactly the peanut butter most of us have grown up with--only it's better for us!

review/summary: Guess SPREAD doesn't really mean NATURAL?!
review/text: I've been a consumer of natural peanut butters "forever" & am familiar with its ingredients. That's why I felt confident ordering JIF, a name brand online. HOWEVER, the ingredients really need to be listed on Amazon. This natural peanut butter has molasses & palm oil in it. Palm oil I'd seen before & do limit intake of it but for a bulk "emergency" type food, I was willing to allow it. This JIF is listed as "no stir" so I figured palm oil was an ingredient.<br />The molasses was a new 'trick" to me. Several of my family are allergic to calcium & can't tolerate JIF's 2%Ca , a result of the molasses. So now I'm making a donation to the local homeless shelter instead of to my family's emergency stock. Even though we're "Prime " Amazoners ,I'm not returning it because I have a feeling Amazon will say the return's not their fault & the shipping would be ginormous due to the weight. Since the ingredients are listed on the individual jars, the shelter can make informed use of it.

I have to give him chemo therapy in the form of 3 pills a day and this is the only kind of treat that works to camouflage the medicine adequately. I usually make little pellets of meds using bits of Greenies pill pockets, roll them in some dried crushed food toppers, and hide them in a bowl among a few whole pieces of the toppers.  This subterfuge has saved us much trauma.<br /><br />They seem to be very delicious judging from the speed with which Albert gobbles them down, medicine and all.

review/text: I found a can of Solo almond filling in my cabinet. When I opened it, I fell in love. It was delicious right out of the can. I never got a chance to use it for baking because we ate it all. We used it as a topping for everything. Alas, when I looked at every grocery within 200 miles of my home, I couldn't find the Solo product. Then I found it on Amazon, and I wasn't sure I wanted to commit to 6 cans. So I waited awhile and when I finally decided I mistakenly bought this brand instead of the Solo. This one tastes good right out of the can but not as heavenly as the Solo. There is a slight bitter aftertaste which I think might disappear when baked, but I haven't tried that yet. This product is more dense, less liquid, than the Solo.

review/text: If my dog could review this product, she'd give it 5 stars. She obviously loves the bacon flavor and being a very licky puppy, this is a real treat for her. As the pet owner, I like that she seems so content with the product, but it's a non-traditional way of delivering a treat and seems a bit awkward. The treat is given through a roll-on ball, like the old deodorants. With little treat bites, you can reward a dog with one or two nibbles, but regulating the number of licks or the time they're allowed to lick doesn't work so well. For training purposes, I wouldn't recommend this product, but just for gratuitous treat giving, I think it's just fine.

review/summary: Smells Super; Our Dogs Have no Taste Appreciation
review/text: I reluctantly give this a 3 due mainly to the smell of the Liver Flavor.  The sole purpose of the product is to offer a flavorful break from the ordinary dog food flavors they normally receive but alas both picky Yorkies refused on several occasions to even take a good whiff.  They love freeze dried livers from chickens, beef, pig and lamb but cannot stand Lickety Stik.  Just to test the situation I tried the Stik first and it was a resounding NO.  Then after they had freeze dried livers and again it was NO.  I took their favorite dry food and applied a small amount on several pieces and mixed them in with untreated food.  They literally segregated the morsels into edible and Stiks.  The Stiks did not get touched while the unflavored were eaten with vigor.  Determined to prove that the Yorkies are just picky I offered a few licks to the neighbor's Retriever and he looked at me as if I am the fool I am.  Success did not open its heart on several days ago nor did it when I tried one more time with the same negative results.  I cannot say that any of the other flavors have any similar aspects since I only received the one container.  Bottom line:  Human Rating: 3  Dog Rating: 1 too many.  Sorry but the effort was there.

They are all medium to big dogs (Boxer mixes, Pit Bull mix, Black Lab mix , Plott Hound & Greyhound mix) and they all come a-runnin' when I pull the bottle out.  Even Mollie, our finicky-eater Black Lab mix, loves it.  Sometimes, they try to take a bite, but they all quickly figure out that the trick is to lick the little roll-on-deodorant-type ball.  The key, of course, is to hold the bottle while the dogs help themselves, as opposed to giving them the bottle to do with what they please...  ;o)<br /><br />The bottom line is the Bacon Flavored Lickety Stik gets a unanimous "Four Paws Up" from my test panel!

review/summary: Interesting way to "treat" your dog!
review/text: I have to say this is an unusual product.  It's made on the same order as a deodorant and the dog licks the roller to get the flavoring.  We got the liver flavor and all the dogs loved it.  In fact, there was some times when two dogs were trying to lick the roller at the same time since they can't seem to wait their turn.  It's definitely something to try...don't know how well it would do training your dog instead of the regular treats, though.  It'll probably get gross after a few lickings too but a damp paper towel should fix it up...especially if you wipe it after the dog uses it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't comment if it really tastes like liver flavor.  The dog's aren't talking but they definitely seem to like it...<br /><br />Oh yeah, and its made in the USA!

review/summary: Interesting Idea - Little Dogs Loved It
review/text: Well, the title says it all.  The little dogs of the household loved this interesting twist on the traditional treat.  They did not seem to understand why they were not allowed to walk off with it, but they grasped the concept eventually.  Often traveling with our two smallest poms, this "roll-on" style treat is a simple, non messy, non-poop-inducing alternative to traditional treats.  It is "just enough" when you want to reward them without having to worry about making a mess in the car.  I am not sure if this concept will catch on with the mainstream, but as long as it is competitively priced, I can see this being a useful tool for many dog-rearing activities.  While we are far past that stage, I can see this being helpful for different training activities as well.  Bring yourself and your dog "outside of the bubble" and give this new treat a try.

review/summary: One weird idea
review/text: Can you imagine how this product came to fruition?  It seems like an accident.  Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.  Or maybe it was a large-scale Big Lots-style buy where the guys at the pet food factory got an incredibly great deal when a Ban roll-on factory got flooded and had to unload a warehouse.<br /><br />In any event, what seems like a really weird idea is...well, a really weird idea that our dog LOVES.  Of course there's not much nutritional value to letting your dog take a few slurps off the end of a liver-flavored roll-on doggie treat, but hey, there's not much nutritional value to that rawhide toy you just bought him either.  Give this a try for dessert.

review/text: When I first saw this I wasn't to sure but I love to give my pups new things to try. When it came in I checked it out....it looks like a roll on deodorant. I had to laugh but then came the taste test. I think my dogs are in love with this! We have small dogs...all less than 6lbs and I have to roll the ball for them to get more flavor so it's not so bad but I imagine that larger dogs can roll the ball themselves. If you're looking for something new and different then you may want to give this one a try!

review/text: I ordered this, not sure if my dogs would like the roller ball or turn their noses up at it, but I'm happy to report they loved it! They went at it with gusto-so much so that I had to put it away after only a few licks-afraid they might make themselves sick. Little did I know that my little monsters would find a way to knock it off the shelf & absolutely destroy the bottle while I was at the grocery store. I came home to a shredded bottle & 2 pomeranians with very guilty looks on their faces.....<br />I think this is a great product & if the reaction of my dogs is any indication-so do they. I will definitely be ordering more when it becomes available, but might have to invest in a lock box to keep it in....lol!

review/text: I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog.

review/summary: Roller Jams, Wasted Product
review/text: The roller ball on this treat (basically gravy) does not roll around readily from the friction of my dog's tongue licking. The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism.

review/summary: Lily LIKED It!!
review/text: My little diabetic shih-tzu, Lily, is notorious for hating anything new. I am constantly on the search for healthy new treats that I can give her after she has her insulin shot (every 12 hours...ugh!) I received the Liver flavor Lickety Stik and was prepared to donate it to the local animal shelter because I was just sure Lily would turn up her nose to it. Lo and behold...she liked it! It took a minute or two for her to figure out how to get the treat out and I squeezed the bottle too hard and some dripped on the floor, but Lily quickly lapped it up. I don't think the ball turned very easily, but she was determined to try to get the treat-juice out of the bottle. I think this is a great idea, but I am only giving it 4 stars because the packaging was hard to read and the ball didn't seem to turn very readily.

review/summary: Great Idea- My dog loves it.
review/text: I have one dog, Rex, a Shepherd/Lab mix and he absolutely loves the Lickety Stik. Now if he sees me get it out, he automatically sits or gives me his paw. So cute.<br /><br />This is a great new idea for doggy treats. Especially when walking my dog- I've gotten tired of carrying a bag of treats for him. And new ideas are always welcome, I don't want to overfeed my dog with other treats... They can get expensive because he's allergic to almost everything.<br /><br />So the lickety sticks come in three flavors- liver, chicken and bacon. Rex loved each one. The container that holds the liquid treat is a roller... I saw another reviewer describe it like a deodorant stick with a roller. That is exactly what the case is like. Unfortunately the liquid doesn't just come out when the ball is licked, the bottle has to be squeezed for your dog. My roller gets stuck if I don't squeeze or push it with my finger.<br /><br />I highly suggest trying this item out, great alternative to milk bones :)

review/summary: Great Idea for Dispensing Dog Treats
review/text: Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and "best" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  "Reilly" recommends the treat!

review/summary: Great, low-cal training treat.
review/text: I had to give the ball a partial turn to get some of the liquid on it after shaking to mix it up, but after I did that my dog licked away and loved it! This is a good low-cal treat for dogs and would be great as a training aid. Our dog dutifully performed her repertoire of tricks to get more of the treat, and then followed me back to the kitchen as I put it away. The only bad thing is that you DO have to hold it for the dog, but if you're using it as a training aid that may actually be an advantage.<br /><br />There are over 500 licks in each tube and 10 licks is only 1 calorie. I gave my dog 10 licks per trick.<br /><br />FWIW, my dog is a 1.5 year old hound dog/bird dog mutt.

review/summary: Good for a go around, but probably not the staple snack for Charlie
review/text: The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're "healthier;" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.

review/summary: My dogs love it, even if it is funny looking
review/text: PetSafe Lickety Stik is a weird looking dispenser full of a delicious liquid treat my pooches are crazy about.  The strange design is slightly bigger than a deoderant bottle and the dogs get their treat by licking the roll-on ball!<br /><br />I own Wonderland Kennels, with 7 Boston Terriers and German Shepherds that I train and compete with.  Even the picky ones love this stuff.  The bottle is small, but it goes a loooong way because the pups are only getting a little at a time, instead of a larger treat.<br /><br />Pacino and Molly (German Shepherds) first instincts were to try to bite down on the dispenser, but it didn't crack and is still holding up fine.  They quickly learned to just lick it, though the best way to introduce it to larger dogs is to hold it completely upside-down so the angle makes it easier to lick and harder for them to grab.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised by how big a hit this little Lickety Stik is with my pups, and how long the bottle lasts.  Maizy, Molly, Gracie, Pixi, Einstein, Pacino, and Isabelle each give it four paws up!  :)

If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself.

I could also see that this might be helpful if you happen to have a dog who won't eat - you could roll the liquid around the edge of his bowl and it may entice him to eat.

review/summary: An innovative invention much appreciated by canines
review/text: with the exception of my senior chihuahua that viewed the container of Lickety Stik as possibly a lethal weapon and, not wishing to take any chances, tore out of the room when she saw it for under-the-bed protection.<br /><br />"Oh well," I said, "I've got three other dogs.  Let's try them."  At first my toy bichon-poodle was also wary and stepped back.  But when she saw my shepherd and chow chow growing very excited and thrilled by this new offering, she relented and tasted some herself.  It was a decided hit.<br /><br />There are no directions on the small plastic container as to how to use, so I was uncertain if I should squeeze it and, if so, how tightly.  I quickly learned that squeezing it too firmly causes the liquid to pour out so, if squeezed, "lightly" should be the watchword.  I would advise the first time trying it to place a paper towel under the container until one gets the hang of manipulating the small plastic bottle and administering the treat to the dog(s), which will not be a problem as my two large dogs, and eventually the smaller one, just kept wanting to lick and lick and keep on licking.  They found this new-found gadget to be very exciting.<br /><br />What is most appealing about it to me is that it contains all natural ingredients - nothing artificial.  They consist of natural flavors, cultured milk, lecithin, rosemary extract and green tea extract.  It also contains Vitamin A.<br /><br />So this is a fun way to make your dog(s) happy, small enough to carry in your pocket, light enough for easy carrying.  Now I've only used it once, but I predict that the next time my dogs (chihuahua excepted) see me holding the by now familiar container, there'll be a stampede of sorts.  Just like in television commercials.<br /><br />Tail waggin' good!

review/text: Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package.

review/summary: Fun Idea
review/text: This is a nice idea for a low calorie dog treat.<br /><br />It looks just like a roll-on antiperspirant, and you have to roll the ball to get it going. One problem is that this is a syrup or other liquid that is pretty sticky and I usually have to get the ball rolling myself each time. Also, once I offer it to my dogs they can get one lick but cannot get the ball moving.<br /><br />The other problem I've had is my dogs want to take the whole thing, not just lick the surface of it. They seem to like the taste because they really grab the whole thing.<br /><br />I think it's a fun idea and it does seem to taste great to them, though I wouldn't really recommend it because of the ball being hard for dogs to roll.

review/summary: Dog was a fan, but I wasn't
review/text: I have a 60lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix who loves all sorts of treats so I'm always on the lookout for new products. Unfortunately, many doggie treats have gotten a bit pricey these days if you plan on giving them a helping. When the PetSafe Lickety Stik (essentially the same design as a roll-on deodorant) popped up on Amazon Vine I naturally snatched one up right away. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Low in calories, 1 per 10 licks.<br /><br />+ My dog loved them.<br /><br />+ Container has a re-sealable cap.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Fluid can drip out of roller ball and leave a sticky residue on surfaces.<br /><br />- Container is not really pet safe if the dog gets ahold of the treat.  Most dogs could easily chew apart the package and choke on the roller ball.<br /><br />- Doesn't promote healthy chewing, essential for a dog's teeth.<br /><br />- Small container is not good for bigger or messier dogs.  My dog licked not just the roller ball but the handle itself including my fingers.<br /><br />- Smells absolutely awful.<br /><br />My dog loved the Lickety Stik (although he's not terribly picky about treats) and the product allowed me to stop his treat giving at any time. Sadly, he doesn't get any dental benefit from ingesting this treat. Better suited for smaller dogs who won't slobber all over trying to lick out the fluid.  Still, I wouldn't pay the asking price for the item. The best thing about this treat was they occupied my dog long enough to groom him sufficiently.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>Lickety Stik is a lickable (vs. edible) dog treat that comes in a variety of flavors, such as bacon, liver and chicken.  The container looks something like an old-style stick of deordorant with a plastic ball under the cap that LOOKS like it would roll around, but is actually stationary.  You squeeze the bottle until the gravy-like liquid treat starts to ooze out AROUND the ball and the dog licks it off. If you're not careful (i.e., if you squeeze too hard, esp. if you are treating a small dog like mine), you could end up with a mess on the floor.  That said, it is not difficult to master how hard to squeeze to treat the dog...just be forewarned to squeeze gently until you find the right pressure to use.<br /><br />As you will see in the accompanying video, my dog adores the flavor (I was using the liver flavor Lickety Split in the video).  She whines for it sometimes several times a day (she knows where I keep it).  However, she has a sensitive stomach and I have had to switch over to predominantly allergy-formula food and treats to reduce (and almost eliminate) the frequency of her spit-ups.  The day after I gave her the first taste of Lickety Stik, she spit up for the first time in a few months.  Perhaps that had nothing to do with it and it was something else, but it did make me wary of treating her with this product too often.<br /><br />Note that the packaging says this product is "All-Natural with Vitamins," that there is only "1 calorie in every 10 licks" and that there are "over 500 licks per bottle."  The product is made in the USA.<br /><br />I can see where this product would be an excellent one to use for training purposes or on car trips, when you don't want to have to carry a lot of treats with you.<br /><br />Edited 10/11/11 to add that, after reviewing a couple of other reviews, it appears that the rollerball is SUPPOSED to roll, which was my assumption, but it did not on either of the ones I have used (bacon and liver flavors).  I just opened them up and tried to forcibly roll the ball.  I was able to on one but not the other.  Perhaps it varies by container or perhaps it takes a good while of use before the ball starts rolling.  I've been using it about a week.

review/summary: Interesting Dog Treat
review/text: My family has two chihuahuas. I tried the dog treat on the two of them today and got different reactions. The largest chihuahua liked it and the smallest chihuahua did not. This is par to the course and people like different things too.<br /><br />The treat is a liquid that taste like liver. It can be rolled easily anywhere you desire. All you have to do is take the top off and squeeze the sides of container. It is easy to use. It certianly is a new concept as I have always thought of dog treats as something solid.<br /><br />I would recommend it for any dog owner. If you have any questions, ask at this email!

review/summary: Not so great says my dog
review/text: This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.  Mine doesn't.  To be fair, he's 8 years old and set in his ways.

review/summary: Rich bacon smell
review/text: This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could "train" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.

review/summary: Our dog's opinions
review/text: We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Novel idea, but needs work
review/text: I'm always willing to try something new for my dogs, and this sounded like a great idea, a portable no-mess treat delivery system.<br />The flavor I'm reviewing is "Smoky Bacon"<br />I experienced some of the same issues noted by other reviewers. The ball in mine did not roll freely, so once my dog licked it clean, I had to manually advance it with my finger. So much for the "no mess" aspect.<br /> Squeezing the bottle as suggested by a few only results in a glop of foul-smelling liquid oozing out and dripping on the floor.<br />Yes, I said foul-smelling. I know dogs have a somewhat different take from their people on what smells good and what doesn't, but 3 of our 4 dogs recoiled at the smell of the product. Our only "outside" dog would take a lick, then take a sniff of her own rear end...presumably she found the scent similar. If you've ever seen a dog do that, then you know what I mean.<br /><br />I'm also concerned about how sanitary this delivery system is. Between uses you have a ball laden with dog-mouth bacteria multiplying. I doubt rinsing the ball before storage would help much, undoubtably some slobber is going to contaminate the bottle contents during usage. Refrigeration is not suggested on the label but it might help retard bacteria growth between uses.<br /><br />I think this product is another one of those things that sound like a good idea but the execution is flawed. I cannot recommend this product in good faith, and the $7.99 suggested retail price is a little steep for 1.7 fluid ounces of product.

review/summary: Three dogs -- not much interest
review/text: I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long.

review/summary: My dog liked it, I didn't.
review/text: I usually try to see the good side of things so I'll start with  - my dog liked the taste.  She is an older dog and it takes a lot to get her excited, this did.  As for me, it's messy, and kind of icky when you think about the dog's saliva being put into the bottle every time you roll the ball top.  The top is a roller ball that is very difficult to turn.  You get your fingers sticky with this strong smelling liquid, and it has to be done repeatedly. You can run it along the counter to turn it, also a bad idea. The dog just gets a taste from the ball, then wants to EAT the bottle which, according to the warning label, is a no no.  No eating the roller ball or the bottle!  If they were to get hold of the ball it could choke the dog.  Bad design if you ask me.  OF COURSE the dog is going to want to bite the bottle if it tastes like bacon juice.<br />  I gave her a couple licks and decided to throw the rest away.  Sorry puppy.

review/summary: Two Out of Three Agree!
review/text: I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone. They were definitely confused by it, they weren't sure what to do with it, but once they caught the smell of bacon they couldn't get enough. The third wasn't so keen on it, but I feel like that was more because he was abused before we took him in and he doesn't like something being held in front of his face like you have to do with this treat. I did eventually get him to try some, but after one lick he refused anymore, I will attribute this to his fear rather than any misgivings he might've had about taste as he eats everything.<br /><br />I think this would work better if you have just one dog. When you pass out treats or food, sometimes squabbles can happen, and that definitely happens here when you're focus is on just one dog and the others get jealous. Also, dogs generally do prefer to grab their treat then be able to go, take it somewhere and spend some time with it, maybe hide it for later, can't really do that with this.<br /><br />This is also drippy, so be careful or you could end up with a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I'm not sure how well this would work for training though. I would probably stick with regular treats for that, but if anyone can test that, please comment and let us know if it worked!<br /><br />Edit: I noticed that my dogs try to go after pill bottles now because the bottles kind of looks like the tube (have a similar shape) so if you get this, might want to watch out for that.

review/summary: New fun treat
review/text: My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while. Other treats just do not last long with her including rawhides but with the Lickety Stik she gets approx 500 licks. She goes nuts every time I go to twist the top off of it and doesn't stop licking until I finally say that she's had enough. With any dog treat some dogs may not like it but I think it's worth a try to purchase Lickety Stik for your dog at least one time. I have found one problem with this treat which is the roller ball doesn't roll so well sometimes. It gets to one point where my dog licks it and it stops turning which annoys her and annoys me as well because I have to get my hands all messy trying to fix the roller. This is the only gripe I have with this treat but it is also why I deducted one star from the overall review.

review/summary: I question its value
review/text: My two dogs do love this product.  The dumb one found it confusing for only a few seconds, and then began licking it happily.<br /><br />The product is physically similar to roll-on deodorant.  The plastic ball works well, and will last the duration of the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't last very long in my experience.  Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.  Otherwise, this simply is not the best value compared to many other options.

review/text: I'm not sure exactly what this product is meant to be used for.  I would think it would be great to take on walks for a quick reward.  Just whip it out of your pocket and give your dog a lick.  No where on the product did I see the shelf life or how to store it.  I'm assuming it does not need to be refrigerated.  It looks just like a roll-on deodorant bottle.  It's just liver flavored gravy in a deodorant bottle. It's dispensed when the dog licks the ball.  I got the liver flavor. I don't see this lasting very long.  It's a small bottle.  There is a little "window" at the bottom of the bottle so you can see when it's almost empty.<br /><br />I could see these being used for treats in training.  "Chester" says it's great!

review/summary: great idea, but the roller ball is hard to roll
review/text: I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket.

review/summary: The dog likes it, but not over other treats
review/text: Who would have thought that putting stinky smelling liquid dog snack in a deodorant roller ball container would be a good idea - although I have to admit, it's a pretty good idea!  It took my dog about 2 seconds to figure out how to use this thing...just point it at your dog and let them do the licking.  Our dog liked it enough, but when giving the opportunity to either lick this, or eat a liver Bil*Jac, he went for the item that required chewing (albeit only a little chewing).  It works well enough for a quick treat, although I think that in training, it's better and (and faster) to toss my dog a small training treat instead of having to uncap and let him lick the Lickety Stik.<br /><br />On a side note, this stuff smells *really* bad (aka, your dog will like it).  I can't imagine the stench come out anytime soon, should a dog decide to rip it open on a carpet or if it leaked in a car...

review/summary: My Dogs Love It!
review/text: Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.  Ten licks = 1 calorie.  I wasn't sure what to think about this product at first--great idea or somewhat odd?  My dogs made the decision for me:  they love it!  In fact, when I picked up the bottle to write this review, they both came running.<br /><br />I think Lickety Stik would be especially useful if your dog is on a diet, or when you're training and don't want to give too many high-calorie treats.  This is a winner at our house.

review/summary: Dogs are undecided!
review/text: I didn't know quite what to think about this dog treat & neither did our Bichon, Biscuit, or our golden Retriever, DJ.  It is exactly like a roller ball on a deodorant bottle.  The dogs have to lick and roll the ball to get the flavor or treat.  DJ finally caught on though it took several licks to get the flavor flowing.  Biscuit still hasn't gotten the hang of licking to roll the ball.  Instead of licking the ball he tries to chew it.  He would get very frustrated when he would get a taste of the gravy, but couldn't lick hard enough to turn the ball.  He finally gave up on it & asked for another kind of treat.  DJ loves it but thought only 20 or so licks wasn't enough & also asked for something more substantial.  I guess it would be good as a treat when training a dog to do tricks or potty train.  It would be a nice reinforcement.  I also like giving the dogs a treat to keep them busy for a while, but this treat takes up my time, as I have to hold it.  I will stick to buying biscuits or other type treats.

review/text: Maybe my doggie is just not smart enough for this product?? I'm not sure. It comes packaged like "Tussy" Deodorant from the old days. You roll it around and the flavor is on the ball and as your dog licks it, the flavor keeps returning. Ok, what did MY dog do? Try to take the whole bottle. No way was he going to just "lick" it... he wanted the container. I obviously couldn't give him the whole thing because he would chew it and the liquid would squirt all over. Very strange "treat". If your dog is used to taking treats from you and chewing them up, getting them to just lick might be a trick. Not for Gus.

review/summary: Lickety Stick; the lickable dog treat (just a bit odd)
review/text: My sister tried these out with one of her  dogs.  She says:<br /><br />I gave the stick a try with our small rat terrier mix, Nellie.  At first I couldn't figure out how to open it the bottle.  It looked like you pealed the wrapper off the lid area, but it wasn't coming.  Then I could see the faint perforated line around the base of the cap and you twist to break that, like a salad dressing bottle.  The stick itself is like a deodorant roll-on. Seriously.  The instructions say to shake it up before offering.  This stick was a "chicken flavor".  I offered it to Nellie, who could tell it smelled good and she tried to nibble around the roll-on top not knowing what to do.  I kind of squeezed the bottle and it made the roll-on get flavored.  She then had fun licking it and she seemed to like the stuff.  She's not very picky, so I figured she would.  The smell is not that great.  You can kind of smell it when offering it to the dog.  If you put it up close to you, it is strong, so I just kept it down at dog level.<br /><br />This is a very odd way to give a treat to a dog. But, I don't think Nellie noticed, she was too busy enjoying it.

review/summary: The dogs love them; I'm not quite as thrilled...
review/text: The dogs like the Lickety Stiks, no question about it.  After one brief attempt to just bite it, the 3-year-old settled in to licking, and the the 11-year-old understood the idea from the start (to be fair, they are both experienced with the concept of licking ice cream and the 'lick it!' reminder may have helped).  I am sure if the Stiks were left in reach, they would quickly chew into them and make a mess, so that's something of which to be careful. They did not drip when held upside down, which was pleasing.<br /><br />I am fortunate that neither of our dogs are overweight or have weight concerns; owners with chubby dogs expressed extensive enthusiasm when I asked them about the Stiks.  The younger dog is not a huge treat hound -- he can often 'take it or leave it,' and these proved no different.  I keep hoping to find the motivator that he just can't walk away from.  The Stiks didn't prove to be his Achilles heel but they are in excellent company in that regard -- both dogs clearly found them palatable and enjoyable.<br /><br />My primary use of treats is in training, and my main quibble with the Stiks is that it is hard to use them to lure... you know how you have a treat in your hand and you allow the dog to nose it but not take it while you lure them?  You can't really do that with these.  They also wouldn't be good when set on a target, as a chunk of bait is. Also, the licks of the rollerball take time, while a small, soft chunk of cheese or liver can be gulped down without any noticeable delay in the action.<br /><br />I found all three 'flavors' to be rather unpleasantly smelly -- I think the manufacturer could maybe dial back the scent and still have plenty of appeal to the dogs.  They were also kind of sticky and did leave a smear if one accidentally brushed the roller-ball dispenser across any surfaces while wielding it.  Our newest vehicle has terribly inappropriate light-colored upholstery (what were we thinking?) and the commercials for the Stiks that talk about keeping one in the car made me cringe -- I would not want these anywhere near light-colored textiles!<br /><br />I'm glad to have tried these but I don't know that I will make a point to purchase them in the future, especially at the current price point.

review/summary: Excellent training treat!
review/text: The main thing I love about this product is that its so good for use during training.  It's so much easier to carry on walks than a bag full of chopped hot dogs or dog treats.  Plus licking has been shown to have a calming effect on dogs which could make this product helpful for reactive dogs.  I like that the ingredients are all natural and there are no "iffy" ingredients.  To top it off my picky raw fed dogs love this stuff.  I'm keeping it as a training treat only to keep it special for them.  I would definitely recommend this product and plan on buying lots more!<br /><br />ETA:  I would caution against using this with totally unruly dogs.  If you think your dog would rip it out of your hand and chew it up enough to dislodge the ball I would not use this product as the ball *could* be a choking hazard.  I have pit bulls and they could tear this container apart in 2 seconds flat but they are well trained so I know they wouldn't. I would also caution against leaving it laying around where an unsupervised dog could get at it for the same reason.  But I think the benefits to this product far outweigh the potential dangers as long as your careful about it.

review/summary: A wonderful treat for dogs!
review/text: I recently got PetSafe Lickety Stik for my dog, and she loves it!  The product consists of a bottle filled with a flavored liquid, and whenever Tiny wants some all I have to do do is shake the bottle, remove the cap, and let her lick at the roller until she's satisfied.  There are times when she tries to bite the bottle, but I usually solve that by completely upending it so that she can't get her mouth around it.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a treat for your dog that's low on messiness as well as being something that they'll enjoy, then PetSafe Lickety Stik is a good one.

review/summary: May be best as a leash training aid
review/text: These treats are certainly a new and different idea, but ease of use needs to be improved before they can become something we'd purchase on a regular basis.<br /><br />Certainly, the concept is clever and has potential. The treats are liquid, contained in a tube with a roller ball at the top. The pet licks the ball and gets a measured dose, so to speak. But the problems begin right there.<br /><br />First, the two dogs (one medium, one large) both want to eat the tube rather than lick it, and getting the "lick but don't bite" idea across has proved a challenge. Second, you can give them one treat and then it seems the roller ball has to rotate to dispense the next treat. How do you do this? You can rotate the ball by hand, which is inconvenient and often messy. Or you can squeeze the tube and hope to get the pressure right and not spray the liquid on the ground.<br /><br />We plan on trying this as a leash training aid, a quick reward for proper behavior. The product seems ideal at least in theory for that purpose. Maybe we'll learn to use it better, but right now, it's a little more trouble than it's worth.<br /><br />By the way: We had three flavors. The dogs didn't distinguish among them so unless you have a finicky pet, choice of flavor may not matter.

review/summary: Rocky and Mr. Peabody love it! They said "Woof!"
review/text: The Bacon Flavor Lickety Stik is like crack cocaine for my dog Rocky. If I handed him the product, it would be gone--plastic and all--within 30 seconds. However, you aren't supposed to "give" your dog the Lickety Stick, which works like a roll-on deodorant, the human holds it while the dog licks it. If your dog reacts like Rocky, you'll get a big kick out of it. While the novelty won't wear off for Rocky, I have the distinct impression that I'll get bored with it after a while.<br /><br />On the other paw, Mr. Peabody seemed to enjoy it, but he wasn't as enthusiastic as Rocky. Could it be their difference in age? Mr. P. is six years old and Rocky is one. Rocky also eats everything, including light bulbs, styptic powder, and prescription eyewear, but not with as much vigor as he attacked his Lickety Stik.<br /><br />Our third dog, Charity, sniffed it, looked at me like I had serious issues, and turned away. She's seven. Based on Rocky's & Mr. P.'s enjoyment of the product, I give it five stars; but if Charity was an "only dog," it would get none.

review/summary: Hilariously awesome product!
review/text: I didn't really know what I was getting when I chose to receive this product, but I love getting my dog new things. I thought it was really funny when I opened it- it looked like a roller-style deodorant! But I tilted the product to get the juice by the roller-ball and let my dog lick it. She loved it and caught on very fast!<br /><br />If you're looking for a treat you can give to your dog and then walk away, this isn't the one. You have to hold it so that he/she can lick it; they cannot eat the plastic part. I think it's a great treat for training. It's easy to carry around and "operate" (uncap, tilt, hold in front of dog). I'm using it to teach my dog simple things...she's learning to stay right now, and so I tell her to sit, I walk away, and when I let her come to me, she gets a few licks. It works like a charm!<br /><br />Of course there's the chance that your dog may not like the flavor or might try to chew the bottle instead of licking it. If you're lucky enough to have a dog that likes it/licks it instead of chewing it, it's a great treat to add to the mix! It's something different and new!

review/summary: dogs love it
review/text: The lickety stick is not a lollipop.  It is a roller that looks similar to roll on deodorant or shoe polish.  Inside is the flavored juice.  When the dog's tongue licks the roller, the juice coats it and the dog gets a taste.  I was sent the liver flavor.  One of my dogs loved it.  He was slow at first, but once the roller got coated with the flavored juice, he just went at it.  He even tried biting it. I had a hard time getting it away from him.  My other dog was afraid of it.  I think he thought it was medicine.<br />So this is an interesting way to give a dog a treat. Kind of fun to sit there and watch him lick it like a lollipop.  My only complaint is the smell was gross.  The bacon flavor would probably smell better.

review/summary: Pros and cons...
review/text: Pros: Very low-calorie; dogs love the stuff; good for them--nutritious, all-natural.<br /><br />Cons: Stinky; can be hard to get out; you have to stand there squeezing it the whole time (so giving a normal treat is far more convenient); messy. They inevitably drip all over, so you'd better use them over an easy-to-wipe floor, or outside.<br /><br />The way it usually works for me is:<br />*squeeze...squeeze...squeeze*<br />"Where is it?"<br />*liquid starts pouring out; lands on floor because it always comes out on the opposite side of the roller-ball from the dog*<br />With luck, the dogs don't step in it too much, and I can easily go over the area with a damp cloth after pointing out the spots for them to lick up.<br /><br />It's not as "convenient" as they'd have you believe. You don't just squeeze, let the dog lick the coated ball, and recap it. This is liquid, and it's going to make a mess and require cleanup. (To be fair, regular treats can leave behind crumbs, slimy goo, etc., as well.) You can travel with it, sure, but I would sure as heck NEVER use it inside my car. Your hands can obviously still contact the sticky end and require washing, and I never feel right screwing the cap back on without first rinsing and wiping off the sticky end. If you don't make a habit of doing this, I'm certain that eventually you'll wind up in a dripping, oozing, gooey predicament. This may be cleaner for your hands than pieces of something else that may be sticky, slimy, and/or odiferous, but it's hardly the neatest thing in the world.<br /><br />Also..."no delay in presenting?" Hmm. There's typically more of a delay in waiting for the liquid to start dripping out, with the dog sniffing at it and waiting, than there is in fumbling with a treat bag in your pocket. Either way, they know what's coming to them, but speed is not really an advantage of this product.<br /><br />The very concept should make it excellent for training, especially, because that can run you through your allotted treats very quickly. Dogs really can lick as much of this stuff as they want at any given time...one lick is hardly ever enough, but always appreciated. I normally wind up squeezing every few seconds for about 30-45 seconds, maybe a minute or so. It makes a good diet snack because they get something very flavorful, less filling, and more healthful. However, it's so messy that you'd have to keep it somewhere nearby and out of reach during training, rather than inside your pocket.<br /><br />Of course, they put a positive spin on the necessity of standing there holding and squeezing the tube, saying that the administration of this treat provides a bonding time and reinforces to the dog the source of his/her treats. Well, okay. I can't call that untrue, although it is rather unnecessary for anyone whom has as strong a relationship with his/her dog(s) as I do with mine. And they are all definitely well aware of me as a provider (or slave, in the opinion of the dog with the catlike mindset.) You should see them make firm eye contact, then look back and forth from your face to the treat cabinet or room, pointing you in the desired direction! Don't get me wrong, though; it is usually pleasant to stay close to your pet, giving him/her continuous drops of scrumptious meat-flavored liquid as he/she focuses intently on that ball--instead of simply watching them snatch a traditional treat and devour it wherever they feel like at the moment.<br /><br />A marginal amount of bonding may occur while you hold onto this thing for a couple of minutes and the dog laps at the putrid-smelling goo, obviously mocking you for your deficient senses of smell and taste.<br /><br />I tried out the three-pack of liver, chicken, and bacon for my three dogs as stocking stuffers this past Christmas, and we've still got a little bit of bacon and liver left. They obviously last a decent amount of time. I wouldn't be averse to buying them again if I saw them at a fair price in a store, and was looking for a small-portion, different type of dog treat.<br /><br />I haven't used them yet as a "distraction" or "soothing" technique; I suppose this might work, although you'd clearly need someone else to administer the stick while you did the grooming or whatever you were trying to do. And I wouldn't necessarily expect a dog to keep still just because s/he was licking...not my nutters, anyway. But, it's an idea, at any rate. It might well be a good anxiety-reducing distraction. They do get pretty excited over it, so depending upon the situation, it just might have that power.<br /><br />Edit: I'm sorry, but I had to lower the rating to two stars. You're far better off dripping the tasty, low-calorie liquid onto a hard surface and letting the dog lick it up. It should be sold as a kibble gravy or something to pour into a tiny bowl, rather than as a "Lickety Stick."<br />These things really do just splatter all over the floor/ground whilst taller dogs lick SOME liquid from the ball, and shorter ones risk being hit with falling droplets. It's a good idea, but perhaps the substance needs to be thicker, or it needs to pour out neatly into a little tray, or something. Some dogs are better at catching it all before it falls, but height differences make it tricky to try and let two of them share one, if they're both willing. You can do one in each hand, sure, but of course that doubles the mess. The secret, really, is to squeeze slowly and gently, watch for where it starts to emerge, and rotate the ball so that the dog can lick it before it slides around the ball and falls.<br /><br />I somewhat doubt my likelihood to recommend or re-purchase Lickety Stiks, unless they come out with a particularly interesting new flavor, or improve the stuff itself. Furthermore, my dogs have actually begun shrinking away and ignoring them, obviously mistaking the sticks for their tubes of tooth-cleaning gel and spray--not the product's fault, naturally, but still a newly noted disadvantage worth mentioning.

review/text: This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container, she thought I was trying to tease her with it.  Finally I started rolling it on the dry milk bone type treats that she's not crazy about to get her to eat them.  If they called it "Dog Bone Icing" it might sell better  and make more sense.

review/summary: Mostly a product without a purpose
review/text: This might be handy for someone who wants a convenient, pocket-able, quick treat in a training situation, but otherwise I fail to see the point of this product.  Although it's low in calories, it's easier and cheaper just to use a few of the dog's kibbles for treats, subtracting them from the dinner allotment if calorie count is an issue.  If your pet doesn't eat kibble but you still want to give treats, I don't think this offers anything that any other tiny treat doesn't offer.  It's actually less convenient to hold the Lickety Stik for your dog to lick than it is to just toss a treat.<br /><br />Also, the first ingredient listed (this is the Savory Chicken flavor) is "natural chicken flavor."  Do a little reading and you'll quickly realize this doesn't necessarily mean an actual chicken was involved anywhere in this product.  Aside from that there is cultured lecithin (I have no idea what the "cultured" modifier means in this context), vitamins E and C, rosemary extract, and green tea extract.  None of this sounds harmful, but none of it sounds particularly nutritionally helpful, either.<br /><br />As far as dogs' opinions, we had an even split at my house.  Both dogs thought it smelled good and eagerly licked it initially.  One dog has not only refused it since that first taste, but actually pulls back from it when it's offered (and this is a dog that eats anything -- animal, vegetable, mineral, paper towel, cardboard...).  The other is happy to lick from it until I take it away.  I'll probably let her continue to use it until it's gone, but I don't see myself adding more of it to my pet-treat cupboard.

review/summary: Phew! We called it "Icky Stik" or "Stinky Stik"
review/text: As much as our dogs enjoyed Lickety Stik, the cloying stench of "savory chicken" repulsed the rest of the family. The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it "Icky Stik" or "Stinky Stik" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of "Braised Liver" or "Smoky Bacon"? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.<br /><br />The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients. Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.<br /><br />In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.<br /><br />Rating: One star.

review/summary: That's what she said
review/text: This product is really dumb and pointless. My dog was simply not interested, and I was not interested in holding it in my hand while she licked it. When I ordered it, I thought I was getting something you could just give the dog, and she would entertain herself for a long time, by licking. It sounded like a good idea because my dog really likes to lick things. I give her something lick-able when I want her to go lay down and be quiet. This product is useless for that purpose. This is an interactive treat. You and your dog both have to interact with it. It gets old, pretty much immediately.<br /><br />The product itself is gross. It's sticky and unappealing. The smell is nauseating. My dog would take a sniff, and sometimes a trial lick, and then just walk away. I'd be left standing there holding a phallic shaped bottle of mysterious smelly goo.<br /><br />Here are some things my dog likes better than Lickety Stiks: dirty diapers, dead pigeons, week-old garbage, and other dog's butts.<br /><br />The only people who really enjoyed the product are the teenagers in my house, who think "Lickety Stik" is possibly the most hilarious product name they ever heard. The jokes lasted most of the afternoon. The packaging offers plenty of crude suggestions ("give a lick" tm  they trademarked that??), as if my kids needed any encouragement. Even the shape of the bottle - a rigid cylinder with a ball on top - was fodder for hilarity. They thought it was just so funny.<br /><br />So this is a stupid product with a funny name and a suggestive shape, which solves no problems, has no appeal beyond comedy, and is completely worthless.

review/summary: Pointless dog treat
review/text: Are we seriously supposed to stand there for hours and hold this bottle up in the air while the dog licks it? This is the new wave of dog "treats"??<br /><br />To be honest, when I ordered this, I kind of missed the whole "Likety Stik" wording on the bottle. I mean I definitely saw the "Likety" wording, but didn't pay any attention to the "Stik" part. I saw that it was bacon flavored, so I assumed it was a bacon flavored substance almost like a gravy to pour over your dog's food, especially by the shape of the bottle.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was like what the heck is this?? At first glance you would almost assume it is roll-on deodorant, but then you see the picture of the dog in the middle of the bottle, so you know it can't be.<br /><br />But I did try giving this to all 3 of my dogs. None of them knew what to do with it and seemed aggrevated when they licked the ball and nothing would come out. I then figured out I had to squeeze the bottle to make the contents drip out. When I did that, they stopped licking, looked at the ball, took one whiff and turned their noses up in the air as if to say "ewwww get this thing outta my face right now"!!<br /><br />I find that dogs (mine anyway) like to chew, so they kinda don't know what to do with this odd invention. They aren't rabbits who drink water from a water bottle. This reminded me of something like that. This is for an animal who is used to licking from a rolling ball. You can't exactly give it to a dog, then let them go off on their own with it like a normal treat or a bone, because rather than licking the ball, they would want to investigate what it's made of and would chew it to bits until the contents fell out. In my opinion, not a very good idea and could potentially be very dangerous. I really don't see the point in this item at all, unless of course you are a rabbit.

review/summary: It's soooo weird!  Doesn't dispense well.
review/text: Okay, first of all, be sure you note the design.  This liquid treat comes in a liquid-deodorant-type container. The idea seems to be that you just have the dog lick it directly off the roller ball.  This plan happens to be a poor plan.  The roller ball doesn't roll freely.  So, I wind up sticking my fingers on the ball to help it roll--thereby getting nasty liver smells on my hands. I do have the liver flavor only; I *thought* Vine was sending one of each flavor, but we just got liver, so my dog has only "taste tested" this one flavor.  She approved heartily of the taste.  Scored big wags.  These are low cal, but unless your dog is on a particularly restricted diet, she/he should be able to spare a few calories a day for treats (there are several 2-10 calorie per treat options out there, like Zukes and Mother Hubbard Minis.  Good old fashioned green beans make good, all natural, dog treats, too).  If it dispensed more easily, I would have given this  four stars instead of only two.  But the combination of it's oddity and having to finagle the roller ball with each use lost it at least one star.  Personally, I rate it two stars; my dog however gave it five (she basically likes food in general, though, and she's never met a treat she didn't like).

review/text: I decided to try this "treat" with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.<br /><br />I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.<br /><br />She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.<br /><br />I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.

review/summary: what a strange idea
review/text: Well when I ordered this product for my dogs I had high hopes that this would be something that they might like.  The concept is that the product looks like a deodorant roll on...if you remember those.  You take the top off, and then there is a roll over which the gravy-like product is dispensed.  The gravy is thick and difficult to get to start dispensing.  Once it does start coming out of the sides of the roller ball, the process of it coming out is inconsistent.  Sometimes it comes out slowly,  then sometimes you have to shake the bottle a  good bit to encourage the gravy to come out around the roll.  This usually means that you are having to futz around with this dog treat much more than you would like to have to.  The dogs also got a little discouraged with the process as well.  They would actually walk off and give up on me with a frustrated look on their face as if to say that this was hardly worth it.

review/summary: Interesting product, but I'm not quite sure what to do with it
review/text: I am only reviewing the bacon flavor (was supposed to get 3 different flavors, but only got one).<br /><br />The good news is that my dog went crazy over this.  He absolutely loved it!  I have literally never seen him get this excited about a treat.  Unfortunately, that is also the bad news.  Because he loved it so much, and because he got so excited, it was a pointless exercise trying to get him to just lick the top.  He would take a lick or two, then he would start hopping and jumping, and trying to grab the entire bottle out of my hand.<br /><br />I have 11 and 10 year old daughters, and they normally love giving the dog a treat.  They won't give him this anymore, because it gets the dog hyper excited, and he starts jumping on them trying to get the treat out of their hands.<br /><br />So......whatever the ingredient inside the bottle is, my dog loves it, and I suppose yours will too.  The only question is the delivery system.  Maybe its not the best idea to have a treat that is meant to be held like this one is.  It assumes that your dog will sit quietly while you hold the bottle and he licks the top. No way that will ever happen with my dog.  He looks at it as he does any treat....he thinks it is meant to be taken and eaten.<br /><br />I debated on giving the product a 3 (because I don't think I will ever buy it for the reasons noted above) or a 4 (because my dog loves the flavor).  Ultimately I gave it a 4.  If my dog loves it, how could I give it a 3.<br /><br />**Update 10-5-11**Despite the fact that my dog loves the taste of this thing, I took it down to a 3 star rating.  Nothing really has changed, except for the fact that I am finding this to be more of a pain than I originally thought.  It was a novelty at first, but now I am weary of fighting the dog over this thing and trying to keep him from biting and chewing it (and creating a choking hazard or a mess).  Can't recommend it.<br /><br />**Update 10-9-11**I feel foolish writing another update on this product, but this is my last one.  My dog has gotten the hang of using this product, and now does a pretty good job of licking versusing chewing.  Also, this is one of his favorite treats. I am surprised, because my dog loves to chew, so I would have thought that a licking treat wouldn't hold much interest for him.  I am now thinking I would buy this product again ***but*** not at an $8 price point.  Way too expensive, relative to what you get.  The package says you get 500 licks.  In about 30 seconds, my dog get in 10-15 licks.  He does this twice a day, so this thing is not going to last 3 weeks at my house.  For me to buy this, it would have to be in the $2-3  price range.  I have to imagine that if they can sell deoderant in this price range (and this thing is identical to roller ball deoderant), then they can sell liquid dog treats in this price range.

What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled "Savory Chicken Flavor". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it "Savory" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me.

review/text: I would have preferred to directly inform the company that makes this product vs. writing a review on Amazon but I couldn't find a way to do that.<br /><br />First I would like to thank the makers of Lickety Stik for donating these things to a Canine Cancer walk I participated in this weekend.<br /><br />I have 2 dogs, as it seemed, one dog liked it and the other did not.<br /><br />I screwed the cap back on and put it on the counter while I took a shower and when I came out I found the Lickety Stik butsted open on my couch and leaking all over the place.  The plastic roller ball was no where to be found, when my dog seemed ill I became concerned that she ate it but I found it later, thankfully.<br /><br />I would not buy this product as my dogs are not usually mischievous or eat things that are not edible but this instance was too close for comfort.  I feel the construction of the container is weak.

review/summary: What?
review/text: This was not at all what I expected. It was like the old-school roll-on deoderant from the 1970's. Only instead of fresh-scented anti-persperant, it was drippy, smelly, bacon-flavored dog juice.<br /><br />So I guess you're supposed to stoop down and hold the roll-on bottle in front of the dog while it licks the roller ball to get the dog juice on its tongue. You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it. Like a dog would do.<br /><br />Try again. Fail.

review/summary: 1 out of 2 dogs liked it!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:42 Mins<br /><br /></span>Since neither of my 2 dogs can write about this new Lickety Stik, I will do my best.<br />A new idea for treats is always welcomed.  We had 3 flavors of Stiks, Bacon, Chicken and Liver.  We tried all three on both Sundae and Casey.  Sundae licked all three and seemed to like them all. Casey, however, wouldn't try any of the three, just turning his head in apparent disgust (lol).  Having had dogs my whole life, you never can tell what a dog will like or dislike.  I didn't give this 5 stars, because of some functional reasons, not because Casey didn't even try it.  First, the lick ball is exactly like a deodorant ball. As a matter of fact, the container reminds me of an Arrid Rollerball Deodorant bottle exactly.  It doesn't move freely by just licking, you have to gently squeeze the bottle for the liquid to be available to the dog.  If you squeeze too hard, it drips onto the floor. Other than that, it seems to be enjoyable.  It is supposed to be healthy, but I had to use a magnifying glass to read the rather small label.<br /><br />The video is one of our taste tests. Hope you enjoy it.

review/summary: Great training aid or as a reward.
review/text: - UPDATE - 10/28/2011<br />It's been several weeks of using it and there is still a ton of licking left, definitely getting my moneys worth out of this treat.<br />Another thing that has been nice is the ability to keep this in my pocket without making a mess. So going for a walk with it has been nice (and a great way to keep his attention when there are other not well behaved dogs around).<br />- UPDATE -<br /><br />Well the puppy dog has spoken... he loves Lickety Stik!<br /><br />When we first presented it to him he was a bit unsure and tried to bite the stick which was kind of cute but he quickly realized he had to lick it.<br />Now every time the Lickety Stik comes out as a reward or to teach him something, he just can't wait to lick the bejesus out of it.<br /><br />Not only does the dog love it and responds really well to it, it's made in the USA!<br /><br />This is a very unique, clean, easy to use, easy to carry, and fun treat for your dog. I would highly recommend this to most anyone. Way to go PetSafe!

review/summary: Best tool for puppy training!
review/text: We have a new puppy, and are attempting to train her using a rewards-based system. This works well, except that we don't feel comfortable giving her treat after treat after treat. Then, along came the Lickety Stik, and it solved our problem! Our puppy LOVES this, and it's become an invaluable training tool. We have bought several in different flavors and keep them in different rooms around the house. When our puppy is doing something she shouldn't be doing, we give her the appropriate command ("Off," "Wrong," "Leave It" etc.). If she does what she's asked, we say "Good Girl!" grab the Lickety Stik, and she gets a couple of licks. This has worked amazingly well, and we're not stuffing the puppy with treats. There are some times when we feel she'll continue the bad behavior just to get a Lickety Stik, but that's the same with any treat. To solve this, once we know she understands the command, if she continues to do the behavior, she doesn't get the treat. She soon realizes that to get the Lickety Stik, she has to not do the behavior at all.<br /><br />Of course, your dog may be different, but this has been our experience.<br /><br />Also, my daughter is working at a local pet store as a grooming assistant, and she tells me that they have started using the Lickety Stik there to help calm their dogs and curb bad behavior while they're being groomed. I felt that was a pretty good endorsement right there.

review/summary: I love it
review/text: I am a veterinarian with 7 years experience, and I have 3 Great Danes.  I am always looking for safe, effective, fun, and innovative new pet products.  I saw the video for this product, and definitely agree that carrying a pocketful of crumbling treats isn't much fun for training/rewards, so decided to give it a try.  All 3 of my girls tried to bite the bottle at first (and I think most dogs will), but within a few seconds, all of them figured it out, and were licking away very happily, each taking their turn sitting down for me.  I also recently used it to help keep them standing still while my 8 year old daughter gave them baths outside with the hose on a nice warm day....much less mess than doing it in the tub inside!  It was also handy when we went for a short hike at a local park a while back, as I am training the 2 younger Danes to wear backpacks (that's a whole other story!).  Even if the dogs jump in the river wearing their backpacks and get them soaked, their treats won't get soggy.  The only thing I would like to see is using a liquid treat that's maybe a bit healthier for them...the ingredient list on the Lickety Stik looks like a lot of processed stuff.  It does have a bit of an odor, too, but I didn't find it that strong or offensive like some of the other people here did.  And I think it's the odor that really draws the dogs to come check it out...otherwise, why would they want to just lick a plastic roller ball?<br />Also, I think it would be nice to have a bottle that is just a little bit larger for the large/giant breeds like mine...but this does work well regardless.  Finally, I think it would be great to have a refillable bottle, so there would be less waste...500 licks goes fast when you're training 3 big dogs!<br />Oh, and yes, I will re-order this, and do recommend it.

review/summary: Lickety good fun
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>*disclaimer* I was sent this item to review.<br />Izzy, our mini schnauzer, is very food motivated. Schnauzers have a tendency to get chunky though, so rewarding her with food every time she does a trick is a balancing act between giving her something she likes but not having her snack with treats all day.<br /><br />At 1 calorie per 10 licks, along with a fun interactive way to give her the treat, the lickety safe is fun and healthy. She had no trouble at all figuring out how to lick the deodorant like ball. This would also be a nice travel treat in the car because it closes up and you don't need to get treat on your fingers to give it to the dog.

review/summary: Awesome treat!
review/text: What I really like about this treat is that it is something you hold while your dog licks it--rather than him taking his chewy someplace and getting busy with it, he ends up looking at me, holding my gaze for as long as I'll let him keep lickin' that rollerball. Awesome for my friend's dog who's old and can't chew. (This is the liver flavor--which smells awesome. The bacon did not ship, but my pup doesn't mind.)

review/summary: Puppy Loves it!
review/text: I thought this looked interesting a liquid dog treat what? So I purchased it, I have two small dogs a seven year old Yorkie and a seven month old puppy Bichon Frise/ Toy Poodle mix. Well I showed it to the puppy I got the liver flavor it does smell bad and let him sniff it he went wild and starting jumping towards my hand trying to get it and barking like crazy I told him sit and paw and he did  and I give him a lick he loved it. Now my Yorkie sniffed it and walked away but she is extremely picky about her treats so it did not surprise me at all. I love how this is small can fit in a jacket and is about the length of your hand opened, this is low in calories 1 calorie in 10 licks and the bottle has 500 licks! this is great I clicker train my puppy and he knows a bunch of tricks but I always felt Like I was filling him up with a ton of treats and then would have to feed him less dinner and I felt bad. But with this I no longer have to worry now it can be messy if your not careful don't squeeze too hard, I will definitely be getting more of this and trying it in different flavors for my Pup Mozart. This is also great for teaching small dogs to heel to stay by your left side and it is great to use outside when the puppy gets distracted by people or other dogs kids etc I can refocus his attention on me and get him to calm down.

review/summary: VERY stinky but my dogs LOVED it
review/text: This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in bacon and beef flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains.

review/summary: Didn't work so well for me
review/text: I think this product might work well in some situations.  For me, my dog was very small when I got it, and right after receiving it, he needed to be trained without treats.  Then, when he was 9 months old, about 4 months after receiving the product, I decided to try it again, as he was at that age where he knows he should come when called, but is a bit defiant about it.  By then, the stuff in the bottle had gotten a bit thick, and the roller didn't work too well.  I used it a little anyway, just forcing the ball to roll with my finger, but I then left it in my coat pocket, and when I wasn't paying attention, Archie bit into the pocket and crushed the bottle and it oozed out inside my pocket - arghh!  Not the product's fault, obviously.  It could definitely work, but I think I will just stick with the old standard kibbles in a plastic bag for now anyway.

review/summary: Might Be Good For Smaller Dogs - Not My 3 Large Ones.
review/text: I have 3 larger dogs - labs and golden retrievers, and I wanted to try this out with them, but it turned out to be basically useless.  None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.  Another of my dogs got so frustrated with it that she refuses to even lick it if I bring the bottle out.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, and exactly what it said it was, but, unfortunately, it was a failure at my house.  I can see where it might be useful for smaller dogs or puppies, but definitely not for my dogs.

review/text: My dogs love the Lickety Stik! I got the bacon flavor, is there anything better than bacon? I use it to distract Joe when his nails are trimmed, he hates having his nails trimmed. Once I figured out that I need to squeeze it gently because the ball doesn't turn it worked fine. I hold it up and Joe licks it like a lamb with a bottle!

review/summary: Dogs like it more than I like giving it to them.
review/text: My dogs love this.  But it's undeniably odd.  Basically, it's packaged like those old roller bottles of deodorant.  You hold the it in front of your dog's face and they lick the rollerball.<br /><br />One of my dogs wanted nothing to do with it, but my puppy (who'll lick anything) dove right in.  That lured the wary dog into trying it.  Now they both love it.<br /><br />Frankly, though, I suspect they'd prefer food.  And I certainly like tossing treats to my dogs for them to catch instead of standing there like a servant holding what looks like a bottle of deodorant as they lick it.<br /><br />Might be good for dogs on a diet, though. You can treat them with a bit of flavor without so many calories.

review/text: Both of the dogs love this Lickety Stik. It took one of them a bit longer to figure out the "roller ball", but once done, they both love it. I especially like the personal interaction I can have at treat time. My main use has been to use it after giving medicine. It works great and now my girl looks forward to receiving a few tasty licks (her spoonful of sugar!) after taking her medicine. Great, innovative product, at a good price.

review/summary: Dispenser doesn't work well...
review/text: This is a clever idea. Give your dog a treat by offering a lick or two of a bacon flavored liquid he or she will like. Take the cap off the bottle and there is a large ball similar to a roll-on deodorant ball - offer it to your dog and he'll lap it up. This appears to be an actual roll-on deodorant container that has been repurposed for this product. The problem is that the ball doesn't rotate freely. Our dog can't make the ball turn with his tongue. When I roll it with my thumb so he can get more, I have to go wash my hands as the liquid is brown and sticky. So - a mediocre rating because the product IDEA is good, but the container doesn't work well.
