review/summary: Great  Natrual cat Treat without preservatives
review/text: Cats can be picky. I have a purebred Ragdoll that I sometimes wonder about, because he is SO picky. He will not eat canned food, Bonita flakes, raw food, and does not like catnip. I have tried several cat treats, and I had given up, until I tried the Kitty Kissers Anchovy treats. He loves them! Who knew? I like them because they are natural treat (dried anchovies) without preservatives. I want my cats to live long healthy lives, so I feed them natural, unprocessed foods, as much as possible. I think this is a good product for any cat and I would recommend it.

review/summary: Not What I Expected
review/text: Expected dried silvery little fish (1 to 2 inch) that I've found before and that both cats liked.  These are yellowed pieces that appear to be explosively vacuum dried.  Texture is different. One cat eats them but the other won't touch them.

review/summary: Best Chai Tea on the market
review/text: I have tried every Chai Tea mix on the market, and NONE compare to this tea.  I hope anyone who loves Chai Tea will give this mix a chance.  I find it better than the actual chai teas in coffee houses.  I understand Tahitian Vanilla is used in this product.  It's fabulous!  The only thing I miss is the lovely packaging they used to have.  I bought the tea for the first time because of the lovely package, but now I buy it for the tea, but it is not an attractive package.  I'm already hooked on the product but I so badly want the gorgeous packaging back, too!  I wish I could insert a picture of the lovely package.

review/summary: Excellent choice
review/text: There are many brands of soy sauce and many flavors. Different people like different kinds, just like soft drinks or coffee. But, this is one of our favorites and much easier to find than the others that we especially like. If you have dietary issues, read the ingredients as there is a huge difference in how different brands are made. I suggest that fewer ingredients = better. An Oriental Supermarket will have dozens or hundreds of brands, so experiment, but we really like this one a LOT. I'd say to carefully record the exact info and SKU of any that you find that you like as some kinds have several confusingly similar labels that contain very different soy sauce.

review/summary: Tastes Like Eating Chemicals
review/text: I eat the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal every day, and unbeknownst to me, my wife started giving me the "Lower Sugar" version. On the first day, I just thought my taste buds were off and ignored it, but after a few days I started to wonder what happened to the oatmeal that I used to so enjoy. To me, it now tasted like chemicals.<br /><br />I went to look at the box to see that it said, "Lower Sugar". Now I had found a clue, but I couldn't really blame my wife because I don't really need the oatmeal to be super sweet. I'm fine with less sugar, although that wasn't my issue. It tasted like chemicals.<br /><br />Upon ingredient inspection, I found that this "Lower Sugar" version contains the artificial sweetener "Sucralose" which I am really sensitive to. I know some people can't really taste the difference between Sucralose and sugar. I wish I was one of them.<br /><br />I also wish that Quaker would have mentioned the artificial sweetener clearly on the front of the box.<br /><br />Be warned. It's not just lower in sugar, which I would have been fine with. We had to throw away 2 boxes.

We usually buy a couple boxes of these to last us for a 4 to 6 weeks and they never see the inside of a fridge and are always fine. The only downside is that they're the standard small size creamer, so most people use 2 or 3. It'd be nice if there was a larger size available, but no one seems to be making that.

I don't refrigerate them though - they are stored in my office at room temperature - but I shouldn't have to since they don't require refrigeration.

review/summary: Great sugar
review/text: I have been using this sugar for about five years.  I used to buy it from my local Latin market.  Two years ago, I moved about 200 hundred miles away.  I was unable to find this sugar anywhere, not to mention that I could not even find a Latin market.  I would always visit that Latin market whenever I traveled to my home town.  I would buy pounds and pounds of it.  Imagine my joy when I found this sugar on Amazon, and at such a good price.  I no longer have to ration out sugar.  The item arrived with the five bags in one large sealed bag.  Each bag was intact which was surprising because in the market, sometimes there would be a hole in at least one bag that I bought.  The sugar itself has a molasses, mellow taste that somehow taste sweeter than white sugar.  I find I don't have to use as much for the same effect.  It's wonderful in baked goods and I love it in my teas.  I'm a happy camper especially since it comes right to my front door.

review/summary: NOT TRUE CINNAMON, THIS IS CASSIA
review/text: I am shocked that AMAZON would directly sell a misrepresented product. The picture on the bag is canela en rama (as it is known in Mexico) and true ceylon cinnamon (as it is known in Sri Lanka). What is in the bag however is cassia, the fake cinnamon the FDA has approved for use in the US. I am so disappointed. If you use the cinnamon found at your local grocery store, this is a great deal. But if you know the difference, then you know that the two are NOT interchangeable and THIS WILL NEVER DO! Cassia is hot, harsh and intense while canela/ceylon is rich in flavor but mild and sweet.<br /><br />Ceylon resembles a cigar from the side, many layers and is light brown in color. You can eat straight from the bag. Cassia comes as flatish squares or is a single layer rolled into what resembles binoculars from the side.<br /><br />If you want true mexican/ceylon, use this link or cut and paste into your browser. Amazon now offers the good stuff with Super Saver shipping. I'm glad they made right by my bad experience.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAU1F0?ie=UTF8&force-full-site=1

review/summary: Great for Gluten Free
review/text: This is a great product for making gluten free bread.  I use it with the Gluten Free Pantry Sandwich bread mix and it makes a big difference.  The bread rises more and the texture is really improved.  Also, this company is great to work with and very, very helpful. I am ordering more.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: I have been using this for the past 6 months or more in my Kamut and spelt breads.  I forgot to throw it in the other day and wondered what was wrong with my bread....the texture was a little less moist and the volume was almost a whole loaf less.  I realized this stuff must be doing something good so I'm ordering more again!  I think it improves the moistness, texture, and overall quality of breads low in wheat gluten such as spelt and kamut.

review/text: I don't know how or why it should, but it works. I tested it to see if there was a difference between using it or not. What a difference, the loaves were like night and day. One with the enhancer was uniform in it's bubbles and stood proudly while the loaf without the enhancer was a good deal shorter and had some large holes in the bread. I'll order some more tonight, I'm not going to do without this stuff. It's great

review/summary: Good for Gluten Free bread
review/text: Making gluten-free bread is much less forgiving than regular bread and you will often end up with a sunken or thick loaf instead of a nice, airy one.  Some sort of dough enhancer will help give you better results.  Many dough enhancer products on the market are not "vegan" (for those who want to avoid animal products) but the one by Authentic Foods is (they also carry an excellent garfavabean flour that is not bitter like some are).  However, you can also get as good, or slightly better, results using apple cider vinegar in place of the dough enhancer - substitute same measurements (for example, 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar for 1 tsp dough enhancer).  Still, this is a good product and I recommend it - especially for those who want to avoid using vinegars.

review/summary: Works as expected
review/text: I have been nursing my daughter for all of her 7 months so far, and have never really had any supply or production issues. At the urging of my doctor, I began taking these fenugreek pills in order to maintain my milk supply when I went back to work about 3 months ago. I haven't noticed any difference in pumped amount, but before I went back to work I never really pumped so I can't be positive that there was or wasn't a difference. I will continue taking these pills for as long as my daughter nurses, as they are easy to swallow, smell delicious (maple syrup, yum!), and I don't see any harm in continuing. All in all, as I was very worried about my supply dropping when I returned to work, this is like peace of mind in a pill form for me :-)

review/summary: Upped my breastmilk supply - happy baby!
review/text: I have had a low breastmilk supply from the very beginning and have tried just about everything to increase it. At the recommendation of a lactation consultant I started taking 4 capsules 3 times a day. Within 48 hours I saw an ounce increase with each pump (which was huge for me). It has continued to improve and I have been taking fenugreek for about 5 weeks.<br /><br />The downsides: when I first started taking it it made my stomach a bit upset, but after about a week it was fine and everything was back to normal. You will start to smell like maple syrup, I can think of worse things to smell like!<br /><br />Overall I really feel like this is helping my supply. I will continue to take it until I am no longer breastfeeding.

review/summary: Nursing mom
review/text: I am a nursing mom who relies on fenugreek to keep my milk production up. I first started taking the Natures Way fenugreek and had tremendous luck. My milk levels started to drop a bit so I decided to switch up the brand. So glad I did! This stuff did help kick my production back up and I am very happy. I take 4 pills 3 times per day which was the same for the Natures Way. I don't notice the maple syrup smells like others have commented on but I do know this stuff works. The color of the herb inside the capsule is also a little different vs. the Nature Way so I know there is a slight difference...although, not exactly sure what it is. I am here to purchase another 3 bottles...

review/summary: Great quality
review/text: I've used Fenugreek in the past to increase milk production when I was breast feeding. While I'm currently not breastfeeding, I decided to start taking it again. The reason - it makes your body odors smell like maple syrup! As weird as this may seem, I just wanted to be able to sweat and not smell like onions, and this did the job after taking it for one day. No side effects, other than it does seem to make your bust fuller, not drastically, hardly noticeable, but I can tell a slight difference. I gave it 5 stars since this particular brand seems to be pretty potent compared to what I used to take. I noticed the maple syrup smell after a few days with the old stuff, this worked after one day, and doesn't have a weird smell to it, making it easy for me to swallow.

review/summary: Wonderfully rich and decadent chocolates -- Very High Quality
review/text: The Godiva kiosk closed in our local mall.  I was very disappointed, because my family expects a selection of Godiva chocolates for Christmas, Easter and birthdays.  However, they have their favorites, and unfortunately when ordering Godiva off-line, you have no choice but to purchase assortments over which the consumer has no input.  They are selected and pre-packaged for you.  So I was looking for other candy companies which might sell chocolates which approximated my family's favorite items, without having to buy extra candies they might not like.  Enter this wonderful collection by Leonidas of Hazelnut and Almond praline-filled milk chocolate confections.<br /><br />These are fantastically excellent chocolates -- just as good as, or better, than the Godiva signature oysters which my family loves. They arrived protected in styrofoam by overnight shipping. I will definitely be dealing with this seller again. I am very impressed and pleased by the chocolate and the high quality of the product.  And the taste?  Just heavenly.

review/text: These chocolates are such a great find! I was looking for a special type of hazelnut chocolate called gianduja. I searched for it and found this perfect selection! It is the smoothest, creamiest hazelnut chocolate I have found. A little on the pricey side but TOTALLY WORTH IT! People I know who aren't that crazy about chocolate or hazelnut chocolate specifically have LOVED it and wanted more! I bought some during the Christmas season and shared it (out of holiday spirit) but kind of wish I had saved more for myself!

review/text: I love this product! It makes the most delicious dairy-free ice cream, and it's soy-free which is a nice bonus. It yields a creamy and smooth ice cream that needs no extra sweetener to please my taste buds. All I need to do is add is a teaspoon or a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract to a whole carton of MimicCreme, throw it in the ice cream maker and about 20 minutes later it's done. My ice cream maker: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGRT">Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, White</a>.<br /><br />The ice cream does get very hard in the freezer. I have yet to try adding a little splash of vodka to a batch of ice cream after it's done churning but before transferring it to the freezer. I hear it can keep ice cream from freezing too hard. For now all I have to do is take the ice cream out of the freezer for a few minutes before serving to let if soften a bit. Five stars for this one - I wish I could give it ten! (I'm uploading a few pictures of some MimicCreme based ice cream)

Texture, taste, color, and freshness are just perfect.

I totally agree with the other reviewer; I dare you to be able to stop eating it right from the jar till its all gone!...  It's really that good.

review/summary: Garlic Salt Never Tasted So Good!
review/text: I've been using RealSalt all natural sea salt for a number of years and only recently learned there also was a RealSalt garlic salt.  What a treat!  The all natural sea salt combined with organic garlic is a superb blend of distinctive tastes -- strong yet not overpowering.  Substitute RealSalt garlic salt for your regular brand and you'll never go back.

review/summary: Equal that isn't so sweet
review/text: We've been buying Equal in bulk for years because both of us drink a lot of tea and coffee that require sweetener. We were away from home for six months this year, and when we got back, I went ahead and ordered this bulk box to restock our supply.  But as soon as we started using the Equal from the box, we both noticed a problem: it didn't taste very sweet.  What would normally have taken two packets to taste sweet suddenly required four packets, and even then, it tasted odd.<br /><br />There have been a lot of news stories about fake products being sold online, so I worried that this was not real Equal and went online to do a lot of research.  I noticed that Equal recently changed their brand packeting and had a look at the packets inside the bulk box.  The packets we had gotten had a strawberry on the cover, while more recent Equal packets just have a stripe.  Then I noticed that the packets were all quite old, with manufacturing dates from 2008 & 2007.  While Equal says on their website that their product lasts forever, they ALSO say that they recommend discontinuing sale of the product after three years.  I suspect they know that Equal begins to lose its flavor over time, which would explain why the sugar we got in this box, all of which is from 4-5 years ago, tastes much weaker than it should.  After learning all this information, we decided to throw out the whole box of weak sweetener and buy an Equal box that had the more recent branding on it (striping).  That Equal tasted right, so we're going with that from now on, and no longer buying ANY Equal packages that have the old strawberry logo on them.<br /><br />This bulk box, in our opinion, is full of sweetener that is past its date and therefore not worth buying.

review/text: This bulk box seems to be defective. I know my Equal, and this stuff just doesn't measure up! I did a side by side comparsion with some I had already (purchased from Walmart recently). The Bulk box Equal wasn't as white and it just didn't sweeten.<br />I suspected it was old, but the outside of the bulk box said it doesn't expire until 2014. If its not too old, it's possible  these packets had a hard life. They could have been exposed to too much heat. Aspartame looses its sweetness with heat.

review/text: When I ordered this product I expected a small root cutting in a makeshift shredded newspaper support packaging. Thankfully this was not true, Hirt's had an amazing treatment in plant care. My prayer plant was properly wrapped to prevent leaf damage and then filled with packing peanuts with a heat pack for shipping in winter. It was well established and actually overgrowing in it's 4" pot (could be divided into two plants)! I received my plant within a week of placing my order, which is twice to three times as fast as other plant growers. Also to this day my plant is thriving without shipping shock or any other ill effects. I will definitely order any type of house plants from Hirt's again.

It requires very little water and sits in a somewhat sunny location, but not direct sun.

Whether you spread it on bread for a sandwich, or use it in a fine recipe, or use in canape recipes, this product is worth every penny you pay for it!

It was a little hard for me to find a place to buy it there for a while...but once I did, I'm back to buying it regularly! It's a very high quality product, made by a company you can trust, and I wholly recommend it to anyone looking for a very good chicken spread!

review/summary: Lucky when they cross your path....
review/text: These are great. I've been on a hunt for good strong licorice since a brand that I used to get stopped distribution (and I can't even find it on the web, so perhaps the company went under.) These are that, and fill the void that the common USA licorice products just don't touch. Obviously no good if you don't like black licorice. Possibly not good (and you should find the smaller amount of 12 individual packages under a different brand name, which do seem to be the same thing, if you just want to try it) if you are quite happy with black gumdrops, jellybeans and molasses-choked strips, strings chews and laces.<br /><br />They are firm, and they are not salted (both fine with me, just to classify them in the realm of licorice.) They taste of licorice, not molasses.<br /><br />I have them on auto-order.
