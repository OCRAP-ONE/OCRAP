review/summary: My favorite gluten-free rice!
review/text: mrs leeper's rice vegetable twists are my favorite gluten-free pasta.  Their shape holds up well and they hold pesto sauce or alfredo sauce well because of all the twists giving it more surface area to coat.  An additional plus is that while the green color comes from spinach as is typical, in these the red color comes from beet powder instead of tomato so it is nightshade free and more nutritious!  : )  amazon had these on a good subscribe and save price when i purchased too!  Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Best Chocolate Ever for Health
review/text: Lindt's 99% cocoa may appear to be Baker's Chocolate with a very bitter taste but it's not.  Somehow, there's enough sweetness to make this a surprisingly delicious bar and maybe he best for pure health benefits of dark chocolate.  The trick is to eat small amounts (which is all you need for health benefits) to get accustomed to the taste.

review/text: I tried this wonderful chocolate recently, and decided to order 5 bars directly from Lindt USA. It is excellent in my opinion. What a wonderful, deep, robust flavor! I enjoy a small piece with a cup of green tea. It is a bit expensive at $5/bar, but it is so full of flavor that it is worth it. Since it is to be taken in small quantities, each bar will last a bit. This kind of strong, full flavored dark chocolate is definitely an acquired taste, and for the true lover of high quality chocolate. I might even say that this is an "adult" chocolate, not your kids Mars bar.

review/summary: It was Okay
review/text: When ordering this chocolate, I didn't necessarily expect to like it.  I love dark chocolate, but I had never had anything more than 75% dark chocolate.<br /><br />Let's just say that my first bite was horrible.  I thought I was eating bitter dirt.<br />The second bite was a little better.  I thought I was eating compacted Hershey's cocoa powder...<br />The third was even better.<br />So, it's definitely easily adaptable, but you might not like it on the first try.<br /><br />But, nonetheless, it was rich and smooth and worth the purchase (for the experience of trying it).<br />Next time, I think I'll just stick with 75-95%.

One has the sense he's savoring the chocolate equivalent of 24k gold. Exquisite flavor and texture combo. I did learn in my search for this elusive variant that it's available only online or in Lindt boutiques. Ordered four of them directly from Lindt at $5/bar.

review/text: These things are definitely dark. You need to work your way up to 99%, as it says on the inner packaging. I love the depth to the flavor and the richness and how it takes awhile to melt in my mouth.<br /><br />That being said, be sure to know what you're paying for - I found these in a health food store in Bloomington, Indiana and was excited about the low price. After I got home I realized it was only 1.8 ounces, unlike the other bars, selling in the same size package but 3.5 ounces. I felt ripped off, even though it is a much darker chocolate, simply because the packaging is completely misleading.<br /><br />Once you get past that, these babies are worth a try. So good.

I think the 99% is very sensitive to heat, so that's why it's so expensive.  For me it's great much different than the 90%, this is no sweetness, but still tastes good.  You only need to eat 1 little square and you're satisfied.  The 90% I just want to eat the whole bar at once.

review/text: Seeing as this is a food product, I can't explain to anyone how it tastes. Obviously you, yourself would have to go out and purchase this in order to have the pleasure. That being said: I must stress of how tastey this milk candy is. They come in a nice fairly transluecent bag with around 20-30 pieces stuffed inside. I didn't bother taking the time to count due to my unquenchable hunger and eargerness to taste the morsel. As I have said, I can't tell you how it tasted because it was so heavenly good that it is hard to portray an image. Creamy would be very accurate yet sentuous would also be a good description. Just order a bag and you will be glad you did, but be careful: this product can be quite addicting!

review/summary: Workmates stole them...
review/text: I love marshmellow.  It has to soft and fluffy to the touch and melt in the mouth.  Hadnt tried this kind although I had heard about from a couple people.  They were very nice, although I didnt have much of a 'pudding' on the inside that I was expecting.  I was thinking that the pudding would be of a custardy consistancy so I delicately tried one not wishing to collect 'pudding' over my shirt like one does with a jammy doughnut.  but the pudding was like part of the marshmellow but a different colour (If you've everhad the creme egg candies you'll have an idea of what I mean) also at the pudding part it was a little on the sweet side, but that just helps you cut down on how many you can eat in one go.<br />I made the mistake of taking them into work... they were gone by the end of the day!!  We agreed to try another flavor...but it looks as though everyone is waiting on me to order them...

review/summary: Marshmallow Goodness
review/text: My husband is a gummy fanatic. We move to a different country every couple of years (through work not, like, running from the law or anything) and so we've had the opportunity to try many different types of gummy candies but my husband always goes back to American gummies as being the best. We've been discussing moving to Japan next in a couple of years which got me thinking and I went off on an Amazon hunt for Japanese gummies to see what we can have to look forward to. During that search, I came across these which looked and sounded so good that I bought them for me as well as a couple of other gummy bags for my husband.<br /><br />I left them all for my husband to try when he got home from work and the next day I saw that the gummies were hardly touched but he had completely PLOWED through this marshmallow kind! They really are very good and I like that I can only eat a couple before feeling like I've had plenty. Too bad my husband didn't feel the same! The two bags were gone in record time.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like marshmallow!

review/summary: Mmmmmmmmarshmallows
review/text: I've bought several different flavors of Japanese filled marshmallows.  I recently bought this "pudding" flavor at a local Asian grocery store for a LOT less than this vendor is charging here.  The marshmallow part is very good, a typical marshmallow that has good mouth feel and texture.  Not too soft & squishy, not too chewy.  Pretty much like a typical American marshmallow.  The filling inside is very sweet and not at all like pudding.  It's more of a frosting/icing texture.  It is thick, smooth & creamy so it's really not bad at all.  Just don't expect a filling that is like Jello pudding.<br /><br />I would definitely buy these again but I would never pay more than three bucks a bag for them.  If you have a local Asian store, even if it's strictly Japanese, try that.  I get mine in a Korean owned store.

review/text: The one positive with these cigars is that the chocolate is actually edible, which was my main concern when ordering this item.  Its not great chocolate, more "fundraiser" quality, but at least its edible.<br /><br />The problem with the cigars is that they are not actually cigar shaped.  Instead, they are shaped like half a cigar, a flattened tube instead of a circular tube.  From the photo this is not obvious, but in person you have to do a double take to fully understand that these chocolates are supposed to represent cigars.  Honestly, it looks a little like a suppository in person.  Having said that, non-smokers loved these things, but I was a little disappointed.

Only comment is that due to shipping, an extraordinary number of chips in each bag are broken and it seems that each bag has less air in it than store bought individual bags - this to create a pillow effect to prevent breakage. Broken pieces still taste good but there is more waste and they are difficult to eat with salsa!

review/summary: Good Chips
review/text: These chips have quickly become a staple in my diet. They taste good, have a good crunch, and the best thing about them is that you get about twice the number of chips in a serving vs. regular chips, with better nutritional values too. This means you can make a decent plate of nachos using just one serving.<br /><br />These chips do have a few negatives. They don't taste the same as regular corn chips, which may put some people off. They don't taste bad at all, just not quite the same. I also feel the bags are a little on the small side, and because of breakage they often don't have the full 7 servings per bag that are advertised.<br /><br />These are now the only chips I will eat, and the several different flavors (including no added salt) are great for different cravings.

The gums stay sore after using this mixture on them for about a week to a month but then they heal completely.  It takes daily use to get the gums to heal but they eventually do.<br /><br />Others have said mustard oil stinks.  I washed my hair and put some in my hair as usual and a co-worker said "you smell good."  We couldn't figureo out what it was but the only smell on me was the mustard oil.<br /><br />Finally, I don't know if this is true or not, but I think my hair is growing quicker; I put a permanent dye on my hair two weeks ago and now I have to put some more on it; dye normally doesn't grow out in two weeks on ethnic hair.<br /><br />What I like about the oil, even if the rest is the placebo effect, is that on ethnic hair, the oil absorbs in about a day and your hair doesn't feel oily but it is indeed moisturized.

review/text: I am in agreement with some of the reviewers about the taste of this bread.  This is a wonderful food, especially for those of us who are watching their carb intake.  It is worth the price because you can't find this type of bread in a grocery store.  Actually, I couldn't find anything similar in a health food store.  Each slice is a little smaller than a regular slice of bread.  It does have a firmer texture than white bread.  If you are overly sensitive to some foods, double check these ingredients to be on the safe side.  Ingredients are:  almond flour; soy flour; bran flour; whole wheat flour; oat flour; sesame flour; unbleached flour; vital flour wheat; wheat germ; salt; anise seeds; maltisweet; cream of tartar; egg whites; soybean oil; dry yeast; soy protein; water; fiber gum; sesame seeds; dehydrated onions; dehydrated garlic; rye seeds; and poppy seeds.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: This is at least truly low carb, unlike Julian bread. While it is a bit dry, it makes good toast or grilled sandwiches.  I use sparingly because of soy, but it satisfies my need for toast with poached eggs, or toast points for pate..  It also freezes well.  I always toast the bread or buns a little to improve taste. I prefer the plain bread and buns. I actually cut the buns into fourths since I find they are too bulky for burgers, so I use the top and bottom for burgers, and the two inner slices for sandwiiches.  This bread also is good for crumbs or stuffing.

review/summary: GARLIC Bread?
review/text: Make sure you like GARLIC if you order this bread. I just got mine and as soon as I opened the box, a wave of garlic hit me. It smells VERY garlic and salty. I have not even tasted it yet, as the garlic smell is so overpowering that I lost my appetite. Ironically, I like garlic toast, and this may be great for that, but I was hoping for just a multi-grain flavored bread that I could make a ham and cheese sandwich with, but I am afraid that the excessive seasoning is going to ruin that.<br /><br />I will get up the nerve later and actually try it. I guess first I will put some in the toaster and see how it tastes as buttered toast. 3 stars for now.<br />-------------------------<br /><br />EDIT: changed from 3 stars to 4!<br />Okay now I have actually tried the bread twice, and I have changed my mind. It is awesome! When toasted the overpowering garlic and flaxy smell totally went away and it was delicious! I've had some with butter, whipped cream cheese, and today had some buttered with bacon and eggs and it was just like eating "normal" bread. So far I am very pleased and can't wait to try a hamburger or ham and cheese sandwich. I have not yet tasted it un-toasted, I will post another reply once I have, but so far I would rate it 4 stars instead of my initial 3.

review/summary: Better than Julian's Bakery
review/text: The Julian's Bakery 2 carbs bread and the raisin cinnamon bread used to be great.  I tried the new Paleo breads and they were so awful that I had to spit them out.  Then I re-ordered the 2 carbs and the cinnamon raisin, but they have a new recipe.  Now they are terrible, but not quite as bad as the Paleo.  I was able to eat one slice of each, but then threw out both loaves.  I hope they go back to the old recipe.  I'm so disappopinted with the new recipes, because they used to be very good.  I remember that Carb Krunchers used to have good bread, so I'll go back and try them again.

review/text: Bread so good I suspect the label.  Really great toasted in a toaster prior to eating.  As others have said, I would eat this bread even if I was not doing the low-carb thing.  Not cheap but absolutely worth the price to be able to make yourself a great sandwich.  Glad to see it on Amazon.

review/summary: Bread! I missed you!
review/text: I have no problem with the texture of this bread as I've been eating Ezekiel bread for a while now, which also has a firmer chewier texture than white bread. After going keto and needing my carb intake to be even lower, I thought this might be too good to be true when I saw it on Amazon. Hallelujah! Totally lives up to expectations. I can have grilled cheese again! BLT! breakfast sandwiches, pate with toast points, PB and (sugar-free) J, the possibilities... this bread has made me very happy :)

review/summary: Really tasty low-carb bread!
review/text: The bread is VERY tasty, similar to other natural whole-grain breads with no funny "chemical" aftertaste like many other low carb breads I've tried in the past. While it's not suitable for phase 1 of Atkins, it works in all other phases with only 4.5 net carbs per TWO slices!  Hooray for grilled cheese once again!  My only complaint is the price of this bread...  It is rather outrageous for the relatively small size of the loaves.  And the cost of shipping...  It cost more to ship it than the product itself.  Wish it was available in local health food or Trade Joes markets. (hint to the product's maketing team... lol)<br />I would definitely recommend this bread!

review/text: Please tell me in these hard economic times that good american people are not spending $26 for two loaves of bread? I don't care if it had "0" net carbs - the cost is insane. There are people living on the other side of this world making 0.26 cents a day. Our grandparents, great grandparents, etc. all ate WHITE bread, butter, pasta, dessert & did you ever notice in old photos nobody is fat? People worked hard back then. And we "bellyache" about doing 30 minutes of exercise a day! I'm guilty too & buy the healthier more expensive options but I'll spend my $26 to put gas in my car thank you very much.

review/summary: Exactly what I expected
review/text: I purchased the Eagle Creek ProTech Cube, size medium, to hold a portable air pump I purchased from VIAIR (Model 85P).  The pump only arrived only with its outer packaging/box.  I searched for something to accomodate the pump and came up with the ProTech Cube which encases/holds the pump perfectly.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the case lacks rigidity.  With the zippers and outer casing having some give to them, it allowed me to squeeze the case and enclosed pump into a space next to my spare tire.  I more rigid case would have not allowed for that.<br /><br />The case is tough enough to protect the contents but again, flexible enough to allow it to fit into some tigher spaces.<br /><br />The case is a bit on the pricey side but definitely does its job well.

review/summary: Alternative case for Bose Soundlink.
review/text: I bought the medium size for the purpose of protecting and carrying my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KFONIU">Bose SoundLink Wireless Mobile Speaker - Nylon</a>..Well, I was not disappointed!! The case space is wide enough for the speaker and the  wire/plug. The medium size measures about 10.5" (L) x 7.5" (W) x 3"(D).  The dividers(2) inside the case are detachable and can be velcroed either on top or bottom or on the sides to add cushion and protection. The handle is a very big plus for portability.  When I unzip the case open and lay it down on top of a table, the space inside is roomy enough to accommodate my upright Soundlink with its speaker cover flipped down, without taking it out of the case, thus keeping the Bose stand/cover clean.  This will definitely protect my new Bose inside my luggage when I travel next time and keep it dust-free when I am not using it.  Bought mine in Bark color from another website for &lt;$20, so, shop around.

It zips so you know the stuff won't fall out. And there are separators in the case to keep things from flopping around. Overall the perfect case for small to medium sized items that you want to keep protected with padding and a zippered top.

review/summary: Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs
review/text: Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.

They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/text: I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local "healthy supermarket," and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.

However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.

review/summary: Bland, Snickerdoodle, Tastes like flour
review/text: I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.  True disappointment, my kids will not eat them and I bought a whole box. Tastes like sweet, baked flour and water.<br /><br />However the chocolate chip ones are good.

review/summary: So good!...........
review/text: One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!

review/summary: Where's the Peanut Butter?
review/text: These are actually quite delicious. They are dry so make sure you have plenty of milk or something else to drink. Also, I did not detect as much of a peanut buttery taste as I would have liked, but they are still good, and I would recommend them.

review/text: Just got these oatmeal animal cookies and we love them!  These are not like a typical animal cracker - they are more like tiny crunchy granola bars!  They remind me of the oats and honey crunchy granola bars from Nature Valley.  Also love the price - the only place I can buy these is Whole Foods and they are .99/package there.  Subscribe and save is definitely a winner on this one!

review/summary: The Boy Loves Them!
review/text: All kids like animal crackers, don't they? Well our three-year-old boy certainly does. So my wife picked up a 7.5-ounce bag of Barbara's Shackimals Chocolate Chip animal crackers. I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: These cookies taste great, my kids love them! I feel good about giving them a healthier snack. The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star is becuase each bag comes with 2 servings in it. This makes them a little less convenient to use while traveling, but with an extra bowl or baggie that problem is easily solved. Will definitely buy again!

review/summary: 5 Stars for Choc. Chip Flavor ONLY, Oatmeal deserves 2 stars...
review/text: Choc. Chip review: I wish I found these before the kids got out of school for the summer because they are a great school lunch item.  I like the ingredients and packs are big enough to share with another person.  I bought based on good reviews and found them to be crispy and delicious.  They taste like those little animal crackers you find in the small, red, zoo-like boxes with the string handles I had as a child but these are crispier and better ingredients.  I didn't sense the chocolate chip in the flavor but they are good. Recommend! :)<br /><br />EDIT:  Tried the Oatmeal flavor and was sadly disappointed..2 stars from me. The taste was bland and nothing exceptional for the over-the-top cost.  PLUS...Amazon only lets you review ONE FLAVOR even if you try others.  Obnoxious and deceptive...makes all flavors look 5 star when they are NOT.

review/summary: Great little snack for hubby and me
review/text: My husband and I enjoy a crunchy snack every now and then, and want it to be not only good tasting, but nutritious as well. I ordered a box of each flavor Snackimals, and we have not been disappointed. I just dump a small bag of each of the four flavors in a small cookie jar. We reach in for a few whenever we want, not worrying about getting one we don't like, since they all taste great. (But I must admit, we're both a little partial to the oatmeal.) Go ahead--what are you waiting for? Buy these!

review/summary: GREAT COOKIES
review/text: My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.

Theyre like 10 times tastier than the regular wheat animal crackers that come in the little boxes.<br />The animals they make are the elephant, the lion, the bear(my favorite), the zebra, a camel, a furry cat, a circus cart, something im pretty sure is a fox, a monkey and a hippo.<br />The cookies are a lovely snack and there is just the right amount in the bag. I will definitely buy these again.

review/summary: Really tasty cookies despite confusing reviews
review/text: I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .

review/text: The Barbara's snackimals are an unexpected surprise.<br />These cookies come in a 2 servings per bag package at 2.25oz each which in perspective is more mass than a 99cent bag of chips at Subway et al. So relatively satisfying portion if eating as intended, 1 bag at a time.<br /><br />Delicious oaty flavor, tasting of molasses and vanilla, 2 of their few ingredients, these cookies are crispy.  Yet they chew down to goo just like the old-fangled animal crackers with the carnival packaging.<br /><br />I feel good about buying them, relatively snacking, and I feel good about consuming them, again, relatively speaking.<br />Recommended in all ways, no drawbacks that I have discovered yet.
