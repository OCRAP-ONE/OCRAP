review/summary: Great Product In Wrong Container
review/text: Undoubtedly, the purchase and use of stool softeners would plummet if everyone, including physicians, considered magnesium.<br /><br />Fact: An insufficient amount of magnesium in the body is a primary cause of constipation and hemorrhoids, yet most physicians unwittingly recommend stool softeners.<br /><br />Fact: By taking your measure of Natural CALM daily your constipation will quickly subside.<br /><br />Friends, before you devour any more medications why not try a natural remedy?<br /><br />Natural CALM is an easy-to-assimilate powder that when mixed with water becomes effervescent. More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM.<br /><br />Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.<br /><br />Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: "Place powder in a glass or mug," it says. "Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water."<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216.<br /><br />Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest.

review/summary: aptly named product
review/text: Have been using Natural Calm for 6 years. Highly absorbable form of magnesium helps with nutritional balance and is a quick-acting, gentle muscle relaxer/tension tamer. If you take calcium supplements or eat a lot of dairy, you might consider supplementing with magnesium. Calcium is used in contracting muscles; magnesium is used in relaxing them. If you have a lot of calcium in your system and not enough magnesium, those muscles can't completely relax! My old massage therapist gave this to every client before his/her massage; she said she didn't have to work as hard to relax stubborn, tense muscles after folks had taken this. Hubby takes it on business trips to keep all systems balanced and avoid tension headaches from Atlanta airport! This is hands-down the best price I've seen for the product, and it was delivered to my door. Can't beat that.

review/summary: Very Good Source of Magnesium
review/text: If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium.  This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium.  My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night).  A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this.  As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate).  After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared.  One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too.<br /><br />I have only two problems with the product.  First, this particular flavor of Natural Calm neither tastes nor smells all that great:  it's sickly sweet.  However, there is a non-flavored variety which is great (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OQ2DL4">Natural Vitality - Natural Calm, oz, 16 powder</a>).  Also, it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  I've subtracted one star from my rating for those.  But, still, I rate this at a Very Good four stars out of five.

review/text: I've been using this product for about 2 years to treat skipped heart beats which I have suffered with for about 4 decades with zero help from the medical community. It has been one of the only supplements I've tried in that same period that has lived up to it's promises. I also have had problems with constipation for most of my life ( I'm sure it's because of my terrible diet which includes lots of sugar) and it also totally solved that problem. I would like you to know that I own no stock in the company, I do not know anyone in the company,I do not sell this product, and I do not have a dog in the fight however I would hate to think that I could no longer be able to get this product. After using several different types of magnesium I proclaim this to be the very best with no one in close 2nd place. I will tell you it takes a small amount of effort to figure out how much your body needs, I usually take about a teaspoonfull a day mixed in a bottle of plain water and I drink it though out the day and I do this about 3 times a day. This product has litterally changed my life and I think I could write a small book about it. I've told numerous people about it and it's a shame there are so many scams in the world that we as a people are so sceptical and that when a great product comes along we sometimes ignore it..

review/summary: Wish I could take this
review/text: I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep at night, and I have suffered from migraines for most of my life. This product seemed like the perfect solution to both problems.<br /><br />For the sleep issue, I have never found anything that even comes close. I actually fell asleep, shortly after going to bed, with ease. This was really an incredible change for the better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I discovered that my migraines got worse when I was taking this. Not just a little bit worse, MUCH worse. It was as if the worst part of the migraine got extended much longer than normal. It was to the point that I had to be driven home from work and ended up in the ER in one case while I was taking this (the normal dose recommended on the label). This was the first and only time I have ever been to the ER for a migraine in 20+ years of getting migraines.<br /><br />Even after that incident I really wanted to continue at least with a small dose before bed. I tried this on and off for several weeks, but unfortunately it consistently aggravated my headaches the next day anytime I took it.<br /><br />I've noticed other forms of Magnesium also cause headache issues for me, which is odd since it is supposed to help prevent them. So, hopefully this reaction is fairly individual to me. But the lack of much of any negative reviews for this product compelled me to write a review. Evidently, not everybody reacts well to it (but I do really, really wish I could take it for the sleep benefit.)

review/summary: Absolutely amazing -- thank God for this product!
review/text: A little over a week ago and completely out of the blue, I started having heart palpitations.  I'm a 27-year-old female and am on no medications and have no significant medical history.  The first two days, I only noticed a few of them.  Then for the next 3 days, I had them much more frequently.  I could put my fingers on my pulse and literally feel my heart skipping beats (a long pause followed by 2 closer-together beats).  It was absolutely terrifying; I couldn't sleep for two nights because I was afraid I wouldn't wake up.  I had read that these are typically harmless, especially if they aren't accompanied by any underlying heart issues or symptoms.  But that doesn't make them any less frightening and unsettling.  Finally, on day 5, I went to the doctor who confirmed with an EKG that I was having premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).  He told me just to forget about them, that they were harmless.  That lessened my anxiety related to the heart palpitations a bit, but I knew something had to have caused them, and I wasn't content to just deal with them forever.  I had my blood checked, and I was neither hyperthyroid nor hypothyroid, and my potassium level was normal (these are potential causes of the PVCs according to my doctor, in addition to caffeine and stress).<br /><br />But I also read that a magnesium deficiency can cause heart palpitations (and being deficient wouldn't have been a surprise because my diet had been less-than-ideal).  So, on day 6, I went to a health food store and was encouraged to try this product.  I paid $18 for 4 ounces!  I went home and took a big initial dose (probably 2 teaspoons) and, within a few hours, I noticed that my heart beat wasn't skipping as frequently.  The next day, I noticed an occasional flutter but nothing like the big scary pounding flip-flops from the days before.  The next day, they were gone altogether, and they have not returned.  I have been palpitation-free for several days now, and I undoubtedly owe my relief to this magnificent magnesium!<br /><br />Beyond the cessation of the abnormal heart beat, this product helps me sleep like a log!  It has also made me feel much calmer, even in situations where I ordinarily would feel anxious.  I am truly thankful to have found this product!

I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  That's pretty insignificant.  So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five.  Highly recommended.  Especially if you're taking calcium.

review/text: I LOVE this product.  I would do without food before I would do without this.  The benefits are multiple - it helps keep you regular and also helps take the stress and tension out of your muscles.  It does take 4-6 weeks to notice full change in your muscles.  I certainly don't feel the stress in my upper back the way I use to - and I still do the same type of computer work day in and day out.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.  You won't regret it - and Amazon has the best price of anywhere I've found it so far.

review/summary: Miracle Supplement
review/text: Magnesium is vitally important on many levels.  It not only helps your muscles to relax, but also aids sleep and allows for a more calm & balanced state of mind. Low levels of this mineral make nearly every disease worse, whether you are dealing with asthma, diabetes, depression or cardiovascular disease. It  assists in the assimulation of calcium & potassium, so those with osteoporosis concerns should be looking to include Magnesium in their supplements.<br /><br />I have been using Magnesium Calm for the past year and have found it very helpful for relaxing muscle tension, & getting a good nights sleep, not to mention its calming effect on my state of mind ! Its easy to take and comes in several flavors as well. I recommend it to many of my massage clients, so they can decrease the pain and discomfort in their bodies.

review/summary: Helps with Heart Palpitations
review/text: After a little bit of research, I learned that magnesium plays a crucial role in the regulation of the heart. After being on medication for some time for unpleasant heart palpitations (which never worked too well), I decided to give this supplement a try. In about 2 months, the palpitations were completely gone, and I don't have to take that horrible drug anymore! This stuff is awesome. This was about a year ago. I have come to realize that doctors know nothing about caring for the human body and know very little about real nutrition. Your just a customer to them; they make their money by prescribing dangerous drugs that only mask symptoms but don't correct the problem at its source. Magnesium is so important for the body - you cannot go wrong with this supplement. Most people are deficient in this important mineral because the land is so devoid of important minerals these days, so it's very hard to get from food alone. This is the best magnesium supplement on the market. Don't take those cheap magnesium pills you can get at any store. Most of them don't get absorbed by the body and act only as a laxative. Magnesium citrate, of which this product is, gets assimilated easily. Don't be surprised if other problems your having begin to clear up as well. Magnesium deficiency can cause a lot of problems. Read the book "The Magnesium Miracle" for more info.<br /><br />Peace.

Some people had mentioned a problem with diarrhea when using Natural Calm; however I have not been experiencing that - possibly because I am taking only 1/2 teaspoon daily.

review/summary: Better training recovery, much less pain, sleep like a baby
review/text: I discovered Peter Gilham's products a few months ago, and can speak for this product as well as the Osteo Calm, which adds calcium.  As a mature exerciser, recovery is always the biggest challenge, and this product eliminated my reliance on OTC anti-inflammatories.  I'm a physiologist who did contract work for a magnesium manufacturer and I've read most of the medical literature on Mg2+'s importance in the management of diabetes and vessel disease, and I don't think there's a better product than this one to address those issues. As magnesium pulls water into the gut, IMO it's the best remedy for sluggish elimination, and you must build the dose up slowly to prevent stools that are too loose.  For people with constipation, it's pretty much guaranteed to provide an immediate and permanent remedy.  And as magnesium is critical for the complete relaxation of muscle fibers, it's a first line treatment for chronic pain of any kind.  Even after months of using the Gilham Calm products, I still have to have my evening pretty much wrapped up before taking the supplement as it really knocks me out for sleep.  Deeper and more refreshed sleep is also a main objective to any chronic pain condition.<br /><br /> I switched to the Osteo Calm a couple of months ago in my desire to add a better piece to my menopausal osteoporosis prevention, and have found that product to be completely awesome also.

review/summary: A True Miracle for my 3 year old son!
review/text: I have struggled for the last year with my 3 year old son's constipation and fear of going "poo" on the potty. He also has been quite hyperactive in the past year; that coincided with a new brother (he is the middle child) as well as his efforts on potty training.  At the suggestion of my mother in law, we began using this product (1/2 tspn per day), and 10 days later, he began going poo on the potty with no problem at all, even asking to go, and went at school.  Prior to this, he would hold it because he was in so much pain when he went, and he never went away from the house!  We literaly BATTLED over going poo in the potty!  So this was the first miracle.  But then, within two days of that, he was back to my sweet, normal 3 year old boy and not so hyper and irritable.  He is smiling more, hugging us again, obeying simple rules and commands, and I feel like I have my son back!  I attribute all of this to the magnesium as we have not done anything different with his vitamins and diet than we had been doing for the last year.  He is also eating better, which I believe is because his tummy doesn't hurt as much now that he is regular.<br /><br />I do think I am going to cut back to 1/4 tspn/day though because the stools are a little looser, and he is taking 3 hour naps, so a little too sleepy.  But all in all, I am in LOVE with this product and highly recommend it for children as well as adults! My husband is about to start taking it to see if it helps with his sleep and his adult ADD that he suffers from.

review/summary: great product, worth every penny
review/text: I've struggled with sleep and muscle tension for years and was introduced to this power powder by a great friend (thanks hil!) who said it worked for her.  From day one, it's worked incredibly well.  I don't feel drugged or sedated, just relaxed.  I agree that it's pretty sweet and strong as far as flavor, but hey, I can deal!  Careful: it does fizz up quite a bit and can easily overflow a glass if left unchecked.  I'm really thankful to have this product as a natural alternative to the myriad of pharmacological sleep aids.  No dependence, no withdrawal, just great, relaxed, restful sleep.  Mazel tov, Natural Calm!!

review/summary: Works Great
review/text: I ordered the Original flavor.  It tastes a lot like Alka Seltzer, only stronger.  This product works really well.  Taken at the dose on the label, I did feel more relaxed and less stressed.  Once it got in my system, it was almost like taking a sleeping pill, as I would get very sleepy within an hour or so of taking it.  The problem for me was that it seemed to build up within my system.  And the relaxed mellow state I started in soon became the fatigued energy-less state.  At first, I didn't realize that it was caused by this product.  But when I stopped taking it, the extreme fatigue did stop.  I'm giving this product five stars, because it works REALLY well.  But you do have to watch your own body and adjust your dosage accordingly.  I still take this product, but just not as often, and not on a regular schedule.  Maybe that's just me.  Do try it, but just be aware of what it can do.

review/summary: Pleasing Results
review/text: Over the past few weeks, I was analyzing my typical daily nutrition and found I was lacking in magnesium. Like most Americans, I consume much more calcium than magnesium; the ratio of calcium to magnesium intake ideally needs to be 1-1.5:1. I read the reviews and thought it would be interesting to see if I could experience the calming effect on my muscles that many other reviewers have noted.<br /><br />I take two teaspoons (dissolved into a 500 mL water bottle) about an hour before I go to bed, and I do notice a calming effect. This product does not have the effect of a hypnotic or a benzodiazepine, so one should not expect it to "knock you out." Rather, I do experience a noticeable "lightening" of the muscles. As I lie in bed, I feel more comfortable and better able to focus on feeling comfortable because the muscles all throughout my body seem to be content to be in "off" mode; they are not as easily excitable as they are on my previously magnesium-deficient diet.<br /><br />I am pleased with this product and will continue taking two teapoons in water every night. I recommend this product to all who have found that they, too, are deficient in magnesium. I also agree that this product softens the stools and provides for a pleasant midday defecation. Cheers.

Wow!  An hour or so before going to bed I have two teaspoons of this powder in a cup of hot water, and pop a melatonin tablet at the actual bedtime.  In my case it helps to avoid alcohol and food intake after 6PM. And now falling asleep is no longer a problem! What a life saver. Tastes good too! Thanks, Peter Gilliam, whoever you are :)

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I have had a "twitching eyelid" problem for over a month now.  I've had that happen a few times here and there in the past, but never like this.  This was really getting bothersome, it was doing it like every 30 minutes or so for a few seconds at a time.  From the time I woke up till the time I went to bed.  It go so bad last week, I looked up again online about it...and somehow came across a forum where someone had the same problem and someone replied "you have a magnesium deficiency".  Well then I started looking up magnesium deficency and came upon this product.  I went and bought it the next day a local store.  And guess what??  My eye twitching has almost completely come to a STOP!!!  From something that was getting to be every 20-30 min. to now it does it about 2-3 times a day, much less noticable too, the twitching isn't as severe or bothersome.<br /><br />So I would have given this 5 stars, but I am still waiting to see if this supplement helps with any of the other problems, I've noticed after reading about magnesium deficiencies.  Those would be an added bonus if it helped with my other symptoms.  I am starting out with a small amount and will work my way up, and see if it gets any better with other things.  But I think it's great for just helping with my eye, it was literally driving me crazy!!<br />So glad I came upon this product...and the taste is really not bad at all.  I mix it with a whole glass of cold water, and it really only tastes like water with a lemon wedge in it, to me anyway...Maybe a larger amount of it, in less water might be too sweet, but it's really diluted in a full glass of water, so it isn't bad at all.

review/summary: One of the best nutritional supplements out there
review/text: A friend recommended that I try this product out due to my low blood levels of magnesium (some of the medications I was on depleted my body of Mg and K). I used to get cramping and soreness in my muscles after going for just minor walks or workouts. This product however, stopped the discomfort within hours of first taking it!<br /><br />If you read up on the side effects of low levels of Magnesium in the blood, you will be amazed to find out how many ailments result. The "Calm" is the answer without a doubt.<br /><br />I suffered from high blood pressure and hypertension for years, as well as an elevated heart rate. After taking this product, in conjunction to lifestyle changes, I began to feel better and all other cardiovascular issues normalized.<br /><br />When my doctor asked me what I changed in my life to make my numbers look better, I told her about the Calm, and she has since began using it herself and telling her other patients about it. Its a much quicker and easier way to get the essential Magnesium into your body fast and effectively. It certainly works better than trying to eat copious amounts of other Mg rich foods.<br /><br />Adhere to the serving sizes- especially at first. Magnesium makes for a darn good laxative if you take too much!!!<br /><br />This product is the cheapest here on Amazon. You'll likely spend $35-$45 at other health food stores.

review/summary: What else would you call this but "Calm?"
review/text: I had high hopes when I ordered this supplement, purportedly for one of my sons who was having some transitional stress issues...but I needed it as much (if not more.)  We have not been disappointed.  In fact, this supplement has exceeded all  hopes and expectations.  I suspect that my anxiety issues were beginning to negatively impact an important relationship. That has improved as have all my other relationships.  I am much more patient and centered, much less needy.  I have also noticed that there are no more occasional heart palpitations, no more twitchy legs either...no twitches of any kind. Also, as a budding middle-aged runner, this product IS helpful with muscle recovery.  I wish we had known about this product when our younger son was running track and cross country in high school.  It would have been tremendously helpful.  As others have noted, "Calm" is a wonderful aid in getting a restful night's sleep. A good night's sleep in-and-of itself is tremendously important to one's overall health. I will try never let myself run out of this supplement.  What a discovery!

review/summary: Hooked on this!
review/text: I'm a huge skeptic, but after 6 months of daily use, I do agree that this stuff is a necessary supplement in my life.  When I skip a couple days, I'm reminded.  I take it at night and it improves my otherwise slow system by the morning.  I continued being skeptical but noticed a marked improvement in my sleeping (more relaxed) and some muscle damage I had in my leg quickly healed (after one year of pain from an injury!).  I started off slow and had to graduate to a high dose - appx 3-4 tsp per day (was having serious constipation) -- after a week or so, I tapered down to a normal dose. I got my husband hooked on this stuff for the 'relaxing' effect alone (he is on the higher energy side).  It's subtle, not a drugged feeling when I say relaxing effect ... it's similar to melatonin without any groggy feeling.  My primary use is for constipation ... no more garbage over the counter drugs.  I never found improvement from pro-biotics either. This stuff helps with bloating and overall "uggh" feeling.  We both really like the taste, too.  If you like it more sweet/sour, then just use less water.  It's an artificial type sweetener, so no calories ... and I normally hate artificial sweetener taste, but it's hidden well.  It's similar to crystal light ... we get the raspberry/lemon flavor.  We take one dose every night.  I highly recommend!  Your local health food store might give you a sample ... try it for a few days but don't buy it from there ... come to Amazon because it's WAY cheaper :)  Good luck!

review/summary: Helped Spouse That Has Fibromyalgia
review/text: I originally purchased Natural Calm to help with my own insomnia and anxiety issues. I started out with 1/2 teaspoon and gradually worked up to 1 teaspoon taken before bedtime. If I take more than 1 teaspoon, it has a laxative effect the next day. Even though it does help me relax, it doesn't really help with the insomnia. I've recently switched to Slow-Mag for a more sustained release of magnesium throughout the day. It doesn't have the same laxative effect, plus helps with daytime anxiety. However, my spouse (who has fibromyalgia) has had positive results with Natural Calm. It has improved his quality of sleep and also helped with muscle aches and overall fatigue. He takes about 1 to 1/2 teaspoons each night. I anticipate that he will want to continue purchasing Natural Calm. It doesn't work the same for everyone, but we are very happy with how the product has helped him so far.

review/text: I'm a 31 year old woman and I have suffered from night terrors for my entire life. Since I started taking this supplement a couple of weeks ago I've slept through the night every night. Aside from that fact (that will keep me a customer for life on its own), I also just feel great in general. I take a teaspoon in the morning and a teaspoon in the evening which i dissolve in warm water. It tastes like a bland lemonade, which is fine by me. I'm not here for the flavor, i'm here for the health benefits. My bathroom trips are more regular and my muscles don't feel as sore after I exercise. One thing I would like to note, just in case it happens for anyone else, is that the first 3 days I was getting a pain in my temple randomly throughout the day. Research has led me to believe that this was from the artificial sweetener in the raspberry lemonade flavoring. I'm not having those pains anymore, and when I order again i'll probably stick with the same flavor. I hope this helps someone else may be on the fence about it.

review/text: I am an anxiety ridden person who just needs to calm down, so I tried this.  I think it has helped a little with restful sleep.  It also impacts bowel movements, so watch your dosage.  Read the directions: it needs to fizz in warm water before you drink it.  There's a raspberry-lemon flavor I would probably have liked better but didn't see it until after I ordered.  The flavor is bitter but it's such a small drink (2-3 oz) that it's acceptable.<br />I think valerian root works better for immediate relief.  This needs a longer time period to work well.

After going through two 8oz packages, I was unable to afford it for a while. I really felt a difference without taking my Calm Plus Calcium twice a day. I found it much harder to relax and sleep at night, and started having spasms in my leg and back again. Recently purchased this 16 oz container thru Amazon, and have been taking it regularly again, and finally the spasms are mostly gone again. I hope they never stop making this product - I suppose I could live without it, but I would rather not!

review/summary: one of my favorite supplements
review/text: Magnesium deficiency can affect all aspects of health. I have tried various magnesium supplements, and this is my favorite. I feel, as the label says in bold letters, more CALM when I take this. There is less muscle tension in my body. I enjoy the taste as well, mixed with just 3-4 ounces of hot water, for a soothing warm lemon drink. I often take this with my calcium hydroxyapatite supplements, since both will work better together.<br /><br />Down sides: Need to be careful when making it, or it will fizz itself up and out of your cup. Also, if you get loose stools, adjust your dose down because it means you are taking more than you can absorb. Unfortunately, this is also a sign that your body isn't ABLE to absorb magnesium properly, in which case you may need to look into temporary IV or topical formulas until this is addressed.

review/summary: Great for sore muscles, helps with sleep, helps with menstrual cramps.
review/text: I've been using Natural Vitality Calm magnesium powder for years. It helps me get to sleep at night, especially after a stressful day or when I'm worried. I use it after I work out at the gym; or if I've got sore muscles from other activities such as gardening or heavy lifting. It is great for "that time of the month." It helps with cramps and mood swings. Calm comes in a few different flavors such as lemon, raspberry-lemon, and orange. I like the orange flavor the best. It's easy to use. Just mix a teaspoon or more of the powder with hot water. Then add a little cold water or cold juice and drink.  A hint: If you have trouble sleeping, try taking Calm and also take Vitamin B1 about a half hour before bed, to help with sleep. My chiropractor recommended that and it works for me. The magnesium in Calm has been formulated to absorb into the body and take effect quickly. There is a little booklet that is usually attached to the canister of Calm that gives more info on all of the benefits of magnesium in this form.

review/summary: Love it! - helps my stress and anxiety, sleep, and blood pressure
review/text: I'm so glad my doctor told me about this stuff.  I was having high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, just stressed out.  Also losing my hair but I haven't been taking it long enough to tell if that will help with this problem.  But, I'm not on blood pressure meds anymore, and I just feel calm, just as it is called.  Work has, and still is, very stressful, but this stuff helps me get through the day without the need to go home and have a glass of wine, or something stronger, every day.  It does not make me sleepy (I was afraid of that happening at work), but it does help me sleep better through the night.  I'm now hoping that this, in addition to some other things I'm taking, will help with my hair loss.

review/text: I absolutely adore pumpkin and these granola bars are heaven for a pumpkin lover.  A lovely warm pumpkin flavor, rich tangy spice and heavenly nutty notes all enhance this bar.  Yes, it could have more flavor but not without adding more salt, sugar and calories.  So for the nutritional value these bars are superb.<br /><br />IMHO, these bars are far better than Kashi's pumpkin variety.

review/text: These granola bars are the epitome of warm fall flavors. They are lightly spiced and have a warm nutty granola flavor. If you like Chai they are very similar in taste to the mix of spices in Chai. In fact, they taste great with a Chai or a nice warm cup of tea. They taste more like a GRANOLA BAR than half the bars at the store that taste more like a candy bar. They are healthy and so low in sodium. I would recommend them to anyone. They are a bit pricey in my local grocery store but Amazon makes them affordable and the bars really are nice size.

review/summary: Love this bar....
review/text: I discovered this bar in a local supermarket once and absolutely loved it. It is not available at all Supermarket outlets. I tried the Hemp Bar made by Nature's path which was also delicious, but because of allergies to some ingredients, this was the first treat that I have been able to enjoy without worry. I spoke to the company and although the bar does not say it is gluten free, and I am gluten sensitive, this bar is absolutely fine for me. Some people cannot tolerate oats, but I have had a lucky break with the oats in this bar. It is a staple grab bar in my home. My teenage kids absolutely love them and that pleases me as it really is so nutritious. I have bulk ordered this twice already through Amazon, and will be back when the cupboard is bare. Enjoy this. I know some people find it not sweet enough. I find it has enough sweetness and fabulous texture. (I normally don't even enjoy bars of any sort). It is a wholesome treat. Try it with a cup of green tea on an afternoon and you will be pleasantly surprized as to how an ordinary day can feel like a gift.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E4C2MQ">Nature's Path Organic Granola Bars, Pumpkin FlaxPlus, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Sickly sweet sugar sugar sugar sugar
review/text: I've tried Natures Path other granola bars and have been delighted with them, and so I thought I'd give these a try. I really wish that I had tried one first (such as buy a single bar from a local store/health food shop), because If I had, there's no way I would have bought an entire box. Texture wise, these are ideal, soft, chewy and don't leave you covered in crumbs when you take a bite. However, these bars are sugar, sugar, sugar!! Okay, so it's not HFSC or refined white sugar, but it's every other kind of ....well...here's a list of ingredients: (brackets are mine).<br /><br />Granola<br />evaporated cane juice (sugar)<br />soy oil<br />tapioca syrup (sugar)<br />brown rice flour<br />pumpkin seeds<br />salt<br />invert cane syrup (sugar)<br />flaxseeds,<br />acacia gum<br />evaporated cane juice (sugar)<br />sea salt<br />spice, and finally<br />molasses (more sugar)<br /><br />As well as being super sickly sweet, these have an almost condensed milk aftertaste to them. I really don't have a problem with sweet as I do have a sweet tongue, but these are just sickly and leave both your mouth and fingers icky-sticky. The other thing that annoys me is that they make it clear on the packaging that these are Flax seed bars, but you'll have noticed in the list of ingredients that flax seeds come way down the list in terms of quantity. Before you order a six pack of six, I'd be inclined to try one bar first, and then decide whether these are to your liking or not.

review/text: It's no secret that I love breakfast foods.  I'll eat them throughout the day and love to snack on these bars when hungry.  My wife picked these up over the weekend, and I've become addicted.  I love the flavor of pumpkin.  It reminds me of Autumn, which is my favorite time of year, and these earthy bars are layered with those warm flavors of Fall, so much so that I'm debating eating another one right now.  The right hint of spice and the right amount of pumpkin flavor make for a really nice bite.  Some have balked at the sugary sweetness, but I didn't find that alarming at all.  It was sweet, sure, but not too much at all.  I also love a chewy granola bar, so I was really happy with the texture of this product.

review/text: This granola bar product's name contains several sensuous operative words:  organic, pumpkin and flax plus; therefore, the bars should smell and taste great.  However,  the bars smell somewhat stale, and they taste at about a C- (if we were using a grading system).  I am disappointed.  And I'm stuck with five more unopened boxes, which I'm going to donate to the poor.  I know that they're nutritional, but I shouldn't have to bite the bullet to eat each granola bar.  My guess that they're not stale at all--they just have an unpleasant smell.

review/summary: Picture is wrong
review/text: I'm not tea connoisseur. This tea seemed milder and smoother than normal tea. Not sure if that is worth the extra 50 per box yet or not. Just had the first bag. Also this picture doesn't match the actual product. Box is for Jasmine tea and not the White tea.

review/summary: I love these.
review/text: Thses are the best flavor Jolly Ranchers in my opinion, and apparently in my family's as well as every time I buy a bag at the drugstore I am left without any. So I figured the only way to solve this problem, as we seem to be WJRF (Watermelon Jolly Rancher Fanatics) was to buy only watermelon flavored ones... one problem... they just don't sell Watermelon flavor bags in the stores anymore... a few years ago you could get them, but no longer. "Fire" flavor? sure. "Green apple" flavor? no problem. You could even find bags of "Cherry" flavored Jolly Ranchers, but no watermelon to be found anywhere. In desperation I turned to the interent and finally found these. One box of these (160 candies) is enough to satisfy even my family's cravings.... but just incase, because of our long-time watermelon depravation I bought two. These candies are wonderful.

review/summary: JOLLY RANCHER WATERMELON-160 PIECE BOX
review/text: ASIN B000ES40MM - One of the original Jolly Rancher flavors, and a lifelong favorite around here, the 160 piece box is something I generally pick up locally to avoid the shipping charges that come with ordering online. To make sure you get the best price on Amazon, take the time to do a search because there are several listings and the prices vary.<br /><br />From the crinkle of the plastic wrapper as you open it to the last tiny sliver of mouth-watering flavor, everything about these candies is a flawless-summer-day-in-childhood memory for me. The flavoring is stronger than an actual watermelon and you can smell them before you open them - so don't keep them close at hand unless you're willing to give in to temptation! There's about 24 calories in a candy and, because they're yummy, I use them rather than cough drops for fighting off that dry mouth, throat-tickling cough. Any excuse!<br /><br />Also see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014C2JFC">Jolly Rancher Twist Watermelon 160 Piece Box</a>. Is 160 pieces not enough?

review/text: Watermelon Jolly Ranchers are by far the best flavor.  Jolly Ranchers are a great sucking candy  and if you put a watermelon and sour apple in your mouth at the same time you really have the best flavor.

review/text: When ordered this way one gets to try Jollys fresh. Yeas, one may label me a fool. -fresh candy?  "candie is candie." I say nay nay, fresh 'ranchers' are superior. Just when I thought watermelon flavor couldn't get any better.

review/text: Apart from having to have this item sent to a friend in America who then posted it privately to me in Australia as Amazon can't send food items out of the country, I have nothing but good things to say.  The candy was delivered to my US friends very quickly and arrived here later in excellent shape.  I'm really enjoying it and can't wait to buy the other flavours.
