review/text: I've only tried a few different brands. But I keep coming back to Lucid. I'm just glad it's one of the cheaper absinthe out there as quick as a bottle can disappear. Also recommend for anyone wanting to try absinthe for the first time.

review/summary: Go for a real Absinthe
review/text: After trying some true European absinthes while living in Europe, Lucid is a fantastic disappointment.  It leaves an unsatisfying after taste not present in more traditionally prepared and distilled absinthes.  Particularly when compared to Absente or its more traditional brother Grande Absente, another French absinthe, you really begin to notice the distinction. While the Absente is a slightly lower proof (@ 100) than Lucid (@124) you can accomodate by adjusting the ration of water to absinthe when preparing the drink.  Overall, I'd suggest finding something with a more traditional Verte Absinthe recipe.

review/summary: So Awful I Can't Come Up With a Comparison
review/text: What a cute bottle! What a bad absinthe!<br /><br />Absinthette? Absinthe light? What ever it is, it tastes like the animal's eyes who are on the front of the bottle played an integral part in the manufacturing of such a drink. I like to imagine it involved the re-appropriation of it's bath water. But this is just conjecture.<br /><br />I used to have an ex who would joke about how all of his blackest nights could be found at the bottom of a bottle of Lucid, and after finally tasting the stuff I have to agree. Please save your pennies people and do not buy this. Who would want to taste misery in a bottle?

review/text: These and La Torre's similar items are delicious!  You may eat them like a cookie; but enjoy them as a delicate pastry.  Should I say more?<br /><br />They are light and flaky, sweet without being tooth-hurtingly so, and will definitely make a mess on your floor or shirt.<br /><br />Answer: eat them over a plate.  Don't let a little mess stop you from enjoying these light and yummy pastries.  Check out the other varieties, too.

review/text: I have a lot of hope using this food for my dogs skin allergies and ear infections. This company has the BEST costumer service I've ever had in an online shopping experience. They had their vet talk to me about my dogs problems and help me with other ways I could help het. You need to try this for your dog if you are having constant ear infections and itchy skin. Kirby, my yellow lab, has had these problems her whole life and I just continue to pay vet bills to band aid fix her problems. This food has already reduced the itching and we have only been on it a week. It takes 12 weeks to see the full results and I'm already seeing changes. Please try this if your dog is suffering like mine was...it's a permanent fix to the problem, and I promise this company will help you every way they can to make sure you understand the product and how it works!

review/summary: My vegetable caviar!
review/text: I'm not a gourmet chef so I don't know all the terminology I would need to make this a veritable critique, but as someone who is yet to poison her family with a badly-cooked meal, I can only say this is one of those things you just have to try before you kick the bucket.<br /><br />I first tried Huitlachoche(or Cuitlacoche) some 6 years ago when a very dear friend -who is actually a chef- introduced me to this Mexican delicacy. I was amazed at the silky texture and incredible taste of this deceivingly unattractive corn truffle! I was hooked-- but like most great things in life, it would be a long time until I came across Huitlachoce again.<br /><br />Sadly, Huitlacoche is hard to find in grocery stores in South Florida, but since you can find everything short of a genuine alien on Amazon, I've been able to purchase a couple of cans.  Yes, I know; nothing beats fresh Huitlacoche. But honestly, finding fresh corn smut is going to be difficult under any circumstances.<br />So deal with it.<br /><br />Although Huitlacoche is actually good even from the can, I usually sautee finely chopped onions, garlic, cilantro and a slice or two of Jalapenos and add a dry white wine to the mix.  I then mix in the Huitlacoche and cook over slow heat for about 20 minutes.  You can have Huitlacoche with just about anything-- I served it with Parmesan Risotto and roasted lamb and got rave reviews. Mainly from my stomach- but then again, when it comes to cooking, that's our target audience.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Authentic NYC Vanilla Egg Cream
review/text: This is the real McCoy!!  Many New Yorkers insist chocolate is the only egg cream...I respectfully protest.  The favorite egg cream of my youth was vanilla, and just like its chocolate couterpart, Fox U-Bet syrup is the only way to achieve that classic taste.  I was forced to travel to stores in Baltimore for this special syrup when I lived in the Washington DC area. Now that I live in the Richmond area Baltimore was no longer an option.  Imagine my delight when I discovered that you can buy 6-packs of this delicious syrup via Amazon.  I can now make authentic egg creams at home using bottled seltzer water.  My kids also love when I squirt some vanilla flavor into their plain milk.  Now only if they could deliver hot New York pizza...I may never go back to NYC to visit.

review/text: I definitely have a "thing" for the sweet/salty combination, and this bar is AMAZING. There is only one store near me that has it, so when I run out I end up ordering it here. Let the chocolate melt on your tongue. When the salt (delicious rare expensive Fleur de Sel from France!) hits your tongue, the savory saltiness combines with the smooth sweet chocolate for the most outrageous mouthwatering flavor combination. If you have ever liked things like pretzels dipped in chocolate, or any other sweet/salt combination like salted caramel, you will LOVE this!

review/summary: Not peppermint, weak chocolate, not sweet, not creamy
review/text: I have  started experimenting with different brands of Peppermint Hot Cocoa and I started with Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa.  It was a home run.  Very peppermint, very creamy, perfectly sweet, very chocolatey, wouldn't change a thing.<br /><br />Next I tried Bellagio Peppermint Truffle hot cocoa (this one).  What a drastic difference.  The first problem is that it tastes more like Mint than Peppermint and even has a slight cooling affect to the mouth like brushing with mint toothpaste -- not something I expect or particularly desire from hot cocoa. I noted that Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa has Peppermint Oil, while this one contains merely "Artificial Flavoring".<br /><br />The second problem is that this cocoa isn't sweet.  It isn't bitter, but it was necessary to add a little sweetener to bring out any flavor, else it was just a bland hot drink with a cooling minty affect.  Even then, the mint is more detectable by the cooling affect than by actual flavor.<br /><br />The third problem is that this hot cocoa isn't creamy.  I had to add a little half-and-half to make it creamy.  In contrast, Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane hot cocoa only needed water to produce a very creamy hot cocoa -- probably because it includes Nonfat Dry Milk, while Bellagio Peppermint Truffle hot cocoa (this one) includes non-dairy creamer.<br /><br />The fourth and probably biggest issue is that this hot cocoa isn't very chocolatey, no where near as chocolatey as Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa, and this is someone who actually prefers milk chocolate to dark/rich chocolate -- i.e., it is even weak by milk chocolate standards.<br /><br />Two stars for the following: 1) attractive and convenient packaging 2) it doesn't taste bad.<br /><br />Bellagio Peppermint Truffle Hot Cocoa is Made in the USA.  Directions: add 3 tablespoons of mix to 3/4 c. hot water and stir.  I also add a little sweetener and milk or cream.

review/summary: Yummy & Great Small Gift
review/text: If someone who will remain nameless would stop eating all mine, then I wouldn't have had to get the box of 20 Chimes ginger candy tins.  But I'm glad I did.  The packaging is cute, and makes a great small gift to hand out to a co-worker having a rough day, a client when you visit, or a friend when you stop by to watch the game.  The tins are recyclable in most locations.  The individually wrapped candies are made with cane sugar and real ginger, no high fructose corn syrup so they are in a way better for you than other candy options.  Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and can settle a stomach and ease hearburn.  When's the last time your chocolate bar did that?

review/text: I got the 20 pack for stocking stuffers and casual Christmas gifts.  For about $2 a tin they are a good deal because the tins are very nice, (to me, worth about a buck each and then the candies work out to under 10 cents each.)  Nice MANDARIN orange flavor at first and then the heat kicks in with the ginger.  I'll prob reorder in the bulk bags but the tins make it great for giving gifts.  Each tin is bit smaller than a standard band-aid box with maybe 15 chews in them.  I don't know, I got to eating them and lost count. The chews are a bit smaller than the standard ginger chews you can find in Asian shops, but this is more than made up for in the natural orange flavor.

review/summary: Ritz crackers made in China!!!!!!
review/text: Where to start~~ First of all I would like to say I have always loved Ritz crackers. Secondly I believe I'm at fault by not reading the reviews before I purchased this product. With a one and one half star out of five, I should've spent time in reading the reviews and why it didn't have a better rating. No one as of yet has mentioned the fact that it's not the same Ritz cracker that you would buy in the grocery store, at least to my knowledge. This product is clearly marked "made in China". There is no information on the website I could find that said this was an imported item. Thirdly, as other reviewers have mentioned, a lot of the product (package crackers) are broken as the other reviewers have mentioned. Last but not least-the taste. To me, who've been eating Ritz crackers ever since they came out, the taste is totally different than a partial box of Ritz crackers I had in my cupboard. The only way I can describe this is more of a wheat like taste very unlike the original American made Ritz cracker. I have to say though, that Amazon.com customer service was very good about this and refunded me the money I spent as I am a person who believes in buying as much American-made product as I can. I am not a complainer and most of the items I've received from Amazon's gourmet foods have been packaged well and are as described on Amazon.com's website accurately. If you are Chinese, please do not take offense to this as most of the electronic items in my home (name brand items like Samsung etc.) are made in China or another country outside of the United States. When it comes to food however, I prefer to stick to America-made products exclusively-does that make me a bad person?.<br /> I never thought at my age ( almost 70 years old and disabled) that I would be spending time writing reviews although I'm aware that most Americans would like to know where their food is made. That's about it and good luck shopping.

review/summary: Received 6 expired K-cups, BUT....
review/text: I really LOVE the idea of this decaf sampler.  I am a new Keurig owner and a relatively new coffee drinker so I haven't tried a lot of different brands/flavors yet, and was really excited to get this sampler.  I read in other reviews that a few people received one or two expired K-cups in their sampler but because of the value and the opportunity to sample many brands I took my chances.  I was very surprised to receive SIX expired K-cups, that's 20% of my box that is undrinkable!!  Totally unacceptable to me (I would have been miffed if one or two were expired and could have lived with it-- but not six).  I hope this seller's customer service is spectacular and they make my order good.  I asked for a replacement of the six expired k-cups, and will update my review accordingly when they respond.  On the other hand, the few that I have tried were very good and am happy with the variety that was sent to me (and I double checked all of the expiration dates!  Most were 4 months out and beyond, FYI).  The packaging is sparse, they came loose in a paper bag that was stapled shut, and I'm OK with that since they are for me (I would think twice about purchasing this item if you were considering gifting it to someone).  I hope they replace the expired K-cups and maybe throw in an extra one or two to boot.  I'll probably even return to buy more if they take care of me, since I love this decaf variety so much.  More to come!!<br /><br />4/4 Update:<br />I heard back from the seller of the 30 kcup deal (Deals On Call LLC) and learned that Amazon fulfills the orders for them in the warehouse, so I contacted Amazon customer service to ask for a replacement of the 6 expired cups.  (I didn't request a return since I had already drank a couple of the cups that were within their expiration date).  As always, Amazon customer service is AWESOME. They refunded my entire purchase price and offered to send me another sampler (if I chose to repurchase) with free overnight delivery, and even sent a nice apology.  They also stated that they would review procedures for filling this order to prevent others from getting expired k-cups.  So, with that, I'm changing my review to five stars- as I said before, I love the variety and the opportunity to try so many different DECAF flavors in one purchase.  I can forgive the 'oopsy' in this case since Amazon went above and beyond to keep me happy.  Love Amazon!  Enjoy!

As a new Keurig owner, I am excited to try all the new kinds of coffee but I prefer to drink decaf coffees. This pack has a fantastic variety of coffees and flavors. There are 2-3 k-cups of every flavor/brand. Previous reviewers had mentioned finding expired k-cups in their delivery; this concerned me. When my package arrived, I carefully checked each of my k-cups' expiration dates. Every single one was not only only with in it's 'best if used by' date but many would not expire until Dec. 2012.

review/text: I was excited to try this decaf variety pack but it arrived today in brown paper bag just like the other review said. some of the k-cups were slightly squished but not broke open. I was very disappointed for 2 reasons:<br />1) The photo in the variety shows 3 of each kind of flavor/brand but my package has 7 of one, 5 of another and one or two of the other flavors. not a good "variety"<br />2) The package i received had 7 that were EXPIRED, but not just expired, 3 months out of date! That's 7 out of a 30 pack, almost a 1/3 of the package.<br />I think the company needs to re-think their idea of customer service as this seems to be an ongoing issue. I am not the first customer this has happened to and i dont think ill be the last.<br />I will be calling the company tomorrow demanding a replacement for the expired ones but to send different flavors for the missing variety ones.<br />WARNING to all future customers... CHECK THE DATES OF YOUR K-CUPS!!!<br />Not happy at all..i will never buy from them again.

review/text: I was iffy about ordering this, after reading some of the negative reviews.  Some previous customers said they received expired product, or it was poorly packaged.  This was not the case with my order.  I received a good variety of different cups,  all seem to be well within expiration date (couldn't tell for sure on some, but the ones that had a date are about 1 year out). The cups arrived in a sealed, heavy plastic bag, packed in a box.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with the value of this product.  My only small complaint is that there were a couple varieties that included 5 or 6 cups - I think they should include more types with less of each to make a better sampler.

review/summary: Not Your Typical Jerky
review/text: I am a big fan of Jack Link's jerky so when i saw this I was interested to see what the difference was.  Why was it called Matador now? Well, imagine someone took your beef jerky, ground it up, put some sauce in with it, and then molded it into little circles of meat.  This doesn't have the chew of real jerky, so it's pretty easy to work your way through a bag without noticing. This particular flavor stops being appealing after a few pieces, but it's not bad at all. I think I could safely call it fairly rich as well.<br /><br />This sells for about 6 dollars per 3 oz. bag at the store so its a fine deal to get it here.  Just know what it is before you buy it.

review/summary: overpriced due to markup
review/text: More than doubling the retail price is hoggish.  I wish Amazon exercised at least some control over resellers like this who hugely mark up products that can be bought elsewhere on the web, such as from the manufacturer.  I recommend you shop around, both to save more than 50% of the price and in order not to support resellers like this.  By the way, a similar review to this one was just removed from the website.  I guess the reseller doesn't want it to be known how much they mark this product up...

review/summary: Superb tea
review/text: I discovered this tea at a local coffee shop. This is undoubtedly the best tasting mint tea that I can recall drinking. The mint flavor is much stronger than the ordinary peppermint tea that I buy in the supermarket.<br /><br />However this is not peppermint tea, but a combination of mint flavors. The result is amazing.<br /><br />The coffee shop served a huge 16 oz cup of tea. When I finished the first cup, I asked for a refill of hot water, and there still was enough strength left in the tea bag for another great cup of tea.<br /><br />If you like mint tea that is robust, then you will love this tea.<br /><br />Note: The rating on this product has unfairly been lowered by earlier reviews complaining about the price. However, the current price on Amazon of ten dollars plus a dollar for shipping is actually less than the current price with shipping on the Mighty Leaf website.

review/summary: A much better version of the Haribo Gummi Grapefruit slices--if you like gummis with good chew
review/text: I love Haribo traditional gummis (e.g. bears, etc.), but I am not a fan of the standard grapefruit slices--they are much softer than the traditional gummi, with very little chew.<br /><br />This product is the special Kosher version of these gummis. As such, it can't contain geletin, and so the ingredients are much different. And so is the texture: These are extremely chewy (even hard when you first bite into them, then turning to a nice chew)--think certain forms of hard licorice. The flavor and appearance is the same as the traditional grapefruit slices, but these are (for me, anyway) much preferable.

review/text: There are four cats in my household, which means there are four litter boxes.  Before I started using Stink Free, we lived with unpleasant odors emanating from the boxes and permeating the house, despite all our best efforts.  It made no difference that we cleaned the litter boxes daily.  We use the spray every day on the inside of the litter boxes after cleaning, and it has completely eliminated the odor problem.  I strongly recommend this product for cat owners.

review/summary: The ONLY litter box deodorizer to use!
review/text: This product is the BEST, and ONLY, litter box deodorizer to use! I no longer need two different products, one for spraying on the sides to create a non-stick coating, and one for sprinkling on top of the litter to deodorize the joint. This product does it all, and it does it better than all the other products I have used. Spray this on the sides and bottom of the box to create a non-stick barrier which dries almost instantly, unlike the other product I have used. Use this instead of those powdered products in shaker-type boxes to deodorize the top of the litter. Stink Free dries instantly, and the cats don't seem to mind, or notice, this product on top of their litter. I had had problems with the other litter deodorizer products in the past. Some cats just don't like the fragrance or crystals that are put into the powdered products in the shaker-type boxes. We adopted a cat colony we inherited when we moved to an acreage almost 5 years ago, one cat at a time, so I have had more experience than a previously sane person should have with cats and their litter box behaviours. It's a cast of characters, with some really bad actors, but Stink Free litter spray has been accepted by all of them.

review/text: This is meant to cover up urine and stool smells, and I am all for that!  Just be aware that it is actually spraying powder-smells like baby powder, and it is not good to breath in. Keep kitties and face away for spraying and let it settle before you come back. Best use for this is to "season" a new little box--fills in porous areas to prevent nasties from sinking into plastic litter boxes.

By the way the price here is outrageous, they are way cheaper at Marshals and TJ MAX.

review/text: I made it through one bag of these before the typical unconditional happiness of finding another gluten-free option wore off.  These are not quite brownies, more like cookies - though certainly not hard in texture, they are somewhat crumbly, not moist and fudgy.  I found them too sweet (may make your teeth hurt and give you a bit of a buzz if you are susceptible to this), and the chocolate not rich enough.  Some people may appreciate a relatively lower fat product, but if I'm gonna go for some junk, I want it to be rich and delicious and not skimp on mouthfeel and flavor.  Better as a topping or something to nibble on, than as a full-fledged dessert.

review/text: The best coffeehouse in the USA is Caribou Coffee. That's just an opinion, but an opinion I'd challenge anyone to test. When I go to the Mall of the Americas in Minnesota, the first place I stop is the Caribou Coffee shop. I don't like Starbucks coffee at all, and usually look for any alternative.<br />Buying these Caribou coffee pods aren't up to the in house experience, but still enjoyable (not as good as grinding and brewing your own with their blend either). This coffee pod is filled (possibly overfilled) so it's not a wimpy coffee at all. If you're looking for a great strong coffee on the mild side Daybreak may be a good option for you. My best advice is to wait till it's shipped and sold by Amazon for the best price, but if that isn't an option, you may want to get your caffeine fix with an alternative seller.

review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household.  Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee.  With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings.  I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick.  Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma.  And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments.  This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop.  It goes great with a little skim milk, too.  A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us.  So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly).  Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it.  It's my new go-to k cup!

review/text: I love this coffee, it's totally delicious at 6am - first sip of the day, first feeling washing over you that it's time to wake up.  It's smooth, not bitter, and makes me say AHHHH...every single time.  Want to be upfront that I'm more a medium, light, and flavored coffee drinker so I'm not sure the dark roast fans will get that same feeling.  Packaging was fine, none of the cups were damaged in shipping.

I've recently been hooked on Tully's Kona Blend because I can get it locally at reasonable prices.

review/summary: My favorite K-Cup coffee
review/text: Taste is a personal choice and I prefer light roast coffees. My favorite brand is Peets, but until Peets gets into the K-Cup market this will have to do. This brew is light and not bitter, however I do detect a slight, stale flavor. However this stale flavor is common in nearly all ground coffee, including the tail end of a bag of my beloved Peets coffee. I also taste a sweet note in the coffee that counteracts the typical bitter notes, potentially allowing me to drink a cup without any adjunct sweeteners or milk. This has happened when I run out of milk (cow, soy or almond) and I just don't feel like using aspartame (Nutrasweet).

review/text: This is the first K-cup I've found that has a real coffee-house flavor.  It's not weak tasting like a lot of other brands, but it's not bitter, either.  I've been drinking San Francisco Bay pods for a while, and they're great, but Caribou Coffee Daybreak will probably be a regular addition to my coffee rotation.

review/text: My current preference in coffees is more towards milder brews...especially at the start of a day. Daybreak morning blend gives me what I need in that first morning coffee: a definitive coffee taste, the caffeine kickstart, and the reassuring coffee smell that lets you know another day has started...<br /><br />It does so without being overpowering or bitter. I also enjoy this in the evening while reading, watching TV or sitting around and talking. You get what you need from a cup, but in moderation.<br /><br />Highly recommended for your K-Cup rotation of flavors...

review/summary: Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than Caribou's signature blend, along comes Daybreak!
review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household. Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee. With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings. I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick. Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma. And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments. This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop. It goes great with a little skim milk, too. A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us. So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly). Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it. It's my new go-to k cup!

review/text: My fiance and I dont seem to like the dark roast coffees and medium roast k cups (except for the Dunkin Donuts one) that much so when we say this at the grocery store and saw that it was a  light blend that we hadn't tried yet we figured why not. We are glad we did.<br /><br />This coffee smells so good when it is brewing so we knew that was a good sign when we made it later that night after we got home shopping. Then we tried it and basically fell in love with it and don't drink anything else now in the mornings. We do have an iced coffee that is different on the weekend but that's another review.<br /><br />I highly recomend this coffee to anyone who like us feels that the bold and medium roasts are just too strong. This isn't at all and is just an all around very good tasting coffee.

I typically use the travel mug setting and drink it black, but it still tastes great using smaller cup settings. I find that a lot of other k-cups taste a little too strong, but these are very good!
