review/summary: Tastes like Grape Flinstones Chewable Vitamins
review/text: This is for the white can Rock Star. While drinkable, this drink has a chalky aftertaste and a fairly wretched flintsones grape vitamin taste. If you like chewable flintstones grape vitamins and a chalky aftertaste, you'll love Rockstar Zero Carb Energy Drink.<br /><br />Not to my taste.

review/summary: Good, and Bad
review/text: Before I largely stopped drinking energy drinks, these were two of the products i drank a lot of.<br /><br />Overall pros: cheaper than redbull<br />Overall cons: still an expensive habit<br /><br />BLUE CAN, 4 stars:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Interesting/good taste.  It has a very, very fruity taste, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other energy drinks, but could kind of become too sweet/overpowering when I drank too many of these.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Compared to other energy drinks, I do not think that this goes well with alcohol (vodka) at all.  So for normal usage, it's a solid drink, for a redbull/vodka substitute, this wasn't it, for me.<br /><br />WHITE CAN, 2 stars:<br /><br />Pros: Most tolerable when mixed with alcohol.<br /><br />Cons: This is the drink that i think has the most stereotypical awful energy drink/diet taste compared to anything else i've ever had.  It just tastes so artificial and chemical-like.  Why did I even buy this drink in the first place? for a while, it was the only diet energy drink in my university's cafeteria.<br /><br />Conclusion:  I drank hundreds of these over the past 5 or so years until finally pretty much kicking my energy drink habit and switching to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>.  I kind of miss drinking energy drinks, but 30 cents/pill vs. $2+ per drink was worth it for me... and I'll still splurge on a Lo-Carb Monster occasionally.

review/text: Caffeine isn't an upper for me, but it's a nice calmative beverage.  I can't have sugar.  So I enjoy sugar free energy drinks.  Rockstar Zero-Carb has a nice berry tea flavor too it.  It's a flavor I can live with, unlike a lot of other drinks.  I can't tell you about the buzz level, since I don't get a buzz, but a can of this will completely knock out any caffeine headache...LOL.  It's got more caff than the Sugar Free.<br /><br />Individual cans are not cost effective.  I was having trouble finding a lot of sugar free energy drinks in my area, and when I did, the prices were high.  I was thrilled to find Amazon had them at good prices... WITH FREE SHIPPING!?!?  Holy cow!  I can get a heavy case of soda shipped to my door for nada?  Now that REALLY rocks!  I don't know how they do it.  The first one came FedEx..LOL.  For free.  And fast, too!<br /><br />I've been an Amazon customer since... yikes, I don't remember the year.  Pretty much since they first opened.  Back when they used to send all their customers Christmas gifts.<br /><br />Rock on!

review/text: At times I wish this weren't an energy drink because I love the way it tastes and I'd like to drink it without the energy effects such as at night. I'm also sure it would be less expensive if it weren't marketed as an energy drink. In any case, I love the taste and it gets me going in the morning sometimes when I'm dragging. It's certainly the best tasting energy drink I've had. If you've tried the non-juiced Rockstar drinks, don't judge this by those. They taste nasty by comparison.

review/summary: Bait and switch!
review/text: Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products.

review/text: I'm very skeptical about energy drinks, mostly because of a possible caffeine addiction. I haven't tried too many (never tried Red Bull, so really...not that many :p), but this one is great. Granted, there is a lot of sugar in it (40ish grams) PLUS artificial sweetner to make a really sweet drink. But I like the taste, and I too find it refreshing. I drink Juiced Guava maybe once a week to enjoy and it perks me up but not as much as coffee does to the point I get jittery.

review/summary: New formula is absurd!
review/text: When I found out Rockstar Juiced recently changed its formula to 10% juice, I was heartbroken. I instantly fell in love with the drink when it first came out. Its 70% juice formula was to die for. When they changed it to 50% juice, I was a little disappointed since the drink seemed a little unhealthier. However, since the difference in taste was minuscule and since 50% juice is better than no juice, I let it slide. The new Rockstar Juiced is disgusting. It is packed with more sugar and calories compared to the old version and the difference in taste is very noticeable. The after feeling I got from drinking the new one was very uneasy and unsatisfying. I was an avid drinker of Rockstar Juiced. I drank at least one per day, sometimes two. I will now have to revert back to coffee & redbull. At least I am not completely heartbroken since some of my local grocery stores still carry the 50% version. But once they are completely out, goodbye Rockstar Juiced. I will miss you.

review/summary: New reduced juices from 70 to 50% and now 10% YUK!
review/text: We drank the new reduced juice unknowingly and thought yuk what's up with this did we get a bad batch? I searched the new can, knowing it appeared simular but could not find the 10% as it was cleverly hidden in the back. I then went to my recycle bin for an old can and compared. No longer proudly displayed on the front 50% real juice. I have justified this expensive,tasty and addictive treat for years and alloted 1 per family member per day. Now this case is going back and we are done with Rockstar until they bring back the higher real juice formula. I even had a stomach reaction to this one and I tend to have a goat gut. Bad taste bad product change and pissed that they reduce the juice keeping the price the same 2-3.00 per can, another misguided by greed rogue corporation. Now I cannot help but wonder if that blogger that rants that Rockstar is owned by Nazi's has some credibility. My wife really resented the fact that the new packaging was predominently identical to the old decieving her into purchasing a product she did not want or like.Back it all goes.

review/text: Been drinking Rockstar Juiced since it came out. I hardly noticed the 70% to 50% change in their formula, but the new 10% forumla is horrible.  Where Rockstar was once the best energy drink out there, this change in formula will easily put the other energy drinks with juice on top. Hope Rockstar sales plummit and they can see their mistake and make the change now.

review/summary: Quite possibly the greatest drink ever!
review/text: I bought this back a while ago, and I'm still reaping the benefits of drinking this miraculous beverage.  I feel more alert, my social life has improved, and my urine has a wonderful neon yellow hue.<br /><br />Even though it is sealed quite nicely in it's case, after you are able to remove the can, you may want to cool down your energy drink.  My preference was to put the cans in my refrigerator, but you could get a similar effect by setting the cans in a snow bank, or by using ice cubes in a glass to cool the drink down.  My first problem came when I was ready to drink the Diet Rockstar(tm).  I looked at the can and was perplexed as to how to open it up, until I noticed this clever "tab" at the top that would pop open a perfect sized drinking hole to use.<br /><br />Once I opened it up, I quickly poured the entire contents of the Diet Rockstar(tm) into my mouth and then swallowed it.  I had heard of people not caring for the last few drops of a warmed can, so I figured that it would be best to drink it before it had the opportunity to warm up.  What a great decision that was!  Shortly afterwards I felt a burst of energy surge through my body and I was more productive then I have ever been in my life.  Normally I would take a 8:30am nap at work, but not today.  Was was ready to work and to get everything completed in a orderly fashion.  However, a problem soon surfaced as there was no more work to do for a few hours and I had all this energy to burn off.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and would suggest that everyone purchase as much as you can.  This drink will change your life and make you complete all of your activities with ease.

review/text: I have this low-sugar oatmeal several times a week.  It's got good fiber without being pastey -- and best of all, it's not so cloyingly sweet as the other instant oatmeals.  I'm guessing<br />Quaker uses the sugar in their regular instants to entice children to eat oatmeal (it makes the oatmeal more like eating a cupcake or a pop-tart,) but I always go for the addition of more fruit over more sugar.<br /><br />And well done Amazon for always having fresh stock on hand.  My local market (out here in the middle of the desert nowhere) must get their stock from an un-air-conditioned warehouse that buys palettes and lets them sit for 2-3 years at a time.  Theirs never stays fresh past the first week or two -- while a box I misplaced from Amazon was still perfectly fresh when I found it 3 months later.<br />(applause)

review/text: I sampled all four of the PB Crave flavors at a Food Day event. I purchased the Co Co Bananas flavor and the Cookie Nookie flavor. The banana one is great, a rich natural-tasting peanut butter with added bananas, honey and cocoa. Saves you the time of having to cut up bananas to jazz up your peanut butter sandwich. This premium peanut butter is great on whole wheat toast.

The scones produced are great and bound to be a hit with everyone-perfect item for a tea party or just because you feel like whipping up a batch of scones on the spur of the moment! Get the Nordic scone pan to really ensure perfection. You will need to add additional liquid when using it and there are directions for that on the mix bag.Enjoy!

review/text: I lived in Hawaii many years as a kid and went in search of Li Hing Mui when I got older. It's surprisingly hard to find out side of a few select Chinese communities.  I ordered the Jade brand from Hawaii a few times and enjoyed it, but even that got hard to find. Thought I'd give Kaj's sweet red a try.  In fairness, there are many different types of Li Hing Mui, this one just wasn't to my taste. Also beware, the shipping cost on these products tends to be very high.

review/summary: Outstanding coffee with the smoothest of flavor
review/text: After having experienced the varied, horrible dark...and even darker roasts of coffee that are now widely popular because of Starbucks, I thought I had somehow lost my taste for coffee over the years. Literally, many of the iced coffees at Starbucks taste what I imagine dirty sink water would taste like with all the fermentation and settling. In a nutshell, it seemed like every cup I experienced was more and more bitter with headache-inducing, cringe-worthy bite upon each sip-----the kind of bite that no amount of cream or sweetener can undo.<br /><br />Well, lo' and behold, my grandmother had spoken of how great coffee/chicory blends taste.  Having never experienced chicory or a coffee/chicory blend for that matter, I dismissed  the suggestion as yet another bizarre coffee variation a la the many flavored roasts that are so popular these days. While at my local grocery store, I decided to take the plunge and venture away from the Folger's, Dunkin' Donuts, and Starbucks varieties. Upon the first taste of this coffee, I was hooked.  It is as smooth as can be with no bitterness whatsoever. It is as if someone took the smoothness of hot cocoa and infused it with the best elements of coffee flavor.  Taken black or with milk and sweetener, the flavor handily beats any of the overpriced competitors. And, in all of this, you will find no sharpness, bitterness or ripe bluntness that is so evident in many of today's "scorched" roasts.<br /><br />Please try this if you yearn for good coffee.  This product will reacquaint you with what your taste buds have been missing for so long.  Luzianne makes an excellent iced tea, and this product is proof that they can do equally as well with coffee.<br /><br />Try it!!:)  You won't regret it.

review/summary: Delicious coffee
review/text: My local supermarket no longer carries Luzianne coffee. I am glad to purchase it from Amazon. Very convenient shipping.  This is the only canned coffee that has flavor. It stays fresh and flavorful to the end.  I use this coffee to make boiled coffee on my electric stove.  I combine cold filtered water and coffee together(6 oz. water per cup to one measure of coffee) into a pot. I use an old stove-top percolator without the inside strainer assembly. Bring to a boil. When the coffee boils take the pot off the burner and turn off the heat. This is to prevent the coffee from boiling over the pot onto the stovetop. Put pot back on the burner and let simmer slowly for at least 3 minutes. An electric burner stays hot even after it is turned off and that's how you "simmer" a pot of coffee. The coffee can simmer for 5 minutes for a stronger brew. Take coffee off the stove. It is ready to serve but I strain it first to get out the coffee grounds. Old-time recipes call for an egg shell to be added to hold back the coffee grounds but I omit the egg shell. You can then pour the brewed coffee into a carafe or put it back into a cleaned out pot and leave it on the stove on a warm setting.  Boiling for a short time really brings out the flavor. Great for camping too.<br /><br />Hope Amazon will continue to sell this brand of coffee.

review/summary: Really Surprisingly Good Baked P-Chips! MMmm!
review/text: I'd pretty much given up on baked potato chips cause I hate that funky texture that, for instance, the Lays one has.<br /><br />Since I really love the organic Kettle Chips in chipotle flavor, I decided to give these a go. I got the lightly salted first, and the texture was great. They were very nearly like regular. (A very minimal difference). Crispy, potato-y. Nice.<br /><br />I then ordered these, and I love them. Much tastier than the somewhat bland "lightly salted" regular ones. They're sweet and smoky. A very nice barbecue flavor, I have to admit.<br /><br />I really hope they make the chipotle flavor in baked (and organic). I'd buy those in a heartbeat.<br /><br />So, for folks looking for a non-fried potato chip alternative (great for brown bagging lunch, four servings to a bag makes them more economical), I recommend the Kettle Bakes. Very good product.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: The BEST! Kettle Baked Cheddar Chips
review/text: My husband and I went to Kauai  in Feb. of this year and we tried these chips for the first time. And my husband started a saying then "an opened bag of these chips is and empty bag of these chips"  and once we came home we could not find them anywhere. No store around our town of Grand Junction Colorado carried the baked cheddar chips. So I looked to Amazon and there they were. So now we have them available and we will order more. Yesterday we had sandwiches for lunch and as my husband ate the last few chips and crumpled the bag up he said" an opened bag of chips is an empty bag and he laughed. They really are good tasting chips whether a person is watching their calorie intake or not. We will buy them again!

review/summary: Fantastic ! Best baked potato chip ever.
review/text: These potato chips are absolutely the best baked potato chip I have ever tried.  They are so good that my husband and son will also eat them.  In fact, my college-aged son says he prefers these over the greasy regular potato chip.  With 65% less fat and baked, they are a healthy alternative to regular potato chips.  We got the lightly salted because husband is watching his blood pressure and these are perfect with just a touch of sea salt on them.  Sodium is lower than Lays baked and the taste is much better.  These look and taste like real potato chips, unlike Lays Baked which don't even look real.  Highly recommend these.

review/text: I have been a fan of the Kettle Bakes for a long time now.  They truly are the best chips available anywhere.  In my opinion they are far better in every way than any brand of fried potato chips, not counting Fritos, which aren't potato chips anyway.  I don't see how they could really be improved.  The crunch is fantastic, the flavor is fantastic, and you sacrifice nothing but greasy fingers!  I have tried every flavor, and my favorite is definitely the Aged White Cheddar, but you won't see me turn my back from the BBQ, or the Lightly Salted.  The Salt and Pepper flavor is a bit peppery, so if you like that then you'll like them, and I even eat them sometimes.  The Salt and Vinegar doesn't work for me, but then I'm not a fan of vinegar potato chips anyway.<br /><br />Just buy these, please, any flavor that tickles your fancy.<br />And then you can thank me later.<br />=)

If this matters to you like it matters to me, stipulate that you receive the Lightly Salted version ONLY.

I was going to have them delivered every six months.  When I got my first order I got seasalted chips instead of lightly.  I called about it and they put through another order at no charge to me.  Second order again wrong chips.  So I called and cancelled automatic delivery.  The chips are good except they are a little too hard and hard on my gums.  Also too salty for me.  The above should have read (lightly salted)<br /><br />I have to admit though that I do like the chips because they are lower fat and may order again.  I just wish I could have gotten lightly salted ones.  "Thank you.  Irene Zalonski (zalonski @sbcglobal.net)

review/summary: not too salty and not greasy
review/text: If you're a big potato chip fan, you might find these a little unusual because they are baked.  I personally am not big on the greasiness that most potato chips have, so I actually prefer a baked chip like this.  I also like that these chips have a little less salt than most chips, so the potato flavor really comes through.<br /><br />Let's face it:  a potato chip is never going to be a truly healthy snack.  Even without the extra fat that comes from frying and without the excess salt, a chip is still a bunch of simple carbohydrates.  If you can control yourself and not scarf down bags at a time, however, this is a reasonable indulgence to add to your diet on occasion.

review/summary: Disappointed with Freshness Date
review/text: My husband and I are on Weight Watchers and eat these chips frequently because they are much lower in fat than regular chips. One serving is equal to 2 Weight Watchers points (old point system). It seems that the local stores are always out of them so I ordered through Amazon, but was disappointed in the freshness date. All 15 bags had a freshness date of August 11, which was much too close to the date ordered. The ones I bought at the grocery store in June had a freshness date of October. Although we eat these almost daily, we won't be able to consume 15 bags by August 11, and did not want to be bothered with the hassle of returning them.

review/summary: Best. Baked. Chips. Ever.
review/text: These chips are amazing.  Though baked (i.e., much healthier than regular chips), they have a great and thick crunch to them.  The ingredients list is also pleasantly short:  potatoes, safflower/sunflower oil, and sea salt.  It's rare to find such a high-quality pre-packaged product these days.  Only real negative is price, but buying on Amazon helps in that regard.

review/summary: Buy These Chips -- They're Excellent
review/text: Kettle brand Baked Potato Chips are the best baked chips I have ever eaten.  They are real sliced potatoes (unlike some brands that are "compressed" chips).  They only have 3g of fat and 135mg of sea salt per 1 oz. serving but you can't tell that by their taste.  I have trouble finding them in my local stores, so this is a great way to buy them at an excellent price and keep extra bags on hand.

review/summary: Good flavor without the guilt
review/text: These chips have some of the best barbecue flavor of any chip without all the grease. The texture is a little hard, so sometimes if I get a thick chip it hurts my teeth. But the taste is worth it!  The irregularity of the size and shape of the chips tells you that they're real, not something created in a lab. Plus through Amazon I save almost 50% off the grocery store price!<br /><br />I just wish Amazon carried the baked salt and vinegar flavor. It exists, but is not easy to find. I manage to snag some every few months or so but at almost $4 a bag I can't really stock up the way I could if they were available through Amazon.

review/summary: So delicious!
review/text: Yum, yum, yum! These baked chips are so delicious I keep forgetting they're baked. They taste like thick fried kettle chips. My husband prefers lightly salted chips, and he was thrilled with these. We only have a couple bags left and will order more when they go on sale again. My only complaint is that they're a tad pricey.<br /><br />In case you're wondering how big a 4 oz bag of chips is, the bags are in-between the larger bags you usually find at the supermarket and the small individual serving bags you might get at a sub shop. The nutritional info says each bag contains four servings. Well, of course, that depends on your appetite and restraint, but I'd say it's more like a two-serving bag.  :)<br /><br />I received the chips on August 30, and the expiration date is December 14... So I wouldn't order these if you don't think you'll eat them within a few months. Not a problem in our house!

review/summary: Baked, and not faked!
review/text: Well, baked potato chips have finally gone mainstream after years of being some obscure brand in the store that you bring home and just try to eat while they crumble in your hand and taste bland while they're doing it.<br /><br />Now some of the big national snack companies have "baked" chips, but why are they shaped like hexagons?  Some of those baked chips from national manufacturers look like the result of some mad scientist experiment.<br /><br />Not these!  These look like somebody sliced up potato and baked it in such a way that they still hold their structural integrity when the process is complete.  They're crispy just like traditional potato chips and the seasoning is balanced just right.  Once I get through this box I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.

review/summary: delicious and nutritious!
review/text: Kettle's hickory honey BBQ chips are fantastic! There are a lot of snacks on the market that are supposedly healthier alternatives to their full-fat counterparts, but in my experience, reducing the "bad stuff" usually causes similar reductions in taste and quality. Moreover, in cutting out the fat, almost every snack adds artificial sweeteners, fillers, preservatives, or fat substitutes, nearly all of which can be health concerns for consumers. (For example, any product with sucralose/Splenda in it makes me extremely ill!)<br /><br />However, with Kettle's chips, consumers can easily identify all of the ingredients in the package, and in the baked chips, you can essentially eat an entire bag for about the same amount of fat you'll find in a single serving of most other brands of chips. Even better, the BBQ flavor is really great in these chips, ensuring that your snack is really satisfying and truly filling your cravings. I love the fact that more salty snack options are appearing on the market, and I hope that Kettle continues its trend of producing simple, healthy, and absolutely tasty products. I guarantee that chip lovers will not be disappointed by this yummy offering...

review/summary: Weird after-taste for me (try one bag before you buy a box)
review/text: I bought a box of these baked barbeque Kettle brand chips from Amazon in somewhat larger-sized bags, because they came so highly recommended by other reviewers, but I really don't care for them at all (though other people to whom I've offered them  munch through them quite happily, and are pleased to take the rest of the bag home with them when I make the offer).  I can only conclude that individual palates may respond very differently to these particular chips.<br /><br />So, if you've bought a bag of Kettle's baked chips in this particular flavor recently in your local grocery store and found them quite tasty, you'll probably be quite happy with buying these by the box-full from Amazon.<br /><br />However, if you haven't yet tried them, do NOT invest in a multi-bag shipment until you first discover whether or not these particular chips appeal to your particular palate.<br /><br />I'm busy giving away every bag I bought, because I developed a distaste for them after eating the first few chips from the first bag I opened (which I ended up throwing away half-full).  But my dislike for these baked barbecue-flavor chips from Kettle brand (whose other, 'full-fat' chips I've almost always relished) is definitely a minority opinion among my friends and neighbors, so far.

review/text: Considering these are baked, they are very tasty.  They are super crispy and taste like fried goodness, but without the oiliness.  The only bad thing I have to say is that these are supposed to be "lightly" salted but I still found them overly salty (that's why I only gave it 3 stars). I actually found the Baked Salt & Malt Vinegar ones less salty than these. So for those watching their sodium intake or don't like things too salty, then you may want to consider the other flavors.
