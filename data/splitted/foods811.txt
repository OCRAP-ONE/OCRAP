review/summary: Make Your Own Coffee Creamer
review/text: Torani sugar free syrup mixed with regular liquid coffee creamer makes a great low-cost, low calorie flavored creamer. It only takes about 4oz per quart of creamer to make creamer about half the price of those high priced coffee creamers.

review/summary: Cats like it and delicious
review/text: It was hard for our cats to get over their fancy feast addiction but this helped a lot!  I went through newmans own which they didn't like much, organix they didn't like much, one food from zealand which I didn't like (the smell).  So this was the winner.  They still didn't like it as much as fancy feast but since they have gotten over their addiction they scarf this stuff down in seconds and beg for more.  Plus it isn't too expensive and is healthy for them.

review/summary: Chicken and Catfish
review/text: I purchased this Lick your Chops Delicacy in the Chicken and Catfish flavor. The ingredient list sounded like a "to die for" mix of things that my kitties would like. When the case arrived and I opened the first can, I was appalled. It looked like your average cheepo catfood. It is a "pate" type formulation with everything ground together and molded into the can. My 4 cats get 7, three oz cans per night for their dinner rations. Needless to say, Dinner is an exciting time at my house. But I put this pate in the bowl with a sinking hear. I figured that I had just bought a case that would end up with the recsue kitties as a donation.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surpirised. The first night the kitties had this, the entire bowl was eaten, so the ingredients and taste must be good, though they are indistinguishable! The second night I put this out, about an eigth of the can remained at the end of the day. I had given this choice on consecutive days. My kitties are quite spoiled and ONLY a FEW things will be eaten two nights in a row.<br /><br />So I waited a week, and, sure enough, the third can was eaten in its entirety. So I give this four stars. I try to give 5 only to the foods they will eat everyday, everytime. So, If I have to strectch out the offerings, I only give 4 stars. My kitties agree and say "thank you" from Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty.

review/summary: Love this syrup!
review/text: I'm trying to watch my weight (ain't doing well, but....) and I like things sweetened with Splenda best, so this syrup is great for me.  I used the subscription plan to get 3 bottles a month sent to me with a small discount applied.  I go through it faster than I thought I would!<br /><br />I like that it comes in plastic bottles, instead of glass like other brands....so I just throw them into our recycling bin when I'm done.<br /><br />I bought it to pretty much just use in coffee, but I'm more often than not making delicious sugar-free vanilla sodas with seltzer.  Tastes great, no cals, and no tooth decay....yay!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC">Torani Sugar-Free Syrup,  Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />Edit: 5/15/11<br /><br />Well, I really loved this syrup when it was $14.85 for a 3 pack using Subscribe & Save.  Then it went up to $17.20, and now it's $22.82, which is really irritating to me.  Especially when the other sugar-free flavors are a lot less than the vanilla now.  So I switched to DaVinci for $14.75 for a 3-pack.  I hope I like it as much!

review/text: I generally don't like sugar free syrups as they generally taste little like their counterparts.  However, this vanilla variety is an exception.  In a latte or other coffee based drink, it is nearly indistinguishable from the normal kind and it sweet drinks, I cannot tell the difference.

review/summary: Good way to wean yourself off sugar...
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee and ergo use a lot of sugar, but am trying to cut sugar out of my diet.  Although I will use Splenda, I am not fond of the aftertaste.  I've tried Truvia too, which also has an aftertaste.  I guess since none of these sugar substitutes are really sugar, they're all going to have an aftertaste.  So while this product is no different, the slight vanilla flavor helps to either cut down on the aftertaste or distracts your tastebuds from it.  One downside is that the bottle goes quickly for hardcore coffee drinkers, which probably more expensive than just straight Splenda.  Overall, I think it's a good alternative to sugar and would recommend it to those who are trying to cut down on sugar consumption.

review/summary: Excellent flavor, made in the USA!
review/text: Torani Sugar-Free syrups are some of the best in the business. This makes an excellent flavor addition to both smoothies and coffee and it tastes just like the full sugar versions. What makes it even easier to use is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W09XZG">Torani and Davinci syrup pump</a>. According to my favorite barista at Starbucks, a venti takes 5-6 squirts, although I think I normally use only a couple of squirts to obtain the perfect flavor for my smaller cups of coffee made at home. Amazon grocery currently sells 3 flavors of Torani Sugar Free syrups, Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Caramel, 25.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3), Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Hazelnut, 25.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3), and this syrup. Since Torani currently makes 27 different Sugar Free flavors, it would be nice if through Amazon they would offer a combo pack of 4 flavors, or just make more flavors available on Amazon. I really enjoy this syrup and have tried other brands, but always come back to Torani. I was pleased to see this available as a auto-ship item at Amazon and will be buying many more bottles through the Subscribe & Save program.<br /><br />I would love to see Peppermint, Vanilla Bean, and Irish Cream flavors added. These also make excellent Italian sodas, and dozens of drink recipes can be found at the Torani web site.<br /><br />Update: I'm pleased to see that Amazon has added 3 new sugar free flavors:<br /><br />Torani Sugar Free Raspberry, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)<br />Torani Sugar Free Chocolate, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)<br />Torani Sugar Free Irish Cr&iquest;me, 25.4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)<br /><br />Great price, too! Better than my grocer.

review/text: Torani's" Sugar Free Vanilla Flavor Syrup", is a nice way to add a little variety to your coffee, without having to run out to a Starbuck's. As I mentioned in the title, there are no calories, fats, carbs or sugars. The taste is very sweet and vanillery, and you can use it in anything you want to add a little variety or flavor. I like it in my Pellegrino. Makes a nice Vanilla Soda. In my coffee, I found I did not have to add anything else. The syrup was good enough and tasty enough on it's own.I use it whenever I get a sweet tooth to get me past a craving for something with more calories involved.<br /><br />It is sweetened with "Splenda", and if you are not used to using Sugar substitutes, you may not like the little bit of an after taste it leaves. Otherwise - consider this a 5 star product!<br /><br />Ingrediants as listed are:<br />Purified Water, Vanilla Extract With Other Natural Flavors, Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Sorbate (to Preserve Freshness), Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum, Sucralose (Splenda Brand), and Acesulfame Potassium.<br /><br />It's a bargain as sold here compared with my supermarket per bottle. I'll probably use one to two tablespoons per drink.(more or less depending on the drink) You'll get your money's worth. Add it to anything you want, hot chocolate, iced tea, etc. Maybe with the holiday's coming, it would be a nice change in other beverages as well. It is also sold with sugar added,and there are several other flavors with or without sugar, just click on other products by Torani at top of page. .<br /><br />Cheers....Laurie

review/text: I was purchasing this Torani sugar free syrup at my local grocers.  I love the taste for my home made iced coffee.  My grocer decided to discontinue carrying this product. Thank Goodness or I never would have known I was paying way too much there!  I paid $5 for a bottle half the size of ONE of the bottles included here!  This 3 pack is a great value for a super yummy item.  Thanks Amazon!

review/text: Decided to try a small bottle from the store & once I blew through it in less than a week I decided to go ahead & get the Amazon deal. My husband & I drink coffee everyday, this syrup (& the caramel) are fabulous for flavoring coffee one those days when you want to feel fancy & pampered. I was afraid the artificial sweetener would give it a chemical aftertaste - but not at all. It's an inexpensive luxury, both in cash & calories.

Sometimes it is difficult to find drinks that have that extra special flavor sometimes--but this is a great way to add to the ordinary diet coke.  It is easiest to add to 16 or 20 ounce bottles.

review/summary: Just Like Starbucks's SFVanilla!
review/text: Just over a year ago we decided that it would make a lot of sense (financial and otherwise) to cut down on the number of Starbucks drinks that we purchased on a daily basis. I did a bit of searching online and came across some recipes for making our own drinks --- and many recommended this syrup.<br /><br />My wife particularly likes sugar-free vanilla, non-fat lattes and they're surprisingly easy to make. We use a 16 ounce cup, two shots of espresso, 3 tablespoons of this SFV and fill the rest with steamed milk. Truly --- she says she either can't tell a difference from Starbucks or that (gasp!) the homemade variety tastes better!<br /><br />We've probably saved well over $1000 this past year by doing this and this syrup really is the cornerstone of the drink.<br /><br />Pro tip: sign up for the automatic renewal and buy this stuff several at a time. If you run out and have to reorder, you can easily end up spending $20 on Sbux drinks while you're waiting for the UPS truck to show. :-)

review/summary: A sugar free alternative for your morning coffee
review/text: Trying to cut back on sugar hasn't been easy and so far hasn't been too successful for me.  But if I can incorporate a few items into my daily routine I figure it helps, which is why I purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2RC">Torani Syrup, Sugar-Free Vanilla</a>.  I drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day and normally add a spoonful or two of brown sugar with my cream, but now I've started using this syrup. Although I can tell that its sugar free it has a more pleasing taste than other artificial sweeteners I've tried.  I've also found a little goes a long way.  By the way I purchased this on Subscribe & Save and it was worth that pricing in my opinion.

review/summary: Perfect for low carb dieters
review/text: One of the big challenges of the low-carb diet regime is finding substitute products that are low on sugar and carbohydrates, but taste reasonably and function "as expected" in recipes. Well, Torani delivers on both counts, and the vanilla works wonderfully in espresso drinks and desserts. It's actually hard to tell the product is sugar-free, since it doesn't have the aftertaste you would associated with a sugar-free sweetener.<br /><br />I think you'd be hard-pressed to beat the price on Amazon (I found the same product in retail for twice the price). Although we've been used the vanilla quite frequently, the 3-pack looks like it's going to take a long, long time to use up - it really doesn't take much syrup to infuse the flavor. Finally, in terms of packaging, the bottles are plastic which definitely affords them better protection in the mail too.

review/text: Never in my life have I had so many uses for this product.  You cannot imagine all of its wonderful uses.  I find myself using it to enhance the flavor of everything.  I started out using it in Sparkling Water.  And the next thing I new I was adding a dash to this and a dash to that and now I have used one and a half bottles and this morning I was thinking...Now you ONLY have ONE bottle left, maybe I need to put my order in for more.  I have frozen raw cranberries and this morning I put some in a blender and added a couple of drops of Stevia and a dash of my Torani and then I added that to my Sparking Water and OMG!!!  Simply divine.  I was JUST thinking to myself...I don't think I can live without this stuff.  I put it in a blend of Almond/Coconut milk with a little Stevia and you can make a wonderful low fat/low cal milk shake with a few ice cubes.  If  you are trying to watch calories or sugar intake this product will help you to prevent feeling like you are being penalized.  So I encourage you to take a chance if you are looking for this type of product.  In my opinion, I do not think you will have any regrets. :-))) I have even thought about making a food goody bag and giving this as one of the gifts in it.  And once you get on a creative roll you will realize that you are GLAD you got the 3 bottle deal.  Now I would not even consider just buying one bottle at a time.  LOL!!!

review/summary: Not bad, but don't love it
review/text: I bought the Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla Syrup so I could make homemade diet cream soda.  I absolutely LOVED the Canfield's/Graf's Diet Swiss Creme soda, and have been craving it since they stopped making it several years ago.  Because this syrup had gotten such good reviews and the 3-pack price was good on Amazon, I ordered the pack and couldn't wait for it to arrive.  I bought a couple 2-liter bottles of carbonated water in anticipation of the delivery, and had made my first glass of diet cream soda within 5 minutes of receiving the package.  While it wasn't bad, I wasn't very impressed.  For lack of a better way to explain it, the flavor wasn't as 'full-bodied' as I had hoped.  I found that I had to use quite a bit of the syrup to get enough flavor, but even then it wasn't what I had been hoping for.  I would be 100% okay with having to use a lot of it if it tasted like my favorite pop.  I had high hopes for it to taste similar to the Canfield's, but it really didn't at all.  It basically tastes exactly like what it is -- diet vanilla syrup.  I'm hoping to come up with other uses for it, so the remaining 2.5 bottles I have don't go to waste.

The flavor is excellent for a sugar-free product and the larger sized bottle available from Amazon makes it efficient and economical as I now go through only one bottle about every two to three weeks (thus the three pack lasts about two months before I need more).  As always, the combination of Amazon's fast free delivery and fair price (no added taxes) makes this a highly recommended buy on an great product, plus if you want to save even more you can buy it on Amazon's subscription basis where you select the delivery frequency that suits your needs.  Torani and Amazon can't be beat for the combination of quality, reliability, and price.

review/text: Torani sugar free syrups are a true life-saver for those on a sugar or carb restricted diet. I am happy to have tried the Vanilla one as I now use it for a variety of things!<br /><br />-My morning Cafe Americano gets always gets Vanilla and one other flavor. The Vanilla isn't an overpowering taste, so it creates a perfect base for sweetening up the coffee and allow another flavor (such as Caramel) to take over.<br /><br />-Makes amazing cream soda! Just add a couple of shots into your can of soda and you get the creaminess of cream soda, without the lingering aftertaste real cream soda gives.<br /><br />-My own whipped topping! Low-carb muffins can be pretty dry, so I make my own topping/sauce for it. The Vanilla syrup added to my whipping cream makes a perfectly sweet and tasty topping!<br /><br />-Also use in the above stated low-carb recipes such as muffins and cream cheese pancakes.<br /><br />This syrup offers a variety of uses, and that's why I love it! Get creative and you will find this is a great addition to any kitchen.

review/summary: Torani Syrup
review/text: A while back, I ordered 3 bottles of the Torani Syrup I think it was the caramel, and I really like the flavor, but it is like water, so be prepared when you start using it. The only other thing I would like would be to be able to choose 3 'different' flavors instead of all 3 flavors being the same.

I have used this in everything from my morning coffee to my mixed vodka beverages on girls night -- and I LOVE it and so do my girlfriends! Why not try a splenda no calorie additive instead of the real stuff that goes straight to the hips? I say pour yourself a drink, sit back, and enjoy with no guilt!

review/summary: Excellent and balanced vanilla flavor
review/text: We've been using this syrup for years, ever since we glimpsed it behind the counter at a Starbuck's in Cleveland. It's not too sweet and gives a good hint of vanilla with two shots into a twelve-ounce coffee, at least for me. I'm not a fan of flavored coffees, preferring black and unsweetened, but this passes muster with me and my (skim milk, light sweet coffee) wife. Also, it doesn't taste like it was made with a chemistry set. We always have a bottle next to our Keurig.<br />The price fluctuates, but typically three bottles on Amazon are the same price as one smaller bottle locally. The shelf life unopened is just fine.

A true vanilla flavor shines through (even though this is sugar free) As a bonus this is sold in a package of three with the option of automatic replenishment. This is a nice service for two reasons: 1) you don't have to worry about running out and not having more to add to the coffee 2) it's a little cheaper on price. It's nice to get a break once in a while!

review/summary: Great Savings for Great Product
review/text: This product is great tasting and zero for calories! This is a must since I must watch my calorie intake. The local stores want over .33 cents per ounce whereas if I order this and don't pay the tax and shipping it breaks down to .22 cents per ounce. This much Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla Syrup in Wal-Mart would be over $25.00. I have kept the smaller 12.2 ounce bottle I had bought some time back and fill it as needed. Much easier to handle in the kitchen than the 25.4 larger bottle. I have purchased this a few times from Amazon, and will continue to do so since the local stores want to mark up the price to unreasonable amounts. The taste is of high quality and cannot tell it is a sugar-free base (uses a Splenda base to sweeten). I think this is a great product and a great price. If I had paid for the shipping, I still think the cost would be justified over local area stores.

review/text: I just discovered this product recently.  It was sent to me from shespeaks as a product test.  I love using this product.  I was sent the pumpkin pie flavor and the sugar-free vanilla flavor to try.  They were so delicious.  I tried both flavors in my coffee and the vanilla flavor in my tea.  I see myself buying the 25.4 ounce bottle quite often now.  Torani is the #1 brand of flavored syrups in the USA and it offers over 100 tasty flavors. It is made with high quality ingredients, like pure cane sugar and coffeehouse inspired flavors.  They can be added to any drink.

review/text: We have been buying this syrup for years in supermarkets, where it is not easy to find and quite expensive.  We use it in coffee and in espresso-based drinks as a sweetener and flavoring, without adding calories.  Now we are getting it exclusively from Amazon for around 30% of what we were paying before, and we don't have to drive around searching for a bottle here and there.  We drink a LOT of coffee-based drinks at home (we don't leave the house for work), so the savings really add up.

review/summary: Great flavor - and a bargain to boot!
review/text: I discovered Torani syrups at Walmart of all places. I'm very pleased with the smooth vanilla taste of this syrup. By purchasing through Amazon and signing up for the automatic delivery, I got twice as much for the same price. Win! I've only used it in coffee so far but as a coffee lover, I do enjoy adding my own flavor to really good coffee and saving the cost of buying flavored coffee. I also drink my coffee black, so this is perfect for those of us who don't use cream. Just wish they sold it with no sweetener at all. I've tried straight vanilla extract and it doesn't impart the same rich vanilla taste - it leaves a sort of chemical aftertaste. I only wish Amazon sold the original Hazelnut flavor, not the new formula. Torani, please make the Classic Hazelnut available through Amazon as well! I'll be a repeat buyer of that flavor too!

So, I switched to the Torani Sugar-Free Syrup and it is the best sugar-free syrup I have yet experienced.  When moving back to the eastern seaboard I found Starbucks hadn't made it's way to the east coast yet.  I purchased an espresso machine so I could make my own at home.  (cost effective too). After searches on the internet, I found I could order the Torani from Amazon.com. I found it was reasonably priced and very fast on their delivery.  Thank you Amazon!  I now am on an automatic delivery and the price is even better!

review/text: I usually make my own flavorings for latte and espresso drinks, but have recently tried to use experiment with different flavored syrups.  My trials have all ended with disappointing results until I tried the Torani flavored syrups.  They have a lot more flavor than any of the other syrups I have tried, so to get any distinctive flavor I had to use a lot more quantity than when using Torani.  Even then, the robust flavor of this syrup puts the others to shame.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the sugar free (splenda) vanilla syrup, and have added it as a regular in my line up.  It have even better flavor than when I used real vanilla extract and splenda/sugar on my own.  This is a good tasting syrup, I have even used it regularly to milk to drink a small flavored milk drink after dinner as a treat and really like it.  This syrup is a winner.

Personally, I did not care for Hazelnut or chocolate (although with most products these would typically be my fav). I also recommend almond flavor, although it costs a little more. Otherwise, this is a great deal for a pack of 3, especially if you utilize free shipping. I really haven't found this product any cheaper at other sites because they all require extra shipping fees.
