review/summary: All Natural, All Good
review/text: We switched to all natural Skippy peanut butter years ago, and will never go back.  As a good source of protein, peanut butter should not contain hydrogenated oils or other weird things.  This peanut butter is the cream of the crop in both ingredients and taste.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Super creamy and smooth.<br />- Spreads very easily on toasted or untoasted breads.<br />- Is great to bake with.<br />- No need to stir.  Some oil will pool, but not enough to really need stirring.<br />- All natural!<br />- Wonderfully fresh peanut flavor that simply cannot be topped.<br />- Slightly sweet and slightly salty flavor that's well balanced.<br />- Stays fresh, even in the big jars.  I like to buy the bigger jars, as they're cheaper per ounce than the smaller ones, and it stays fresh for a long time.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- None!<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION<br />It's worth switching to this all natural peanut butter.  And I've tried other natural peanut butters, and Skippy makes the best one.

review/summary: The best non-hydrogenated peanut butter around
review/text: I am always torn between buying the yummier peanut butter with the icky trans fat and the healthier peanut butter that doesn't taste nearly as good. Well, actually, I'm not torn, I've just been buying the icky tasting organic, need to be stirred type peanut butter. I saw the Skippy Natural in the store and quickly scanned the ingredients. No hydrogenated oils... sweet! The ingredients are roasted peanuts, sugar, palm oil and salt. I do realize that peanut butter is healthier without the oil, sugar and salt, but I also know that it's nearly impossible to have the best of both worlds, so it's a trade off. With Skippy Natural I get healthier peanut butter and a fabulous taste! Plus, when I compare it to the nutrition facts in Adams Natural Peanut Butter here's what I get:<br /><br />--------Adam's - Skippy Natural Serving size 2tbsp in both<br />Calories - 200 - 190<br />Total Fat - 16 grams - 16 grams<br />Sat Fat - 2.5 grams - 3.5 grams<br />Sodium - 105 mg - 150 mg<br />Total Carbs - 6g - 6g<br />Protein - 7g - 7g<br /><br />So, we're not looking at the much of a difference at all. I will take the better tasting peanut butter in this instance. If the nutrition was severely compromised then I would make a different choice, but not in this case! Now every time I see someone at the store reaching for the gross, hydrogenated peanut butter I want to show them this and compare the ingredients for them and explain that it tastes just as good as what they're planning on getting. I politely mind my own business and move along. I would be awesome if they marketed this stuff better though. Grab a jar and a spoon and try the creamiest, yummiest peanut butter without the unnecessary trans fat.<br />Nutrition from [...] and the back of my Skippy jar

review/summary: Tastes like sewage
review/text: I have been eating various brands of natural peanut butter for over a decade.  This is inedible.  It may be because in addition to peanuts, there is sugar, salt and palm oil. I assumed "natural" meant peanuts and nothing else, but obviously I was mistaken.  This tastes very different from natural peanut butter that has peanuts as the only ingredient.  Much prefer Smuckers. Oh well, the local homeless people will hit the food jackpot when they dumpster dive tomorrow...

review/summary: Freekeh is my new quinoa
review/text: I love freekeh! It is expensive and you will wonder how you just paid so much for so little, however, you don't need much to feel full. I thought this was easy to cook, easy directions and could be used in so many different ways. I cooked mine and used it in a spicy shrimp saute. I loved the way my house smelled while it was cooking. The texture is between sushi rice and barley and it has a very natural sweet taste to it. It's worth a try if you are looking for a healthier alternative to rice.

review/text: I started roasting my own coffee beans 6 months ago.  It's easy and satisfying, and generally cheaper than buying roasted (and already-too-old) beans.  These Mocha Java beans taste great and roast well.  I have found more foreign objects in this bag than I usually see - pebbles and a small metal object - not a lot of them, just more than usual.

review/text: This was my first experience with a Coffee Bean Direct product. I went for a light city roast and the flavor profile was exactly as described in the product description. I use a Yama vac. pot and a fine grind (YMMV). In a few days I'll do a darker roast and post the comparison. Amazon's price is great; nearly half that at the Coffe Bean Direct site. While other suppliers have similar prices, large orders are usually necessary for free shipping. As always, Amazon comes through. I highly recommend this coffee; if you think you would like it based on the product description you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Green Mocha Java Coffee from AMAZON
review/text: I purchased these coffee beans via a SEARCH on the AMAZON site, looking for beans that I can roast myself (have done this for the past 5 years). I intended these to be GREEN (unroasted) coffee beans for my own roasting (but "GREEN" is in this product's title). When the already-roasted beans arrived, I notified AMAZON of the error. Foods cannot be returned; therefore, I simply received a credit.<br /><br />Although this roast is not as smooth as many of the beans I have roasted over the years, the taste is good enough for 4-stars.  I appreciated AMAZON for refunding my purchase while my family savors this commercial roast (on the house).

review/summary: JUICY JUICE'S MISSION: STOP BUYING SODA FOR YOUR KIDS: BUY JUICY JUICE
review/text: JUICY JUICE'S MISSION: STOP BUYING SODA FOR YOUR KIDS: BUY JUICY JUICE is a simultaneously self-serving and altruistic mission.<br /><br />SO WHAT IS THIS STUFF?<br /><br />Libby's "Juicy Juice 100% Apple Juice, 46 fl oz" is part of a larger family of 100% juice products that has taken aim at the huge market share that Coke and Pepsi have carved out for themselves. Their target market is the youth of America. That, more than anything else, makes this and other Libby's products important. I first became aware of this targeting when I was watching the PBS program "Arthur" with my youngest child (who is named Arthur). At the end of the show there was a message from Libby's that said, "Juicy Juice Is Proud To Support Arthur". Since then I have regularly supported their 100% juice products, although I drink more of them than our Arthur does. Surprisingly, most "Juicy Juice" products are significantly less expensive than "Ocean Spray" and "Northland" juices, though I still buy some of those varieties as well.<br /><br />HECK OF ALOT BETTER FOR KIDS THAN DRINKER SODA!<br /><br />Though many critics and health advocates have pointed out that fruit juices are naturally high in sugar and after processing, including pasteurization, lose many of their healthful properties, they still represent a healthful alternative to soda for children. Surprisingly this seems to be a controversial statement, but 100% juice [with a little Vitamin C added] does help to engender healthful eating habits which begin with the choice of beverage. It is also a good source of potassium and is an excellent thirst quencher. All without added sugar and NO caffeine!<br /><br />PALATABLE AND CONVENIENT:<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that all of these juices taste very palatable to kids, probably because they are blended to taste sweet without any added sugar. Of course, it would be better to make your own juice, avoid pasteurization [made in a very clean environment], and include the natural vitamins, minerals and pulp, but who really has time. What's more, do you really think a child would drink such a homemade healthy brew? In the meantime, there is "Juicy Juice" and our children will most probably drink that thereby avoiding soda.<br /><br />FOR MORE INFO ON JUICY JUICE:<br /><br />To find out more about this product, see their website at "juicyjuice" on the world wide web. They have several useful links to pediatric nutrition sites and "Frequently Asked Questions" about their products.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THIS OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT.]

review/text: We were very pleased to find this item online, as it is extremely difficult to find canned pumpkin most of the year, at least in our area.  In addition, we had purchased this exact same brand of pumpkin previously in a local store, and it was over three times more expensive than what we paid online.<br /><br />The pumpkin we received is different in texture (much more grainy) than we expected.  The taste is o.k., and overall it is usable; however, we believe that the noticeable difference in texture is the reason why these particular cans were so inexpensive.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: One day, I was making a favorite bean and sausage soup and I started counting up the sodium content. For a "healthy" soup, one serving contained about 70% of the daily sodium requirements. Yikes! I jumped on Amazon and started searching for low sodium broth and beans. These beans were the ones I bought. I love them! they are delicious and are a fraction of a day's worth of sodium per serving (3.5 servings per can). And the added bonus is that the can liners are BPA free! The beans are a bit softer than other canned beans and if you, like me, like to cook up a big batch of soup and then freeze  single servings for future meals, be aware that the soft beans get even softer after freezing/thawing/heating. Not a problem for me, but if your preference runs toward a firm bean, you may not be happy with these beans.

review/summary: We love Eden products
review/text: I cook dried beans in large batches and put them in freezer containers, but like to have cans on hand for super fast meals or for when I want smaller amounts at one time. The canned beans are a bit softer than the home cooked ones, but still retain their shape and are particularly handy for salads of all kinds.<br /><br />Great Northern beans combine beautifully with pinto beans for a great soup, either as a mixed bean soup or as the protein in a rich and hearty vegetable soup....or just for a big bowl of beans for a "beans and greens" meal.  We also sometimes open and drain a can and use it to top a big main course salad, along with dried cranberries and feta cheese.<br /><br />The fact that they are salt free in the can means you don't have to drain and rinse them several times like you do brands of canned beans that contain salt.  The little bit of kombu (seaweed) that is in the cooked beans adds a bit of iodine to your diet which can be helpful if you use pure sea salt like we do - and even more so if you don't use any salt at all.<br /><br />We use several Eden organic products because of their consistent quality and BPA free can linings and have been looking for the Great Northern beans at a decent price for many months. I was delighted to find them now on Amazon.  I hope they continue to be available here.

There are strict storage instructions for these bars; they are more perishable than most other bars from my experience. When they are fresh they taste quite a bit like figs and  their flavor is very mild. I find that they are light on my stomach and they provide nutrients I used to get from vitamins. When they have gone bad like most food items that have gone bad, they do not taste good.

review/summary: I am addicted to these bars (in a good way)!
review/text: These bars have become a staple in my diet. Not only are they vegan and low in gluten (I have food allergies and am gluten sensitive), but they taste nicely sweet and aren't heavy like many bars. I like them as a snack food or as a pre- or post-workout snack and they seem easy to digest. I'm also a big fan of chia seeds and do feel they help me have sustained energy in a subtle steady way.<br /><br />It feels indulgent because of the chocolate but I don't get the caffeine hit like from other chocolates and it feels good for my body - sweet but not too sweet and full of good ingredients - lots of greens.<br /><br />I don't understand the negative reviews here as I LOVE these bars. Perhaps if you are used to eating sugary candy bars these don't taste as good (?) but when you eat healthy food (lots of greens, veggies, natural whole foods), this tastes like a real treat and is a great option for a snack on the go (for travel, too).

I was excited to see something new with the Chia bars, so I bought a box (it was discounted 50%).  I looked at the nutrition facts, very solid.  I figured they tasted just as good, if not better than the Original Greens + Bars.  Boy, was I wrong....<br /><br />These bars taste absolutely abominable!  In all seriousness, I've never had a nutrition bar that tasted so bad, and believe me, I've eaten 100's!  It's hardly even something you can choke down--it's really that bad.  I've yet to try the Greens + Chia Chocolate bar.  Maybe that's edible, but these bars surely aren't.  I give it 1 star for taste, 5 stars for nutrition... but of course, the nutrition doesn't mean much when you can't even choke 'em down.

review/summary: Great for sensitive systems
review/text: When we got my dog, she barely ate. She didn't even like treats. We finally got her to eat, but the regular (more affordable) brands didn't sit well with her system. My vet recommended this or to cook her food on our own. Obviously, cooking food for a dog gets a bit time-consuming, but this Pinnacle food really was great for my dog. She finally started to gain weight. (She was so skinny when we got her from the shelter.)<br /><br />My dog doesn't seem to have the farting problem the other reviewer said.<br /><br />I guess every dog's system is different and you just have to find the one that's right for your dog. this one works great for ours :)

review/summary: My Shiloh loves it!
review/text: My canine companion is a 132 pound, five year old, Shiloh Shepherd.  The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weaned on.  I had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen.<br /><br />Then to my dismay, I learned 'Premium Edge' was placed on a recent recall list.  I knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend, but I had to take immediate action.  And, at the time of recall, I didn't have time to gradually transition to a new diet, which is always the way to go, to avoid negative symptoms.<br /><br />After carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble, I opted to give Pinnacle (Trout & Sweet Potato) a try, ordering a 15 pound 'starter' bag from Amazon.  In addition, I ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase.<br /><br />The bag arrived.  I opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be.  The first whiff out of the bag was strong, smelling of fish.  I noted the kibble size, itself, was quite small for a large breed dog, but felt this was only a minor reservation.  The ultimate test was not what I thought about it, but what my Shiloh would.  He immediately had a positive response.  In fact --- he loves it!  He appears more enthusiastic about it than the 'Premium Edge.'<br /><br />I had to start the Pinnacle before the enzymes arrived, so I was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea.  Well, that was not the case.  He has gone through the 15 pound bag, and half of the next order --- a 30 pound bag, with no diarrhea, or gas, at all.  In fact, his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet.  Supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this new regimen.  I also love that I can order a 30 pound bag through Amazon and have it delivered to my front door.  I'm now avoiding a considerable drive,  and,  the back-breaking-discomfort, of lugging around heavy bags of kibble.<br /><br />My dog is happy, and I'm happy.  That said, after an adequate therapeutic trial, I feel confident in recommending Pinnacle.

review/summary: Only thing that will settle in my Bichon's stomach
review/text: I have a Bichon Frise with a horrible stomach for keeping any food down. This was the only dog food we could find that she wouldn't throw up. It was recommended by our vet who said our Bichon just had a lot of allergies and this food was known to work well with dogs having her problems.<br /><br />It's a bunch cheaper on amazon than any local pet store we could find, and we don't have to have the trouble of lugging the 30 lb bag home.<br /><br />However, the reason for the loss of 1 star -- our dog really dislikes the taste of it. She's on a pretty tight diet to lose weight currently and still refuses to eat the food immediately when poured into her bowl. She'll sniff it on and off for about an hour before eating it. It also gives her pretty bad breath, but these are both things I can live with to eliminate the stained carpets.<br /><br />We have been using the food for over 2 years with no problems; I definitely recommend it if your dog has a sensitive stomach.

review/summary: My picky dog enjoys eating it
review/text: My dog, a Great Pyrenees, has a few food allergies (rice, chicken, eggs, soy, nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6-Fish and, after a few months, he decided to stop eating it.  After trying a few different foods I heard about Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.  He loves it and it agrees with his digestive system.  I order it from Amazon because the price is lower than the local pet stores in my area. With Amazon Prime, it arrives in 2 days.<br /><br />Four stars because I do need to mix the last quarter of the food with the next bag (treating it like a new dog food - I didn't need to do that with Orijen 6 Fish).  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Alternate meat source = less itchy dog
review/text: My dog started developing signs of an allergy last year - nothing overt - just noticable skin twitches when I touched her in certain areas on her back.  Unsure if her reactions were due to environment or food, but they didn't seem to be seasonal grass allergies, so I chose to test the easiest source first.  I chose a food with a completely different meat source, switching from chicken to fish.  It's only been a week and I'm already seeing improvement.  She's still showing signs of itchiness, but her reaction is much less when I pet her back.  And on top of that, her fur is softer too!  It's early yet, and there can still be some progress made, but I have no doubt that the change in food is helping.  I sat and read review after review on dog foods with in-depth ingredient analysis before settling on Pinnacle Trout & Sweet Potato.  If after 6 weeks, she still shows some signs of being itchy, I'll happily try the Salmon and Potato Grain Free variety to see if grains are a factor in her allergies as well.<br /><br />Have seen some reviews mentioning breath after eating the fish based foods.  I have to say, I haven't experienced this with my dogs.  There might be a slightly different odor to their breath, but it isn't by any means too "fishy" smelling.  Just different.  And neither dog has experienced any gasiness or changes in stool since the switch was done gradually.

review/summary: Picky Eaters Food
review/text: I have a Bichon Frise and for the longest time feeding was nothing but an endless hassle for me.  Both my dog and me would be completely stressed out because he couldn't find a food he enjoyed and I was buying tons of food that he would just stare at for hours and refuse to eat.  One day I went into a local pet food shop and they had sample packages of all the different types of foods they had and they gave me several to try out. I took them home and set them all out for my dog... he went around and sniffed at all of them but this was the one he finally went for.  A couple years of using this food later and he never seems to protest.  Thanks for making my life easier.

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: This food is an exceptional product.  I take care of a number of dogs and am very selective about the formulation of their food.  In particular, I have one with pancreatic insufficiency, requiring a low fat content, and a little fellow who has had a bout with gastroenteritis, so needed a food with a different protein source than chicken.  Both are healthy and happy with the Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.<br />The only drawback, and it does not concern the food itself, is that Amazon uses FedEx for their delivery.  Apparently, when there is a holiday on a weekend, FedEx home delivery takes extra weekdays off.  Consequently my order arrived after my kids ran out of the food they needed.  It took 4 1/2 days for FedEx to get the parcel from the Columbus, Oh area to central West Virginia.  UPS was delivering while FedEx was still holding up my shipment, as my UPS driver passed here the day before my dog food arrived.  I have spoken to Amazon corporate headquarters about the fact that it appears UPS can get the job done more efficiently.  Perhaps a UPS option is in order for those customers who would rather not use FedUP...oops..I mean FedEx.  Hey, weren't these the guys that were hurling Christmas packages out of their trucks?

review/text: Tried this food for my adult mix that has been on a fish based diet since puppydom. I thought trout and sweet potato would be an interesting change from salmon, but nope, not really. It gets eaten, though not with any particular excitement. I think it is safe to say while my dog is indifferent to it, the ingredients and price are a plus. Spruce it up a drizzle of olive or canola oil and it gets eaten.

review/text: Ordered their 6 month Frequent Flower club subscription off of Amazon.  Wasn't sure what I was going to get but had some points I needed to use to I went ahead and ordered 6 months.  I was very impressed by the quantity and the quality of the flowers.  Each month I received a variety of flowers, two bouquets, sometimes two similar ones, sometimes they were different.  There were so many flowers I divided them up and made arrangements for the kitchen, the dining room table and even small arrangements in the bathrooms.  They're super fresh and come with several packets of preservative so as long as you change the water and cut them mine typically lasted at least 10 days looking super fresh.  This is my first month without them, I'm going to reorder another 6 months subscription because I really have missed them this month.  I'd highly recommend them!

review/text: Sun Maid raisins are the best brand of raisins on your grocer's shelf--period. These raisins are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They are relatively high in sugar (29 grams per 1/4 cup) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these raisins are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that the raisins do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily.<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the bottom of the container. Eat or use these raisins before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These raisins are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Raisins provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!

review/summary: Decent flavor, difficult packaging
review/text: It will never be as nice as fresh pesto, but I find the flavor of this pesto paste comparable with other pestos I've bought in jars.<br /><br />The tubes are very difficult to use, however. I bought them imagining that the pesto would squeeze out smoothly like toothpaste, allowing me to dispense just the right amount for each dish and leaving no mess behind. Unfortunately, the tubes are metallic and hard to squeeze smoothly. After the first few squirts they don't want to dispense anything at all. I have had to cut the back end off of each tube in order to get the pesto out. At that point, of course, it's like dealing with an ice cream cone when you've bitten the bottom off.<br /><br />Unless you want to spend a lot of time cleaning up a mess of green oil, I suggest choosing a pesto that comes in friendlier packaging.

review/summary: Love this tea.  The best black tea in the world.
review/text: I have never had black tea this good before.  I love lychee fruit and wanted some black tea for the caffeine content.  Problem is I do not like the taste of black tea.  This tea is different it is not bitter.  It is smooth in taste.  I do not add sugar to my teas so they have to stand on their own.  This one does.  That is why I purchase teas with flavors in them.  This may seem expensive, but realize this is 100 bags of tea and comes in a huge box.  If you look a regular tea it is a much smaller box.  This looks over three times the size.  Great tea try it for your caffenated tea.  It is wonderful tea.  This beats out earl gray or english breakfast tea in taste.  This tea is a pleasure to drink.  I just wanted to get some caffeine in a tolerable way with no artificial sweeteners or regular sugars.  This is it.  In the highly sweetened american culture there is a way out drink this tea from china.  It is calorie free with no artifical sweeteners. I am not asian, but I love asian products.

review/summary: Poor packaging of sausage
review/text: We have purchased this item several times in the past and it was always shipped in insulated boxes and delivered over night from a company called Christmas Central on the East Coast. We ordered this time again expecting the same efficiency. The shipment of four pounds of Polish Sausage came in three separate cartons-none of them insulated, the "frozen" gel-packs (all of three of them) were melted and warm to the touch and even the sausage itself did not feet cold to the touch. It was  delivered to its destination by the regular post man who stuffed the sausage along with daily meal into the mail box. Your West Coast provider Otto's Imports,  simply said that they had done everything they could do short of delivering the sausage in person. They are obviously ill prepared for this type of deliveries. We still haven't decided whether to chance eating this sausage or simply throwing it away.

You only get finely cut flower petals without the bulbs, stems and what not which you would get with the slightly less expensive unsifted version of this. Having only the flower petals means you actually have to brew less of the product to get the same result.

review/text: I love this tea!!!!...I was introduced to hibiscus tea at a local restaurant. I had been buying Republic of Tea brand and was satisfied with the tea. I like my tea iced and mixed with stevia. I had to use 5 tea rounds to make the tea to the strength that I wanted when I would make a pitcher of it.  Purchasing this Davidson's in bulk is the way to go. I was amazed at the size of the bag and the quality of the tea. It is simply yummy!!! I have read quite a lot about the health benefits of drinking this tea. I am pleased with the great side effects but quite honestly I would drink it even if there were not health benefits. The best way to sum up the taste is sweet/sour when mixed with stevia. The red color that results is so pretty. I will purchase this tea again and again!!

review/text: Purchased this for my husband who has high blood pressure. He is such a trooper...even though he didn't care for the taste (he said it's too sour) he drank it religiously every day, and in a week's time his blood pressure went from 152/102 to 145/90...almost perfect. He said he feels great and has a lot more energy...also his sex drive is starting to return. On that note...I just brewed up a big pot...enough to fill 3 containers (I used empty orange juice containers...size 1.75 liter). I also added some honey to cut down on the sourness of it. He said it's pretty good...I said drink up buddy boy, it's been almost a year and I want me some good love'n.<br /><br />Will update at the end of the month after he goes back to Walgreens for another free blood pressure check up.

review/summary: Great taste - very economical
review/text: I looked for hibiscus tea after it was mentioned on TV.  The supermarkets in my area did not have pure hibiscus tea. Even the health food stores had it mixed with other teas.<br /><br />It makes sense to spend a little extra money and get it "cut and sifted". That way there are no bad surprises.<br /><br />I had to experiment a little with the amount of tea per cups of water. Usually it is one teaspoon per cup. But this tea is so strong that we use 1 teaspoon per 2 cups of water. With herbal tea, it is OK to leave it in longer. One time we forgot and let it brew for 15 minutes and it still tasted good.<br /><br />One word of caution. I liked it so much that I drank 4 cups a day and got acid stomach. I had to give it a little break.<br /><br />One big compliment to Davidson's. The quality is great, the price is great and they ship very fast.

review/text: The bag I received was full of quite a bit of broken bits and dust. There are enough whole and half blossoms that I'm brewing tea with it fine, but I'm not sure I'd recommend this brand. I adore this tea cold in the Summer, mixing it with club soda or tonic and it is fantastic with a splash of gin or Tequila. Most often I mix half and half with regular (black) tea.Agua de Jamaica AKA Rosa de Jamaica is also really healthy - packed with Vit C and great for digestive health.

review/text: This stuff is marvelous.  This is the first time I've tried Hibiscus.  It has a really tasty, tangy flavor and I combine it with Davidson's bulk Tulsi Signature Blend to make sun tea.  It's great by itself hot or cold.  And even better for you when combined with Tulsi, due to Tulsi's adaptogenic qualities.<br /><br />I live in Las Vegas, so I drink a couple of large glasses of this awesome red-colored (looks like Sangria) combination as iced tea daily, now that summer's here, and really love it.  It's both healthy and refreshing.  I'm very satisfied with it.  And I'd recommend this version, rather than the whole flowers, because this version has smaller pieces.  Smaller pieces means more surface area (like a finer ground coffee), thus, a better infusion with more flavor using less product.

review/summary: Allergic reaction!
review/text: I loved the tea and the fact that it was well cut and sifted, but I couldn't continue to drink it because the tea somehow causes me to have an allergic reaction to it.  Just an hour or two after drinking a cup, my body would start to develop hives and itch all over.  After multiple visits to the doctor, I was finally able to narrow it down to the tea and the hives went away after I stopped drinking this tea.  To be fair, I do have seasonal allergies (pollen, pet dander, etc) but I rarely need to take antihistamine medication for it; but after a single cup of this stuff, my body goes crazy.  Since the entire flower is included in the tea package, I believe that there may be residual pollen in it.  If you have allergies, beware of this tea.

review/text: I started drinking hibiscus tea for its blood-pressure lowering properties. It's hard to find in my local stores, with the Republic of Tea bags being the only ones I could find. I do like the flavor of the Republic of Tea a bit better because they have Stevia, but the value of the bulk tea is so much better and the quality of the tea is higher because it's cut flowers and not dust. I suspect I'll get used to the less-sweet flavor pretty quickly, and I will definitely purchase again.

review/text: Do you have any iea how much tea you can make from a 16 oz. bag?  A lot.  It's very aromatic.  I'm debating whether I should brew it or make sachets.  Hibiscus flowers are supposed to be all kinds of good for you, and I'm sure they are.  But they are a tad acid in taste.  If you have problems with acid, you may want to pass on this choice.<br /><br />This tea will appeal to you if you reallllly like brewed tea.  If you're more a teabag convenience sort, don't buy bulk tea.  This tea will appeal to you if you're into the tea 'experience' -- you know what I mean, a 10 or 15 minute break in the mid-morning (for elevenses?) or mid-afternoon, with a side of cookies or biscuits.  I find this lovely with some honey to sweeten it.  I only give it 3 stars because, while I loved the first cup, there may soon come a day when I can't look at the stuff.  Or I may fashion it into 'headache pillows' for migraine-prone friends....

review/text: These bars are excellent, as are all of the Fiber One products. Most people are so consumed with sugar and fat grams and they don't even think about fiber. Most people don't have a clue of the fiber content of the foods they eat or even how much they need per day. But they can tell you how many fat grams and carbs things have!<br /><br />The average adult needs 25-30 grams of fiber per day. It's not just about staying regular, it's all about beating the odds against colon cancer.<br /><br />Fiber also helps blood sugar stay regulated by slowing down digestion which keeps your insulin steady.<br /><br />Thanks to fiber one for making these great products. I no longer have to take icky fiber supplements! Colon cancer runs in my family as well as Type 2 diabetes and high fiber products like this are a blessing to me.

review/summary: Yummmmm! And I'm getting a good dose of fiber!
review/text: I've tried all of the Fiber One Bars and I have to say that I love Oats and Peanut Butter the best! They taste great, like dessert and when I'm hungry and need something to fill me up for a bit, these bars do the job. Not only are they great tasting and fill you up, but they're super good for you, too. A delicious way to get your fiber.<br /><br />***And for those of you on Weight Watchers, Fiber One Bars are 2 Points each!!! Yay!***

review/summary: Great taste, filling and fiber!
review/text: These bars were recommended to me on a phyisician's supervised high fiber diet plan and I was afraid they would taste like cardboard. I was so wrong. They taste amazingly good, are filling, high fiber--I couldn't ask for more. I eat one between lunch and dinner or for my 9 PM snack and they really hold me. Now I would eat them even if they weren't recommended on my diet!

review/summary: Tasty Fiber Solution
review/text: I've been eat Fiber One bars daily for one year. These contain 35% of your daily fiber allowance and have a pretty good consistency and flavor. My only problem with the Fiber bars is that they do contain sugar, but other than that, I try to eat one everyday for breakfast. The Peanut butter flavor has less sugar than the chocolate ones. These are pretty filling. It takes a little bit to get used to the Fiber Bomb, so give your body a few days to adjust.

review/summary: I got hooked on these...
review/text: I got hooked on these when a local closeout store (Lot-Less) had an amazing deal - boxes of 5 for $1.50.<br /><br />Naturally I bought 10 boxes and have gone through almost all of them.  The bars are absolutely delicious, and I'm not even a big fan of peanut butter (maybe now I am!)<br /><br />Plus, even at face price, this bar + milk + a Good Morning Pill (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill | 60 Pill Bottle | Energy Vitamin Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off!</a>) is my usual breakfast, which comes to under $2 total and is pretty healthy too.  I'll continue buying and eating these for the foreseeable future.

review/summary: Fiber.....Makes Me Sad
review/text: Fiber One Bars are very tasty and "effective".  I have been buying them for over 6 months and have one each morning.  After eating one I am no longer sad.

review/summary: Best delicious source of fiber on market and snack
review/text: This Fiber One bar has the highest grams of fiber per bar on the market. The other catch? It far exceeds any other fiber bars in taste! You would expect it to have not much of a real good tatse whether peanut butter bars or chocolate, but it will surprise you. Any child would not find any dis-taste in eating them.

review/summary: My favorite subject, fiber?
review/text: Once again, I was extremly skeptical about the taste. The cost, is also a deterent.<br /><br />I changed my mind on both counts.<br /><br />This is why. The stinking bars taste like candy bars, Yikes, no cardboard flavor. I almost fell over and couldn't get back up. Help lifeline!<br /><br />Really, I have tried two flavors, and they to me do taste like a candy bar and not a fiber bar. I researched and found less costly bars and that is because they have less fiber grams and so you must buy twice if not more of them to equal your gram intake. The amount of grams in these helps tremendously in getting your grams which is sooooooooo hard.

review/text: If you are a lover of great health, have a problem with constipation or hemorrhoids, or want to keep your weight in check this is one of the best products on the market and it beats anything that the doctor recomends that you usually purchase in the drugstore.

review/summary: Satisfying, Chewy, and Tasty
review/text: I like these bars because they are soft and chewy and actually have a lot of bulk compared to some regular granola-type bars, which normally is what I eat.  These make a decent mid-morning snack, at only about 150 calories each.  They seem to keep me satisfied much longer than most other snacks I have in the morning, which helps prevent overeating and snacking before lunch.<br /><br />I also like that they are a decent substitute for a mid-day sweet or candy bar. The peanut butter flavor and the drizzle remind me of a candy bar. The peanut butter flavor is subtle and not overpowering. I usually end up eating about 2-3 of these per week, and actually prefer them over most other bars.

review/summary: Great healthy breakfast treat
review/text: These are a great alternative to an eggs and bacon breakfast. Much healthier and they definitely keep you regular. The price here is too good to pass up. If this is your first time trying them be forewarned it will take a few days for your bowels to get used to the huge amount of fiber.

review/summary: yum yum yum
review/text: This is the best flavor of the Fiber One bars in my opinion.  They are yummy and with 9 grams of fiber, they ward off hunger for hours! You can get a case of them through Amazon for about the price of 6 boxes at the store (in NY, regular price 3.99) and they stay fresh for a long time, even if you're the only one who eats them in your house (like me!)

review/summary: GREAT way to get your fiber!
review/text: Yes, these taste surprisingly good, but more importantly they have a 35% of the RDA of fiber in every bar. I recommend these to all my female friends who 'never go' and I swear they'll keep you regular. Practically a miracle food in that regard, but also really really yummy. Great with coffee for breakfast!
