review/summary: Smooth Chiapas Mexican Coffee with Natural Chocolate notes
review/text: This is a smooth coffee with delightful flavors and natural chocolate fragrances and flavors too. It is now my favorite of coffees to buy. I make it in my Espresso machine; but I have also enjoyed it by the drip coffee method. I actually like it best by drip; but it is easier to use the Gaggia Espresso machine with the burr grinder. I like to drink this coffee with soy milk vanilla flavored and sweeten it and then it tastes like Chocolate is in there with the coffee. I do drink it black as espresso most often though. It is great that it is so smooth even when made concentrated. It is an organic medium roast. The best of the Chiapas coffee beans do have this naturally occurring chocolate molecule fragrance and flavor in the beans.

review/summary: Ruta Maya whole bean coffee
review/text: Great medium roast coffee - I was scared to buy the whole bag ($7.99 at grocery store) because I usually just buy small amounts to try different flavors and brands. When I first opened the bag I thought Oh!Oh! dark roast too strong probably (very strong smell). I didn't use as much as I normally do when brewing, but even with it being slightly weaker than what I like it had a wonderful smooth, not bitter taste that seemed to linger on my tongue. I just couldn't drink the whole cup because I already had my caffeine limit for the day.<br /><br /> I grind my own, I think that makes a real difference in how coffee tastes at home - if your trying to kick your buy cup of coffee every morning addiction, then I think it's a must to grind your own - but you probably wont save any money, good coffee is expensive if you make it your self or not, but hey, you can impress your friends and family with how good your coffee is. This is a good middle of the road strength coffee that most people would enjoy.<br /><br />A couple of more tips, use filtered water, unbleached filters (or permanent filter) and good coffee maker. And once you figure out how to grind your own coffee - it's fun and you might never go back to pre-ground.

review/summary: Per Doctor Recommendation
review/text: With 290 MG's of sodium per serving as opposed to 590MG's for plain old table salt, this substitute is a tasty way to reduce your sodium intake.  I've tried the "no-salt" salts (100% sodium chloride) and they actually have a fake taste to them.  This is a very palatable way to reduce the amount without compromising your taste buds.  This is a good source of potassium also.<br /><br />This  type of product was recommended to me by my heart doctor.  We are trying to lower my salt intake (not alleviate it 100%--at least not yet) So if you think your heart doctor would disapprove of sodium chloride in your diet then get his/her permission first...I did.<br />I purchased this at my local grocery store, but if you buy it here the price is comparable and you save on the gas for your vehicle!

review/text: These sardines are fantastic - probably why they stopped offering them. Actually, they spoiled me from regular sardines; after you eat these, the skin and tails and bones of regular sardines tend to make you quesy.  These have a mild flavor, so even if you don't like sardines, you may changer your opinion after these...<br /><br />I eat them, one tin per day, at work - much to the dismay of my co workers.  Then I crumble some whole wheat crackers and spices into the fish oil and olive oil left over, let it absorb, and chug it down! Omega-3 fatty oils, protien, and olive oil! You cannot go wrong, and here in Butler (30 miles N. of Pittsburgh) Giant Eagle charges 2.99 per tin...so you save as well.<br /><br />Eat. Get Healthy. Annoy your weak-stomache co-workers (smak your lips, smile, sigh as you eat). Can you go wrong? I think not.

review/summary: Excellent quality and taste
review/text: I just bought a case of these as well as a case of Crown Prince's cheap line of Sardines (known as Ocean Prince).  The difference in quality is quite clear.  These sardines have excellent taste, texture and aroma.  The pure olive oil really makes a difference in the taste, and the sardines are thick and tender.  The can is also easy to open.  For the same amount of money, you can buy 12 of these or 24 of the Ocean Prince Sardines.  Well, you get what you pay for, and it shows here.  This is the first brand of Sardines didnt give me gas/bloated stomach after I ate it.  Go for with the premium line...you pay more, but its well worth it.

review/text: Crown Prince Natural Skinless & Boneless Sardines are the best sardines I have EVER eaten!  I'm trying to lose weight and eat healthier, and when one of the attorneys in our office prepared a plate of sardines, sliced tomatoes and cottage cheese for lunch, I was intrigued.  He let me try the sardines and I was hooked!  They are absolutely delicious!  And they don't have that strong "fishy" smell most sardines have.  Unfortunately, my local grocery store doesn't carry them so I was extremely pleased to be able to order a case from Amazon, and I'll keep on ordering them until I can get them locally.

review/text: These sardines are delicious...no bones or scales, and usually 3 or 4 large sardines per can. The olive oil within the can is also great and I love to put these on salads along with the oil (saves you from using salad dressing). These sardines are also great on crackers, sandwiches, etc. They do not have that typical "fishy" smell at all and they're one of the healthiest fishes one can eat (very low in mercury, lot of protein (26g) and good for you oils). The ingredients are listed as "sardines, pure olive oil, and salt" and the sodium content is rather low (280mg or 12% of your daily intake!). I had no issues with the packaging either and I will be sure to order these again.

As one reviewer wrote that they were very mild and tasted like tuna - absolutely correct.  These are delicious, I am so glad I took the chance and ordered them.

review/text: If you have to eat fish at least a couple times a week to be healthy (I do), these are a good way to do it. The only brand I've found that tastes better is Bella Ohao, and that's because they are lightly smoked, whereas the Crown Prince are not. Add a generous amount of freshly squeezed lemon juice and some salt, and you've got yourself a "Yum" that's really good for you! AND: sardines are low in mercury which can't be said for a lot of other kinds of fish!

Well, they cost much more than the other sardines, you don't get as many in the tin, and (honestly), I don't care for the olive oil that they are packed in.  I doubt I will purchase these again in the future as I think the 4.25 oz is a much better tasting sardine and, definately a much better buy.

They were great, straight out of the can after sitting on a UPS truck all day. Perfect packaging and delivery from Amazon as always. I highly recommend taking advantage of the subscription (you can always cancel subsequent deliveries), they are just barely over $2 a can, less expensive than some store brand fishies :). I will be eating several cans a week for a crazy healthy lunch.

review/summary: Heaven in a can for those who love sardines !!!!
review/text: I decided to write this asap, to be honest I just got my order today, and we just ate our first cans a few minutes ago (wife and I). The sardines themselves are well preserved and not broken, and taste superb you get the fish texture without the cheap canned sardine taste or strong smell. There were about 5 sardines per can. So enjoy !!!<br /><br />p.s.<br />Here a little taste at how we prepare them.<br />We used<br />2 1/2 plum tomatos chopped<br />1/2 of a small white onion finely diced<br />4 olives (pickled and stuffed with jalapeno(mild))roughly chopped<br />1 small pickled jalapeno finely chopped and seeded<br />juice from 1 1/2 limes<br />Kosher salt<br />fresh black pepper (depends on your taste)<br />just a few drops green tabasco sauce (jalapeno)<br /><br /> Simple combine these items in a medium bowl and add the salt and pepper to taste<br /> Let it rest for a bit the jucies from the lime will cook the onion a bit...<br /> After a few minutes we added two cans of the sardines (drained and slightly broke up with fork)<br /> Folded it up and tasted. (add what you think is missing)<br /> We served it in the same bowl and ate it on some toasted baguette slices.<br /> (Beware if you like it it won't last long)

But it's no big deal - I'd use a can opener to eat these tasty things if I had too.  I won't be buying crap sardines at the grocery store anymore, ordering more of these from Amazon.

review/summary: Perfect. Even for people who don't love sardines.
review/text: I have to say, I love these sardines. The fact that they are wild-caught (not farmed), boneless, skinless, packed in olive oil, and have a very short ingredient list (Sardines, Pure Olive Oil, Salt) make them perfect. They are not too stinky (my office-mate who sits very close to me says they don't stink). They do smell a little - but I would think any canned fish product would have some kind of smell.<br /><br />I've been enjoying one can for lunch (sometimes with Popcorners chips [also available on Amazon] and they go nicely together). They are also great on their own, or on top of a salad. If you are not a huge fan of typical sardines, but want to enjoy their health benefits, I would suggest you try these. Their sodium content is quite low compared to other sardines. The fat is a bit higher, but that's from the (healthy) Olive Oil they are stored in. From the carton, one can of sardines is:<br /><br />99 gram serving (1 container):<br />Calories: 220; including: Calories from fat: 110<br />Fat: 12g; including: Saturated fat: 2.5g, and Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 15mg<br />Sodium: 280mg<br />Total carbohydrates: 0g; including: Dietary fiber: 0g, and Sugars: 0g<br />Protein: 26g<br /><br />Calcium: 6% Daily Value<br />Iron: 6% Daily Value<br /><br />Also, according to the carton, each can has 2g of OMEGA-3 fatty acids. I think I am going to sign up for the Subscribe & Save... they are worth the price!

review/text: Sardines sometimes have a bad reputation because the cheaper ones are smelly and covered in tomato sauce or mustard.  Crown Prince sardines are neither smelly nor "fishy" tasting, and because they are skinless and boneless, can be eaten on crackers, for example, and have the delicate flavor of a well-prepared salmon or tuna.  They furnish a high protein content as well as potassium, and are a good source of Omega-3.  I am starting a regimen of two to three cans per week with the intention of lowering my cholesterol numbers.  After trying two other brands, I am satisfied that Crown Prince is excellent in all ways and I need look no further.  And, of course, they are delicious.

review/text: My husband and I  receive a dozen cans of these sardines every three months.  Amazon's service in providing them with the "subscribe to and save" feature has been outstanding.  The sardines are a great snack, mostly on crackers.  There are usually four plump and can length sardines in each can, and being boneless, are easily flaked.  My husband likes them oily but I don't, so we pour off half of the oil before serving.  Nutritionally, each can (one serving) contains 2g of omega-3 fatty acids and 26g of protein, or about half of the RDA.  Not too shabby.  And most importantly, the taste is excellent, as I think anyone who tries them would agree.

review/text: I have never had sardines before, and wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by these. The sardines are firm and meaty, the flavor is great and the olive oil helps keep them moist and easy to swallow. Highly recommend!

review/summary: As sardines go ... delicious!
review/text: Compared to other sardines I've had over the years, these sardines are the tastiest. The best part is that everything in the container can be eaten - no need to remove bones or look at slimy coatings. The worst part is that the olive oil in the container can make the overall experience feel too oily. Be prepared to wash your hands after handling the container. Not a bad thing ... olive oil is good for your fingernails  :-) My first case will not be my last ...

review/summary: The Best
review/text: These (non-Kosher) sardines in the white box are the best. They are moist and tasty and cost a lot less than the Kosher version in the blue box. The Kosher sardines are slightly drier. In my opinion the non-Kosher skinless and boneless sardings taste better than the more expensive Kosher sardines. They stopped selling these in my local supermarket so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. Actually, the skin of sardines contains healthy oils and the bones are a great source of calcium. So, I guess the sardines with skin and bones are super healthy but I can't resist the delicious taste and texture of these skinless and boneless sardines. The taste the best. These are great for people who might be a little squeamish about trying sardines. I turned my landlord on to them. He was amazed having avoided them all his life. He especially likes them in addition to his stock of beans in his "bomb shelter" in case of some kind of disaster or social upheaval. If you subscribe to ordering on a regular basis you can save a ton of money especially if you want to prepare for armageddon (literally or figuratively). No joke.

review/summary: BEST "GOURMET" ALL BONELESS/SKINLESS SARDINES EVER EATEN
review/text: I am not a medical doctor-merely a science and medical researcher. What I have written is based on scientific text book findings, research, using myself as a guinea pig and consultations with medical specialists.<br /><br />REVIEW OF CROWN PRINCE NATURAL SKINLESS & BONELESS SARDINES IN PURE OLIVE OIL.<br /><br />Most of the general population need omegas every day. Good for brain, heart, muscles and joints, anemia prevention, plumping up skin (less wrinkles) and good lipid panels &lt;(re lipid panels-sometimes a Statin Drug is still advised by an MD if lipid panel is out of healthy range) Provides 52 percent of the desired/healthy protein intake. Protein promotes healing of skin injurys-cuts, bruises etc.<br /><br />CROWN PRINCE NATURAL SKINLESS & BONELESS SARDINES IN PURE OLIVE OIL, 3.75 OZ CAN are delicious especially when I start thinking about what they are doing for my body. One tin provides half of the protein one needs for a day- 26 grams=52 percent of your daily intake.<br /><br />I had to do a lot of researching to find what appears to be the healthiest sardine. I was looking for wild,  mercury free, (these are so low in mercury that I would have to say in my opinion "mercury free') skinless, boneless, packed in olive oil (another omega 3)<br /><br />Until I opened a can of these I had only experienced the yucky kind.<br /><br />Here is what you see and get when you peel back the tin. (Avise to open in the sink as the smell is not too appealing-I wash the tin right away and chuck in the garbage can outside) Truth is: Some healthy things do not have a great smell. I mean-come on- lets get real here: Would you want to kiss a girl/guy who had just eaten sardines, onions and garlic? All of these are healthy for you. Every doctor I have ever met with has garlic breath. They know they have it-but the benefits far outweigh the garlic breath!! Same with the RIGHT sardines.<br /><br />Okay veered off course as I tend to do when reviewing.<br /><br />Upon opening the can in the sink I saw four skinless, boneless/tuna colored sardines sitting in olive oil. I dumped the sardines and olive oil into a small bowl, then transfer to a plate with a large helping of tomatoes, sometimes sweet onions and one slice wheat bread. My little one loves them also (that is unbelievable-a kid loving sardines)<br /><br />I took my first bite and was pleasantly surprised. I ate the remaining portion-yes the olive oil too. Yummy. What a great mid-day snack or a meal if you wanted to have a salad and some steamed veggies on the side.<br /><br />Yes, they are a little pricey; however, my brain, heart,cardio system, muscles/joints and plump skin thanks me.<br /><br />I am on auto delivery-less expensive that way.<br /><br />Side Note: As with any food one decides to eat long term for health benefits one should consult with their doctor before proceeding-(e.g.) should you already suffer with a chronic illness it is always a good thing to let your doctor know) Also-Should I find any negatives re this brand Sardine I will revise my review. That is a promise.

review/summary: Crown Prince places fewer sardines in each can
review/text: For years until my last purchase, Crown Prince placed five large Moroccan sardines in each can. Now, this company is putting solely three sardines of a slightly different appearance in each can, accompanied by a much increased amount of tomato paste.<br /><br />This was a deplorable decision. Do executives of the company think that by adding more tomato paste, customers will not notice the 40% decline in the number of sardines posited in each can?

review/summary: This is not just eating, it's an experience!
review/text: I've been eating sardines since before I can remember.  My parents were big on sardines.  We used to eat Reese boneless & skinless in olive oil and that is what I bought for myself over the years, however, when they were out of stock I found these and they were having a promotion so I got them and WOW.  Now Reese is a good brand, but these Crown Price ones are less fishy tasting.  They taste like REAL food, not the normal hum-drum processed crap that America is producing.  I prepare them in my family's traditional way:  Chopped onions, garden tomatoes, a good-quality feta or gorganzola cheese crumbled and top with the sardines, oil and all. Give it a toss and serve with good whole grain bread for dunking. I would consider sardines a superfood and these are a very good quality version.  SIX stars if I could! On a side note, I am a big believer in food being your medicine and the source of your health.  I know that when I am sick (head cold, flu, etc) This meal makes me feel better.  It may be the onions (anti-viral, anti-baterial) and the tomatoes (vit C) but I swear by good sardines for health and wellness.

I called Crown Prince one day because for some reason we my son and I got this strange itching in our mouths after eating them one day (my other 2 children and husband were fine). Anyway, I called to ask them if there was a possibility that the sardines in that can were bad or something. They said that if everyone else was fine, they thought it was probably a type of allergic reaction. But, they still sent us a wonderful gift box full of stuff from their company! Very sweet of them an completely unnecessary. Anyway, I highly recommend this company and this product.

review/text: FYI, I bought these at the end of March and they have a Use By date at the beginning of July. That's not much time to use up nine boxes, and I'd be concerned if I didn't know better. These things last practically forever--here's no fat in them to go rancid, and they're in sealed plastic inside the box. One time I bought a large supply when a grocery store was going out of business, and I think I was still eating them after a year.<br /><br />To me, these are nicer than Wasa, Ryvita or Ry Krisp. They are very thin and crispy and you don't get that mouthful-of-sawdust feeling from them. They're very good for spreading a stiff cheese like cream cheese right out of the fridge, as they are sturdy and won't break up like a saltine would. Healthy, tasty, and a great price. Go for it!

review/text: Finn Crisp Caraway Crispbread are very tasty very thin "crackers" each 1 5/8 x 4 3/4. Finn Crisp are wonderful with melted cheese (about 20 seconds in a microwave).  They can be used anyway you'd use crackers, with the benefit that they are less fragile, less likely to spontaneous disintegrate with the first bite---so Finn Crisp are actually better than crackers for dips and spreads and such.  In fact, a very tasty, very healthy snack (if you aren't counting every calorie) is simply a thin layer of mayo on a Finn Crisp.<br /><br />I suppose Finn Crisp are healthy, a good source of fiber, with minimal processing, no preservatives, and such.  However, Finn Crisp are simply my favorite crackers.<br /><br />OTHER VARIETIES<br />Finn Crips Original has a slightly sour flavor, like (unseeded) rye, pumpernickle or sour dough bread.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJK0B6">Finn Crisp Original, Delicately Thin Rye Crispbread, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 9)</a>  In contrast Finn Crisp Caraway has the flavor of seeded rye bread (i.e., with caraway seeds).  If you prefer a milder flavor, try Finn Crisp Multigrain  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJHSQG">Finn Crisp Multigrain Thin Crisp, 6.2 Oz Boxes (Pack of 9)</a><br /><br />PRICE<br />$26 for a pack of 9 (or $21 if you sign up for a periodic shipment subscription) direct from Amazon is a fair price.  However, when Amazon is out-of-stock, I've seen the price as high as $42, which is excessive.<br /><br />Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.

review/summary: The best!
review/text: I've been buying these for several years and got them on subscription at Amazon. They always are fresh and excellent quality. Love the taste of this particular brand. I've tried other brands and various products of Finn Crisp, but I think the Thin Rye is the most authentic they can get. Highly recommend!

review/summary: The best cranberry sauce in the market!
review/text: I love this product -- and have since I was a child.  It's essential to the holiday season but I love it anytime of year as a side to chicken or turkey, however they may be prepared.  I just wish Amazon.com would offer it in bulk as they do so many other items.  It's not really offered at a good price on site anywhere that I've been able to find.  The price for one can was too high but I was really, really wanting some and couldn't get out to get it.  So ... for taste, it can't be beat.  But they could do better on the price and purchase options.

review/summary: How Did It Survive???
review/text: Stuffed in a box with peanuts, I still wonder how it survived. But, it did! Bent- because the pot was not attached to the box anywhere, it came alive and is starting to straighten out, except for the one small broken top branch. It is vibrant green, and even better than I expected, except for the dirt everywhere. THX!  I recommend that the seller learn how to wire the pot to the bottom inside flaps (it is not difficult), as this would achieve arrival of a perfect plant.

review/summary: Good deal on Parsley Aralia
review/text: The plants were exactly like the one pictured.  Each pot came with 3 stalks.  They arrived in good shape. While a bit pricey, they were quite full.  Shipping was reasonable, but that's because we ordered multiple plants, which cuts the shipping cost per plant significantly.<br /><br />They are planted in a potting mix that is a bit strange compared to what we usually see here in California. Looks like ground peat moss, but I can't say for sure. After watering the plants, they seem to dry out quickly, but we've had some rather hot weather here lately.  Maybe not peat moss.  We plan to move them into another pot with potting mix from around here.<br /><br />We have noticed a number of dropped leaves since they arrived. (2 weeks)  We know how to manage Aralias as we have over 10 currently around our house. (Ming, Fabian, False, and Parsley) So I'm not sure if it's just a change in location/climate or something else.<br /><br />These Parsley Aralias look somewhat different than the ones we bought about 8 years ago here in California. The leaves seem thicker and the plant is fuller. (Dense foliage) I'm not sure if it's due to different conditions/climate or fertilization, but they are not as light and airy looking as what we're used to.  We'll see over time if they change or stay the same.<br /><br />Overall.....a good purchase.

review/summary: misleading
review/text: On Sept. 10, 2012 I did receive my plants in good condition and it was beautiful, but it was not the correct plant.  Only the ad is misleading. The name of the plant is correct but the picture is not a Ming Aralia. The Ming Aralia has long feathery, lacey like leaves.  Out of the 4 small pictures that are posted below it, the first picture and also the large picture they advertise with are Parsley Aralia's the 3 smaller pictures are the Ming Aralia.  Also the plants I received had a plant tag that also said it was a Parsley Aralia.  But they are two total different looking plants. I contacted Hirts by phone the day I received them to tell them I got a Parsley Aralia and not a Ming Aralia they asked me to email pictures and to give them the order number and info I also included a copy of the packing slip that came with them and have yet to get an answer or even know if I will get the correct plant. I got this for my son, for his birthday so I don't know what I am going to do because it is not the Ming Aralia he wanted it is a Parsley Aralia.<br />Heard from seller and they are resending my plants, can't wait to get them.

review/summary: Diabetic testimonial
review/text: Being a type II diabetic is challenging when it comes to desserts. Concerned that I was consuming too many products using artificial sweeteners and while researching some other products (allergic to stevia and agave), I came across the SweetTree Blonde evaporated palm sugar which claims a glycemic index of 35. My body has had positive gylcemic reactions to sesame and coconut products and I made the purchase on faith that the glycemic load using this sugar versus artificial sweeteners would be similar. I made a batch of cookies using Splenda and another batch using the SweetTree blonde sugar and then tested my blood glucose.  I did this repeatedly over the course of about 7 days and was pleasantly surprised that my blood sugars in both cases were consistently within a few points of each other.  So, for my body I found this sugar to be just as good a substitute as splenda.  For my money, I would rather put something in me that is closer to nature. We use it now in our morning coffee and the company will be releasing a new liquid version of the product in the fall sometime.

review/summary: Vegan, organic sugar
review/text: Farmers produce coconut palm sugar by making slits in the buds of a coconut tree to collect the sap. The sap is boiled until it thickens and then dried into hard cakes, which are ground into powder (see photo of the sugar I posted above). Coconut palms grow under drought conditions in sandy soil. They not only use one-fifth the water and soil nutrients of sugar cane, they also enrich (vs. deplete) the soil and produce 50-70% more sugar per acre.<br /><br />The Big Tree Farms brand of coconut palm sugar is not mixed with any other type of sugar as some other brands are. It is a 100% organic, natural sweetener which is not filtered or bleached as white sugar is. When sugar is bleached, the process involves using ground up animal bones, thus, this non-bleached sugar is vegan.<br /><br />The major claim to fame of coconut palm sugar is that lab tests have apparently shown that this product has a glycemic index (GI) of 35, compared to agave nectar at 42, honey at 62, cane sugar (sucrose) at 64, and date sugar at 103. A low GI is 55 or less. A medium GI is 56 - 69. A high GI 70 or more.<br /><br />Those who are concerned about the environment and humane labor practices will approve of the fact that this product is sustainably produced by smallholder farmers on the island of Java, Indonesia. All of the money earned from growing, harvesting and processing this sugar stays in the local community that produces it, and Big Tree Farms states on their website that they work directly with international, non-governmental organizations to create and maintain supply chains for this product that are "transparent and socially equitable."<br /><br />I purchased this particular brand of coconut palm sugar as a substitute for white and brown sugar in dessert recipes because my husband is a vegan and I'm on a "mostly vegan" diet. I have uploaded photos above to show the chocolate cookies I made using this sugar. (Note that I also substituted coconut oil for butter.) My husband and I love the taste and texture of these cookies, and I will definitely continue using this product.<br /><br />If you are not a vegan or vegetarian, there are two issues that might affect your decision as to whether to invest in this product:<br /><br />First, the claim of a very low GI of 35: Big Tree Farms states on their website the following: "pure, organic coconut palm sugar is typically 70-79% sucrose, 3-9% glucose, and 3-9% fructose." They also state that they believe the high sucrose content is what makes the GI level so low. I find this explanation confusing, because this product is touted as a healthy substitute for table sugar, which is 100% sucrose. The logic of how this sweetener, which is 80% sucrose, can have only 55% of the GI rating of table sugar that is 100% sucrose makes no mathematical or scientific sense to me.<br /><br />Second, the high cost: If you are not a vegan or vegetarian, I'm not convinced that the presumed health benefits of this sugar make it worth the extra cost and hassle of obtaining it. You can conveniently buy brown sugar at your local supermarket for about 89 cents per pound and white sugar for about 38 cents per pound--and they often go on sale. That's really cheap, and the GI is not "high"--it is "medium" at 64. In contrast to that low cost, this product sells for between $4-$5/pound. Since a pound of any kind of granulated sugar consists of 2-1/4 cups, that comes to $1.78-$2.22/cup for this product compared to 40 cents/cup for brown sugar and 17 cents/cup for white sugar.<br /><br />But, you might ask, isn't refined sugar bad for you, and isn't this much-less-refined sugar good for you? Actually, few health experts believe that any sugar outside of that found in whole, unprocessed fruits and vegetables is healthy. But few of us have the willpower to completely give up sweets. Hence the goal of trying to keep the GI levels as low as possible while eating them. A much cheaper way to do that than buying this sugar is to use a couple of tricks I learned during the years I spent on the Zone and Atkins diets: (1) Bake your sweets with any sugar you please and consume protein at the same time you eat the sweets in a Zone or Atkins ratio. (2) Make the baked goods themselves have a definitely lower GI by decreasing the carbs and increasing the protein content. Substitute stevia, lo han guo and sugar alcohols for table sugar, and plain protein powder for wheat flour (which has a GI of about 71).<br /><br />If you are completely convinced that "natural" sugar is healthier than table sugar, this product is certainly less expensive than some other alternative sweeteners you can buy and doesn't have some of the problems they cause when substituting them for table sugar in baked-goods recipes. For example, lo han guo (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013JV5LK">Slim Sweet</a>) sells for around $17-$22/pound and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGWIH0">stevia</a> sells for between $54-$70/pound (both of these are also vegan, by the way). Marketers of lo han guo and stevia claim that those sweeteners are over 200 times as sweet as table sugar. I personally find this claim to be grossly inflated. To my own taste and that of my family, lo han guo is about 8 times as sweet as table sugar, and stevia is about 16 times as sweet. Regardless, the fact that they are so much sweeter than table sugar means that if you try and substitute them for it in a recipe, since you don't need nearly as much of them, the texture and "mouth feel" of the finished product simply isn't the same. For uncooked foods, though, such as smoothies, tea and coffee, lo han guo and stevia are great.<br /><br />In contrast to lo han guo and stevia for baking, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OSSV8G">sucanat</a> (at about $2.60/pound), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M4ALP8">date sugar</a> (at about $4/pound), and this product have the same sweetness as table sugar and can be substituted in a ratio of 1:1 in recipes for cakes and cookies, allowing the recipe to retain a similar taste and texture to what it has when made with table sugar. Sucanat, however, has about the same GI as table sugar, and date sugar's GI is through the roof at 103, the same as for dates, because it is made from finely ground dates.

review/text: I agree w/ others that it may be less expensive at a local health food store, but I had already put in my order at Amazon when I discovered this. I do not have access to a Whole Foods store. The flavor is a bit caramel-like and the texture is fine powder to coarse granules. It is 35 on the glycemic index, so I plan to use it on foods that I don't want to use stevia on. I haven't baked w/ it yet, but I can tell it would make wonderful peanut butter cookies and oatmeal raisin ones. I hope as it becomes more popular that it comes down from five bucks a pound to a comparable price of other organic sugars.

review/summary: Tastes good, but there's bugs in mine!
review/text: This is my first ever product review. I did not purchase this product from Amazon, but my local Whole Foods market just a couple days ago. Normally I'm not one to do reviews, but since this product is so expensive, I wanted to share my experience.<br /><br />I've been working really hard recently to cut my sugar intake. After reading rave reviews on Amazon about Sweet Tree Coconut Palm sugar, and doing a little research, I debated for 2 weeks, and then decided to just go get some even though it was $5 for a pound. (my health is more important) I started out by using some in my steel cut oats yesterday, which I really liked! I also used it in my coffee yesterday in place of regular sugar, but I noticed little dark things floated to the top. I know it's pretty raw, so I figured, maybe they were little fibers from the tree, or perhaps it was something with that batch of coffee? So I just scooped the little dark floaters out, and drank my coffee. Which tasted pretty good with the palm sugar! I was so pleased, that I was very excited to have my coffee this morning with my new found sweetener.<br /><br />This morning (not more than 10 minutes ago) I made some coffee again with my palm sugar, and before I even had a chance to drink it... more little floaters! As I pushed them to the sides of my white cup, one I noticed for sure had LEGS on it! Yes, my friends... it was a BUG!! I dumped my coffee imediately, and made some more with(unfortunately) my raw organic sugar that I still have. No floaters. So it's definitely not in the coffee... it's in the palm sugar! Has anyone else had an experience/noticed this? I know it's supposed to be healthier and all... but for $5 I'd like my sugar to not have little bugs in it. That's NOT the extra minerals I had in mind! Maybe I just got a bad bag?  It's not my intention to bad mouth this company -- but I would want someone to tell me if they knew I was eating/drinking little bugs. I haven't contacted the company just yet, as I just noticed it for sure this morning. I also looked in the bag that I have, and can see others... one is caked in sugar crystals, so they're hard to notice unless you really look for them.

review/summary: Tastes great but didn't digest well.
review/text: I do not do well with any product that contains sugar alcohols. Based on what I'd read about palm sugar, I don't think it's a sugar alcohol, but my body sure acted like I had ingested sugar alcohols. I had the same gastrointestinal distress that I have when I eat sugar alcohols. Just to be sure it was the product and not some other influence, I waited until my system cleared and tried again; same reaction.<br />With regard to taste, this was great. I liked the lower than average glycemic index for sweeteners. It baked well in cookies, and dissolved well in liquids. The package says NOT to use it if you're diabetic though, so I don't think this is intended to be a 'non-sugar sugar.'<br />I'd say if you can handle sugar alcohols and you're not diabetic, give this a try. It just didn't work for me.

review/summary: Sweet Tree Evaporated Palm Sugar
review/text: I originally bought this product when it was discontinued at Whole Foods.  Now they don't seem to even be able to special order it for me, so I order it from Amazon and get free shipping.<br /><br />I've changed my diet due to cancer.  Originally I was using agave, then stevia, but have switched to the palm sugar, especially since it bakes so well.  I have to say that I'm a little - well, maybe a lot - confused about fructose, sucrose, and glucose, so I'm trusting their website explanation about the glycemic levels.<br /><br />But all of that said, I love this product.  I have adapted cookie recipes to include this sugar in lieu of both the white and brown sugar, and then use combinations of different flours to replace the white flour.  I've tried peanut butter, oatmeal raisin, and muesli chocolate chip cookies.  I love how it works with this sugar.  The flours I've used recently for the oatmeal raisin cookies were a third quinoa, brown rice, and millet.  They turned out great.

review/summary: Sweet Tree coconut palm sugar
review/text: Hi All, I know coconut Palm sugar is all the rage now but be aware of some things. I have been purchasing this product for years way before Dr.Oz suggested it. When I first bought it, the package was labeled organic coconut palm sugar. I loved the stuff and used it in all my cooking I was even able to make homemade chewing gum with it. Then all of the sudden I can't find the regular coconut palm sugar. It is now labeled "blonde" or some other title, which at the time I didn't think anything of it until I cooked with it. Everything I used it for came out tasting really salty. I have suspicions that they are using fillers in it such as salt or even regular sugar etc. If anyone knows a food scientist I would love for them to check it out because I believe there is a high amount of salt in the product now. That's why all of the sudden they are labeling it "blonde" I believe they are falsely advertising that it is 100% palm sugar. There is no doubt that there is a high amount of salt in it. I know the difference because I have been cooking with the real stuff for a long time. Something seems pretty fishy to me with this company so I have decided to try another brand. It seems to me that once the producers and everyone else figured they could make some big bucks with this product,they started coming up with some short cuts. Other than that though, I love the product and it definitely has a lower glycemic rate.

review/summary: I like this...
review/text: This product isn't cheap, but it tastes good. It tastes a lot like brown sugar, in my opinion.<br /><br />I bought it to use in meals for my mother, who has been confined to bedrest and was recently diagnosed as a diabetic. So far, I have only used it to make a lower-carb poppyseed dressing for the chicken slaw she likes so much. When the weather is cool enough to bake, I'd like to make her some coconut meringues using partly this sugar, and partly something else such as Splenda or xylitol.<br /><br />My mom takes Glucophage and has had fairly good blood sugar levels when she eats reasonably, so I'm probably not the best qualified to comment as to how it could affect someone whose diabetes is more severe.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be for the company to consider going with a different bag, since the zip-close top on this doesn't work, and I'm keeping it in another bag. FYI, the carbs listed for this product are the same as regular brown sugar, although I understand different carbs metabolize differently.

review/summary: Not too sweet!
review/text: I found this palm sugar the my local grocery store while I was on a coconut kick, and thought it was worth a try. I am so glad I did! I found I really dislike the taste of white sugar, and am not fond of things made with it. I love palm sugar! It doesn't have the overpowering sweet taste that white sugar has, I love the flavor it adds to my coffee and oatmeal! I don't find that I need to add too much since I feel the flavor it has more than compensates for the light sweetness. I have not really done any baking with it because I typically use honey for that. If you are looking for a white sugar replacement then maybe you should keep looking, but if you find it too sweet or processed tasting you might enjoy palm sugar.

review/text: I'm giving this 3 star because it tastes good....BUT &  However, if you are purchasing this because it's supposed to be low glycemic, it says right on the package that the glycemic value fluctuates and they don't recommend it for diabetics.  I'm disappointed.

review/text: Like everyone else here, I liked the lower glycemic index and the fact that it is not processed and bleached sugar.  Love the taste, although I sprinkled it on some strawberries and that wasn't so great ("white" sugar still has its place).  Baked up well in muffins.  Thumbs up!

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  It's not as sweet as brown sugar, and it's more grainy, but it's a good substitute.  If you're looking for a sweetener that doesn't spike your insulin in a recipe that calls for brown sugar, this works.

review/summary: Coconut Palm Sugar
review/text: The price is right (especially compared to specialty grocery store prices), delivery was prompt and the product is very fresh.<br /><br />I've been using coconut palm sugar for over a year now primarily because coconut palm sugar is a tastier and possibly healthier and more sustainable substitute for granulated or brown sugar. There are also reports that it is lower on the glycemic index than processed cane sugar. While the recommended ratio is 1:1, I typically reduce the ratio by 25% to 50%. The flavor is similar to that of brown sugar.<br /><br />If I had a large family to feed it would be a harder choice due to the cost, but we are now empty-nesters, so the added cost is minimal.

review/text: I had read about the nutritional benefits of using palm sugar as opposed to refiined cane sugar and was intrigued.  I tracked down this product at a local organic food store and was incredibly pleased with the caramel-like flavor!  I have subsequently signed up for "subscribe & save" deliveries of the 6-pack offered here on Amazon, and have been enjoying this product ever since!

review/text: I get this for my Mother who has diabetes, she loves it and it has not cause her any sugar issues. She really likes it in her coffee.<br /><br /> I have found it better than sugar for baking spiced cookies/cakes/breads/pies (it makes awesome zucchini bread), it imparts a rich sorta brown sugar (but better) taste and is great for anything you would use brown sugar in.<br /><br />I give most of my order to my Mom, but I have started keeping a bag or two for myself to replace brown sugar in my foods, I figure it can't hurt my family to diversify our sweetener sources.

review/summary: No more hot flashes!
review/text: Amazing difference using a low glycemic index "sugar". I experience hot flashs with 1-2 teaspoons of sugar in decaf coffee or tea.  When I switched to coconut palm sugar based on the advice of a friend not - no more personal summers. Just great taste. A little price, but worth the money, and worth the investment in my health.
