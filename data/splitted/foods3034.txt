review/text: I can't always find these at the store, so thanks Amazon!  At 10grms of protein, they aren't too shabby for day when I'm running out the door in the morning without breakfast.  I especially like the strawberry flavor, it is one of those rare nice strawberry flavors that does not taste too artificial or too grainy.  It's not perfect, but it certainly is better than most and doesn't give me that artificial strawberry heartburn.

review/summary: Wow Great Cookies!
review/text: Ok, I said great cookies and I mean it. I got a box for Valentines day. I love orange flavored chocolate and these have a wonderful chocolate coating. Not a cheap chocolate, a really nice lightly orange flavored chocolate coating over a very crisp fortune cookie. Not a stale fake vanilla flavored one like you often get from restaurants. A nice crunchy not too sweet cookie under just the right amount of smooth dark orange flavored chocolate. You will have to stop yourself eating more than one at a sitting. The fortunes are simple, "you will travel far away", or "The sooner you start the faster you finish" that sort of thing but who needs a fortune with they have these lovely cookies with their tea or hot cocoa? I am looking forward to trying the other varieties from this company.

review/summary: Very Good. Try It Full Strength.
review/text: My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market has a special section of shelves having items they are trying to get rid of (for whatever reason) by offering them at discounted prices. Well, I love a good bargain so I always drift by the shelves. About a month ago they had a few cans of Manischewitz Condensed Chicken Broth (10.5 ounces) so I picked one up. That's something I can always use and it has a long shelf life. I used it today as an ingredient in soup. It was excellent. My feeling was it was superior to brands I've used in the past, but I have no way of testing that statement. In any case, my reaction was quite favorable. Maybe it seemed so good because I didn't notice it was condensed and I used it full strength.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Works great! But how does it compare to Solofill?.... Read on
review/text: This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)<br /><br />EcoBrew VS Solofill<br /><br />First off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own "stand" in order to fill it properly.

review/summary: This filter works PERFECT!
review/text: Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the "old fashion way" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size.<br /><br />I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Amazon, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

review/summary: Ekobrew Washer Hack
review/text: When first ordering a couple of ekobrew cups, I had high hopes that they would make my recent hand-me-down Keurig B44 a viable alternative to my Cuisinart drip machine. But, my hopes were quickly dashed upon first use. The second cup wasn't much better. Third time's a charm, right? Wrong. Things were just not good.<br /><br />I experienced many of the same problems that are mentioned in other reviews: leaky, messy brew, and weak coffee. I was pretty disappointed in the prospects of my new Keurig adventure, but was also determined to make this work and, after some experimentation, I did. The solution is a tiny washer.<br /><br />If you look inside the upper clamshell of your Keurig machine, you'll see the injector needle that punctures the top of standard k-cups. Around this needle is a gasket that presses against the top of k-cups to form a seal. This gasket is the problem. It does not put enough pressure on the cap of the ekobrew to form an adequate seal, causing water and coffee to spew out from the cap. To fix this, slide the gasket down and off of the injector needle (use caution as the needle is sharp), slide a washer up onto the needle, then slide the gasket back on. Your leaky, messy brew should now be a thing of the past.<br /><br />The washer hack also made my coffee noticeably stronger, but additional solutions may be required to satisfy your desired strength. Prior to putting in the washer, I began tamping the coffee in the ekobrew cup. That helped, and I still continue to tamp even after the installation of the washer.<br /><br />The washer I used is rubber, 1/16" thick, 5/32" inside diameter, and 3/8" outside diameter. Specifically, I used a washer from Lowes with item number 136493.

review/summary: Good Product and Excellent Customer Service
review/text: At first, we did not get along.  It spit and spewed in our B60 and made me mad that I had paid full price for two of these new K-cup replacements.  Good coarse grind, check.  No grounds around lid before closing, check.  Not too full, check.  Seated properly in Keurig, check.<br />My best guess was that the lid was not sealing properly because there was a little wiggle room when closed, so I contacted the company by email and asked if a replacement seal would help.  I was delighted when they offered to send replacement Ekobrews.  The next morning, we tried something different.  We removed, cleaned and replaced the rubber piece that surrounds the needle that inserts into K-cups in the top of the machine.  That helped, a lot.  The next cup we decided to try turning the Ekobrew around so that the hinge was at the front of the machine.  Perfection!  I cannot explain why, but it worked.  I did let them know right away that replacements were not necessary, but they were already in the mail!<br />We now have an alternative to K-cups that makes a great tasting cup of coffee, can handle enough to brew a nice strong travel mug full and is easy to fill and clean.  We will continue buy K-cups when the price is right, but when it isn't we can still have great, single cup coffee without breaking the bank.<br />Just as a note, we tried the Solofill, which is a good product, but it just did not hold quite enough coffee for a happy mug.

review/summary: great design
review/text: Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.

review/summary: Perfect!
review/text: This one is well thought out - perfect in every way!  I threw my old "My K-cup" out in the trash.  Did you know that some of the new Keurig brewers, such as the B-40, were redesigned a little?  Yes, and the new brewers don't allow the My K-Cups from Keurig to fit properly.  I called Keurig on this - and their customer service team says "some of the brewers were redesigned with slight changes that don't allow the My K-Cups to fit.  You have to move a small gasket down each time you switch between your K-Cups and your My K-Cup.  We don't have a new My K-Cup that works - so you need to just use this "work around" for the time being."  Now with my Eco-Brew - problems solved!  That's because it's the exact same size as the K-Cups!  No more changing the adapter in and out.  It works better too!  Coffee is stronger!  No more "hole down the middle" with weak coffee and wasted grounds that were never used.  Whoever designed this was a genius..... and too bad for Keurig they didn't think of it!

review/summary: AH-MAZING!!
review/text: WOW - we got our keurig as a gift and with the gift was a big box of the k-cups with all the eh, average tasting coffees...but once those ran out we would never be the people to spend that much money on coffee every month. so we have been using the solofil for about 8 months. we hated it and because of it, hated the keurig. the coffee we buy (the strongest roast from starbucks) was always watery and the solofil would leak all the time and it was such a pain to clean. but we put up with it. ENTER the ekobrew! omg this thing is amazing. i don't know what makes it so much different and i don't care -i just care that we get an amazing cup of coffee from our machine now!  SUCH  a difference. we used to use the solofil twice for one cup of coffee - we would make two of the smallest cups to make it as strong as possible. not anymore!! highly recommend! buying 2 more!

review/summary: Techno-BEST
review/text: My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.  Kudos to these guys.

review/summary: Excellent brew, economical too!
review/text: With the price of coffee continually rising, I've been on a search for a replacement to the expensive K cups for some time.  Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!

review/summary: Most flavorful chili powder on the planet
review/text: I always used Gephardt Chili Powder when I lived in California and never thought much about it. It wasn't until I moved and could no longer find it in the grocery stores that I realized how good it really is. For years family members would pick me up some every time they visited California. When that option ceased and after throwing out bottle after bottle of inferior chili powders after using them once, I am thrilled to find it available online. Chili powder is not all about heat. Gephardt's provides a much richer and fuller flavor in addition to the heat. According to history, William Gephardt, originally of New Braunfels, Texas and later of San Antonio invented the first commercial chili powder in 1896, but very little else is known about him; he apparently sold out to a brother-in-law and disappeared from the scene. His chili powder nonetheless remains popular today with a cult following.

review/summary: Gebhardt Chili Powder ->>> Six Pack
review/text: Gebhardt's is the best chili powder I have found for making my authentic chili - and all my other southwest cooking favorites.  It has richer flavor, just the right touch of "hotness" without overpowering the sauce or meat. Used to have to bug friends in Texas to send a good supply of it for the years I didn't visit Austin.  Now i buy it online. Note: the other reviewers who said it is expensive did not notice that you get six (6) 3 oz bottles - not one.  So at $4 a bottle times the 6, it is a fair price.

We don't have Gebhardt brand available in Oklahoma so I'm happy to find it available online. The pricing isn't as competetive as I'd like to see -but since there aren't many choices online.....It's probably priced as competetive as it needs to be. I only found one online retailer with 12 pak cases available for purchase and one retailer with 6 pack cases available. -I went with the six pack as you will really want it to be as fresh as possible.

review/summary: Nice flavor, mild!
review/text: This chili powder is the first "different" brand I have ever used.  I usually get the giant containers of Tone's at the local Sam's Club which I have always thought was pretty good...not great but there are not many varieties available around here where we live and I really don't like running all over town just to find a chili powder!  I have been hearing about this "Chasen's" Chili for 50+ years.  I had always been told you "have to have" Gebhardt's Chili Powder to make it authentic!!  I searched for years to find this stuff and finally found it on Amazon. It was out of stock and  I was on the waiting list for many months before it was back in stock.<br />  The price is the "only" thing I did not like about it.  When I put my name on the waiting list....it was around $16.00 for the 6 small bottles...not exactly sure of the price but it was around $16.00 and no higher...but when it came back in stock I was astounded at the increase..with shipping the cost was around $32.00!!!!!  The high price "is not worth it" and I am not sure if I will buy it again!!  I do have 6 bottles of it so I might not need it for quite a long while!!!<br />  It is a very tasty Chili Powder but it is quite  mild.  It has a lot smoother taste than the darker Tones powder and we enjoyed the difference in taste very much.  We loved the Chasen's Chili...I got some really wonderful comments on it...my husband said that it was the best he has ever eaten!!!!  Then I noticed  in my Chasen's recipe I also needed a "special" brand of Cumin...no way!!  I am not searching all over the internet or town again for cumin.  I used Tones again, and this Chili came out great.  The recipe called for 1/2 cup of the Gebhardt's Chili Powder...I used 3/4 cup and it was great...it could have used more in my opinion...it was that mild...not tasteless....just mild.  I feel like I can use this powder in a lot of other recipes.  And it is great sprinkled on a Cheeseburger!!!  Honest!!  :)<br />  I am going to try and find this powder another place...this price here on Amazon is just to high for what you get and what it is. You get 6...3 ounce bottles.  But it is good...so if you can get a friend, neighbor or co-worker to go in on it with you that would be the way to buy it!!  It is good so you can't really go wrong with it!!  Like I said...it's the "cost" that is the draw-back!!

review/text: I make my own chili. I have done so because I have GERD and Gebhardt's is the ONLY chili powder I will use. Like many have said, I have thrown away batches of chili made with other powders, and subsequently thrown away the powders. I have even tried to make my own from dried chilis, mexican oregano, etc. It isn't the same.<br /><br /> So until you get Gebhardt's I will wait on making chili. It is that important. Like many other's I cannot get it here in Ohio, they just don't carry this product beyond the west coast. I usually go on a buying spree when I hit CA, OR, or WA to stock up on this stuff. I just wish Connagra would realize that they needs to expand their selling base to include other areas in the US, outside of the west coast for this chili powder!<br /><br />Just incase you wanted to know, my sister in law is Mexican, originally from Texas. My chili recipe comes from her mom ; ). Good stuff!

review/text: Fast shipping.  Can't get this chili powder by me here in Chicago.  Needed to finally try it after having seen a few recipes calling for this brand.  I also order Pendery's Top Hat and Fort Worth Light at the same time from their website.  Pendery's is way better in my opinion.  Gebhardt's is just ok.

review/summary: Simon Coll "spanish" hot chocolate
review/text: I bought this product, since I just came from my vacation in Spain and had there my churros with the hot chocalate "a la taza" style, which is a very thick dark chocolate taste. But this product does NOT come nearly close to the real taste. It is super light flavored, kind of sour and once is done it starts to "desintigrate" or crumble, like when milk becomes sour with its lumps and sour taste. Didn't like it at all. Wouldn't recomend to anyone!

review/summary: A Surprisingly Refreshing Gift!
review/text: I received this as a gift from the company and, of course, immediately sniffed and tasted it.<br /><br />A friend of ours gave us a soda stream machine because he was tired of it. It makes soda water (or "fuzzy water" as one of my kids said when they were a toddler) and we added a bit less than the recipe called for. We went with a 2 parts mix to 1 part soda water/carbonated water mixture. It was really great! I'm not a big drinker (I'm only about 5'4", not big at all) and the soda water mix was wonderful. It was like  fruit punch soda without all the syrupy sugary aftertaste, or the red teeth.<br /><br />The bottle gives you some other recipes, but we really enjoyed it in it's simpler form. The things we thought about adding were:<br /><br />*Mint leaves (Mint will overgrow your house and steal your car keys if let out of a container. You find yourself finding more and more uses for the stuff when you're pulling hunks of it out of your linen closet when you find it growing there)<br /><br />*Cranberry juice<br /><br />*Citrus wedges, and my thoughts were along the cinnamon/allspice route.<br /><br />If you want a nice light soda, this mix plus soda water seems to be perfect in hot weather. No chemical after taste from some fake sweetener that will make your toes fall off in 20 years, either.<br /><br />At some point, I'll try the adult beverage versions of the recipes, and I'll let you know how they turned out. Well, depending on how things go, I might post a while afterwards to ensure legibility and intelligibility of my review. It's tough to take someone's review seriously when they slur their typing.

review/text: I am an insulin-dependent diabetic so I use Pez candies in my purse/car for those times when I need to eat candy and need to know the exact carb count (it's 9 grams per roll).  Pez are discreet and usually quite tasty but somehow the Cola flavored Pez taste somewhat medicinal to me.  All tastes are personal so mine might just be "off" but I know that I won't be reordering this particular flavor.  I love the Chocolate flavor, the "sour" flavors and all the original flavors - this one just fell a tad shy for my personal taste.

review/text: Parthenon sent me these Turkish olives by mistake; I had ordered the Greek ones by Angel that are in a glass jar.  I can seen why Ziyad CANS these instead of using glass.  Nobody would buy these brown-spotted, small olives floating in an unappetizing 'stew' of what looks like lemon wedges and a few green finger peppers.  The flavor is reminiscent of tin, with sour lemon. UGH !  Too much of a hassle to pay to mail them back, I just accepted a refund because these olives cost less than the brand I ordered, and much deservedly so.  If I could give them a zero rating, I would.

review/summary: Always a satisfying treat
review/text: The Chocolate Chip Snack Cakes are one of the few treats from my childhood that are just as good as I remember them being when I was 10 years old (back in the late 80s). Little Debbie hasn't messed with the recipe and I hope they never do because it's perfect. Ultra dark chocolate cake, simple sweet layer of vanilla cream, all covered in hard white icing and sprinkled with a few mini chocolate chips. So delicious. The perfect size, too. One snack cake satisfies my sweet tooth for the day and is not TOO bad in terms of calories (just don't fool yourself into thinking one twin pack = one serving size!) These used to be a favorite dessert item in my lunchbox and they are still a favorite today - for me and my husband both! :)

review/summary: Tasty cookies, a few got broken.
review/text: Several reviews have pointed out the fact that some of their cookies were broken up inside the jar and it's true that some of mine have been broken in their packaging, however none have been absolutely pulverized and let's face it, they're going to be broken up by your teeth anyway.<br /><br />The cookies in this jar are just like the ones you're given on flights by several airlines. They have a nice cinnamon taste and a really great texture too. They're not overpowering and at the same time not addicting, you can munch on a couple and then stop without being disappointed.<br /><br />The jar isn't anything special, it's just a plastic bucket. It holds the cookies, nothing more. I typically take mine out of the plastic bucket and put them in something else (in my case an antique Planter's Peanut jar) a little more hardy to help protect the cookies better. If you knock the plastic bucket over you'll probably break up several cookies inside, which is inconvenient but won't ruin anyone's day.

review/text: This review refers to the plastic "cookie jar."  The cookies are good, but the cheap plastic cookie jar has a lid that is almost impossible to get opened.  I finally managed to open it by working a screw driver under the edge to pop it open.  The jar is not suitable for reuse as either a cookie jar or a kitchen cannister because of the difficulty in opening the top.  If you are buying a gift, I would recommend one of the other products.  I would note that the cannisters all have very tight fitting tops (I ordered two others besides the cookie jar).<br /><br />Maybe this is the latest in childproof lids.  A young child would have extreme difficulty getting the container open.

How wrong I was...subtle (can you use that word when referring to a cracker?) and light, these crackers can be offered at nouveau riche cocktail parties, and no one attending would even guess that they are "Ritz". They even are terrific with no topping whatsover, which is how I scarf them, due to the fact that I am bourgeois, and do not give nor attend cocktail parties. I can only dream of the little black dress- in the meantime, I'll be crumbin' up my little black kitchen table with these babies.

review/summary: Strange...
review/text: Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say "man I can sure go for some raman", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.

review/text: I bought these swirl lollipop suckers for my son's Birthday party. They looked good, and seeing how fast they went, they must of tasted good too. However, looking at the image you would imagine them bigger than they ended up being. Cut the lollipop sticks to about half the size you see in that image, and make the actual lollipop part a bit smaller as well. They were fine though. They looked okay, but not the same as the image, that's for sure. Their colors and patterns were slightly different too. This wouldn't be such a big deal, except for the fact that I had spent more getting these than for some other suckers,because I thought these were bigger and better looking. Oh well. They turned out fine in the end. I'm guessing no one looked at them and analyzed how they might be better.

This review, which covers all six listings, is 5 stars for the product - some of the listings deserve less and I'll tell you why.  B000F8GWR2 is for twelve 7 ounce packages (5.25 lbs), B001ASEWQE is for a 1.2 pound tub, B0017D3TJS is a 17 ounce plastic, lidded bowl; the others are 5 pound bags.<br /><br />B001ASEWQE and B0017D3TJS have only one thing going for it: it comes in a tub.  But you have bowls, right?  So, the tub's not exciting and the price there is too high when you factor in shipping.  When shipping is charged by weight, it matters that the listing for B000NMG2LQ claims its shipping weight as 7 pounds, while the rest of the 5 pound packages say 6 - unless the box weighs over a pound, 6 is correct and the renegade 7 pounder is just dipping into your pocket.  Still it's B000HROH2I that is really ripping you off, with $17.93 in shipping charges.  The best deal turns out to be straight from Amazon, with B000F8GWR2 showing me $8.53 in shipping - and the potential for free shipping.  Of the 6, only the one from Amazon makes any sense to buy as a consumer; the others might make sense to a wholesaler, although I can't see how - the best price is the best price!  And, of course, look into the prices yourself because they're subject to change and by the time you read this, they might be completely different.<br /><br />Jolly Rancher candies, particularly the original hard candy flavors, are great.  The flavors are strong enough so that each flavor is distinct, unlike so many other candies.  Watermelon tastes like watermelon, cherry like cherry - these things are literally mouth-watering, in the best way.  Individual wrapping keeps them clean when little hands dig for their personal favorite.  Personally, I've been stocking up on them as part of my plan to quit smoking; it'll certainly make quitting a delicious experience, especially as my taste buds recover.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: My Pup Can't Get Enough of Them
review/text: My Rottweiler is allergic to almost every animal protein on the planet. So far, he is doing ok with whitefish and salmon. That is why this treat is so good. It does smell strongly of fish, it smells good. Its got a crunchy texture, its unlike any other pup treat I've found. My pup loves it, when I take the bag out of the pantry he runs to the kitchen and sits for his treat. Don't even have to call him.<br />The 28oz resealable bag is great, the treats last a long time. If your pup has allergies, you may want to think about giving this one a chance. Guaranteed, your pup will love them.

review/summary: dogs and cats love these!
review/text: my 3 dogs and 1 cat really love these treats. I can't find them locally so order via amazon. a 28oz bag is huge and will last a long time. each treat is about the size of a quater and 1/4" thick or so. they're hard crunchy treats and smell very strongly of salmon. I keep them in a zip-lock bag so I don't have to smell them all the time. I love that these are all natural and grain free treats (especially w/ all the pet food recalls going on now), and my pets just can't seem to get enough of them.

One thing to remember, try to crush these up finely, leaving to big of flakes causes some serious discomfort the next morning.

review/text: I love Duplo.  I have travelled to Germany twice because my relatives live there.  Everytime I am there I bring a lot of this home with me.  They also bring some to me when they come.  These are THE best wafer / chocolates you will ever eat.  A lot of German chocolate is made with Hasselnuss.. I mean Hazlenuts..  Anyway, if you like these, you are definetly going to love Milka my fave Sahne-Creme).  They are to die for and I screamed and called my mom when I found these on amazon.  I would also reccommend Ritter Sport (my fav is butter biscuit),  Ritter is becoming more mainstream and I have found it at a few local grocery stores (it is not as good as Milka though).<br /><br />I close my eyes and take a bite and I can feel me sitting in my cousins house overlooking the green pastures of the tiny village of Weissenbach in Southern Germany...

It's like going back to a Hershey bar after having a European Cadbury Milk Bar.<br /><br />Just go to a World Market and get a Duplo, Bueno, Cadbury Milk, Flake, and Crunchy. Trust me.

review/summary: Lunchtime Delight
review/text: Turkish delight is a soft-ball sweet with a consistency between gummy candy and caramel. When bitten, it is supposed to come away with short strings or peaks. Traditionally, the flavors are floral or citrus. It is cut into cubes two centimeters by two centimeters by two centimeters, packed in caster/confectioner's sugar, and wrapped in cooking parchment.<br /><br />As candy goes, Turkish delight is highly susceptible to the environmental conditions under which its made, sometimes stiffer. Sultan's Turkish Delight is actually marvelously even in its production. Sultan's Turkish Delight is also the western European style of Turkish delight, where the interior of the cube is the perfect consistency, and the outside of the cube is rubbed to firmness with confectioner's sugar. This treatment prevents the eater getting sticky fingers, but does not recommend Sultan's as the Turkish delight to feed to messy children or to sneak before a meeting. Rather, Sultan's is the Turkish delight to serve at a lunch with friends, or with hot drinks, fruit, and cheeses for a movie night.<br /><br />Sultan's rose and lemon assortment is a good choice if some of the diners have never tried Turkish delight before. Where the rose cubes are distinctly sweet, the lemon cubes have a slight tartness that cuts the sweetness, almost the flavor of lemon curd. Unlike many modern flavors, this Turkish delight does not contain chunks of nuts or slivers of citrus rind.<br /><br />Four Stars: Western European Turkish delight with an ultra-sweet twist.

review/text: "Legend has it that in his endeavor to cope with all his wives a certain Sultan summoned all his confectionery experts and ordered them to produce a unique dessert to add to his collection of secret recipes for which he was famous. As a result of extensive research Turkish Delight was born."<br /><br />The ingredients are as basic as sugar, water and starch, but the flavor is smooth, slightly soft and sticky and dreamy floral sweet. It is impossible to imagine how such perfection evolves from the list of ingredients. The Turkish Delights in this beautifully designed box are flavored with lemon or rose.<br /><br />The rose flavor is especially exotic and transports you to lands of mystery and intrigue. My husband usually eats the lemon ones. The beautiful box and the sweet delicious confections make this an excellent gift for anyone you want to spoil. I usually buy just one box but if you add a small item you can have four boxes with no shipping charges. What a deal!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

They are advertised as 4-5 inches, but they are really 3-4 inches - mostly 3-3 1/2, and none over 4 inches.  Also they are very light, so I think they are basically hollow.  I have not, however, taken one away from my dog mid-chew to verify this.  My dog seems to be happy with them, but it only takes him a few minutes to finish one, compared to about 20-30 minutes with the previous brand of rawhide bones.

review/text: My cat loves the Fancy Feast Gourmet foods so much that she does not want to eat anything else. I usually mix this cat food with some healthy stuff so she gobbles it right up. This 7 pound bag also makes this gourmet cat food very reasonably priced. Once your cat tries this you'll be proud of yourself for buying it.

review/summary: Kitty crack!!
review/text: I don't know what they do to this food but my cats act like maniacs when I put it out. I only give it to them a few times a week (I give them a variety of dry food) and they get so excited when they get this kind. I normally avoid dyed food but my cats love this so much I enjoy giving it to them. They get other "healthier" types of food along with it so I am not concerned. Their little lives are too short to not get food that they truly love and my cats ALL love Fancy Feast dry and wet. Indulge your babies in a little junk food on occasion, it won't hurt anything. I have a little junk food myself sometimes cause it makes me happy, too. :)

review/summary: Exceptional Quality & Value
review/text: I've been using Frontier Co-op spices & herbs for years now, many of which are organic, and I've yet to try one that I didn't like.  Their garlic salt is no exception.  It's very flavorful, it's natural, it's produced by a company that's both environmentally friendly & socially responsible, and it's kosher.<br /><br />I feel obligated to mention that the garlic salt pictured is Frontier's certified organic garlic salt, which contains parsley (as well as garlic & salt).  The product on this page is not organic, and it's parsley free.  It's also free of additives (like calcium silicate, which makes most store bought brands of garlic salt free flowing), so although it may cake up a bit if you live in a humid environment or store it in a damp place, there are no icky chemicals within to worry about.

review/summary: my cat loves it!
review/text: My cat used to eat wellness core dry food. He slowly ate less and less. I tried to find a food that is still high in protein and grain free. Now our problem that he finishes his food too fast!:)

review/text: This product is better than their regular cat food. If u don't have the time to do the raw cat food diet to match what the eat in the wild, this is a good substitute.

review/summary: Picky cats love this grain-free cat food!
review/text: I wanted to write this Natural Balance cat food review because Cupcake loves her Alpha so much!  She's a picky kitty and turned her nose up at a few other natural cat food brands.  There was one other one she did eat but it gave her diarrhea because it was too concentrated in protein.  This food is a good blend of many nutritious ingredients and it has probiotics for her little tummy.  No more bad poops!  I have no complaints about Natural Balance - I buy their products for my dogs too.

review/summary: Wonderful product and price!
review/text: My dogs LOVE Greenies and get very excited at just their mention.  I only use them once or twice a week, so the big pack lasts a while.  I try to brush their teeth at least a few times a week also, and, with the combo,  their teeth have stayed so much whiter between vet cleanings while using the Greenies than when I didn't.  Also, Amazon has the best price I've seen for these anywhere - at least the large and jumbo sizes.  I was as excited to see them on Amazon as my dogs are to get them!

review/summary: Greenies
review/text: My dog loves greenies, but they are quite expensive. Anytime I can save some money on them, I try. My dog will go to the counter top that has the greenies on them and sit down looking at them. If we don't respond, he will whimper until someone gives in and gives him one. Then he gets excited, jumps around before he grabs it and runs off to eat it in private.

review/summary: Dogs loved them but they're a pricey snack!
review/text: My challenge has been to fine a healthy chew-fest for my Labradoodle pup. He devours anything he is not supposed to have<br />and shows no interest in any of the Nylabone, Kong, Buddy or any other "safer" chew toy on the market. Both he and my adult Corgi loved these Blue Bones. The problem is that they each chomped the regular sized Blue Bone down in about 10 minutes. I would not describe either dog as an aggressive chewer. These bones are pricey at a little over two bucks a pop so I guess I'll keep looking.

review/summary: OMG
review/text: Oh my goodness, I can see now what the fuss is about when it comes to aged balsamic vinegar.  It's like the difference between the house champagne at a Sunday Brunch (you know, the stuff the restaurant serves with a towel wrapped around the bottle so you can't see that it's labeled "carbonated kool-aid" or whatever) and a good bottle of aged Cristal.  Not only is there no comparison, but the supermarket stuff shouldn't even be able to be labeled balsamic vinegar.  It's expensive, but a little goes a very, very long way.  I've tried it on strawberries, cheese, salads, salmon, and even ice cream.  This is the good stuff.

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: Very economical compared to some of the older balsamics.  A drizzle on beef or lamb creates a full tantilizing flavor.  Mixed with crushed habanero and fresh garlic on tomatoes is wonderful.  I will always keep some on hand!

review/summary: great value, healthy but not horsey
review/text: This cereal is the best of all worlds, and a great value.  It has good crunch and something to bite on to and a little bit of sweetness without being sugary.  Doesn't get boring, and works great as a dry snack food for little (and not so little) people.
