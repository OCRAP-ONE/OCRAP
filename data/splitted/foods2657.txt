review/summary: A little expensive but good
review/text: I recently did a week-long cleanse and these crackers were recommended as a snack.  I was skeptical and they are definitely on the expensive side for a case of crackers but I was pleasantly surprised to see that you get a LOT.  So it's a good thing that they taste pretty delicious.  They're nutty and a little... malty if that makes sense.  They are thin and seedy and very, very crunchy.  I thought this brand of crackers would be similar to the Doctor Kracker brand, which are VERY delicious, but probably just a bit less healthy than these.  However, these crackers are very different: thin and round and somewhat shiny in appearance, and almost more like a tortilla chip in texture.  I've tried them with hummus and guacamole, and I think they'd also go really well with salsas, cheeses, olive tapenade, and just about any dip.<br />It's a good thing I like them because I'm going to be eating them for a lonnnggg time... it's a LOT of crackers.  If you are less sure, you may want to buy a single box before committing to a case!

review/summary: Interesting product...can be difficult to find locally
review/text: One of my friends is big into organic foods and introduced me to these crackers. They are extremely crunchy & crisp, reasonably low in calories (140 calories for 13 crackers) and don't contain any gluten, wheat or high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />They do have a slight nutty flavor, but the texture makes me think I am eating bird seed.<br /><br />They don't taste salty at all to me, but contain 190mg of sodium per serving.<br /><br />Obviously, if you have wheat or gluten allergies, these crackers could be perfect for you. If you are like me and eat pretty much anything there are better crackers out there, but these are probably a bit healthier than most.<br /><br />I would like to try other flavors, but I'm not willing to purchase a box of 12 just to find out I didn't like it. It would be nice if Amazon sold an assortment of 12.

review/text: I'm not gluten-free but I do have friends that are gf, so I thought I'd get a box of these to have on hand. BAD CHOICE. These things are terrible! I have no idea where the glowing reviews are from, but these crackers are tasteless and bland, slightly woody or burnt tasting, just awful. Go with the Crunchmaster gf crackers you can get from Costco: a bit of a sesame flavor, rich and crispy, salty and delicious. Nobody in my family had even one more after tasting the Mary's, and I strongly urge you not to waste your money on what we are going to use as squirrel food!

review/summary: Not Your Ordinary "Cracker", True
review/text: As I stated in my title, it's true these are not like ordinary "crackers" and I can see how they might not be to everyone's taste, but I *love* them!  To me they taste a bit like those little sesame snack sticks/nuggets that are so dang unhealthy.  I like the nutty flavor and the CRUNCH.  They're great just as is for a snack, with dip, cheese, nut butter, or broken up in soups or on salad.  One of these days I'm going to try them crushed as a coating for fish or chicken.  I definitely want to point out that this review is for the ORIGINAL flavor.

review/summary: love them as a snack for my 2 year old!
review/text: We found these at Costco the other day, and, since we are always looking for healthy alternatives to the common "toddler snacks" available today, we thought we'd give them a try.  I love that they have flax seeds, quinoa, and brown rice.  My husband doesn't really care for the taste very much, but my daughter and I have been scooping up homemade hummus with them all morning, and I'm a huge fan!<br /><br />I also really like the fact that, even though they are crackers, the sodium content isn't TOO high.  I normally prefer to buy things with a 5% or less sodium content, but for a whole grain snack option, the 8% found in these crackers aren't bad at all.<br /><br />We'll definitely be buying these again, and my husband will just have to get used to them!

review/summary: Bird seed wafers
review/text: These things are horrible, lol. My son with autism loves them though, and that's all that matters. The very first box we bought because they are gluten-free. After trying them, my wife and I said "Oh no way, he wont eat these." So just to be sure, I put a few in front of my son. Much to my surprise, a child who refuses to eat things like rice, rice based pasta, mashed potatoes, and a zillion other gfcf foods, loves these things. The supermarkets sell these for upwards of $5 a box, depending on where you go. The best I've seen is $3.79 a box locally. Amazon, as usual, slams through the basement with the price when bought via subscription. Thanks Amazon. The break is much appreciated.

review/text: When I ate the first one I was a bit surprised. These do taste different than your average crackers. The flavor is very nutty, the first bite seemed a bit bitter even. But very soon I knew I was hooked. These are super crunchy and the different seeds keep the taste very interesting. They are not salty at all and that lets the taste of the seeds really shine. Based on the ingredients they should be very nutritious too. I think I found new addiction. I can't wait to try the other flavors!

review/text: So if you're expecting a flaky, baked cracker, forget it. These are classic "health food" crunchy, not Ritz crackers. I love them -- and they are $5 a box in the store, so the 12-pack is a good deal, but they are still expensive, tho they are perfect for low-glycemic diets and for people with good teeth. They have a strong, nutty flavor, good with cheddar cheese. Or use in place of chips (tho they cost five times as much).

review/summary: My daily cracker need fulfilled.
review/text: I have been eating Mary's Gone Crackers (original) for many months. With so many flood allergies, I was searching for a gluten free cracker that did not compromise on taste nor health benefits. Need I say more. Every day I consume these crackers, often instead of gluten-free breads which are not that pallitable to me unless overly toasted. The crackers have become a healthy part of a meal in a day, whether layered with humus or chopped liver. (Hard for some to hear the chopped liver part) but after 40 years I was encouraged to eat meat again and chopped liver was strongly encouraged. I never thought I could do it. These crackers are a delightful accompaniment to healthy food toppings (or even alone) and for those without allergies, what a magnificent gift for the taste buds with endless options for toppings.

review/text: First off, this cracker is not for everyone...I love it, it works especially well with toppings or plain.  The crackers have an earthy flavor almost nutty so if you are allergic to nuts its nice to get to experience that flavor without reacting! These crackers are fairly crunchy which is why I gave the product 4 stars I wish they were a little less so.  However, they are thin which is nice...I appreciate the fact that it is not a 100% rice product.  That is selling factor for these crackers.  If you are sick of rice based products and have multiple allergies these are the cracker for you.  I am allergic to everything and I do not have an issue with these crackers!

The Glutino rusks work well with soft or spreadable cheeses like brie or chevre.  They do not crumble so easily as most GF crackers.

You can compare the prices and sellers for yourself.  One item not currently available, B000WMI6NY, is likely to be the best deals, since Amazon usually offers free shipping with purchases of a certain dollar amount.  The others, once you add shipping to the sale price, seem to me to be over-priced.<br /><br />First there were M&Ms, which are good.  Good enough for Reese's to take the idea and expand on it.  And Reese's Pieces are so good that M&Ms stole the idea back - and doesn't do peanut butter anywhere near as well as Reese's!  Like M&Ms, Reese's Pieces are little dots with a candy-coating; inside is a creamy peanut butter.  They don't compare with M&Ms Plain, but they beat the peanut butter out of M&Ms Peanut Butter!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: Good product
review/text: Our cat loved this new brand. We introduced the new diet over a week but she started having frequent vomiting episodes thereafter. The vet ventured that she may have developed a food allergy to one of the ingredients. He said that such episodes were impossible to predict, and could happen with any food. We switched her back to her regular diet, and the vomiting has since stopped.

review/summary: This is the REAL Coca Cola
review/text: I bought a couple bottles of this from a local gas station (Michigan) the other day. The owner told me it was bought from Mexico. I tried it side by side with locally distributed Coca Cola, and noticed it tastes like the Coca Cola I remembered as a child. The local Coca Cola does not compare. I attribute the difference mainly to the use of cane sugar in the Mexican product. The aroma of this product is better as is the taste. The greensish tinted bottle gives it a nostalgic feel, but it is the taste and aroma that sold me. Additionally, the local product was overly carbonated, perhaps to have a longer shelf life. If you are looking for the way coca cola used to taste, this is it!

review/summary: Takes me back to when I was a young Mexican boy working on the granja
review/text: Of course, back then everyone drank the good stuff. This was before the U.S. Government-sponsored sugar wars of the 1970s, leading the soft drink manufacturers to use cheaper high-fructose corn syrup instead. (+ History Lesson included below)<br /><br />It was never a taste or health decision, purely cost. Of course we now know there are other (long term) costs: HFCS probably has plenty to do with the frightening increase in obesity and diabetes in this country. (* recent Princeton study; see link in Comments)<br /><br />Coke's current U.S. offering isn't just bad FOR you. It tastes horrible, too. And despite official Coca-Cola comments to the contrary ("All of our consumer research indicates that from a taste standpoint, the difference is imperceptible"), anyone who has tasted both knows the difference. The suits in Atlanta have a vested interest in protecting their bottling partners on this side of the border. Their apparent failure at the taste test table thus becomes understandable if not acceptable.<br /><br />On the other side of the border, however, Mexican Coke still uses cane sugar, which translates to pure sweetness not to mention less aftertaste. Nice heavy glass bottles add to the appeal. Find these at your local carniceria or bodega, or even by the case at some Costco or Sam's Club locations.<br /><br />REFRESCO indeed!!!<br /><br />P.S. If you are unable to find Mexican Coke locally and unwilling to pay the shipping premium here, just keep your eyes open next Spring for the special Passover Coke, which also forgoes the corn syrup for good old fashioned (and Kosher!) sugar.<br /><br />[+ History Lesson follows]<br /><br />By the late 1970s, increasing tariffs on imported sugar forced U.S. food manufacturers to develop alternative sweeteners. The answer quickly became high-fructose corn syrup, the price of which continues to be kept low through government subsidies for corn growers. Damn the taste, we know what fat Americans with dead taste buds want!

review/summary: It IS the coke of your childhood...
review/text: Coke switched from using sugar to high fructose corn syrup in the 80's.  Remember the whole New Coke, Classic Coke, New Wave Coke crap?  Mexican coke (and most Coke from other countries) still uses sugar instead of the cheaper high fructose corn syrup.  And it's probably much better for you because of that and the fact that it's only 11.5oz instead of the 20oz plastic bottles commonly consumed in the U.S., so it's fewer calories. We buy Mexican Coke when at all possible.  But, I've heard that the Mexican Coke Zero uses an artificial sweetener not approved for use by the USFDA, so not something you want to run out a try.

review/summary: Not bad for the money!!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this kit.. I made it to the directions, but added 2 oak spirals (purchased seperately) during fermentation. For some reason, this wine took more time to ferment than the directions stated, which is why I always go by hydrometer readings and not the "guidelines" in the directions. This posed no problem for me as it gave the wine longer to extract flavor from the oak.. My kit took just over 6 weeks from yeast pitch to bottle. Fermentation alone took 4 weeks. This is also the only kit I ever made using tap water, so that "may" have affected fermentation..<br /><br />All in all, this wine is a winner to me, and everyone who has tried it has given it a thumbs up. The oak gave it the soft buttery and vanilla flavors which I have always loved in a Chard.. If you are not a fan of oaky Chards, and decide to make this, please post your results without using oak. I am interested to see if the oak added significantly more character to this wine or not. For the money, I think this is a steal!! Especially since it comes with corks, shrink capsules and labels!!!<br /><br />I will definatley be ordering this kit regularly, and already have orders for more bottles!!

review/summary: Shocked how good this was
review/text: I also modified the kit instructions.  I hydrated the yeast, however, the instructions said that you could do this as an alternative to using the yeast sprinkling method.  My SG at start was 1.08.  The first fermentation ended on day 11.  After racking, I added toasted oak chips.  I racked the wine again on Day 21 when the SG was .990, and again on Day 23 due to the amount of ugly sediment that was forming quickly at the bottom (and I was going on a business trip).  The wine at this point was extremely cloudy, and tasted and smelled horrible.  The alcohol tasted very strong and I thought that the alcohol content was way too high.  I then removed the oak chips and added the gels.  The wine cleared within a couple of days and seemed to darken a bit over the next week. I racked the wine again on Day 33, crossed my fingers and tasted the wine.  I was shocked that it tasted good but I wish that it had more body and had more oak flavor and had more body.  I have not bottled the wine yet but am thinking of adding more oak and bulk aging the wine a bit longer.  Note that I am probably at 20 liters but I am not adding water or wine, but am spraying inert gas (Wine Preserve) into the carboy whenever I lift the airlock.<br /><br />I like a very oak flavored Chardonnay and this kit contains no oak.  That is the only reason that I am ranking this kit as a 4 star instead of a 5.  I hope that Amazon continues to sell Vino Italiano kits.  I would to try out the red and see how they compare to the much more expensive Vino del Vido and Mosti Mondial red wines that I have made.<br /><br />Based on my results thus far, I would recommend this kit.  I will add more information to this review if I am able to later.<br /><br />Update June, 2011:  Just opened one of my last bottles.  It keeps getting better.  Very smooth,  very good flavor.  I am ordering another kit.

review/summary: Makes Very Good Chardonnay
review/text: This kit makes a very nice chardonnay - with some adjustments. First, be careful and use a hydrometer when you make up the wine to volume. My kit made 20.5 Liters at 1.090 instead of 23. In fairness, the kit says it makes 23 L at 1.075 to 1.090. I opted for reduced volume in lieu of diluted wine.<br /><br />Secondly, the kit does not contain yeast starter nutrients and the kit instructions have you just sprinkle the dry yeast into the wine must. That's really not a good idea! I bought some GoFerm for rehydrating the yeast and some Fermaid K yeast nutrient to add during the fermentation. Rehydrated the yeast by sprinkling it into 6 grams of GoFerm suspended in 4 oz of water. After 30 min, I added 4 oz of white grape juice (no preservatives) to let the yeast start their metabolism.  After 6 hours, I added another 8 oz of grape juice and let the yeast grow overnight. Used this starter culture to innoculate the wine kit must. Added 3 grams of Fermaid K nutrient on the first day after pitching the yeast and 3 more grams when the must had fermented down to about 1.060 specific gravity.<br /><br />With those modifications and with some attention to the details of aeration and stirring, the kit makes a very good chardonnay. I'll give it 4 stars because the quality of components makes such good wine. However, if you just follow the kit instructions and sprinkle the dry yeast directly into the fermentation vessel, you run the risk of a very slow start and increased risk of contamination. If you don't add any yeast nutrients, you risk having stalled fermentation somewhere along the way. The yeast nutrients are cheap; they should be in the kit!

review/summary: Whole lotta bang for the buck!
review/text: First, a disclaimer for those looking at wine kits who aren't familiar with them;  this is *not* absolutely everything you will need to make wine kit, but it does have just about all of the disposable items you'll need other than bottles.  If you don't own any wine making equipment, you will want to get a fermenter, a carboy and... well, you'll need to get a STARTER kit.  This has just about everything someone who has already been making wine will need, except for the bottles... and if you're like me you'll just save your bottles anyway to sanitize and reuse them.<br /><br />That said, wow.  It did have everything I needed.  It included the corks I'd need for my bottles, the Chardonnay bottle labels as well as a bottle sealer that I found extremely cool but had not used before.  The yeast (Lalvin-1118) is my go-to yeast when I make mead or hard cider and it worked well here.  It will tend to leave a dry wine, but then you can backsweeten it if you want... but with a chardonnay, you'll probably want to leave it dry.  I used the same fermenter, carboy, tubing, etc. that I use whenever I make my adult beverages, but the kit completely covered me for all of the "consumables" that I would otherwise have possibly bought, even including some clarifiers I hadn't used before but I will be using again.<br /><br />I ordered this back in September in order to make this batch for some chardonnay lovers in my family for Christmas and I did the final bottling yesterday...  I am not a big chardonnay fan personally (I like sweeter wines myself) but even I enjoyed the final product.  The only thing I added which was not in the kit was oak chips (available here or at your local brewing supply store) to give it an oak flavor, but that's certainly not necessary.<br /><br />This is my first Vino Italiano kit -- as I said above, I normally make mead or hard cider so I don't have a lot of experience with wine kits, but I will definitely be trying other Vino Italiano varieties for some of the sweeter wines that I do like...  Yes, most kits cost more, but this is a case where I feel like I'm getting more than I paid for.  Highly recommended for fans of chardonnay who already have a wine making starter kit and 30 or so 750ml wine bottles they can use.  :)

The sugar content was not high enough to get to a 10-12% level, the second kit I added 3 lbs of sugar to bring it up to the right level. It is now rounding out to the right amount. The first kit had a champhage yeast this one a normal white wine yeast. The other is better. I'm seriously debateing if I would buy another kit from this company

Even bulk aging for one year doesn't help it.  For $65 people could get the World Vineyard Australian Chard from most brew shops.  MUCH better chardonnay for a decent price to get something drinkable in 9 months.

I rinsed the oak at racking and kept it in the wine till bottled.<br />5)I whipped it good before clearing and it was totally clear in three days.  I racked it and let it continue to sit on oak for a couple weeks<br /><br />I am keeping this kit on continual re-order and will not hesitate at all to serve it to guests, though I won't tell them it was less than $2/bottle. :)

review/summary: Pleasantly Surprised - aging a must
review/text: My sister bought this for me for Christmas 2011. We found out (as have others) that "Kit" means it only comes with the ingredients. However, I can't knock Amazon because it is as advertised...just make sure you know you have to purchase the equipment (carboy, fermenter, thief, siphon, etc). Most local home brew stores have packages for the bare minimum you'll need.<br /><br />Making the wine was relatively easy and very fun. I brew beer using the Mr Beer kits, so I felt somewhat confident in my ability to make wine. Needless to say, making wine was way more involved than Mr Beer brewing. In fact, so much so that it was more fun. You really need to watch the temperature during the entire process. I found that a cooler and some frozen 2-litre soda bottles worked great. This kit made 29 bottles. We drank the first bottle that night to see what the non-aged wine tasted like. To be honest, it was bad. It tasted like a Sutter Home or an Ernest Gallo. I half expected Bartles and James to come back from the grave and tell me 'job well done'. So yeah, I was a bit worried that either 1) I had screwed it up or 2) I had spent all this time on a crappy kit.<br /><br />But like many here, I saw that you should age the wine. So I put it in a cooler and kept the temp around 60F. There they sat for 2 1/2 months. My expectations were pretty low that 2 months of aging would make a big difference. Over the weekend (5/12) we cracked open a bottle. It was so much better than the Day 1 bottle. There wasn't that bitter/sour bite the first bottle had. This was smooth and enjoyable. I can see where some people say 'watered down'. I'm not a big Chardonnay drinker, but I found this to be palatable and pleasant; not overbearing. Wine is a very subjective drink; some like the sourness, others don't.<br /><br />I plan on doing a red next, as they hold up better in the summer heat. I will certainly add this back into my rotation in the fall.<br /><br />I will say this regarding equipment. The instructions recommend a wine filter. I didn't use one (mainly because it costs $180). I was very careful when I moved the wine around and siphoned from fermenter to carboy not to pick up any sediment. I think for this reason I lost a bottle's worth of wine. If you're careful in siphoning and bottling, you really don't need a filter.

review/text: My dog has a sensitive digestive system so we appreciate having biscuits we can safely give her.  My vets don't always have these in stock so it's convenient to order 2 or 3 bags at a time.  They would even be a good deal if it wasn't for the shipping.  That's why it's 4 stars rather than 5.  It's too bad they're not eligible for super saver.

review/summary: Perfect for the evening...
review/text: Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams.<br /><br />This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect.<br /><br />Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Mmmm....peanuts
review/text: I got these for under ten bucks and they worked out to just a tad over two dollars a pound, which is excellent.  I rarely see peanuts for any less than that, even on sale.  I've been buying Planters for years so I knew what to expect and am perfectly happy with the freshness and taste.  Their expiration is a year away (Oct/12).  I was concerned about that huge jar... either 1) I was going to plow through them way too fast or 2) In my effort to be conservative, I might end up with stale peanuts.  So I took an old, clean 16 ounce jar I had and poured a pound of peanuts into that and put the remaining half pound in a container in the refrigerator to save for later.  The essential story on peanuts (having read this on-line somewhere) is that as soon as you break the seal, they begin to lose freshness.  Refrigeration can slow that down.

review/summary: Very fresh tasting.. with just the RIGHT amt of salt .. !!
review/text: I was plesantly surprised when this purchased arrived. I am a frequently Amazon shopper and this has to be the best packed item I have ever received.<br /><br />*First thing I noticed was  these are GLASS JARS..  Each large jar was double bubble wrapped. so no chance for breakage,<br /><br />*Second.. on opening the jar a nice pleasant fresh smell emerged...<br /><br />*Third .. Taste.. nice .. NOT overly salted peanuts,  just slightly salted and that allows the flavor of the nut to shine Nuts were whole on the  most part and nice size .<br /><br />The reason I purchased these were to make home made Peanut butter.. but the fresh taste of the first jar made it a nice snack item as is.<br /><br />We did make peanut butter with the 2nd jar and it was exactly as we like.. Perfect fresh peanut tastes, with just the right amount of salt to enhance the flavor.. I did add a touch of honey as that is this group prefers but in my opinion totally unnecessary.<br /><br /> I think we will be happy with this subscribe program in this house.

review/summary: You really can't go wrong with peanuts
review/text: The following review is for peanuts in general.<br /><br />With a flavor somewhere in between almonds and walnuts, peanuts are an amazing treat, and they make a great Christmas gift for people of all ages.  If you've never tried peanuts, you are missing out.  You can buy them shelled or unshelled and in a variety of flavors, including; salted, extra salted, unsalted, roasted, dry roasted, chocolate, spicy, pickled, smoky, w/raisins, and sugar coated.  The only flavor that I don't care for is unsalted.  In their natural, unsalted state, peanuts are disgusting (1 star).  Fortunately, natural unsalted peanuts are very rare.<br /><br />According to so-called scientists, peanuts are not a true nut, but a legume.  However, scientists also claim that men have walked on the moon.  So you really can't take anything those guys say seriously.  Peanuts are definitely a nut.<br /><br />Scientists also claim that peanuts are a very good source of monounsaturated fats.  But I believe that claim just about as much as I believe the claim that men have walked on the moon (not at all).  So whatever.  Just enjoy peanuts for their amazing flavor.<br /><br />Note:  I realize that most people have probably already tried peanuts.  But this review was written for the minority of people who have never tried peanuts.

review/text: "Planters Dry Roasted Peanuts" - when I first ordered they were good and crunchy and it disappeared from my house fast and so I ordered the second package and I really feel for ordering. The peanuts were old stock and did'nt taste good or cruncy. Disappointed with amazon, did not expect this from amazon.<br /><br />Since all these S&S come in three packs, it is a waste of money. Better to get one from local stores atleast if it is not good, I will not waste lot of money like I do with amazon.

review/text: update:  recommend using a strainer to get ride of the salt and peanut dust / crumbs.<br /><br />This is review of the Lightly salted Dry Roasted Planters Peanuts with sea salt.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Glass bottle.  Very impressed.<br /><br />Suggestions to Planters:<br />I actually called planter's 1877 # to make some of these suggestions:<br />-The label says "quality USA .. TM (trade mark)", and that got me thinking, is this made in the USA or not?  According to the SKU # that I provided, planters customer rep said that these peanuts were roasted in the USA.  I suggested that they write that.<br /><br />-I can't imagine anyone would want the regular salted peanuts!  Planters should have "lightly salted" be the default.  People would probably eat Less of the regular planters peanuts and it's less healthy.  Even for this lightly salted version, there's a disclaimer that reads "Contains 95mg sodium per serving compared to 190 in planters dry roasted peantus, not a low sodium food."  Well, why not have 3 grades, no salt, almost no salt, and finally lightly salted and get rid of the regularly salted.<br /><br />The label does say "Kraft Foods Global, INC.  Northfield, IL, USA."  I really want to know if these peanuts were grown and roasted in the USA.  It helps to write which part is in the USA at the minimum.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Taste like peanuts, no complaints, just wish it's even less salty.  Maybe I should go with the no salt version in the future.

review/summary: why so highly priced?
review/text: For some reason Oreo cookies are the most expensive cookies available on the market.  It probably has to due with the fact they're the most popular ones, and that Americans love to dip Oreo cookies into a glass of milk.  Hey I love doing that too (a lot in fact) but that doesn't mean I want to spend over 20 dollars doing so.  Even when shopping uptown at a grocery store, I'm expected to dish out more than a pretty penny for a bag of these exceptionally awesome cookies.  It's not right!  The good news is that there's plenty of no name brands that are 3 times cheaper and taste almost exactly the same.  Go for those ones instead please.

That being said, I've been cooking with everything being low fat, fat free, etc.  I must say I was quite pleased when I tried this peanut butter.  It seems to be a little more runny than regular peanut butter, but it's not really runny per say.  It's just not as creamy as regular.  As far as the taste is concerned, it really does have a great flavor to it.  It's hard to describe, but it does taste very close to the real thing.  I will definitely be buying more of this, as I love anything with peanut butter in it.  Give it a shot....you won't be sorry.

I also had one dog die of liver disease, and from my research I discovered that a high-grain diet is the suspected culprit. Well, since I feed my dogs raw, I knew the only source of grain they really got was the dog biscuits, so I then switched to Costco-brand chicken jerky strips, but when my one dogs soon seemed lethargic and not like his usual self, and I took him to the vet for a blood draw, I found his liver enzymes were very high! After a month of serious perplexion, I was brought to wonder if now the chicken jerky strips were the culprit, and sure enough, there were DOZENS of postings on Google about those chicken jerky-type treats (from China) being discovered to have melamine coating, and causing fatalities and grave liver illnesses in dogs! So again I searched around trying different healthier treats (but now only ones "Made in the USA"). I now use these Duck treats exclusively and feel very good about them; they are meat-based and tasty, yet formed like a small crunchy biscuit. I buy the multiple packs off Amazon because the pricing works out alot better as my 2 dogs go through them so quickly. They are really worth it though for the much healthier alternative! I am grateful to Plato for making them (in the USA!)

review/summary: Great for dogs with food allergies
review/text: My white Boxer has severe food allergies.  I tried almost every treat on the market. I came across these as she can only eat duck.  She loves them and has no digestive problems after eating these. Great product and made in the USA. I only buy USA food products for my dog.

review/summary: Yummy Stinky Treats
review/text: Our trainers highly suggested Plato Treats to use in class since they are healthy, stinky treats that dogs love.  It is difficult to find these treats in local stores and the price is at least a couple dollars more (per pack).  We love the fact that the treats can easily be broken down into smaller pieces suitable for training.  It's amazing how attentive dogs are for stinky treats!

review/summary: Lapsang is lovely.
review/text: Definitely one of the best teas ever, although its smokiness may make it an acquired taste for some.  I recommend buying it in small quantities, as it definitely does not improve with sitting around.  It is imperative to preheat your teapot and your mug, and don't make this with anything but BOILING water from your kettle--if your water, pot, cup are not hot that nasty overtaste develops quickly with this tea.  But it's easy to brew it HOT, then add a little sugar (I especially like natural sugar here), sit back and enjoy.  Nothing more warming on a cold day.

review/summary: schlepper bargain
review/text: Love the terrific price for my every day cooking-why schlepp 1 litre cans when can store away enough for 5 months cooking.  My car is dead,and in Los Angeles this means a loser,so I'd rather shop as little as possible.  We adapt as mother time dictates,and father dollar demands.America=$.......Forget your pathetic academic arguments in utter denial of reality of how the real world works!!!!!! Money in Los Angeles is truly all that matters,especially for males under 45 years....cook and save your money,God knows you'll need it....Older gals really have to cut back,in every aspect of life....

review/text: We had been using Lea & Perrins Marinade For Chicken for years, when suddenly our local grocers stopped carrying it.  So many recipes just weren't the same without it.  I'm so happy I was able to use Lea & Perrins Marinade For Chicken once again.

review/summary: Super salty
review/text: This is a great deal for pumpkin seeds, but I was disappointed.  The seeds have a crust of flour and salt which is very heavy.  I am eating the seeds, but in order to I have to rinse the seeds first.
