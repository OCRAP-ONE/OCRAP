review/summary: Good filling, odd tasting crust
review/text: Caveat: I'm pregnant, and I bought these to head off nausea when I get hungry (which occurs about every 90 minutes). I don't have too many food aversions, just HAVE to eat, so I'm pretty sure that this is not just being pregnant, but it could be my taste is off. Having to eat so much, I really wanted to get something which wasn't QUITE so bad in terms of corn syrup, additives, etc., but I may have to go back to Nutri-grain bars, which I know I like the taste of. The filling on these was good, but the graham surroundings just tasted weird to me. The texture of the crust was also slightly off. I force myself to eat these on occasion as long as my stomach isn't heaving, but I wish I had bought a single box in the store to make sure I liked them before buying a lot off Amazon (though at the time, I didn't feel like going to the store at all). If you are at all picky, you might want to do the same.

review/summary: Better than most
review/text: Kashi's SOFT-BAKED cereal bars have a very good texture and flavor in a soft shell that is better than most others in almost every way. I have one of these every morning on my way to work (along with their many other varieties). If you're like me and you like soft cereal bars you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Yummy bars- but not as flavorful as other Kashi bars
review/text: Let me just say- we are a "bar family". It is one of the first snacks my kids, and even my husband grabs when in a rush...so we've pretty much tried them all. As stated in my review of the Kashi apple cereal bars- this brand offers something that is truly hard to find in a cereal or snack bar- nutrition. I tried the blackberry bars for me- since I LOVE blackberries. After reading the reviews, I am surprised at the low level of flavor in the bars. The apple bars are MUCH more flavorful, but I don't love apple bars as much...so even though I'm not as excited about the blackberry ones, they are still good for me as a healthy snack option, and they do still taste good. Just don't be surprised like I was when you take your first bite.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: What made me by this was the fact that it had 9g of sugar in each bar. A lot of bars nowadays, even protein bars, have an insane amount of sugar.<br /><br />Anyway, these taste like Nutrigrain bars, which I use to love. Then I learned about High Fructose Corn Syrup and after years of eating Nutrigrain bars from Kelloggs, I read the ingredients (I'm 20, started to look at the things I ate) and I couldn't believe it had HFCS.<br /><br />Then Kashi came around with their health foods and while they are really expensive, I think this is a good deal on amazon.<br /><br />36 bars for 15 or 17 dollars is pretty good.<br /><br />It's also a great snack for those who want to lose weight, when it comes to calories. It isn't a good significant source of protein or anything else. Just a healthy snack.

review/summary: Tasty chewy bars
review/text: We thoroughly enjoyed these bars.  These were a good deal on amazon; they work out to about 50 cents a bar, which is cheaper than I would pay for a nutri-grain bar at work, but more healthy, and just as delicious, and maybe even more filling!  I would sometimes eat two within a short span, although one is filling enough.  I did start to get sick of these when I was close to finishing the pack of 36 bars, but I wasn't quite sick of them, and could see eating more of the same flavor after a short break.  I will try another flavor next and see how they match up, although I would imagine all the flavors to be equally tasty.

review/text: These are a perfect breakfast on the run or anytime snack. Tasty and filling! But I got them at Kroger for $3.00 per box, so this is a bit expensive, even with free shipping. Check your local stores first, but don't hesitate to try them. I'm not a big blackberry fan, but it is mild, not too sweet or tart and the graham crust is very flavorful, if you like Graham Crackers, you will like these.

review/summary: Great reasonably healthy option for breakfast
review/text: These have excellent flavor.  The blackberry bars are actually better than the strawberry ones.  The strawberry are good too, they are just a bit drier.  We used to really like the Fiber 1 pastries for the kids in the morning.  They had some fiber and tasted much better than regular pop tarts.  Well the Fiber 1 pastries aren't made any more so we've been searching for something else.  We tried some organic/fiber pastries but they were way too dry.  These are finally a good replacement.  I use these to give the kids something eat while I'm getting ready for work.  It does the trick until mom gets up and makes them breakfast.<br /><br />And life doesn't get much easier than Amazon's subscribe & save!

review/text: My 3-yr-old hates to sit at the table and eat breakfast, she always wants to take a snack in a cup and run around.  Most days, she would rather go without breakfast than sit down and eat.  I finally compromised and got her some Kashi cereal bars that she could eat on the go.  I was so pleased to find something with whole grains, real fruit and no high fructose corn syrup that I could give her.  She loves them, I love that she eats them and they are better for her than other bars on the market.  I wish they had more flavors than the three I'm always buying, I would purchase more to give her more variety!

review/text: These are delicious and a perfect on-the-go snack for me and my little boy. I love the texture -- a little firm around the edges and soft in the middle -- and the filling is sweet, but not overpowering. I've compared the nutritional facts with a few popular organic or specialty-kids' fruit bars, and these have less sugar (and no high fructose corn syrup) and more fiber. Of course, it's still processed food, but overall, it's pretty healthy, tastes great, and is an affordable quick snack.

My local grocery is no longer carrying these bars as a result, I made my purchase through Amazon at a great price. I was paying a dollar or more for individual bars. The chocolate peanut is fabulous. Can easily curb your craving for a Snickers! I was also pleased with how fresh they were.

review/summary: Great for breakfast
review/text: I bought these bars because I never eat breakfast.  I hate eggs, don't like most cereals, etc.  I know breakfast is important so I decided to try these.  They taste okay, leave a gritty aftertaste.  With these particular ones I can taste the chocolate but it's lacking in the peanut butter taste.  I will definitely keep eating them though because they do work.  I had one for breakfast two days in a row and did not find myself feeling hungry until it was lunch time.  On the third day I decided to try a bowl of cereal (Cheerios to be exact) because it was convenient.  An hour after I ate the cereal I felt as if I was starving.  Thank goodness I had an apple with me because I devoured it but was still hungry!  Obviously the cereal did not satisfy me the way the bars did.  I will keep eating them and am curious about trying the protein shakes.

She had told us she was feeling tired but didnt' understand why as she was eating her carbs.  When we sat down and looked at her diet, there was little to no protein.  These protein bars do the trick.  She can put them in her purse or backpack and off she goes.  They don't take long to eat and taste good.

I've found that if I eat one for breakfast, I am hungry by lunchtime, but not overly so. If I eat one for lunch at around 1pm, I am generally very hungry after 5pm.<br /><br />They are a good size, not overly chocolaty, and the peanut butter isn't overpowering at all, it's almost subtle. The bsr doesn't stick to your mouth, it's easy to eat, and it has a nice texture, not too hard. Plus the slight crunchiness from the rice parts kind of reminds me a bit of a candy bar.

review/text: I prefer these Special K bars over candy bars, because being almost 50 I have to closely monitor my weight.  Obesity is a serious health problem in this country, besides being unsightly, it is unhealthy for all parts of the body, and I need healthful snacks like these to keep my hunger cravings at bay. I know cynics say they are no better for you than candy bars, but what do they know?  One candy bar has almost 55% of one day's(!) portion of fat, whereas the special K bars are substantially less, because they cynics are not working at the Special K factory.  I think they are overpriced, however, I will not pay $1.00 for them, but when they go on sale for $4.00 then I will get a box of six.  I find they taste great and they are not too hard, and I will absolutely not buy any snack bar that doesn't have a little 'give' when I press down with my thumb.  I don't want to eat any snack bar that is harder than my teeth, and the Special K bars are a nice filler between meals.  Any flavor is good.

review/summary: What happened amazon?
review/text: $6.75 a box?  Try harder?  Local grocery store has them for $5.99 NON sale price (I've gotten them for as low as $4.49 "on sale"). You have other bars that beat that price, for some reason your peanut butter bars are through the roof.  Epic fail Amazon.  Usually you are my savior...i just don't understand...<br /><br />To everyone else, check your grocery store before buying.  Don't get me wrong, I love amazon (spend almost thousands a year on amazon) but this is a bad deal.  Even our highest priced grocery stores have them cheaper.<br /><br />Also to Kellogs,  These things are already overpriced.  I like the bars, but they aren't the 'best' for you (they have real sugar vs sugar alcohol for instance.)  They have a great taste, and i've bought a few hundred dollars worth in my lifetime (used to order 12 boxes a month until the prices jumped up on amazon.)  My advice to you is to get them below $5/box.  You'll earn me as a loyal customer if you do.  Thanks to the price increases i've been forced to purchase other brands, and you've lost around $700 retail (this year) or so as a result.  Might not seem like much, but get a few people doing that, and it becomes an issue...

review/summary: Wrong size bars sent
review/text: The first shipment was just as ordered.  This last shipment was not the same....the bars went from 1.59 ounce to 0.9 ounce.  The bar says chocolate peanut - not chocolate peanut butter.  The picture looks the same on the packages.  I am very disappointed in this shipment.  We opened all the boxes before we realized the difference, so we couldn't send them back.

However, the new package again contained only Meal Bars.  The description/title of this item must be incorrect.  Do not order this item if you are looking for the Snack Bars.

review/summary: AMAZING! FOOD! CAN'T HELP BUT SHARE WITH OTHER PET OWNERS!
review/text: Ever since our 2 mini poodles and 2 Maltipoo came in to our household they stole our hearts and became a part of our family. The hunt for the right food came when I heard countless horror stories from friends and family on how leading brand name foods affected and even caused the death of their pets. We all know how costly vet bills can me and because of this reason I believe that being proactive and taking preventive care will be a lot cheaper in the long run. Certain grains and corn are not a natural part of a dogs diet and as you know most or all advertised brands use that as one of their main ingredients. What i love this brand is that it doesnt skimp on any of the right ingredients and makes meat/poultry/etc. (depending on the flavor you buy) the main ingredient! this is awesome because there really isnt any other brand out there that is true to their pet owners and their pets! This manufacturer makes me feel like they actually care and thus they will get my money for their 1 of a kind and amazing food! My dogs love it, they have beautiful coats, they are energetic and healthy all around. Been using this for about 3 years now and will continue to do so. This is our households choice of food- the right food.

review/summary: My dog LOVES it.
review/text: After lot of research, I chose to feed my new dog the Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food. Soon after we adopted him from a rescue group, we realized he has lot of problems -diseases, non-behavioral.  After multiple trips to the vet and  various treatments/medications, now he is as healthy as he can be.  Blue Buffalo Wilderness Grain Free Dry Dog Food is pricey, but the peace of mind I get from knowing that I'm providing quality food to my dog is definitely worth it (He has unusually low immune system, so he may get sick again, but at least I will know that it's not due to food).  He tried Duck flavor and the Salmon.  I think he prefers Salmon flavor.  He looks good (nice coat), seems healthy, and acts happy.  I've this on repeat delivery, so I don't have to make regular trips to the pet store.

review/summary: Whether you call it Rooster Sauce or Thai Ketchup, it is a condiment you won't put down
review/text: Andrew Knowlton, restaurant editor at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NIND">Bon App&eacute;tit</a> magazine, predicts sriracha will be one of the biggest food trends of 2010!<br /><br />Knowlton was a guest on the CBS Early Show and shared, "If you walk into any chef's kitchen or home, you will find sriarcha. Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on."<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed "Thai ketchup." Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars

review/summary: Rooster Sauce
review/text: I first discovered this sauce as the "secret ingredient" from my favorite restuarant's hot wing recipe, they called it Rooster Sauce because of the Rooster on the label.  I now use in my hot wing sauce recipe.  I often use it as a condiment for just about everything from eggs, spice up thousand island dressing to pad thai noodles.

review/text: I love Sriracha Chilli Sauce because it goes with everything you want to add a little spice too. One of my favorite dishes is adding it to a chicken salad. HMMMMM! Add to meat before placing other ingredients to salad. I usually chop the chicken and add some Sriracha and place in fridge for a hour or two before actually making the salad. I've always received rave praise from guest concerning this simple dish. My 12 yo uses it with everything, forcing me to keep a spare bottle in the pantry. I purchased it from Kroger, so I am sure other store have it also, Check the Asian Food Section ...

review/summary: Excellent...no bones about it!
review/text: Deeeelicious!! I am very picky about fish, and this did not disappoint. Probably as good as the halibut I pulled out of Alaskan waters myself some years back. The best part - I've had 2 pieces so far and not one bone in sight. The price isn't any more competitive than anywhere else, but the quality was very high. It makes me want to buy more products from Omaha Steaks, if only I could afford them.<br /><br />I was worried about the shipping because I received a notice on a Thursday that it had shipped, and when they didn't arrive Friday... or Monday... or Tuesday... I wondered how they could possibly remain frozen. But they were frozen solid! Omaha Steaks could do a better job of describing the shipping process on Amazon. The fish steaks were packed in a cooler with dry ice. It worked out perfectly!

I will have to compare prices to see which is the better deal.  Either way, I'm glad I got these.  It's one of the few fish that we like - very mild and the texture is good.

review/summary: Easy Convenient Way to Improve Your Diet
review/text: This drink mix is refreshing and not over-the-top sweet. I use it sometimes as a meal replacement (I hate eating breakfast) and drink it especially after working out.<br /><br />Most of us don't drink enough water and almost everyone needs to get more fiber in their diet. This is an easy way to do both. Each packet has 5 grams of fiber and is only 30 calories! It's reasonably priced and I can find it even in the small town I live in. Also, it's very portable. You can slip a packet into your pocket or purse and go.<br /><br />In the summer I freeze it in ice cube trays and either use it as ice or throw the cubes in the blender with some pineapple, kiwi, banana or other fruit and some no sugar added orange juice and it makes a nice smoothie.<br /><br />This has become a staple for me. I use it pretty much every day and I've found it does take the edge off my hunger.

review/summary: Preferred Dog Biscuit in my house!
review/text: I have two chows and pet sit a Samoyed regularly. As far as dry biscuits go, AvoDerm is the one all three will actually eat and not drop out in the yard!  The caveat is they fancy only the "original" flavor Kookie, not the other two flavors AvoDerm offers. I have not noticed any adverse affects like gas or loose stools so I will continue to purchase these treats for them so long as I can find them. So far, the big box store quit carrying them, so I get them here off Amazon Prime (albeit a bit more pricey than what I was getting them at Pet*****) I was able to find them on the drugstore site, but they were in a different packaging and they arrived broken to bits. My order from Amazon arrived with all 6 bags snugly packed inside a box within a box so there were zero broken Kookies! Score one for Team Amazon!<br /><br />The ingredients are: Ground Whole Brown Rice, Lamb Meal, Ground Whole White Rice, Oatmeal, Rice Flour, Natural Flavor, Flax Seed, Avocado Meal, Herring Meal, Canola Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherols), Avocado Oil, Blueberries, Carrots, Rosemary Extract, Sage Extract, Lecithin.

review/text: I don't know how long pink peppercorns should last stored but these peppercorns (technically they are a berry) were in sealed jar and had fresh smell and the expected oily residue when crushed.  I tried using these in grinder with black peppercorns but the oils gummed up the grinder.  I use a seperate grinder for these set to coarse grind and works fine.

review/summary: Bring back Flavia
review/text: It's like flavored water, but not actually coffee.  I know when it was MARS FLAVIA it used to be great.  When the switch was made to ALTERRA, they promised the same quality coffee, but -honestly -it's quite different.  There's none of the aroma I enjoy about coffee in this stuff that's brewed.  Just buy your coffee from the grocery store -any of them will rank better than this Alterra junk.  Don't waste your money.<br /><br />Maybe if they bring back Flavia coffees I will venture to try it again.  It's a real shame, because now I have this $200 machine sitting in my office that serves no purpose except to maybe lend a "contemporary" look to the office decor.  Well, I guess it still makes hot water.

review/text: I bought this product at our local store and I think this is the best Pina Colada mix I have ever tasted. If you are looking for an at-home mix that tastes like the Pina Coladas that you get at a tropical resort, this is the product you want. I have never found a mix that my wife would drink until this one. I have tried all of the major brands. She loved this one. That's why I am on here looking to buy it in bulk. Hands down, Island Oasis makes the best mixes. I have also tried the Margarita Mix and it was equally fantastic.

review/text: Oasis sells 2 kinds of mix to make frozen drinks.  I misunderstood the label on Amazon because I thought I was ordering the mix that is always refrigerated.  Oasis ships these with dry ice to maintain the refrigeration. This item is the version that sits on the shelf until opened.  I haven't tasted it yet, but I would have preferred the kind that was likely to have fresher ingredients and less chemicals that must be needed to make this a shelf-stored type of product.  Oh well.... perhaps adding additional rum in the mix will soothe my disappointment.

There is no chance of staleness because of the vacuum sealed packaging. And the box is JAM-PACKED filled to the max, so you get your money's worth!! There's enough rice here to have risotto once a week for a year!! Also, if you're a bit of a novice when it comes to risotto, there's a great recipe on the back of the box that's spot-on. This rice of THIS quality in THIS quantity is alot of bang for your buck!! Give it a try!

review/summary: Some Dogs love them; Owners question
review/text: Two little Yorkies basically love these little chicken wrapped biscuits.  Each morning each one gets 2 of them and they start the process of enjoying them.  Then after a few minutes they finish with a nice little mess.  I do not understand but near the end of the process they either just get tired of eating them or do not like them or they are suggesting that they want to share the leftovers with us.  Regardless, we always have a few pieces on the floor that have to be vacuumed.  No big deal, however.  There are three treats these critters love:  these biscuits, pig snouts and freeze dried livers.  I would love to have a return of all the money we have spent on other treats that did not make it to the eating condition.  Yorkies are blatantly picky (or at least these ones) and it's one sniff and eaten or gone to the neighbor's dogs.  Maybe that's where the expression "gone to the dogs" originates.  If you buy food and do not like it then give it to the dogs.  Bottom line:  great for us, love the little plastic container and they love the treats.  We'll be back for more.

review/text: I bought this suet at a local bird store, and it worked well.  Decided to buy it in bulk from Amazon, and MAN I have not been disappointed!!  I watched the suet feeder for an hour a few days ago and saw TWENTY bird species.  No joke.  One was a Great Crested Flycatcher that I'm pretty sure only showed up because it heard all the bird commotion.  :)  This suet has attracted several families of birds this spring, including baby Red-Bellied Woodpeckers, Downy Woodpeckers, Bluebirds, Chickadees, Thrashers, Nuthatches, etc, etc..  Couldn't be more pleased.  Worth every penny.<br /><br />Squirrels investigate it every few days, but they don't stay long.  I guess this stuff has some serious kick.  ;)

Thrashers (and other birds) pick-up the fallen pieces from the ground too.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: This item really is ~H~O~T~. Make sure to wash your hands after you touch it. . . or even better. . . use gloves.<br /><br />FYI, I recently purchased a "Squirrel Buster Peanut Plus" feeder, which holds what I call the "suet peanut balls" from C&S and it works really well. Though they make hot pepper peanut balls, that's really not necessary with the "Squirrel Buster". I have one of the large "Squirrel Buster" seed feeders, which is really great. "Squirrel Buster" feeders are not cheap, but they really work and you'll enjoy them.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007LQ3RQ">Brome 1024 Squirrel Buster Plus Wild Bird Feeder with Cardinal Perch Ring</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061O2O8K">Squirrel Buster Peanut Plus Wild Bird Feeder</a>

review/summary: Birds love it!
review/text: I bought the regular Woodpecker Suet by CS and yes the birds liked it but the "No Melt" version is even better. I have several suet holders and the birds prefer the "No Melt." I have tried other brands as well and in general my birds get more excited over the brand CS. I live in San Antonio, Texas and it's hot right now. I think the birds like the "No Melt" because it's not messy to the touch.. I have lots of visiting birds; cardinals, blue Jays, woodpeckers wrens, little gold colored finches, House finches, warblers and now a HAWK. The hawk hasn't caught any doves, starlings, or fat pigeons yet but it's sure scoping out all the bird action.<br /><br />I bought this Hot Pepper suet since I just started feeding birds and I didn't want a squirrle problem but so far my dogs keep squirrles out of the yard better than any product so far.

review/text: These candies are small which I like since I don't want to scarf down a candy bar that has 300 calories. These candies are about 15 calories each. The flavor is a mix between coffee and cream, which you already know, but the sugar content is not so large as to make you feel the candies are nothing but sugar. You can eat 8 of these candies a day and have no guilt. The hardness of the candies is great because they last awhile and unlike other candies they don't stick to your teeth and torture you for 20 minutes. Geeh, I'm sounding old! But I can't buy the junk from a vending machine at work and enjoy it and most candies are huge in size and calories, so these candies seem to be ideal.

review/text: Hopjes are small hard coffee flavored candies that I remember from fifty years ago. Many people prefer them to other candies. They cost somewhat more than the cheapest candies, but in the 9.9 pound size it's $4 a pound or so. They have a distinct coffee flavor and are not too sweet. Occasionally one has come out of its wrapper, but they are not particularly sticky. I always carry hard candy: peppermints free from restaurants, butterscotch, cinnamon, root beer; these are special.

I was forced to switch brands after a move recently and noticed the sores went away, finally found this brand again after a few weeks, and the sores promptly returned. Now I have her back on another brand, and within a week of switching the sores went away again.

review/text: If you can catch this at the right price and have prime it can save you a buck or two. Same decent food, no trip to the store. if this is what you feed your cats, you won't be disappointed with the food, just compare around for the deal!

review/summary: Worth the extra $$ - fussy baby calmed right down on ready made
review/text: My daughter has had colic/bad gas since she was born, Gentlease was suggested by a friend and we purchased the RTU (ready to use) 2 ounces.  My daughter was so much better - by week 5/6 we thought we are doing great.  Selfishly I loved the convience and kept purchasing it w/o realizing the cost...then the cost adds up and we switched her to powder Gentlease...BAD IDEA.  I didnt read on this (ready made vs powder).  So now at 10 weeks and been on powder for a few weeks - her colic/gas has acted up and bad!!  I am no longer using the powder and only getting ready to use, will purchase the 32 ounce cans soon!!  FYI - powder formula creates bubbles and foam...which creates air/upsets their tummies.  Ready made is thick and heard some babies can't do the heaviness...but you should look into this.
