review/summary: Great Oil for Fish
review/text: Decided to look up this oil after hearing some great things about it in the 4 Hour Body book.  I made the purchase online as Macadamia nut oil is not the easiest to find in the local grocery store.  The lemon infused has been excellent for pan frying tilapia and salmon filets and giving them plenty of flavor without me resorting to using lots of butter.  The three bottles came packed well and I'll be ordering again once I'm finished.

review/summary: Best Steel Cut Oats out there!
review/text: First of all, whoever eats regular quaker rolled oats, BELIEVE ME, once you try Steel Cut oats, you can never go back to that mushy gooey bowl of quick cooking oats. Initially when I switched over, I used to buy the McCann's 5 minute Steel Cut Oats which are pretty good, but once I discovered these, there was no going back! The size of each grain is larger in these, and when cooked and plumped up, it has a great texture (the McCann's one in comparison is smaller and tastes slightly gritty when cooked). To speed up the cooking time, I usually do this the night before:<br /><br />Pour cold water over oats (+1tsp whole wheat flour/wheat or oat bran) the night before to abt 1" above the level of oats in ur bowl... then microwave for 1.5 - 2 minutes (check that it doesnt overflow!)... then boil some water in a kettle and pour enough water to fill your bowl 1/2 way or 2/3 of the way to the top... then cover and let soak overnight... the next morning, add a little more water (if necessary) and microwave again for 2-3 minutes (again, check to make sure it doesnt overflow)... then add ur toppings and flavourings and Enjoy!!!! I do this every other morning and eat my oats at work, and it's well worth the little extra prep time the night before - trust me!!!

review/summary: Steel Cut Oatmeal is the best
review/text: When I first started making steel-cut oatmeal instead of the typical rolled oats we all grew up on, I was sure I didn't have time in the morning to cook something for 20-30 minutes, as opposed to nuking it for 3-5. It actually turned out to be pretty easy, once I adjusted my habits a bit (e.g., to start the water as soon as I get to the kitchen). And it's definitely worth a little more effort, the increased flavor and texture are phenomenal. And after trying a few brands, I am very happy with Bob's Red Mill. It has a nice nutty taste on its own, and I also like to throw in some dried fruit and sliced almonds. I'd absolutely recommend you try this, and you'll be surprised at what a difference it can make in your breakfast experience. Now I find, the only time issue is one I create myself, since I slow down to pay attention to what I'm eating! instead of mindlessly eating-cereal-and-checking-email.

review/summary: best oatmeal i've ever had
review/text: I had been wanting to try steel cut oats for about a year, then I saw these at a local health food store.  I absolutely had to buy this stuff!  I love this oatmeal!  It's not slimy and mushy like rolled oats.  It has quite a nice texture to it, closer to brown rice than rolled oats.<br />I always have mine with a pat of butter and a tablespoon or two of honey.  Sometimes I use brown sugar, but I think the honey is better.<br />While it is much better cooked on the stove, I have determined a way of cooking it in what I think is an 1100 or 1200 watt microwave (the microwave isn't labeled with its wattage and the packaging and owner's manual are long gone):<br />Combine 1/4 cup oats and 7/8 cup water in a dish that holds at least four cups.  Microwave 1-2 minutes, or until boiling, let stand for 2-5 minutes.  Continue microwaving for 1/2 to 1 minute intervals, letting stand at least two minutes between, until done to desired firmness. Watch carefully to make sure it doesn't boil over!  I do this in my 4 cup pyrex measuring cup, and stop the microwave as soon as the boiling water and oats come within an inch of the top.

review/summary: Awesome, for what it is...
review/text: Hi everyone...<br /><br />This is the first kit I ever made..  Actually, the first WINE I EVER MADE!!!!!<br /><br />I have to say that I didn't have great expectations...  More of an experiment....<br /><br />I am suprised how good it tastes...<br /><br />I did make it 5 gallons, instead of six.  Also, I picked up so sparkolid as a clarifier, since there is some concern for shell fish allergies, and the use of chitosan.<br /><br />Other than that, I am very happy with the result.  It has been in the carboy for 4 months.<br /><br />I also made some Sangria with this wine... Came great!!!!!  Looking forward to drinking a lot of this, this summer....<br /><br />In a nutshell, for anyone starting out....  You will need equipment.  I got mine from the winemakers toy store, but any homebrew shop will have a starter kit for equipment.  I went overboard, and bought a lot of equipment, but you only need the minimal kit.<br /><br />The equipment, you can use over and over again.<br /><br />If you want to go the least expensive route, buy two of the Paklab 6 gallon carboys here on amazon for under 28 dollars each and this wine kit together, to get free shipping.  You will also need a stopper and air-lock, some metabisulphite and cleanser ( I used b-brite ).  Also, some tubing to siphon from one carboy to the other.  A carboy brush will also be helpful.<br /><br />Make it in one carboy but only do 5 gallons, which translates to 25 bottles of finished wine....  Transfer it to the other when racking.<br /><br />Now, after you do this once... You will be hooked...  So, your next step is get a starter kit, which will come with a carboy, now you will have three, meaning you will be able to brew 3 different types of wine at the same time.  ( I currently have 4 going... )<br /><br />Your problem now becomes, where are you going to put all of this wine?<br /><br />Enjoy!!!!!

review/summary: 5 not 6 Gallons
review/text: As many reviewers have noted, do not attempt to make this to six gallons. This must (juice) is hardly concentrated and turned out very thin and weak when I made it to five gallons. I also added mulling spices and two, 32 ounce bottles of cranberry juice to make a total of 5 gallons prior to fermenting and it was still very light. It was good tasting though. It's a real shame that many of the Vino Italiano kits seem to be made from good grape stock, but skimp on the amount. I have had better luck with some of their other reds and whites but I still make them all to 5 gallons, not 6.

review/summary: Easy and Good
review/text: A friend of mine made this kit exactly according to the instructions, and it was pretty good.  Most red wines from kits benefit from some extra ageing (a few months), but this one was good from bottling day.<br /><br />When I got the kit, I decided to do something crazy with it.  In order to concentrate the flavor I decided to mix it only at four gallons instead of the instructions' suggestion of six gallons.  I had heard of others doing it to five gallons instead of six, and that was well-reviewed, but I hadn't heard of four gallons.<br /><br />The gravity was extremely high, about 1.120 if I recall correctly.  Since the kit comes with champagne yeast, though, I thought that they could handle it.  I oxygenated the fermenting wine three times in the primary, and believe me, it needed it!  The gravity took two weeks to drop down to 1.010, when I racked it out of the primary (bucket) fermentor to the secondary (carboy) fermentor.  It's still sitting in the secondary, waiting for the clarification steps.  It's going to be about 16% ABV, so it will no doubt benefit from ageing, but all-in-all I think it's going to resemble an "auslese" of a chianti when it's finished.<br /><br />Making the kit as instructed gives you thirty bottles (well, 28, really, after you lose a little from racking) of good table wine.  I've heard making it only five gallons will give you 25 bottles of improved wine, and I can confirm that making this kit to four gallons will give you 20 bottles of very strong, very tasty red wine.

review/text: I made the Vino Italiano Chianti wine kit and as I type this review I'm enjoying a glass of the finished wine.  I am extremely satified with the wine.  Great Chianti taste, dry, fruity, great mouth feel and such a great value.  Please calibrate your expectations as this doesn't taste like a $180 wine kit but it tastes better than the $70 Chianti kit I made earlier this year.  These Vino Italiano kits are great every day wines.  I made my six gallon kit a five gallon kit and I would recommend this.  Yes I'm still making more expensive kits but these are quick and very drinkable after four weeks.  I also made a white which was excellent and have the Barolo in progress. I will be buying more of these kits in the future.

review/summary: Mediocre Wine
review/text: Sure these wine kits are cheap, and they do come with corks, labels, and cork covers, but they really skimp on the juice. I was surprised that there was only 5L of juice in this kit. That means that you have to add 18L of WATER to get up to 6 gallons. I really think this hurts the end flavor of the wine. I've made both this Chianti, and the Reisling, and they both came out mediocre compared to other kits I've used. No real unique flavors, even after letting the wine age for 6 months. I just think these kits are a little OVER concentrated. Spend the extra money and get at least a 10L kit. I've had some great experience with RJ Spagnols brand wine kits, even their 10L kits taste noticeably better than these. I guess you get what you pay for with wine kits.

Considering there are more than two hundred packets, I was definitely hoping the flavor would stay optimal a lot longer than that.  Or if they were sold in smaller packages, it would be a good compromise.

review/summary: Great product, but pitiful expiration date on bulk order
review/text: The ability to get gluten-free soy sauce in individual packets is great.  But I was a little stunned to stock up on the bulk size of 240 packages, only to discover when they arrived that they all expire in two and half months.  Not impressed with that aspect of the product.

review/summary: Gluten free and good.
review/text: The soy sauce came in "Travel Packs", which is what I was hoping to use the sauce for anyway.  There's 12 packs of 20 in the box, which is probably way more than I'm ever going to need, but luckily I know a few Celiacs to hand some off to.  I'm sure they'll be excited.  I never knew that regular soy sauce had wheat in it, so it was nice to find a replacement product.  I can't tell a difference from regular soy sauce.  I've gotten this exact package from a major chain Chinese restaurant before, so I knew it must be good.  The little packets make it very convenient to pop in your purse if you're going out for sushi.  This is a great product.

review/text: I was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and was having a hard time at restaurants; especially at my favorite Sushi restaurant. These little packets are a life saver. I have my sushi prepared dry and add my own Soy. Wala!<br />Only thing i would reccommend to the manufactured is to create a low sodium version.

review/text: I just ordered these soy sauce packets due to my newly diagnosed gluten intolerance. Tastes pretty good and is a must for all that have the same issue... my main concern is the way this was shipped to me. I assumed they'd come in those nice little 20 ct white packs or whatever ct the picture shows, but it basically all came loose in one big box.. Wherever I keep these (car, work, etc..) I guess I need understand it will look like one of my drawers after doing one too many times of take out Chinese.

review/summary: Yay!!! Soy Sauce Again!!
review/text: I have been soy sauce deprived since discovering that regular soy sauce contains gluten, so I was excited to purchase this gluten free soy sauce. I bought it in the travel packs for a reason - I divided the little plastic cases between home, office, our ranch office,our cars and my purse. They are perfect!!! We love Asian food, (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.) and have used them in restaurants as well as in our own cooking. As far as taste? Excellent! We are foodies of sorts and tend to do a lot of blind taste testing... This soy sauce held it's own very nicely against the "standards". In fact, I think I may like it even better...

I do use the low sodium Tamari soy sauce from San J Organic at home and really did not expect the regular version to be sooo salty. We will have to try it with lots of wasabi and maybe dilute it a little with water. I really wish that the low sodium soy sauce would be available in the individual packages, too.

review/summary: The Best Cherries You'll Ever Eat!
review/text: I got hooked on these thing while living in Switzerland. They are not you're average chocolate covered cherries. These wonderful little pieces of decadence have what I call "three stages." First is this dark chocolate that isn't too rich, but has just the right mix of sweet and bitter that melts on your tongue as you bite down. Then there's the first impact of the Kirsch (cherry liquor, only better). And finally, the chocolate, cherry and Kirsch all mix into this wonderful burst of flavor. If you haven't tried them, you've missed something special!

review/summary: Received damaged product twice, gave up
review/text: The product received was a box of 25, with a small pack of 5 Mon Cheris. The small pack of 5 was perfect, the box of 25 was damaged. The chocolate had been allowed to heat so the chocolate melted and all the Kirsch had leaked out. There was no liquid in the package, no stickiness, and the cherries were dry so the product was damaged before shipping to me. I wrote a complaint, and was promised a replacement. Weeks went by while I waited for them to recieve a fresh shipment. This time the candy was shipped in a box with an ice pack, but the candy was damaged in the same way. I will shop elsewhere in the future, no longer trusting the quality from this vendor.

review/summary: Divine Chocolates
review/text: I first had these delicious chocolates 5 years ago when I was given a Mon Cheri gift box for my birthday. I was never before a fan of chocolate covered cherries as they are too sweet and gooey, but Mon Cheri is totally different. They have a subtle, full flavor with a slight hint of alcohol and are not runny, sticky or gooey. Now I give them as gifts every year, including one box to myself. (I believe they are only offered at Christmas time as they do not have a long shelf life and thus go bad quickly.) Meyers German Deli in Chicago used to carry them, but when they closed I turned to ordering them online, which does cost a little more but is worth it. Highly recommended.

Bad if you want to make an impression with a nice big box.<br /><br />I will buy more of these when I want liquor filled chocolate cherries but I would have bough different ones if I had known I was going to get three boxes of ten - good thing I didn't.

If one does a simple search in Amazon for this product you find two correct results and many fake results - the fake results are for a Hazelnut product (another Ferrero product but NOT Mon Cheri) The first product costs only $13 dollars with product count of 60 the second product costs $20 dollars for a product count of 30 (1/2) !!!<br />The first provider will not accept a shipping address in Italy (EU) - The second provider will accept a shipping address in Italy - however at more than twice the cost of the product!!!!  $50 shipping on a $20 product!<br /><br />AMAZON is clearly colaborating in this activity - AMAZON - GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER  Amazon should be responsible for doing the appropriate market research for a just and fair international market -- if not - what is Amazon as a world market provider doing for us???

review/text: I like that this is thick when first opened and easily served. doesn't need to be heated right away and makes on-the-go meals for your toddler MUCH more simple. Also, it is not overly salty like regular shells & cheese or mac-n-cheese which is VERY NICE when you're trying to feed your toddler healthier options. What I DON'T like... once it is opened and you have to refrigerate it, the sauce becomes more runny. When you heat it up after it has been in the fridge, it turns into Shells & Cheese soup. NOT easy to feed your toddler!! If your little one can eat it all in one setting, it may be good for you. Otherwise, I'd pass on this purchase.

review/text: My baby has serious allergies, and it's difficult to find microwaveable foods she can eat. We took a container to her allergy doctor and she okayed them for us. Tonight we tried them and lo and behold, she loved them. She ate the whole bowl, a first in her recent history. It's a pity that Gerber makes most of her products with carrots and sweet potatoes. We would have a greater choice if they didn't. However, we are willing to try more new foods in the near future. By the way, we microwaved the bowl but it did not become too runny like other reviewers said. It was the perfect texture and softness. I would even say it tasted better than Kraft's version. We all are very satisfied!

review/text: If you have a sweet tooth, these are absolutely amazing - like CRAZY delicious. They break a little easier than their fruity counterparts because there isn't as much frosting to keep it together and the filling is gooier. That being said, if you cradle these while eating, they will cradle your taste buds in return like a blizzard of flavor crystals erupting with every bite.<br /><br />Nutritionally, I would categorize this species of pop-tart under "soul food" along with bacon waffles and ranch fries. If you're a health nut, look elsewhere.

review/text: This pasta is fine in terms of taste, but the letters are so tiny that my son doesn't like them. He used to love the Trader Joe's alphabet pasta but they stopped making it. I bought this as a replacement. The letters, being so small, end up all over the place. I have to pick them out of the holes in the colander and out of the rug when he spills. This might be fun in a soup or a casserole but not as a pasta dish on it's own. I think I'll just use the rest of the uncooked noodles in a craft project. Perhaps we can sprinkle it like glitter on a greeting card.

review/summary: Hearty Pasta, Perfect for Soups
review/text: One of my children wanted "letter" soup, so I ordered a case of this pasta. It is a whole grain pasta, so it is heavier on the pallet than traditional pasta. We have only cooked one box and served it with a simple pasta sauce. We all ate it for lunch (5 of us) and had leftovers...it goes a long way. The flavor is a little off from some other pastas I have tried (but we are not whole grain pasta lovers at all, so take that into account). A good way to have a little fun and change to the lunch menu. And to note...they are very small, like letters in soup. However, none made it through my strainer (not a mesh one, just a "normal" stainless steel one). Good buy for the hearty factor in my opinion!

I did not notice this pasta being smaller in size than others I have tried in the past<br /><br />While I don't advocate letter drills during dinner, funnily enough, the pasta seems to be highly weighted toward the letter "O," which is great as that is one of the letters my child knows. The colors are also fun ("green O!" "Red O!")<br /><br />A good basic pasta, the fact that it is veggie and organic is probably not a significant benefit, but why not?

review/summary: very good, worth trying
review/text: I thought this might end up like the time I tried chocolate yogurt (nasty!), however, I was pleasantly surprised.  This zero calorie black tea has a strong chocolate flavor and smell.  Something's odd about it though, almost a chemical smell.  Chocolate without cream and sugar was bound to be odd!  Still, I'm on my 3rd cup.  It's not the worst tea in the cabinet, but not the best.  I'm impressed that Bigelow (known for cheap office tea) pulled off this flavor.

review/text: I'm starting to doubt the legitimacy of reviews for Bigelow teas.  This is the fourth (and last) tea from this company I'll ever purchase, no matter how enticing it is.  Like the other flavors I tried, I really gave it a fair shake, brewing up several cups and sharing with friends.  We came up with the same, insipid black tea with a bizarre chemical-like smell to it each any every time.  None of us could detect anything remotely similar to white chocolate, or much of anything save for a hint of cinnamon.  Might be best to try one box first.

review/text: White Chocolate Obsession is a blend of chocolate and robust black tea. I love this tea with milk and Stevia. It also has cinnamon and carob in it. I can definitely taste the carob and black tea more than anything else. If you love tea and you love chocolate you will probably love this tea.

review/summary: It's okay.
review/text: My mouth watered as I eagerly anticipated ordering this, just thinking of what it could taste like. I am a heavy drinker of Bigelow's Eggnog'n tea. So I couldn't even guess what this could taste like. I received the package and eagerly brewed a cup and overall was pleased, but it didn't taste how I had imagined. I noticed in another review that they said it tasted a bit like "chemicals." For the first bag I could see where they would interpret a certain aftertaste to be somewhat like a chemical, but I have not since. After a few cups (not one after another, mind you) throughout a couple weeks it just tastes like some sort of hot chocolate. Even looks that way when I add a bit of soymilk and sugar.<br /><br />Overall I give it a 3.5. Its not amazing. It's not bad. I suppose I just don't have acute tasting skills, but I honestly don't differentiate it too much from a cup of hot chocolate. I actually did put a bag in a cup of hot chocolate and it was definitely a chocolaty heaven. All in all it's good. I'm sure I'll go through all 6 boxes eventually, but I can't say that I'll be ordering more after that. As for the eggnog'n, however, that's an entirely different story :)<br /><br />If you're debating on this, I say order a small box to give it a try, then graduate to the 6-box package if you're blown away.

review/text: This one smells like hot chocolate and has a nice cocoa flavor.  I drink it unsweetened but it is good with milk and sweetener too.  I alternate this one with the Pumpkin Spice which has a bit more of a bite.  This chocolate tea has a nice mellow flavor and goes great during the cooler fall/winter and early spring months.  I have made iced tea with it as well that isn't bad, although I prefer Raspberry Royale for iced tea because it's more subtle.  But this one isn't bad for iced tea when you're in the mood for something with a cocoa flavor.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Really Tasty And Versatile...
review/text: I do a lot of hiking and camping, and have used quite a few dried products from Barry Farms. If you don't mind the taste of dried dairy and veggie products, there is just about nothing you will not find that they haven't managed to dry and bag.  Most of the products by them I came into acquaintance with way back when my son was a youngin' and in the scouts and we did a lot of camping.  A few of the products have stayed with me as extra tasty and versatile now that I am tending to face the savage wilderness alone.  Barry's red bell pepper is one of the best items to have along on a hike, or just to have included in any survival kit.  Bell peppers dress up and add some spice to just about any meat, fish, or stew that you can manage to put together out in the wilderness. And as already noted in the other review, dried products such as this last literally for years without spoiling. This dried pepper is for some reason a lot more favorable to me than genuine bell pepper.  A lot of dried products from Barry Farms have spices added, so perhaps it is the excellent garnish they use.  In any event, a little of this pepper goes a long way.  So don't let the small 2 oz package fool you.  I not only recommend this to add some fine flavoring to whatever campfire cooking you encounter, but I also recommend checking out some of the products by Barry Farms.  They're not all worth it or as flavorful, but most of them are.  And like the other reviewer here, I also recommend you buy several products at once and save a bundle on the shipping.  Recommended...

review/text: After waiting some 3 weeks for this product, thanks in part to one reviewer who, in fact, swayed my decision with the comments "Two ounces of dried peppers is a pretty big bag."  I got some teeny, tiny little 3 x 5 or so zip-close bag with what looks like red pepper bits, flakes and DUST!  I will NEVER make this mistake again.  They even have the gall to put in the directions to "Add 1 C. red peppers to boiling water to reconsitute - - ONE CUP???!!!??? I would guess that not even the entire bag makes 1 cup and it is CERTAINLY NOT "a pretty big bag," as noted.  I was expecting luscious CHUNKS of dried red pepper dices, as advertised and I got a bunch of dust and flakes for my apparently wasted money.  NO MORE!  Do not bother.<br />Make your own.  That's got to be a better deal.  "a pretty big bag," My Foot!

review/summary: Not what we expected
review/text: We are fans of the Lindt Lindor Truffles Assorted chocolates with the 5 flavors and wanted to try this special white chocolate flavor for a change. We are not fans of this one. It IS their wonderful white chocolate shell and tastes 'right', however, the gooey center has an odd, almost fungal taste both during consumption and afterwards. By 'fungal' I mean almost like eating raw mushrooms in a salad: that earthy, back of your throat,'taste'. It is quite odd and none of us (there are 8 of us here) found it enjoyable enough to want a second one. We donated this box to our local soup kitchen. (Oh, we also tried the Hazelnut at the same time and that box was donated as well. We like hazelnut, but again, the chocolate shell was normal and the hazelnut center just wasn't anything to write home about. It, too, had an odd flavor and after-taste. We knew none of us would be sneaking either of these two flavors when no one was looking).  We'll stick to the assorted 5 flavors we love. Those can't be beat.

review/summary: Buying this is a very stressful experience.
review/text: Lindt truffles is my husband's favorite chocolate.  Whenever family or friends take a trip to the US, I always  grab the chance to buy it for him.  In that past, it was hassle-free as it would be a store purchase.  Today is the first time I buy it through Amazon.com where I've had pleasant online shopping experiences in the past.  Today is a different story, I place the order at 2-day shipping thinking it would arrive at my friend's hotel by Sept. 17 or 18 at the latest.  I get an order confirmation email from Amazon telling me that the estimated delivery date would be Sept. 20-21 -- my friend would no longer be at her hotel to recieve the delivery.  So I hurriedly log on to my Amazon account to change the order details, either to make it overnight delivery so it arrives sooner or to change the delivery address.  The Amazon system was faulty and could not display my order.  Heck, it could not display any of my orders in the past year even.  It took two hours and still the website displayed sorry can not display your order.  So I place an international long distance call to Amazon customer service to see what they can do and they say it's not showing up in their system.  Great.  In a few minutes though, they email me saying that it finally showed up in their system and that they can't do anything about it since it's a third party seller (Lindt).  So they direct me instead to get in touch with Lindt.  They can change the delivery details or cancel my order altogether and I can just re-order with the correct delivery details.  So I place another international long distance call this time to Lindt, who says it's not showing up in their system.  They suggest I get back to Amazon.  Which I did and again they re-direct me to Lindt.  Back and forth a few more international phone calls later, Lindt tells me to call back in 3 and a half hours to see if it will be up in their system.  How ridiculous is this??  My bill for this order is just US$40 but I'm spending more on the phone calls just to cancel the freaking order which should not be my problem had the Amazon website been up and running instead of saying it can't display my order.<br /><br />What is more stressful in this entire experience is neither Amazon nor Lindt offered any smarts in problem solving or trouble-shooting.  They did not exhibit good customer service behaviour either.<br /><br />Very, very, very disappointing.

review/summary: My cat is addicted!
review/text: Okay, I don't know what the magic ingredient is in this, but my cat is absolutely in love with it! He is one picky eater: I have tried literally all the "healthy" types of treats (Greenies, etc.) I can find in the stores, but he is either lukewarm about them or just refuses to eat them. Alas! I am wary about stuff from Friskies, since I was told that they are "unhealthy." I read the ingredients list and it didn't say "chicken by product" so I guess it's better than the average Friskies? Anyway, I have given up on "healthy" treats (I mix Greenies in his regular food now because I know they don't work as "treats." I guess I will just have to make sure I don't overfeed him with these treats, because he is addicted! My cat is not a lap cat, but he will actually deign to come and sit on my lap when he wants these treats.

review/summary: Cat loves these
review/text: My elderly cat loves these hard little treats. She will sit and look at me until she gets one. The bag has a lot of pieces but she only gets one because she swallows whole then sometimes it doesn't stay down, if she had more teeth she could have more. I gave half the first package to the elderly cat at work, she loves them too, now about half done with second package out of 10. I think I will donate some to the food bank they accept pet food because I subscribed and then send me another 10 packages that will last me 10 years or more.

review/summary: kitty loves these treats
review/text: My 2 yr old loves them. He loves them so much he refuses to eat regular cat food unless I mix it in, but if I mix it too much, he smells it, then sits and stares at me. If I'm out I get no end of grief from Sarge.
