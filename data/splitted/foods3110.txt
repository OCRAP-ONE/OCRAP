review/summary: Tastes good and is convenient
review/text: The nice thing about this gluten-free oatmeal is that it both tastes good and is convenient to prepare in the morning. The non-instant GF oatmeal we've come across needs about as much cooking time as, say, steel-cut oats. If you're pressed for time, or if you just don't want to stand over a stove in the morning, GlutenFreeda is an excellent choice. The flavors in the variety pack are all appealing, too. So, if you need to be gluten-free and you miss oatmeal, this is a good choice. The celiac in our family loves it and goes through about a box a week.<br /><br />The one problem we've had with our orders the last couple of times has been the fact that most of the boxes have come to us from the supplier open or partially open due to a failure of the glue machine to dispense a proper amount of glue to seal the boxes. We passed this info on to GlutenFreeda to look into, but never heard back from their Customer Service representative about it.

review/summary: GF instant oatmeal at last - and it's DELICIOUS!
review/text: I found that one of the hardest parts about cutting out gluten was having to give up oatmeal. (Oats in and of themselves are generally not a problem for people with gluten sensitivity, but oats can easily become contaminated with wheat and other gluten-containing grains if they are processed nearby.) I had really come to depend on instant oatmeal as a quick, nourishing, and tasty breakfast food that I could also take with me when I traveled. And I couldn't get excited about the GF hot cereal alternatives available to me.<br /><br />Imagine my joy when I discovered that Glutenfreeda's instant oatmeal is not only gluten-free, it's also DELICIOUS. Seriously. It's true that it's not excessively sweet - which I think is a good thing, personally - but it's easy to add a bit of honey or sugar to taste. And the variety pack is handy for figuring out which flavor(s) you prefer, or if you just like to have a little, um, variety in your breakfast choices.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

I found these and ordered them right away.  He LOVES it!!

review/text: I have to disagree with the reviewer who said this oatmeal is too sweet!  I actually thought it was kind of bland, although my previous brand was Quaker Oat High Fiber Instant Oatmeal.  I actually wish it was a bit sweeter, but keep reminding myself that it is probably much healthier for me without the extra sugar. It is certainly still tasty and I like that I am getting the flaxseed too.<br /><br />Since I'm not a true celiac, but just someone who has noticed some adverse reactions to wheat, I haven't been too worried about possible trace amounts of the grain in oatmeal.  However, with an option like Glutenfreeda, I decided I may as well go with a product that promises to be gluten free.

review/text: We're gluten-free from necessity, and always seeking healthy breakfast options. I love oatmeal, but Glutenfreeda's flavor combos don't do it for me. I hate maple, which is in 2 out of 3 flavors, and wish they'd make a cinnamon banana instead of cinnamon apple.<br /><br />Also, I could do without the flax. It is nice having the convenience of the single serving packets, expecially when we travel.<br /><br />Hey, Glutenfreeda! How 'bout making some straight oatmeal, no flax, with just fruit flavors? You've already got customers waiting for it!

review/text: I was greatly disappointed when we received this coffee. We prefer a dark roast, bold coffee, and this definitely was not a dark roast - it even says on the label that it is only Medium Dark. So how come they call this an Espresso Roast? It's not even close. I feel duped! At best, this is a Full City Roast. The coffee these beans make is OK - maybe average - but if you are looking for a true dark roast coffee, this is not it.

review/text: As soon as I opened the bag, I could tell this coffee wouldn't have the depth of flavor that my husband and I prefer.  The beans are light, there's no surface oil, the aroma isn't rich -- all huge disappointments, since opening a new bag of good coffee is one of life's simple pleasures.  And you can't simply up the amount of beans you grind to reach the boldness you want -- it just becomes bitter.  Too bad -- I really wanted to find a good organic, fairly-traded, shade-grown coffee that tastes as good as the stuff you can get through Costco.  Now I'm stuck with 5 lbs. of this stuff.

review/summary: Good, and better value than you might at first think
review/text: A Cadbury dairy milk snack bar is a block of dairy milk chocolate in which each "square" of chocolate is filled with one of six different fillings: pineapple, strawberry, turkish delight, caramel, and so on. It's a bit like a box of chocolates, but in block form instead of individually wrapped treats. The quality is actually not quite up to what you'd normally expect from box chocolate, but it is pretty good. So I've given this product four stars.<br /><br />BUT, that judgement doesn't necessarily factor in the price...<br /><br />Prices on amazon can fluctuate quite a bit over time, so things may have changed quite considerably by the time you're reading this. But right now they're asking over $10 a block. Which is a bit steep.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is a LARGE block of chocolate. I confess that while I've had many of these, I haven't bought any of them from Amazon - here in Australia you can buy them at just about any shop on the street. However, as near as I can glean (after peering at my screen veeeeeery closely), the product on sale here is the 250 gm block. That basically means it's equivalent in size to five regular chocolate bars. So while the current price still doesn't exactly work out as cheap, it's not quite as bad as it first appears.<br /><br />Theo.

You should pluck some of the cake 2 teaspoons of dry leaves, put it in a cup, pour hot boiling water on it, let it soak for 10-20 seconds then discard the "first tea" prepare your serving cups, pour fresh boiling water over perviously steeped leaves let it steep for 20-30 seconds then strain tea into serving cups. make sure all the water is gone and none left in the leaves as this will oversteep the tea. You can re steep the leaves up to 8 times.<br />great health benefits, enjoy.

review/summary: Simply the best tea I ever drank
review/text: I just received this tea after waiting only 2 days, that is amazing.<br />I could not wait to try it so I followed the other reviewers' advice and washed it first. Etc. Etc.<br />Now I am not saying anyone is wrong by any means but I tried it both ways, washing and not washing and I cannot tell the difference.<br />To me I believe it is a waste of tea to wash it, in fact I found a lovely video that may be very interesting to some of you it is only 5 minutes this man is Dr. Tea he has written a book and has a shop and sells teas. He is basically an expert and he does not wash his tea.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I did however make a nice ritual out of the making of the tea.  I had the opportunity to purchase an authentic tea pot along with all the extras that I found is needed to make a good tea, I got it from China Town in California, and I used it the proper way for the first time today, it was relaxing and fun.<br /><br />I was not aware of all the health properties in this particular tea, the list is impressive, heart problems, high blood pressure, cholesterol, it helps with teeth and gum problems and promotes its healing, it is also a weight reduction tea, but what I needed it for is the Theanine that is in this tea, I have an autoimmune disease that causes inner tremors and I take L-theanine to calm me down but this tea is doing that in a more natural way.  I will no longer be needing to purchase this supplement. This also is a tea that has very little caffeine and it did not make me nervous like the average teas do.<br />I do recommend this tea to everyone especially if you have any of these problems, but for me I enjoyed a very restful day without any jitters.<br /><br />As for the cost, this morning I cut off 2 grams of the tea and I am just finishing it, you can brew this tea many many times as you can see in the video, this makes it, for me, a very inexpensive tea. It will last forever even if I use it on a daily basis which I now intend to do.

review/summary: A Great Pu-erh the first time...
review/text: "The pu-erh received was lovely. It was aged, ripe pu-erh that had a distinctive honey taste and smell. Very enjoyable!"<br /><br />That is what I wrote the first time I bought this pu-erh. Though I didn't recognize the maker of the tea, at least the box it came in matched the pictured tea on Amazon. The tea tasted great.  I thought that I would get another- but what arrived was totally different.  Different producer and different quality. I would not buy from this source again, as there is no mention of the producer of the tea and no clear description of the<br />tea, as what area in China that it comes from or year it was produced. The first bing-cha was a good value for the money. I'm not sure I can say the same about the second bing-cha.

review/summary: Disappointing taste
review/text: I have been having two different brands of Pu-Erh tea that my friend hand carried from China since last year. They taste very smooth and gentle to the stomach that I enjoy very much. I started to look for more Pu-Erh tea online as I was running out of them. I saw this brand online and gave it a try. Unfortunately, this Pu-Erh tea tastes just like Lipton type of black tea. It does not taste like good Pur-Erh tea and does stimulate my stomach a bit. I was quite disappointed!

review/summary: Don't Be Afraid to Try It
review/text: OMG. I am SO relieved. I've just taken my first few sips and I HAD to come and post a review. I've had this tea sitting around for weeks, frankly out of fear of it's taste. I read the reviews here and in other places. Descriptions like "earthy" and "mushroom" had me gagging at the thought of drinking the tea. I do NOT like mushrooms and "earthy" is a very vague description.<br /><br />That being said (this review is strictly about the taste. I will post later if I truly notice any health benefits) there is a subtle taste it that can only be described as earthy. Probably the way you'd imagine tree bark to taste. Not horrible, but nothing to drool about. I don't taste mushroom at all. The flavor is SUPER mild. It's not strong so it's almost pleasant to drink. Although the tree bark doesn't make my taste buds do a happy dance, I'm not gagging. I didn't need to add sweetener to my tea, and I can drink this every morning from now on with no problem. I have been trying to wean myself from coffee to tea and this is a good compromise IF it can wake me up in the mornings. The earthiness of the tea almost gives the satisfaction of drinking a cup of coffee that's not quite sweet enough. If you don't like sweetener in your coffee, you will probably enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I didn't time the brew. I have one of those 16 oz insulated cups with the tea diffuser inside. I filled the diffuser (not sure if it holds 1 oz. or 2) and I put hot water in the cup. I gave it 2-3 minutes then poured out the (light reddish) water and put in new water. It immediately became dark red. About 3-5 minutes later, I threw away the tea leaves.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I made mine too weak since I used a big cup. Maybe I should let it steep for 6-10 minutes? Also, I have to check to see if I used enough...or even too much tea. I'll play with it to make sure I'm getting the maximum health benefit but for now, don't be afraid to taste it! It's not horrible. No lingering after taste. If you don't like it, you'll forget it within 30 seconds of having tasted it.<br /><br />Go ahead, take the chance.

review/summary: Great impression of first time Pu Erh drinker
review/text: I just got the package a few minutes ago and just started my first brew. I followed the traditional procedure of rinsing the Pu Erh with boiling water for 20 seconds and throwing out the rinse. The first infusing which is the one I'm currently drinking while reviewing was a 20 second brew as well. This tea is very mellow and I'd imagine very hard to make bitter due to the fermentation process, it has strong woody presence, both scent and taste, reminiscent of green rooibos. I would definitely buy this again.. now back to tasting the tea.<br /><br />with 5.2 grams(Messured with a scale) I've just broken off gently with my hands, since I have no proper tools. A 150ml tea cup is used to measure the boiling water and drink from.<br />..<br />edit: Second, Third, and Fourth infusion have all been the same, no compromise to the complexity and only a very slight hint of bitterness on the  fourth, which was a 35 second brew, the longest....I'm going to go as high as 7 infusions.<br /><br />This tea packaging wrap has a date of 2007, so pretty decent aging.

review/text: I am not an expert on Pu-erh tea but I know what I like and I like this tea.  I just read a review that mentioned this tea has l-theanine in it. This is great because I can be a stress queen and it explains why it does not make me jittery.  To see how strong it gets would make you think it would, but it is not bitter either. I bought this tea because of the health benefits so I am going to stick with it.  Health benefits or not, if I didn't like the taste I wouldn't drink it!

review/summary: Yunnan pu-erh Tea
review/text: After reading reviews and watching You Tube Chinese brewing methods I have found the instuctions on the pkg. to be adequate (2gm. in a cup of boiling water for 3 min.)  If you want to rinse it for 20 seconds and discard this first steep like the chinese ritual then rinse it.  I think rinsing doesn't clean the tea it may be a rehydrating process.  After all, this is a fermented tea and all the benefits of the fermentation process shouldn't be washed and discarded.  Keep in mind that the Chinese make teeny tiny cups of tea at a time so the steeping lengths are measured in seconds.  I make 16oz.at a time in a large mug so I put 4gm. of tea in a tea ball and steep in boiling water (just let it sit there) for 3 min. then set aside the tea ball for the next steep in 16oz. of boiling water for 3-5 min.  Color is the best way to tell the strength and steep time if it takes 30 seconds or 3 minutes.

review/summary: Great tea
review/text: I like the taste of Oolong tea.  This is along the same lines as far as taste, but much darker and flavorful.  I personally can drink it without sweetening it, but I still do add some sweetner.<br /><br />I have seen ways to prepare it on youtube, but I guess I do my own thing.<br /><br />I have a small 12 oz cup with a strainer.  I break up a relatively small portion and run hot water through it.  I immediately dump it out.  Some of the fine particles wash out and the tea is very light.  I let it sit damp for a while (most of the time overnight).  It seems that since the tea is now soaked, I can pour hot water over the tea leaves/stems and immediately remove the strainer (and consume).  I can do this 2 more times that same way as the same batch.  On the fourth time, I let it steep a few minutes to get the last bit out and then discard the used up tea leaves.<br /><br />I have heard that there are some health benefits from drinking this tea.  I cannot comment one way or another as I have not noticed anything.  I like the taste and the pick me up.  I usually have 2 cups a day between breakfast and lunch.  I like my sleep, so I personally wouldn't drink it too late in the day.  I also don't get too jittery like drinking a Venti Tarbucks.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: This is a pretty good low end pu-erh, sweet and earthy. Because there can be some confusion about how to make it, here is how I do it.<br /><br />First I break off a suitable size chunk of it (I like to taste my tea, so I use more leaves). Then, I rinse this in my infuser with freshly boiled water. I then steep the tea in freshly boiled water for the following times:<br />1st infusion: 65 seconds<br />2nd infusion: 75 seconds<br />3rd infusion: 95 seconds<br />4th infusion: 210 seconds<br /><br />The first two infusions taste pretty strong, the third is noticeably weakening and the fourth is about half as strong as the first.

Yes, these blueberries are bathed with High Fructuose Corn Syrup. In fact, they have so much of this Genetically Modified sugar that eating a few of them mad me cough uncontrollably! The only way I could eat these blueberries was after washing them for 15 min in running water and this was not enough.<br /><br />Worse. Where foes it say in their advertisment that this supposedly natural product is contaminated with GM HFCS? I think, we consumers, should be able to look at a lable before we spend our cash.

review/text: Do not buy this product or anything else they sell if you want something actually healthy.  I cant believe i did not look at the comments first.  I totally trusted these were going to just be dried blueberries.  High fructose corn syrup makes these things horrible.

review/summary: too sweet
review/text: I was excited to get these but  did not read the ingrediants before purchasing. Big mistake. To me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting.  I dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids.  The high fructose is insane and really  i feel they would be  better off with a fraction of what they add.

review/summary: Very tasty snack
review/text: I compare these to the dried blueberries that I purchased (for considerably more) at our local organic grocery.  These were far superior in taste.  The blueberries were much bigger, and tasted like blueberries (as opposed to the ones at the organic store, which just tasted over-sweetened, but without any real flavor.  My wife and daughter go through these so quickly by the handful, I almost never have them to cook with, but they work great with oatmeal, pancakes, etc.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: blueberries + high fructose corn syrup
review/text: I was also surprised to find out that Stoneridge Orchards puts high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in their dried blueberries.  As the incidence of metabolic syndrome has increased, so has the consumption of high fructose corn syrup.  We are up to an astounding 62 pounds per person per year, compared to 0.5 pounds per year in 1970 (Basciano H et al.  Nutr Metab 2005;2:5).  Fructose is preferentially metabolized to fat, compared to other sugars, so it's certainly a concern.  But anyway...I called the company and asked them about this.  They said they have to add some sugar to the product, to keep the natural sugars in the berries from cystallizing.  From the packaging, the total sugar content is 31 g per 40 g serving, and the "inherent" sugar content of the berries is around 29 g, so they are adding a couple of grams HFCS per serving (less than 10% of the total).  In the overall scheme of things, this likely isn't a huge deal, since the berries themselves already contain fructose.  Any downside of the small amount of added HFCS is likely outweighed by the high antioxidant content.  So my advice, for what it's worth, is to eat these berries.  They taste great!  The company also has a line of organic dried blueberries which have added cane sugar instead of HFCS, and they say they plan to discontinue the HFCS-adulterated product.  If you still have an issue with eating berries to which sugar has been added, pick your own berries and dry them yourself!

review/text: I would give these zero stars if I could.  Your basic fat American may be able to taste the blueberry through the other additives, but I cannot.  And they play hell with my blood sugar.  These are very dangerous for people who have diabetes and if you eat enough of them you will probably get diabetes.<br /><br />And do you really think hiding the "High Fructose Corn Sugar" behind an acronym makes them "All natural".  In a more enlightened age you would have been busted for false advertising.<br /><br />Why can't Amazon offer at least one unsweetened selection of dried blueberries?  That way those of us with blood sugar problems or who want to avoid them could find something healthy to eat and the rest of your suicidal customers can do their thing.

review/summary: Best Blueberies Ever
review/text: If you like Blueberries (and who doesn't), but don't have time to go pick them, this is the product for you. The blueberries are dried and taste better than fresh blueberries. I usually have to add sugar to fresh blueberries because they aren't very sweet naturally. These dried blueberries have a little corn syrup added already, so that makes them extra tasty. These are whole blueberries, not pieces of blueberries like some other brands. So, that's good. I put them in my oatmeal every morning, which is delicious. You could also put them in pancakes or muffins or even just eat them out of the bag. Blueberries are full of antioxidants which is good for your health. I don't know who picks these, but I'm glad I don't have to. I picked blueberries once and it took forever to pick just one pint. Plus it was hot. My time is better spent sharpening the blade on my lawn mower and then watching "The Hills" on MTV.
