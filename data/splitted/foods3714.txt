review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.  Nice cheese flavor.
review/text: I recently tried these, after usually sticking to the Black Bean Sea Salt flavor.  These are certainly different from that flavor, but just as enjoyable.  The cheese flavoring is the perfect flavor for my pallet.  I won't switch to these from the Sea Salt ones, but will definitely add them to my chip rotation.<br /><br />Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories. That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste. To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings. I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these and wish that the bags contained less air and more chips, but otherwise I think they are great. I highly recommend that you try them.  The pricing here on Amazon, is usually about 30 cents per 6 ounce bag cheaper than what they charge at the local grocery store, HEB.  Specialty stores like Sprouts and Whole Foods charge even more for them.

review/summary: Another great EB product
review/text: I think the other reviews seem a little dramatic.  I'd have to guess that the BPA is in the very edge of the babyfood jar lid, to help seal it.  so unless you are storing the food upside down or letting your child suck on the lids, it really shouldnt matter...hey...by the way, they ship them to Targe in a rusty metal truck that live in diesel fuel...  why this guy is even reviewing a pouch of pears is questionable.  If he wanted to hate the jars...fine, but this is a bpa free pouch product.<br /><br />The actual product.  Excellent.  5 month old loves it...and our 2 year old tries to steal them too!

review/text: This seasoning is outstanding!  I don't use it to make taco meat.  I use the packages for that.  I use it to flavor almost everything else.  It is great on sandwiches to pasta with only butter.  I love it on steamed vegetables!  Wal-mart carried it for a short while but does not carry it anymore; so, I will be purchasing more from the internet.  If you have not tried this - you must.  It is a very mild flavor.  It is very noticeable but not pungent.

review/text: Old El Paso Seasoning is so versatile, and this particular canister is a VERY good deal compared to buying the little packages in the store that make one recipe of taco meat.  Flavor is great as is, or you can add more heat with a little cayenne.  The seasoning is good to use with pork in a slow cooker to make shredded pork too.  Soups, chilies, layered dips--tons of uses for this.  With Amazon Prime it is an even better deal.  Let's eat!

review/text: My older cat has dander problems so the vet recommended this product.  While I was at it I put it in both my cats food<br /><br />It might have helped his skin and fur, but after giving him the quantity specified on the package, he got diarrhea.  I decided dander was preferable to diarrhea.<br /><br />The other cat ran when she smelled it in her food.<br /><br />So, bottom line, I use it rarely in smaller amounts for one cat and not at all for the other.

review/text: Stevita is my favorite brand of Stevia.  I've ordered it numerous times (my bottles keep disappearing!), and gotten my family and friends hooked on it too.  The cinnamon is my favorite of the flavors, perfect for coffee and tea.  This has a really strong cinnamon taste, so just a few drops can be more than enough.  Anyone who complains of bitterness (as in another review), used too much.  Less is more!  Try a few drops first, and then add more to taste.  It adds sweetness and cinnamon without adding carbs and bitterness!

review/summary: Absolutely disgusting-not white choc, chemical aftertaste
review/text: I bought these because they are listed in the white chocolate category and therefore should be white chocolate. I expected the "inside" dream part to be some kind of vanilla cream or something but the candy bar part, the chocolate part, is supposed to be actual white chocolate. It's a solid white square that tastes funky.<br /><br />This was the worst tasting, most chemical aftertaste I've ever tasted in candy and there is nothing remotely white chocolate, except for the color. This was some kind of dreadful lab created super sweet fake vanilla square. Even the vanilla flavor was not like actual real vanilla, unless maybe they used an entire bottle of flavoring or 50,000 vanilla beans. Still, that would give it a real vanilla taste, not a chemical/fake vanilla flavor.<br /><br />If you are not looking for creamy white chocolate taste and are not looking for that light vanilla flavor, maybe you'll enjoy it for what it is but I was going by the description and the name and giving Ghirardelli credit in advance that it would have a taste that was consistent with white chocolate with a slight vanilla flavor. I don't understand how a basic taste - white chocolate, milk chocolate, dark chocolate is a simple concept, and yet, Ghirardelli white chocolate is nothing close to white chocolate.<br /><br />By the ingredients, I suppose it is accurate if they are truthfully listing ingredients, but the taste is absolutely horrendous.

review/summary: While Vanilla Chocolate?
review/text: As an unofficial chocaholic I must say that the Ghirardelli CWV squares were confusing by name mainly. Very sweet without much of a vanilla flavor at all they were by accident very good when combined with Ghirardelli's Intense - Premium Dark chocolate squares which from 70% to 80% pure chocolate were way too bittersweet if that even applies to their inedible taste without Ghirardelli's CWV squares. I purchased this item out of pure mistake not being a fan of white chocolate and wouldn't purchase these again for that reason alone. All said I liked then and wouldn't turn down one if offered to me.

review/summary: Bitter and Sour
review/text: I love figs, fresh and dried, and I've loved every Oskri product I've tried...until this one. The expiration date says 2012, but either I had a bad batch or these bars were intended to taste very bitter and sour. They're not sweet at all and even kind of burned in my throat on the way down.  I am not in any way a picky eater, but this is definitely one of the worst foods I've ever experienced.  Don't say you weren't warned.

review/summary: Good figs
review/text: I love real figs and really wanted to be able to have some small size "healthier" snacks to carry with me when I travel.  Love the size and how they are wrapped so well.  It is great to just throw these in my computer bag, suitcase or purse when I head out the door.  Even though I love so many of Oskri's products, these are not my all time favorite; yet I'm not quite sure why.  I like figs as an ingredient in other bars and when they are fresh.  I think what these are missing are the little seeds like regular figs have and I personally love the little seeds.<br /><br />All in all these bars are really handy and quite good if you like figs - without the seeds.  Another real bonus besides the small snack size is the packaging.  Packaging like this is great to keep on a shelf in our house or to keep at work.  Makes healthy snacking easy - just keep bottom open and grab-and-go.  Snacks like these would be great to have around for kids because the size isn't so large (reduce risk of obesity) and the packaging looks really appealing and fun - so kids would be more inclined to grab these instead of candy.

review/summary: Yummy Figs!
review/text: These are great little bars to snack on. Great for taking along to school or work. They are pretty good tasting and just the right size. I have consumed about six boxes of these over the last year and found them to be consistent in quality. They are slightly moist and not overly sweet like figs should be. If you are looking for a substitute for candy bars, these will do the trick. Nothing but figs, no crust.

review/summary: The bars are a lot smaller than expected.
review/text: I was disappointed in the size of the fig bars. I received some as a gift in the past, and they were three times the size of these bars. The ones I received here, look like they are bite size, fun size, or children's size. I think I was misled by the image shown of this product. I think it would have helped to show a horizontal picture of the bar. Also, maybe put in the description that these are "fun size" fig bars so people know they are not the normal size they should be.<br /><br />On a good note, these bars are very tasty. I will just have to make sure I order the correct size next time.

review/text: Somebody gave me this bottle when cleaning out her fridge. She doesn't use syrup much but it was brand new and had a long way from expiring. Well, she gave away a great tasting syrup!<br /><br />Compared to the store bought brands out there, this one knocks them out of the water. You can taste that it's much more natural than the preservative laden stuff out there. The sweetness is just right and it's nice and thick like you want it. I kept mine in the fridge so that it'd stay fresher.<br /><br />I was sorry to see that we've finished it and I even rinsed out and kept the bottle. Now that I've seen it here, I may purchase the bigger bottle. Looking at the price, I'd say it is worth it!

review/text: I first tasted <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004QVH0W0">Tasty Licks BBQ - "REDEYE REDMEAT RUB" - ONE POUND BAG</a> on chargrilled Ribeye steaks and enjoyed it very much. It has a unique flavor that does remind one of coffee. It is especially aromatic and quite different from the other meat rubs I have tried; both store bought and homemade. Since then, I have used it again on strip steaks, allowing it to work its way into the meat for at least 4 hours before grilling. I did try it on St. Louis Pork Ribs and didn't really care for the flavor combination. I would recommend a bit of salt added to the meat in addition to the rub.<br />The product is so good that I will definitely try the other Tasty Licks rubs. Enjoy.<br />Recommended.

review/summary: Excellent Turkey Stew for Dogs Spoiled at Thanbksgiving
review/text: Our three dogs, our dachshunds Wiener & Schnitzel; and Polly our rescue mixed terrier, love Blue's Tasty Turkey Stew.  When we bring out the can they know by sight the can. Wiener & Schnitzel sit up on their hind legs and whimper while I open the can.  Meanwhile Polly sits, her energy held at bay, while the meal is prepared.<br /><br />When I move the three bowls towards the dog eating area, all three dogs follow me.  All three bounce up and down on their front feet until I stop and hold the bowls out.  All three then sit.  Their dinner is then served.  The dachshunds usually finish first and attempt to go to Polly's bowl.  But they are warned away by Polly's growls, until she is finished.  All three dogs then exchange bowls and attempt to lick-up parts of dinner the others have missed.<br /><br />What a wonderful product.  Polly, who is scarred from a fire, has increased in size and vitality.  Her scar, which is bare of hair, seems to shrink as she uses Blue Buffalo products.  We think this is because of the balanced meats, vegetables and fruits in her diet plus the extra vitamins she receives from Blue Buffalo products.<br /><br />Thank you Blue Buffalo.

review/summary: A St. Louis Original -- Best Chocolate EVER
review/text: My husband grew up in St. Louis (let me know if you want to know which High School ;-)  and the first Christmas he came to our house, he brought us a pound of the Milk Chocolate.  He certainly knew how to win over my family because our entire family practically had fist fights over this chocolate.<br /><br />It is incredibly creamy, rich, and full of flavor.  It makes Nestles taste like cardboard.  Their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZXXWF0">Bissinger's Dark Chocolate Peppermint Bark (10 Oz)</a> is also like Nirvana.<br /><br />Service from Bissinger's is excellent and they often have free shipping. Every year, I send this all over the country to all of my family members and it is always the most popular part of the holidays for many.<br /><br />I've had a LOT of chocolate in my 40+ years... this is by far the best I have ever had.

review/text: I absolutely love these fruit snacks!  In fact they are my favorite out of the other "natural" brands I've tried-- "Yummy Earth", and "Surf Sweets".<br /><br />Amazon for a time was selling the 2.75 oz. bags for about a dollar a piece (but now they're back up to $2.50+ per).<br /><br />I thought I was getting a similar deal through VitaCost, but to my dismay, it's only a box of five .08 oz. pouches, and therefore not worth the price (in my opinion)!<br /><br />Nowhere on the product page does it say how big the bags are. I should have checked VC's website to make sure; next time when it's not specific, I guess I will.

review/text: Update: this listing has been corrected to reflect that the item is fudge flavor only; the rating has not been changed since the review does reflect the product currently sold. Original review below.<br /><br /> - DG<br /><br />This was supposed to be a mix of cookie dough and fudge brownie bites but it was all one flavor, just fudge bites. I've notified Amazon of the issue.<br /><br />Other notes on this product:<br /><br />The fudge bites are very lacking in "fudge" flavor - very cheap, overly sweet and artificial tasting.<br /><br />The "chocolate-y" coating has that cheap Whitman's sampler type taste, not very much like chocolate, more artificial-type chocolate-y taste.<br /><br />The whole thing is a little gritty and waxy in texture.<br /><br />It arrived in a bag within a box and the inner bag resembles a blue opaque trash bag; I am  used to food items being stored in clear bags only; this may be some new way to package bulk items?<br /><br />Rated as just the fudge bites I would not purchase again nor recommend.

I hated Grevalia, the Maxwell House is OK coffee, but like drinking flavored water, when I saw the French Roast, which is supposed to be DARK and assumed stronger and fairly inexpensive, I thought I should at least try it. It is hard to replace Starbucks, but the French Roast is OK, not wonderful. I tried the Narob and several different others, but FOR ME this is going to have to be my Starbucks replacement.<br />I had heard that Tassimo was supposed to get a better choice by mid to end of summer and it appears they have fallen short. I had heard that Starbucks was to partner with Cruinart, but so far it's not showing up. I'm not sure these single cup guys are so great, when you are forced to a limited brand of coffees. We are back to Corporate America manipulating our morning cup of wake up.

review/summary: tassimo t-discs
review/text: The cost is considerably less, however the loss of the Starbuck brand and African Kitamu t-discs was a real downer. I have tried many single serve coffees and Starbucks was the best. I'm sure it has had a negative effect on Bosch single serve coffee maker sales. At this time I'm considering a Nesspresso machine because of the bold, dark coffee blends available.

review/summary: Undiscovered gem
review/text: You've already discovered Tassimo, now discover one of their best and cheapest coffees!  This French Roast is just as good as the more costly Gevalia.  It's also better than the regular Maxwell House blend, I think it's called House Blend.  I used to buy it directly from Tassimo, but they have gone up a dollar per package so this is the best deal going.  Hope Amazon continues to offer it forever!

review/summary: Smooth, silky and always in my cupboard.
review/text: This delectable brew always reminds me of eating in a Chinese restaurant where this black tea is served, rivaling in popularity with green tea. The taste is smooth and mellow, absolutely delicious with some sugar and even tastier when chilled. There is no harshness and no aftertaste and this would please even the most finicky tea drinkers. I used to make two or three cups of it, and leave them in the kitchen only to return later to drink the cool, silky tea. Also wonderful with milk or lemon, this black tea is my second favorite after The Prince of Wales also from Twinings and even though they are both black teas, they taste little differently. Oolong is my everyday drinking tea but it's delicious enough to be served to guests or to sip a steaming mug of it on a rainy afternoon.<br /><br />I have tried other brands of Oolong, but so far this is the gentles and less metallic and smoky tasting than others. I am drinking it now with some fried rice as I type, and in my mind I am ready to have a refill or two. For those still stuck on Lipton and Tetley this is the tea they need to change to, for the price is not high and the taste is absolutely fantastic. This is one tea not to be missed, as it's delicate and smooth, and so much more than just "tea".<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/summary: Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor
review/text: To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words "Medium Extra Bold" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.

review/summary: My Favorite by a Landslide so Far
review/text: I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do.

review/summary: Great Coffee--competetive price!
review/text: I've had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop "regular" but instead has "Extra Bold". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes.
