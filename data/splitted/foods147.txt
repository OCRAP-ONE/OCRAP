review/summary: I've had better
review/text: When my local grocery store stopped carrying my favorite avacado oil I started a search for a new favorite. I typically use it to make homemade mayo so I prefer a mild creamy flavor. This is far from mild or creamy. It gave my mayo a pungent almost bitter taste the was more like olive oil than avocado oil. In the past, quality oils have turned my mayo slightly greeninsh, this stuff turned it an odd bright yellow which does make me doubt the quality of the product.

review/summary: Folks, smoke point is 350F, not 500F.
review/text: Hello, just want to let you know the smoke point is 350F for this oil. Hope you folks haven't been cooking at a temperature beyond that, you could be eating bad oil. REFINED avocado oil is up to 520F, but this is NOT fully refined (which makes a better product in terms of retaining nutrients and flavors). The 350F is clearly stated on the manufacturer's website, and also their response to an email inquiry I sent.<br /><br />"The smoke point of REFINED Avocado oil is in fact the highest of any<br />vegetable oil at around 520. Our oil is not fully refined, and in so being<br />retains the wonderful flavor and aroma of Avocados. The smoke point for our<br />oil is as stated 350 because it has more avocado solids in it, that's why it<br />tastes so good. Fully refined oils are  odorized and less flavorful.<br />Hope this helps.<br />Thank you for your support of La Tourangelle."<br /><br />That means there are a lot of retailers out there providing the wrong information on this. If you want a high smoke point, make sure it is REFINED avocado oil. For its purposes, this is still a great oil to use.

review/summary: Excellent quality oil with a delicate color, flavor, and fragrance
review/text: La Tourangelle Avocado Oil has a beautiful pale green color and a wonderful but delicate fragrance and flavor of avocados.  It is not at all bitter.  Avocado oil is pressed from the flesh of the avocado, not the seed.<br /><br />It is especially good drizzled on fresh-baked bread or pizza.  It is nice on a salad although if there are other strong flavors for it to compete with such as balsamic vinegar, onions, or cheese, consider using a less expensive oil with a more competitive flavor such as first-press olive oil and save this for when you can better appreciate its unique sensory qualities.  There is a recipe on the label for a citrus dressing with equal parts of this oil and citrus juice with a little honey, salt, and pepper which complements the flavor of the oil rather than overpowers it as a dressing with vinegar does.<br /><br />Avocado oil also has a medium-high smoke point, higher than that of olive oil, so it is safer to use for cooking on the stove top although there are less expensive oils just as suitable for this purpose.<br /><br />Avocado oil is also an excellent oil for use on the skin and the scent is pleasant enough that I will dab a little on my elbows and knuckles when using it in the kitchen.<br /><br />The oil is packaged in a can to protect it from light and the lid fits tightly, although I have found that it will drip from the spout and collect on top of the can.  Twisting the can at the end of the pour (as with a bottle of wine) helps prevent this.  It can be stored at a reasonable room temperature but it would be better off in the refrigerator in warm climates or instead of over the oven.<br /><br />I purchased my La Tourangelle Avocado Oil at a organic grocery store chain (known for high prices) because other customers have reported that they have received rancid cans from Amazon, probably from sitting in a hot warehouse.  Let's hope Amazon addresses this issue and also provides appropriate packaging to protect the attractive can during shipping as the price is significantly lower here.

review/text: I wonder if someone started listening to the reviews on here of dented cans? Mine was shipped in a box with air-filled bags inside of another box with a ton more air-filled bags. No dents.<br /><br />I purchased this oil for two reasons. One, homemade healthy mayonnaise. Two, high smoking point. I used it last night to deep fry some soft corn tortillas to make hard taco shells. Worked great. No gross after taste like you get with canola. I also deep fried some flour tortillas for my husband (I have a wheat allergy), and he LOVED them. The great part is I can deep fry and not have to feel guilty about serving up rancid, omega-6 filled food. Very happy.

review/text: I'm an aficionado of avocado oil for over ten years. If you like a neutral tasting avocado oil (i.e. Spectrum), then this isn't for you. Still great for everything, including mayo.<br /><br />If you receive a dented can, you can call Amazon and they will ship a replacement. Don't try the web site as you'll get some dismaying answers... It's not La Tourangelle's fault that someone at the Amazon fulfillment center didn't do their job right so please don't give a negative review on the product for that reason.

review/text: I bought this oil for my hair.  I've been swimming a lot and the chlorine has depleted my hair form its natural oil. The avocado oil added the shine and softness back to my hair.  All I do is wet my hair and towel dry it.  Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of avocado oil to my intensive repair cream (I use moroccan oil brand repair cream) put it on my hair and either sit under a hot cap or leave it overnight.  works wonders!!!! I grew up eating and using avocado for beauty treatments...I used to mash up avocado and put it on my hair...I like the oil better...less messy.<br />I am also cooking with it.  The popcorn comes out so much better!!!! LOVE IT.

review/text: Since going primal (see here is you don't know what I'm talking about:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982207700">The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy (Primal Blueprint Series)</a>), I've been abstaining from gluten and eating out, which means I'm cooking a whole lot more than I ever did before.  It also means I'm avoiding packaged foods, such as mayonnaise, which is actually how I found avocado oil and what prompted me to purchase this product.  (This stuff makes FANTASTIC homemade mayo!  Buy it!  Try it!)<br /><br />I've never particularly liked the taste of extra virgin olive oil (it has a bitter taste to me) and it should not be used to cook at high temperatures as the smoke point is about 405 degrees F.  Avocado oil, on the other hand, has a subtle aroma and taste and a HIGH smoke point of about 520 degrees F, making it useable for pretty much anything.  I use it for salad dressings, marinades, and cooking (with the exception of deep frying - I don't deep fry anything).  With the exception of some specialty oils, such as walnut oil and truffle oil, this is the only oil I keep in the house anymore.<br /><br />A note on packaging:  When I purchased this through Amazon, both of the cans were dented.  Since I drain the oil into a tinted glass oil drizzler, that didn't bother me but FYI to those who might be.  I've found these at my local TJ Maxx many times and the cans have never been dented, so check there if you just want to give avocado oil a try or you need an unblemished can.

review/summary: Expeller-pressed but Probably not Cold Pressed
review/text: First good thing: the package arrived two days after I placed my amazon order.  I bought this oil mainly for cooking stir fry dishes in high heat.  The oil appears to be thicker than grapeseed oil.  The only thing I am not sure about is if this avocado oil is cold pressed.  I sent an email to the manufacturer but did not receive a straight answer.  Their reply is that all their oils are pressed by expeller-presser at room temperature without using any chemicals.  I think I will try the other brands of avocado oil that are advertised "organic and cold-pressed" after I am done with this order.

review/summary: Reminds Me Of Olive Oil
review/text: I have been using La Tourangelle Avocado Oil in 'everything' since receiving my order couple weeks or so back. I like not strong olive oil (usually like the buttery kind from late ripe olives). I tasted some of this avocado oil alone and it is a bit stronger than "buttery" olive oil as it does have a bit of a 'bite'. I still do like it, though. I've used it for sauteing, on toast with onion or garlic powder, salads, rubbed some in my skin and a tiny bit on my chapped lips. I may get it again as I like to have a variety in my diet plus the avocado oil is good for moisturizing my skin. My fave oil is golden flax oil by Community Living Foods, except it should not be used for frying or heating.

review/summary: Just okay...I prefer Olive Oil for taste
review/text: I got this based on the all the positive reviews and was so excited to try this out since I love avocados.  The day I got this, I poured some in a small dish and tried using it as a dipping oil with bread.  I normally use olive oil and love it but love trying new things and was looking forward to this since others said the taste was great.  Well I personally did not like it all as a dipping oil.  I could not get past the first bite of bread and immediately dumped it and got the olive oil.  I've used it in saut&eacute;ing dishes and it is fine for that purpose.  I don't fry food at home so I've never used this other than in regular cooking.  THis is a decent oil if you are in the search for different products to try but I personally prefer olive oil for dipping and cooking and prefer walnut oil for salad dressings.  This is decent but I probably wouldn't buy it again.

review/summary: Avocado oil - a great replacement for olive oil in high heat situations!
review/text: You should Google the toxic effects of oils when they are heated to their smoke point. I used to think fried food was just fatty - now I know it's also toxic. That research led me to take note of the smoke points of the various oils I use when cooking and make sure I don't reach them. I try to only use healthy oils and use them properly:<br /><br />Coconut Oil - smoke point: 350-400 degrees F<br />Olive Oil - smoke point: 350-400 degrees F<br />Avocado Oil - smoke point: 520 degrees F<br /><br />The smoke point of most common oils is around 350-400 degrees F - depending on the specific type/process used to create the oil. As a result, it's pretty easy to reach those smoke points and create toxins in your food.<br /><br />Avocado oil has a very high smoke point (520 degrees F). It also has a fatty profile similar to olive oil (healthy in moderation). This makes it an ideal substitute to whatever you were using to cook things at high heat. For me this means any time I cook meat in my cast iron skillet (high heat to get a nice sear). The avocado flavor is very mild and is not something you will taste in the finished product.<br /><br />I've been using this product for a few months...<br /><br />EDIT: It just dawned on me that this product is in a can. While the oil itself has been great, I cannot continue buying anything in a can. I have been phasing canned items out of my kitchen to avoid BPA. Even BPA-free cans have to have some replacement chemical lining the aluminum to prevent corrosion. As such I am dropping this rating down to 4 stars and will look for other options. I even prefer plastic over cans but glass is best!

review/summary: Great alternative to olive oil
review/text: I love the higher burning point. I can cook in higher heat and not create smoke or blackening as with Canola oil (PS - for those who think canola oil is bad for you, do some research.  It's no longer made from rapeseed and doesn't contain the high level of erucic). I can see them being ok if used in small quantities. And even though I'll use the occasional spray of canola on a pan, I prefer this to Canola or Olive Oil.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have a mild skin allergy to olive oil. This is just as good and I prefer the taste more. I use it in a misto sprayer. Great stuff. On my second order.

I was concerned about the highly processed vegetable oil we had been using, and the way the oil can become carcinogenic when cooked at high heat. Now, this is true for any oil; it should not be heated past it's " smoke point ". Avocado oil has a very high smoke point, making it a perfect, healthy choice. It has healthy fats for your heart, and tastes yummy. I also recommend macadamia oil for the same reasons. Amazon shipped these right away, and they were perfect. If you have a Misto, this is a great oil to put in it! We will definitely keep this on hand.

I opened the box only to find a second box inside. I remembered some of the reviews said that it had been well packaged, so I didn't get my hopes up. I opened this box to reveal mounds of bubble wrap. Finally I got to the cans. Both were pristine! I haven't made the soap yet, but the oil appears to be very nice. It has a light fruity smell and deep green color that I hope translates into the soap!

review/text: I am totally allergic to Avocado's.  Before I knew it I had ordered this for a dish.  So since I couldnt use it for the food, I knew it was good for the skin...so I used it...OHHHHHH, it felt so good.<br /><br />I used it hot in my hair, used it in my lotion and used it also after a shower.  Multi - Use and very nice product.

review/summary: Badly dented can
review/text: The oil seems to be of good quality, but when I received the package, one of the cans was so badly dented that I just threw it away. There were plenty of airbags packed around the cans and the box wasn't dented or creased, so I think one of the cans was already dented before it was shipped. When a can is dented, heavy metal leaches into the product. I feel a bit cheated.

review/summary: Fun gift, but dented
review/text: I thought this would be a fun gift for my boyfriend's sister who is into cooking. I had read in many other reviews that the cans came dented.  For so reason I was hoping that this would be different for me.  Well, they arrived today.. dented.  One can isn't dented too bad and will still give as a gift.  The other can is too dented for me to consider gift-worthy.  I can't attest to the quality of the oil yet, because I haven't used it and nor has she.. I just wanted to get this review out to let people know that your cans will most like come dented in some way or an other.  In fact, mine came in a big box from Amazon with a few other purchases; Amazon seemed to wrap it well, but my guess is that the cans were dented before Amazon shipped them to me.

review/summary: A must have for any and every night out!
review/text: I think it's a fair to say that on at least the last 3 new year's days I have spent the entire day hungover, telling myself "I'm never drinking again." This year, I attended a giant party where I drank more than my body weight in booze THEN finished off a fifth of Jameson with 3 others...all in all, I drank for about 7 hours and was well on my way to a "Never drinking again.." kinda morning.  I managed one more shot (of Party Armor) before bed and woke up thinking "Did I even drink last night?".  Seriously, aside from a slight headache which I quickly got rid of with some excedrid, I felt amazing on New Year's day.  Dont drink and drive, but also dont drink without Party Armor.  (As a side note, they might not advertise this, but it gets rid of hangovers if you already have one, just drink it quickly and try your best to keep it down.) Awesome, awesome, product.

review/summary: Funny as a novelty, and good for self torture - 2.5 stars
review/text: Previously, I had sampled Lester's Fixins <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079KZ9AK">Sweet Corn Soda</a>, a rather bizarre beverage.  Now, with Buffalo Wing Soda in hand, I was about to imbibe yet another dubious offering from ol' Lester.  With slight trepidation, I pried the bottle cap off of this evil beverage and took a sniff --"Okay," I foolishly thought to myself, "it smells a little bit strange, but not as bad as I expected." (I was in denial)!  Finally, I took my first swig...  In reality, it tasted sort of like a citrus soda that had been spiked with a couple teaspoons of hot sauce.  The spiciness gave a slight burning sensation to my esophagus, and a funky aftertaste lingered for a while after I had finished the beverage. Subsequently, "rot gut" began to settle in, and any lingering "open mindedness" that I still had toward this soda faded away exponentially...<br />As I type this review, the empty bottle sits next to me; I've now become acutely and unequivocally aware of the noxious smell continually wafting from the opening:  An unsettling hybrid scent of hot sauce and sickly sweetness.<br /><br />I like the novelity of this soda, but I don't think that I'll be drinking it again.

review/text: Jablum Jamaican coffee is Jamaica itself, especially the Sandals Resort at Ocho Rios. If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican "blends" offered in stores and on the Internet). Thank heaven for the Blue Mountains (the "blum" in Jablum)!

review/summary: Straight from Jamaica
review/text: I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other "Jamaica grown" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price.

review/text: When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.

review/text: Believe it or not, I bought this at a yard sale for 50 cents.  The packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo.  It doesn't expire for another 6 months.  I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)

review/summary: Unbeatable flavour and taste
review/text: You know I love my English Breakfast (see my earlier 5 star review of Twinings English Breakfast) -- but my greatest delight is Earl Grey tea -- with its deep, smokey, heavy (but not burdensome) mysterious wonderful flavors that linger hauntingly on the tongue and bring sublime moments of joy into a grey day (no pun intended). Steep it long enough so that all the flavor intensity is in your cup (or tea pot) Drink it straight, with no sugar -- OR-- sweeten it to bring out even more of its wonderful flavor -- AND for a special treat, add cream or milk or soy milk-- your Earl Grey will take on a "Chai presence"!!! Either way, Twinings Earl Grey is a tea to look forward to time and time again.<br /><br />Lady Grey was new to me, and yes it is a bit lighter and not as intense as the Earl himself, but Lady Grey is still very very good -- notably so.<br /><br />Irish Breakfast is a tea that may make you break out in song -- it is robust and delightful, clearing up "morning fog" in a hearty way.<br /><br />This is a very good variety pack, IMHO, to keep on hand at the office when having panel meetings or board meetings -- or just in the "break kitchen" for folks to enjoy when they are want a tea break!! Wonderful flavors and aromas like these can't but help to make people sit up and notice, and make a sometimes dull work-day (or...ahem...meeting) more enjoyable.

review/summary: NICE VARIETY AND A RELATIVE INEXPENSIVE WAY TO FIND OUT IF YOU LIKE FOUR VARIOUS BLENDS
review/text: When I write a review on teas I am always hesitant to either fully recommend any given tea, or conversely, to recommend that it not be touched with a ten foot pole and that it is not fit for human consumption.  The reason for this is taste.  We are all different in this area and what may be an absolute delight for me, may quite well be another's gastronomical bane. Finding the "just right tea;" the tea that is the beginning and the end for the lover of tea is an adventure and in my opinion, an adventure that should last a life time.  I started drinking tea (we are talking hot tea here) as a small child, as did my wife, and we have been together on our search for well over 50 years now.  I have to tell you that the trip has been wonderful!<br /><br />Now a person can sink a lot of money into their tea habit and hobby over the years.  Nothing is worse (well, I suppose many things are indeed worse...I just use this as an expression) than to spend a King's Ransom on a large amount of new tea(s) that you want to try and find that you find you cannot stand the stuff!  We have found in recent years a bit of a solution to this problem in these "variety packs" offered by many companies - Twinings being the leader in this marketing method.  We get to sample different varieties and blends, in this case four separate blends, without having to sell our first born into bondage to be able to afford it.  The other upside to this variety pack, as with many like packs, is that you get several tea bags of the same blend so that you have plenty to make your mind up with.  We never try just one cup or one brew as taste can change from day to day as well as moods; and trust me, when it comes to tea drinking, moods and attitude do count!<br /><br />With this variety pack you get a nice sampling of English breakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey and Irish breakfast teas to sample.  All of these teas are of the black variety; all are different and all have a nice full-bodied presents which is ideal if dark full-bodied teas are "your thing."<br /><br />Even this pack though will show the difference in taste.  I am fond of the English breakfast tea (My favorite if this selection), where as my wife favors the Lady Grey.<br /><br />This is a good selection to simply get to know four nice blends.  If you brew it correctly, use good quality water and let yourself relax and be as objective as possible, I should think you will be pretty happy with it...or maybe not.  I personally liked it.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: Great pack of dark teas
review/text: If I had to point out a flaw in this variety pack, it would be that there's no light flavor (i.e. green tea) to round out the mix. Short of that, I can't imagine anything I'd complain about with this mix.<br /><br />English Breakfast: Strong, dark, and goes well with a dash of milk if that's your thing. A solid way to wake up, any day.<br /><br />Irish Breakfast: It's hard to say this blend tastes lighter than the English, but it makes you feel lighter. Great with a full Irish breakfast, the Irish blend really makes you happy to meet the day.<br /><br />Earl Grey: Twinings brand actually bears the seal of the (or, an) Earl of Grey, and it is probably the best Earl you can get from a bag. Great for any occasion, especially for Star Trek nerds like me who can't help but chuckle and mumble "Earl Grey- hot" with every mug.<br /><br />Lady Grey: A remarkable inclusion, Lady Grey is based on the Earl flavor. Whereas the Earl tastes of deep orange, the Lady has a very light dash of lemon. Lady Grey is an excellent and complex treat, good for relaxing or just plain enjoying your tea. Lady Grey is light and aromatic, without being a gimmick tea like so many other brands are willing to push. This is a serious tea, and yet it still has a sense of fun.<br /><br />This mix has it all. You've got your strong standby flavors that are great in the morning (English and Irish), you've got a great anytime flavor (the Earl), and a superb treat flavor (the Lady). Short of making the jump to looseleaf tea, you just can't find better flavors than this.

review/summary: A collection for those who enjoy black teas.
review/text: I enjoy black tea blends over any other. I don't drink coffee, so black teas takes the place of it. Many variety packs have a selection of herbals, blacks and green teas. Thankfully Twinings offers us this variety pack of wonderful black teas.<br /><br />The Teas:<br /><br />Irish Breakfast:<br />I love this blend. I have always been a fan of Irish Breakfast. If your new to the tea, don't let the name and green packaging give you the impression there's anything minty about it. It's a straight black tea (typically 100% Assam teas). No sweetness or flavoring of any kind. This is typically taken with sweetener or has milk added to it to taste (like straight black coffee). I personally enjoy it without anything added, and drink it black. Because of it's caffeine content, I prefer drinking Irish Breakfast in the mornings. It also goes great with meals since there are no strong flavors/aromas to overpower the taste of ones food.<br /><br />English Breakfast:<br />Much like the Irish Breakfast tea, it is also a blend of black teas without flavors added. However, there are usually several black teas blended together (most common Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan) to produce the flavor of English Breakfast. The information of the exact leaves blended is not offered as information from Twinings, saying only that it is a blend of black teas, but those are the usually ones. While not as bold as the Irish Breakfast, it is still a strong tea that is typically accompanied by milk or sugar.<br /><br />Lady Grey:<br />A milder version of Earl grey, very subtle citrus flavors have been added to this blend. By no means is this a fruity tea, as it is just a tiny hint of flavor. Not nearly as aromatic as the Earl Grey blend, this Lady Grey has a much more delicate taste.<br /><br />Earl Grey:<br />Bold, aromatic and memorable. Most tea drinkers can pick out a cup of Earl Grey no matter the brand, and Twinings blend is no different. An unmistakable presence of Bergamot can be found, but is not so strong to be off-putting. Fans of Earl Grey will find this a medium strength blend, just enough to know what your drinking, but not the strongest on the market. A nice tea for afternoons and evenings.

review/summary: Actually the tea was two 5 Star, one 4 Star and one 1 Star
review/text: Let me preface this with a brief history of my tea addiction:  Until I was approximately 40ish I thought all tea came with ice and enough sugar to make it into the infamous "brown kool-aid".  Since I only drank tea at restaurants and my Mom's at obligatory dinners, no big deal.  Well as I slipped towards 50 I began to drink more coffee (which I liked) but which eventually led to a parting of ways due to the fact that the coffees I liked, did not return the favor and feeling slightly nauseous was not the desired effect I was looking to achieve.  One day a friend of mine suggested I try some quality tea (which meant nothing made by Tetley/Liptons/etc).  I tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DBN2F">Tazo Passion Tea, 24 Tea Bags</a> and while good it was missing that elusive element combination of good taste and adequate energy boost.  So I stumbled into this item <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FY">Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> which gave me 4 choices (great idea).  So without any additional ramblings are my opinions:  English Breakfast Tea = 5 Star, this stuff is great  /  Irish Breakfast Tea = Again 5 Stars, maybe a infinitesimal edge over the English version / Earl Grey = 4 Stars, good taste and flavor, not as good as the breakfast teas (IMHO) but probably better for later in the evening  / Lady Grey = WTF??  This stuff was horrible, I tried to use 1 bag of it with 2 bags of the others to keep from pitching it into the trash but to no avail, I am gonna give it to someone who has no taste buds.  1 Star.<br /><br />Again, realize I am far from a connoisseur of fine tea but I know what I like and what I don't, I am going to buy a few boxes of the breakfast teas and enjoy them.  BTW I also bought a huge box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEV9YE">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 160-Count Tea Bags</a> and to prove my tastes are obviously out of the norm I hated it (I wanted to love it but alas it has something added to it that sure ain't tea)

review/text: This was bought to be used in our wedding and we couldn't be happier. We have a ton of tea left over and we have been enjoying it. The flavor is good and doesn't taste as though it has been sitting in the boxes for a long time. Twinings is a great company and we have often had their tea in the past and we will probably continue to get it in the future. The box of 6 is a great way to get the bulk you need without paying a ton.

review/summary: Royal fireworks indeed
review/text: Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) at $17.14 is a STEAL.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Twinings tea, then perhaps you ought to start tasting REAL tea - the type the Royal Family awakens to, the type everyone who enjoys tea outside the U.S. enjoys at tea time.<br /><br />Twinings, around since the beginning of the 18th century, literally saved my life. While I shall not go into that story, I will tell you what you can expect: a decent, dazzling cup of tea that will, I guarantee, make you basically drop coffee forever.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the meal known as 'tea' since I was a boy. My parents avoided it for some reason but I always had my Twinings. Since it got too complex hereabouts, I just order tea bags these days instead of a good old-fashioned brew-up with my favorite antique English teapot.<br /><br />It appears that in this variety pack you are getting the following: English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Earl Grey and Lady Grey. For you ignorant slobs, Irish breakfast is the finest, blackest and strongest tea you can get. English is a bit dialed back but it is just as hearty. These beg for cream and sugar, but it is no sin to have it black. The Greys are meant to be taken with lemon and you'll suffer if you try to pour cream or milk into either of them!<br /><br />So there you are: a world of tea in one neat box, from my ONLY tea providers and lifelong at that. You can visit their site and buy direct; you can examine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006RXQ2CY">The Queen</a> closely and watch for the scene that reveals the Queen Mum's preferred tea.<br /><br />My second favorite, Irish breakfast tea being my first love, is the incomparable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MOWL8M">Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (20 Tea Bags)</a>, blended from premium Keemun and Ceylon (just you try to get good Keemun at a reasonable price).<br /><br />In the event it interests you, Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention, the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named "FLOW-THROUGH") that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Get Twinings good cheer, the genuine cup that cheers.

The other three are all classics, and I love them too!

review/summary: Great introduction to Twinings
review/text: This variety pack was my "nice to meet you" handshake with Twinings teas. It was about time that I tried the brand! I cannot in good conscience say anything about the English Breakfast or Irish Breakfast, as I'm not a big fan of black tea, let alone STRONG black tea as these. But I made a lovely discovery: the Lady Grey. I wrote a review about it saying how it quickly became my favorite comfort tea. As for the Earl Grey, it's passable when I'm out of Lady Grey, but only if I steep it for a few short seconds - otherwise it's too strong.<br /><br />Whatever is the case, here you have the chance to try 4 flavors and find your favorite. Being a 6-pack, you won't have too much of any one tea, which is a good thing.<br /><br />And now I definitely want to try more Twinings flavors.

This tea can be found locally, but costs much more than the Amazon price.  This is my second purchase of this item.

review/summary: Healthy and Tasty Chip for Snacking
review/text: My family loves these chips.  The company seems to care about offering healthy, all-natural offerings that use green energy and get the "we support American Rivers" stamp.  These chips are all natural, no trans fat, gluten free, no cholesterol, no msg, chips.  You can eat 15 for 120 calories and they provide 12% of daily fiber.  Sodium is low--only 5% of daily values.  Total fat is 11% of daily values.  There are healthier chips on the market with more fiber or vegetable nutrition, but this one is pretty good.<br /><br />These are light and crispy and have a cheddary-spicy-salty taste. Their shape is hexagonal--6 sided.  They're cute chips. They are a good basic chip that is fairly healthy made by a company who appears to care about health and the environment in manufacturing.<br /><br />This company offers an array of chips--would like to sample some of the other flavors as I'd like this texture in other flavors.  This is a tasty chip to serve at a party or family picnic.

After drinking a six pack of this stuff over the course of a week i went back to try zevia again and found that zevia was mild and tasteless by comparison.  The blue sky has a really strong flavor and even burns the inside of my nose a little bit...  but for me that's a good thing.  I like more powerful tasting drinks.<br /><br />Very good stuff,  i will continue to buy Blue Sky.

review/text: I LOVE the taste of ginger in any form, and have never before had an adverse reaction to a non-sugared sweetener. That said, this is the worst tasting ginger ale known to humankind.<br />There is no ginger taste whatsoever. The only taste, initially, is that of smoked meat -- similar to that of bacon. To add insult to injury, a split second later, an overpowering bitterness invades one's mouth, tongue, and any other digestive body part that comes in contact with this vile concoction.

review/summary: Used to be better, but still quite good
review/text: I'm a freak for ginger, so when I got my first case of this stuff and felt that awesome gingery bite, I was in love. I went through a couple more cases of it and continued to love every sip -- occasionally poured over some decent bourbon.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that the product had recently gotten less gingery, and I am dismayed to confirm this report. The most recent case I received (August 2011) is substantially less spicy.<br /><br />I still like it enough to give it 4 stars. It's still more gingery than your standard ginger ale (or Zevia ginger ale, which is quite bland by comparison,) but for a ginger lover like me it's a disappointment. If I had never tasted the more gingery version, I'd probably tell you this is damn fine ginger ale, but the "Jamaican Ginger Ale" moniker is now a bit overblown.<br /><br />Hopefully they just made a weak batch and the next case will be back to gently burning the mouths and tummies of thirsty travelers worldwide.

review/summary: Best. Ginger Ale. Ever.
review/text: Boy howdy, is this stuff good or what! Let me tell y'all this is easily the best ginger ale available on the market, bar none. Sure, you get the benefits of having zero sugar and zero artificial sweetners, thanks to stevia. But the taste is where it's at: this product strikes exactly the right balance between packing a punch of ginger taste to avoid the bland, stale flavor all too common in ginger ale and yet stops short of being the too-strong attack commonly found in batch brewed ginger beers.<br /><br />You're gonna love it. It has a crisp, definitive ginger taste without being overpowering. The sweetness level is just right, but without any of the bad stuff. Delicious!

review/summary: Good Ginger flavor and uses stevia for sweetener, good stuff!
review/text: I purchased a 6 pack of this Ginger Ale at the local QFC grocery store (it's pretty expensive) to see if I would like it before I went and bought a 24-pack from Amazon.  I really like strong ginger ale's and while this isn't as strong as I'd like, it's definitely good... if you like ginger.<br /><br />It's also better if you poor it into a glass so your full senses take part in enjoying this ale, similar to drinking a good beer.  You will notice a difference.<br /><br />The price on Amazon is great, if you're not sure go pick up a 6-pack from your local store if they carry it and see if you like, that's what I did.

review/summary: Disgusting!!
review/text: I've been drinking ginger beers/ginger ales all of my life (I'm in my sixties) and have never tasted anything as bad as this. It tastes like water that has had pepper added to it, with very little real taste of ginger. Indeed the can lists pimenta as an ingredient! Also the drink leaves an extremely unpleasent after taste of sweetner. I find this drink to be absolutely disgusting and would advise anyone to not waste their money on it.

review/summary: not good in the summer
review/text: We LOVED this product until shipments starting arriving in June--in Texas.  The taste is terrible!  No ginger taste left, not happy with the product at all any more.  Sad...loved it back in the winter and spring.  Guess it can't survive the heat in travel.

review/summary: WOW!!!
review/text: So, I really really wanted to like this stuff, and I tried to make it all the way through one can, but alas I lacked the strength of will. I love ginger ale, and Jamaican ginger ale in particular, but this flavor (and maybe we had a bad batch?) was a whole new, disgusting animal that took me quite a lot of time to pin down my feelings on. Firstly, I felt I was drinking water that had been poured into a glass that used to have Pepto Bismol in it, but had not been rinsed out first. Secondly, I thought maybe it tasted more like truvia had been simply mixed with water into a sickening solution. Third, it made me think that i now know what it would be like to drink generic birch beer after someone else had thrown it up. And, lastly, when i finally gave up, as if giving up on a bet, it just tasted like hostility and sadness.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and try a different flavor!<br /><br />One caveat- Usually, when a company screws up any kind of ginger ale, it is because they seem to make it taste soapy. Kudos to Blue Sky for finding a whole new way to make ginger ale so vile. It doesn't taste soapy at all!

review/summary: the truvia made our whole family ill
review/text: The flavor and quality cannot compare to Zevia Ginger Ale made with erythritol and stevia but not into a mega commercial commodity. I don't know all of what they must do to "process" Truvia into what it is since they don't have to disclose the process or the additives, but no comparison to just good erythritol and stevia. Wouldn't have thought it would make such a difference. We will never buy any of these sodas again. All of the Zevia sodas are good (although more expensive, they are worth it) and don't make everyone have serious intestinal pain.

review/summary: OMG
review/text: I'm trying to cut sugar out of my diet and more importantly, I'm getting rid of Aspartame.  That stuff is a neurotoxin and I'm suffering from some of the long-term health effects of that poison.  I had high hopes for beverages using the new Stevia extract and tried the Other brand with the Stevia ingredient.  The other brand is a little pricey, so I thought I would try this one too. The other brand, outside of the price was a very pleasant experience.  Keeping in mind that this is the only flavor I tried of this brand,  I can't comment on the Blue Sky brand as a whole, but in this one instance, I have to say it sucks.  The initial taste in unpalatable and the after-taste is even worse.  I tried six cans over the course of a week (hoping my taste would acclimate)  and ended up pouring the rest down the drain.  It doesn't taste like a beverage.  I'm not sure what the taste reminds me of, but I definitely cant drink it.  Sorry for the harsh review, but this stuff is awful.

review/summary: Starts My Every Morning!
review/text: I have enjoyed a cup of tea, preferably green tea, for breakfast in the morning for over 50 years, and I'm here to say this is the very best of all. I never used to like bothering with loose tea but this is very manageable as it is rolled young tea leaves. It's actually fun to handle! You can make it as strong as you like it. For a green tea it is very robust, I'd call it the Irish breakfast of green tea. I'm totally spoiled for other green teas now and am very happy to be able to buy the multi packs. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: The "Green Pearl" of Tea.
review/text: Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the "green pearl" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself "home of silk and tea" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name "gunpowder" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.

review/summary: Good Tea and a good buy
review/text: I was a little hesitent to make a big order for so much tea, not knowing if I would like it.  So I went to a local supermarket and bought a tin there so I might give it a taste test.  This is quite a good green tea.  Other than buying generic green teabags, I usually buy a Bancha tea. This tea is not as grassy, more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it.<br /><br />The cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh.  The only thing to be aware is that this is a lot of tea, altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters. Unless you really love this tea, plan on making some gifts.

review/summary: Best Gunpowder available for the $$
review/text: This is the best Gunpowder tea you will buy for the $$. It's perfect for everyday green tea drinking. The tins are individually foil sealed so you can take your time getting through the lot, or share with friends and family. I usually take a tin to work and keep one at home. Some specialty grocery stores in Dallas carry the loose teas, but out in the suburbs, Amazon makes it easy and convenient. I priced this out one time and it's $$/oz is incredible bargain, the same tin at specialty grocers (Whole Foods, Central Market, World Market) is like $6-$8. Unless you have an Asian market with a bulk tea section close to you, probably not going to get more affordable.<br /><br />---Preperation<br />Use filtered water if you can, I get it from my Fridge since it has filter on the water in the door.<br /><br />~165-170 degress F (I stick a probe digital thermometer into the whistle hole on my stove-top kettle and set the alarm to go off at 165F, gives me time to get from the living room back to the kitchen without it getting too hot. I have the tea portioned and waiting for the water in my teapot, 6 tsp)<br /><br />~3-3:30 minutes steep time (covered)<br /><br />Do not boil or steep longer than 3:30 or it will become overpowering and bitter. If you like it stronger, add more tea.<br /><br />I alternate with the Twining's Prince of Wales loose (~195-200F, 4min steep time), it has become my favorite black tea.<br /><br />No cream or suger needed if you brew it correctly. The green tea can be reused for another brew, I typically add a tsp or two to the already brewed leaves and good to go.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I68NCS">Finum Brewing Medium Basket, Black</a> is a perfect partner for your mug/pot at work. I just use the hot water tap on our coffee machine over the leaves in the basket, 3 minutes later you have perfect green tea at work with easy clean-up.<br /><br />Enjoy this tea!

review/summary: Good green tea
review/text: This is a basic, good green tea.  I use enough for a 4-cup batch, but use only water for 1-cup.  In this way, I can drink a condensed form of it at my work desk all day long.  This keeps me from sneaking into the coffee room and getting my caffeine only from coffee sources.  Not that this is bad (my company gets the best coffee in the world), but all too often there are high-calorie or high-salt snacks lurking in the coffee room, just waiting for you to bounce in there!  Yikes!!  And you always fall for it:  I don't care who you are or how steeled your thoughts are against taking any "free" coffee-room snacks.<br /><br />Getting back to the tea.  This gunpowder green tea tastes great and it is entertaining too.  The "gunpowder" is rolled up little balls of tea leaves, and if you make this in clear glass you can watch them unroll (explode, like gunpowder).  This isn't the highest quality, but the price is right and it tastes good.  Perfect for your average normal day.  For that, I give it 5 stars.
