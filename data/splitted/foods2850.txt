review/summary: Wakes you up, maybe a bit too much
review/text: I drink a strong black cup most mornings, thought I'd give Jet Fuel a try.  One thing is this is a strong cup of coffee.  It may be too much for me since I drink it black.  The first thing I noticed when I pulled one of the K cups off the brewer is that there wasn't an aroma like I was used to with other K cups, which translated to little smell in the cup.  The flavor is strong and bitter, like I say it wakes you up.  Not one to sit and enjoy in my mind.  I prefer the other bold coffees available in K cups to this one.  They at least have an aroma and taste of coffe vs. this one that has bitterness to offer.

review/text: Good, strong cup of coffee.  I agree, it seems to have a lot of caffeine.  But the flavor is nice and bitter, the color is dark, the packaging convenient, and the price is right.  Nothing wrong with trying it if you like strong coffee.

review/summary: Jet Fuel K-Cups, just OK
review/text: I have found the quality control of my recent purchases of K-Cups to be marginal, at best.  I look for cups whose foil covers bulge at the top.  Unfortunately, many of the cups seem to have their seals breached, and the cover is flat and sometimes concave.  The performance of these cups is often terrible, with grounds escaping both within the coffee maker and into the cup of coffee and coffee even spilling out of the maker beyond the bounds of the rim of the cup.  Worse yet, the taste of the coffee is lifeless and insipid.  In a word, it is stale.  When the packaging seems intact the coffee tastes fine, and there is no mess or clean up necessary.  I'll keep searching for a more reliable provider.

review/text: Jet Fuel is an extremely bitter blend. I normally drink my coffee with a little bit of milk and a teaspoon of sugar. In order to even choke this down I would probably need a half cup of sugar. Ridiculous.

review/text: This is one of our very favorite K Cup selections -- bold and deep flavor.  It HAS been a staple in our household, but no longer.  I'm not sure what Amazon's reasoning is for the huge and sudden price hike.  I read that they claimed it's an increased price from the manufacturer, but all other retailers that I count on for K Cups have kept the same price, so that seems like an excuse.  At $27 a 50-ct. case, I can walk into any number of retailers with a basic sale or easily accessible coupon and get a MUCH better deal.  Sorry Amazon!  I love you, but I won't be buying any more K Cups from you unless you bring back the reasonable pricing.

review/text: I love a good cup of strong coffee, but this has way too much of a bite for me.  Even my husband, who does like it a little bolder than I do, thought the same.  If you are looking for a smooth, full bodied coffee, this is NOT it.  If, on the other hand, you want something that is bound to curl your toes in an attempt to wake you up, this will do it.  Not what I look for in coffee though.  I like to be awakened with ease, not a jolt.

review/summary: Passable, but muddy
review/text: NOTE: This is a review of this coffee in the K-cup format, not of Amazon's packaging.  However, I have never had trouble with the Frustration-free packaging; I simply cannot comment in this case.<br /><br />Reviewer's preferences: Strong, medium-dark roast coffees, mid-to-heavily sweetened with whole milk (4:1 ratio or a little heavier toward the coffee side).  I occasionally add a hint of vanilla syrup and cream or half-and-half if a coffee is overly bitter.<br /><br />I picked up this coffee in a large sampler box of Coffee People "Extra Bold" K-cups, which I have just finished off.  The collection contained the following blends/coffees: Wake-up Call, Jet Fuel, Black Tiger, and Organic.  I have had each coffee multiple times.  From the four, I give the Organic blend the top spot with a slight edge over Black Tiger (we're talking 9.1/10 over 9.0/10 here).  Both the Black Tiger and Organic were strong and bold in flavor but not too bitter, while the Wake-up Call tended to be a little more harsh on the palate.  The Jet Fuel blend was appropriately named, as it almost always required a little vanilla and more milk or even heavy cream to make it palatable.<br /><br />Qualities of Coffee People Jet Fuel:<br />Dark, almost burned coffee flavor (think bad Sumatran roast).  Heavy bitterness that overwhelms the flavor, harsh on the back of the tongue and a fully bitter aftertaste, but probably drinkable if you are a fan of Sumatran or French Roast coffees.  Medium acidity, a little tangy but not really sour, with an earthy flavor that tends toward muddy.  Flavor envelops the entire mouth, but generally overwhelms the palate.  Heavy body, but not sludgy, though your mouth may be convinced otherwise from the flavor.  While I can and sometimes do drink other coffees black (mostly full-bodied medium roasts), I can't imagine anyone drinking this black even if they take their espresso that way.  Requires sweetener and cream/half-and-half or a heavy addition of milk.  Personally, I had to use a small splash of vanilla syrup to hide the bitterness.  Drinkable, but just barely with better choices available. Hard to find the good qualities in the disappointing profile.  Certainly not the WORST dark roast I have had, however.<br /><br />I give this 2 stars for one reason.  If you were using this coffee as an ingredient where you wanted the coffee and perhaps the bitterness to not be hidden too much, then this would be an excellent choice over many harsh Sumatran and French Roast coffees.

review/summary: Coffee taste alright
review/text: This is my first shipment for this coffee.  I'm on a subscription basis.  Each K-Cup is flushed with nitrogen and then sealed in an air-tight, moisture-tight cup.  This lid is adhered to the top of the cartridge as soon as it is filled with fresh coffee or tea grounds, and the K-Cup remains air-tight and moisture-free until the needle of your Keurig brewer punctures the foil.  However in this shipment 35 of the 50 k-cups were deflated and lost there seal.  Not sure how fresh this coffee is since the seal was broken prior to shipment.  If the next shipment returns the same result I'll go back to paying more for a fresher product.

review/summary: Love Coffee People, but Not Jet Fuel
review/text: Let me begin by saying I am a huge Coffee People fan.  My wife is from Oregon and anytime we visited her family my first priority was visiting one of their shops.  I was deeply disappointed to see their stores absorbed by Starbuck's (nothing against Starbuck's, they make a good cup of coffee and are a very responsible company).  Having tried Jet Fuel, I find it tastes like it sounds, with a bitter and chemical finish.  I'm no connoisseur, but I know what I like, generally bold coffees, and this may be bold, but also harsh with an unpleasant finish.  I'd recommend passing on this one and explore their other excellent coffees.

review/text: I'd like to give the manuafacturers the benefit of the doubt, but this stuff is hard to swallow (no pun intended).  I love strong coffee, from the Sumatras to the other dark roasts.  That's why I purchased the Jet Fuel.  I also purchased the Kona coffee from the same coffee co. - that is a great roast and I would recommend to anyone.  But this coffee actually has the aroma of old cigarettes...not too appetizing.  I could have just received a bad batch and I'll look to return what I have left (I did give it a few tries).

I hate to say this but neither of these brews are stronger than any other "extra bold" brews I have tried. If you get this just know that you still need to use a smaller amount of water to make a strong cup of bold tasting coffee. I think the new Starbucks bold brews actually make a stronger cup of coffee.

review/text: I purchased this coffee for my office machine and immediately started getting complaints. When I tried it my self I thought it was some of the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It is tolerable when loaded up with sweetener, however. It tastes like jet fuel mixed with mud.

review/summary: Rich and strong but not bitter!
review/text: I was a bit apprehensive about buying this after seriously disliking the "wake up call" variety, but I'm quite glad I decided to try it.  It's a bit stronger than the "donut shop" variety, but is very similar in flavor.  Very dark and rich with very little acid.  I'd suggest this to anyone that loves a good strong cup of mud, but dislikes bitter over-roasted coffee.

review/text: I have tried a LOT of different coffees for my Keurig machine, and to me, this is the absolute best "get up and go" coffee for breakfast time.  The aroma alone is enough to wake and entice, and from the first sip, my taste buds are happy.  This has become my "cvoffee of choice" to start my day.  I am now on my fifth box, and will be ordering more when this starts to run low.  And thanks to Amazon Prime, I never have to worry about shipping delays making me run out and having to start my day with something more "ordinary".

review/text: I've only had my Keurig since March and have been ordering and consuming coffees which are labeled 'extra bold'. I first ordered Green Mountain Double Diamond which I thought was great. I then ordered Starbucks Sumatra which was also good but seemingly inconsistent with regard to taste (strange). I received Jet Fuel today. I thought it was going to be hard to top the Double Diamond but Coffee People have done did it! This stuff is FANTASTIC!! I will definitely be ordering this again and again.

review/summary: Harsh flavor, and yet still  not strong coffee by my standards
review/text: I went out on a limb and purchased this 50 pack of Jet Fuel because of so many good reviews.  Let me start by saying, I like STRONG coffee.  Espresso is fine with me, and when I make my own coffee I make it as strong as can be.  If all I have is instant I  at least quadruple the amount of coffee to water.  In other words, I like a strong coffee, and Jet Fuel by my standards is strong in flavor only.  Okay strong isn't the best word; HARSH would be a better word.  It's not a pleasurable drinking experience.<br /><br />I took some to work to let a coworker try it, and I think he nailed the aroma and flavor of this Jet Fuel coffee.  He said it's like a dirty ashtray.  After he said that it clicked in my mind.  Dang, yes that is what it tastes like.  Now, I will give the benefit of the doubt that I got a bad batch, but so far since I was a sucker and bought 50 of them, I keep drinking them usually adding instant coffee, or another nicer flavored coffee to it to kill the ashtray flavor because all of them taste the same so far.<br /><br />Be warned, I'm no stranger to harsh coffee, but this IMHO is not a pleasant harsh.<br /><br />J

review/text: I put a sign up at my workplace that reads, "There is no strong coffee, only weak men." Alright, I'll admit that there are some coffees that are stronger than others, but not very many that are stronger than Jet Fuel. And, this is actually my wife's favorite brew, so no more excuses girly men! This has a very dark, strong flavor with just the right amount of bitterness to round out the flavor. However as mentioned in the title, it's for adults. We drink this as our every day coffee, but also keep some more milder flavors for guests and "weak men".

review/text: Got Jet Fuel because I thought it would be a funny drink to have in the cupboard while going through Air Force Undergraduate Pilot Training.  Turns out this is pretty darn good coffee, strong enough where I can brew it in a large cup add a little milk or creamer to cool it down, add a little more cold water if I need to pound it before I get out the door, and it still tastes great.  I'm no coffee snob, but I know what I like, and I'd definitely recommend this to a friend.<br /><br />Kept me alert enough to get through pilot training, and will definitely keep on having it to stay alert and keep the skies safe.

review/summary: I had to change my review.  No longer a good coffee (in my opinion)
review/text: Update to my review:  August 2012:  It appears they have changed the formula for this coffee.  It now tastes very thin to me.<br /><br />It used to have a good film of oil on the top after brewing (I don't know what that oil slick is called - but I see it on all the good coffee I drink).<br /><br />Anyway, oil spill is not there any more...<br /><br />Nor is the taste...<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------<br /><br />First Review...<br /><br />For my taste buds - this is it.  Rich and full - with no burnt taste.  'Hint' of sweet finish - i.e. not bitter.<br /><br />Hard to believe this is pod coffee.<br /><br />Five stars!<br /><br />------<br /><br />About my tastes...<br /><br />I have been drinking K-Cups for two years and tried about 2 dozen types of coffee.  Most recently, Timothy's Espresso, which I found it to be thin - and almost undrinkable (after my experience with Jet Fuel).<br /><br />I just order Black Tiger - but not in yet - so no comparison.<br /><br />Also, I often drink Newman's (my wife picks up at Sam's Club).  I thought that was pretty good until the Jet Fuel.  Newman's is fairly rich - but has a slightly over-roasted taste for me... again,compared to the Jet Fuel.

It is so smooth and flavorful, but without the bitterness that some bold coffees exhibit.  Coffee People has done a great job of formulating a coffee which will "kick-start" you in the morning, but I must confess that even if Jet Fuel was de-caf, I'd still drink it just for the exquisite flavor!

review/summary: The best K-cup so far!
review/text: We bought a Keurig for Christmas and have gone through the 80 cups that came with the machine along with well over a dozen cases of other flavors that have been 'highly recommended'.  Jet Fuel has been our favorite thus far.  In fact, we've reordered it twice already.<br /><br />That said, we prefer strong coffee.  Jet Fuel tastes perfect no matter which size you make.  There is NO bitterness or aftertaste that you find in some of the other k-cups.  I'm picky, I'd be the first to complain!<br /><br />If you like strong coffee, try Jet Fuel.  Other flavors that have been superior are: Green Mtn. Espresso (hubby alternates between these two), Emeril's Big Easy Bold, Revv, Timothy's Parisian Nights, and Paul Neumann's Organic EB.<br /><br />Donut House and Timothy's Midnight Magic were EB's that were highly rated, but I found them to have bitter/weird after tastes.  I have not enjoyed the flavored coffees at all.  GLoria Jean's Butter Toffee was particularly dissappointing.<br /><br />If I had to buy only one flavor of k-cup, Jet Fuel would be it.

review/summary: Jet fuel
review/text: I like home made espresso, starbucks bold drip coffee and bold coffee that's not bitter. Jet fuel is bold, but not strong as home made over the gas range espresso or starbuck's bold drip. It is much smoother than black tiger though, and the strength is similar to black tiger. If you drink black tiger after jet fuel, you will definitely notice Black tiger's bitterness. When I use one jet fuel with 4oz water serving choice,  it gets pretty close to starbuck's.<br /><br />Before buying from amazon, I used to buy emeril's big easy, but jet fuel is stronger, and through coffee people and amazon's club, this is the cheapest way to purchase coffee for keurig machines. Cheaper than Costco or sams club.

review/summary: Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]
review/text: ASIN B0029XLH4Y - All right, I'm going to start by saying something negative about the Keurig coffee makers, which I will later explain better in my review of IT. Here goes: this coffee maker makes the weakest dang coffee in the history of the free world. You get a choice when brewing: itty bitty cup of semi-strong brew or sort-of-big cup of brown caffeinated water. This displeases me. I bought the thing because I love coffee and would like to mainline it but cannot. Now, I've learned to live with and even get around some of the deficiencies of the maker, but finding the coffee that makes the maker look good... tough job, but someone's got to do it.<br /><br />Jet Fuel is fantastic. It makes Keurig look like the geniuses they ought to be. This stuff is strong enough to overcome the wimpy options of the maker and then some. It's not bitter, but it might taste bitter to folks who aren't hardcore coffee drinkers. To me, that "bitter" taste is sharp, crisp and maybe a little chocolate-like. This is the stuff to wake up to, the perfect morning jolt.<br /><br />If there's a true negative for me, it's the individual cup issue, from the ecological point of view. You get a plastic cup with a foil lid and, inside, a small paper filter filled with grounds. It is, generally, thrown away as one piece. This means that the (unnumbered) cups, which may be recyclable, cannot be put with the plastics; the foil cannot be put with the rest of the foil; the biodegradable filter and grounds not only don't go into the composter, but they'll biodegrade very slowly, deprived of air, sun and water in their little foil and plastic casing. It's possible to take the thing apart and deal with the individual pieces appropriately, but that defeats the convenience factor of the maker. Someone's got to design a better k-cup, but I can't take points away from Jet Fuel for a flaw that all k-cups share.  On the up side of the packaging, Amazon's packaging is awesome - not just frustration free, but 100% recyclable!<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

review/summary: the best coffee..the best deal
review/text: I like strong black coffee. I like it to taste strong, have body, & wake me up. The way to make strong coffee is use more grounds per water, but that doesn't guarantee it tastes good . "Jet Fuel" tastes good & wakes me up. It seems at least a time-&-a-half stronger than most other coffees, is full-bodied, &  is consistently, equally great cup after cup: I've had a hundred of them so far. It's my favorite. I bought 50 cups on sale for $20, but the regular price at the time was only $21! Since you'll probably only need one cup in the morning, it's a great deal. Also: It arrived less than 48 hours after the order was put in

review/summary: Best soft pepppermint to date!!
review/text: I've been a soft peppermint fan for years. I couldn't find my ususal peppermint choice and someone told me to try Red Bird. I can't thank them enough. This is by far superior to any other soft peppermint I've tried. The bulk packaging and individual wrapping (with its colorful red birds and USA flag on each wrapper) is top QUALITY. The candy is almost suspended inside the wrapper. When eating, the candy starts to disolve rapidly, then slows somewhat for the lingering peppermint effect. This candy also seems to have more peppermint flavor than other soft peppermints. My praise and thanks go to the Piedmont Candy Company in Lexington, NC for a job still well done.(Made in the USA since 1890)

These Red Bird "Peppermint Puffs" are super light, soft and sugary chunks of melt-in-your-mouth minty goodness. When I worked where I had my own desk, I always kept an old-fashioned apothecary jar of peppermint puffs on my desktop. They disappeared almost as fast as I could fill the jar. Simply terrific!

review/summary: No peppermint flavor
review/text: I wanted something to put in my hot chocolate to make it pepperminty and most candies seem to have lost much peppermint flavor. I saw this and read that they are available at Walgreens, so I went over and picked up a bucket. They are light, fluffy, airy, sugary, but not pepperminty. Great texture, no flavor. I put one in my hot chocolate and there wasn't even a hint of mint. Disappointed. Sadly the Bob's brand is worse. They're hard and don't have any of that light airy texture they are supposed to have. I'm going to order some from Williams Sonoma. They get great reviews.

It is very sweet, with tastes of cinnamon and sugar, but a Cinnabon? No. Personally I think it's a bit too sweet as well. And the first bite I had, had a weird flavor to it. Not sure I'm loving this one.

I order several different flavors to give them some variety. I will also say that when I adopted my fatty 21 pounder, i tried for years to get him to lose weight. Recently the vet told me he lost 5 pounds! (that's like 50 pounds in humans) and I will honestly say the pounds didn't come off until I started feeding him this stuff. I gave him high quality dry food, pure tuna (pet food) from TJs and nothing worked. until this.<br />And the price is right! I'm hooked.
