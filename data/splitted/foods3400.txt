review/summary: Delicious for Shoyu Tamago
review/text: Made Shoyu Tamago for the first time using this product.  Shoyu Tamago is a hard boiled egg that is peeled then rolled in gently simmering tamari so that the egg white absorbs it.  It is a beautiful presentation when sliced and the flavor of the tamari is much richer than "regular soy sauce".  However, the sodium taste is also more intense and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

review/text: The Banana Split Taffy candy was delicious and full of that old time banana flavor. It was very sticky though. It hand started to melt. I had to put it in the refrigerator to get cold, before I could get it out of the paper without being a gooey mess. I guess you shouldn't order taffy though the mail when it is hot outside.

review/summary: Zinpro saved Kiko's life
review/text: My beautiful little cocker spaniel, Kiko, had a terrible skin condition called seboria.  He secreated a thick oil that made him and everywhere he went smell awfull.  His hair fell out by handfulls, and he was covered with scabs.  His underside developed a black mold that wouldn't wash off.  None of the vets ideas worked.  I tried everything.  I kept him on dog food for dogs with alergies which helped a little.  I bathed him twice a week with a strong shampoo but before he was even dry he would be stinking again.  He made our whole house stink.  His skin was red and swollen and his feet were so sore we called him tripod.  We were considering having him put down. But he's such a sweet, good dog, I kept looking on line and reading blogs.  I finally found Zinpro Biscuits and now after a year on them he's like a normal dog.  He's so beautiful. He has a long, extremely full coat, and I can bath him once a month.  Only the good part of seboria has stayed with him, the fleas don't like him.

By definition, Madras is hot so you have a few options: deal with the heat, use coconut milk or yogurt to mellow it out.<br /><br />This curry in combination with a pressure cooker = Dinner in 20 minutes.  Personally, I like boneless skinless chicken thighs.  For vegetables, I use an onion, a potatoe, some carrots and occasionaly a tomato.  When I feel like splurging a little, I use boneless lamb or bone-in goat.<br /><br />On the econimcal scale, this product is very cost effective.  On the I'm lazy scale, this product makes meal preparation a breeze.  Like I said: Use a pressure cooker.

review/text: Although these delicious delicacies can stand on their own merit, they have a know reputation.  Everyone remembers the red stapler from "Offices Space" (1999). But only a connoisseur would associate gummy bears with "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986). While Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) was making his principal getaway on a school bus, a young lady offered him a gummy bear. It was warm and chewy as she kept them in her pocket.<br /><br />You do not need to keep these animals in your pocket to enjoy them. Just be aware that they may not blend well with temporary fillings. You can just suck on them in that case.

I'm so glad I found these after trying so many different bars, goos, and other nut butters.  The taste is great and is so much healthier than alot of the other alternatives.

Further, my kids love the taste as well so I now can feel good about them enjoying a healthy snack anywhere we go and at school.  This is truly the perfect food and now in the perfect package to go with me and my kids everywhere we go.  If you havn't tried Barney Butter, I highly recommend.  And the prices on Amazon are better than the stores so its a great deal.  Enjoy.

It was very easy to open (there was a little notch, my 9 year old had no problem either) and it is the exact same smooth and creamy consistency that I love in the full size Barney Butter jars.  I am always looking for dense nutrition that my kids will actually eat.  They love Barney Butter and I am so grateful for such a high quality product.  I'll give my kids these packets for their lunch, on their way to soccer practice or if afternoon activities delay dinner.  That it is peanut free is great because some of my kids' friends have peanut allergies.  This is a great quality product.

review/summary: Excellent, exactly as expected, perfect taste & consistency
review/text: Because it's nutritious, I bought a total of 96 packets to add to breakfast bags for the homeless. I figure it is a form of quick energy that can be tucked into a pocket to consume later, and no worries about peanut allergies -- It's produced in a 100% peanut-free facility. I tried it myself to make sure the flavor was right. I'd never had almond butter before and it tastes somewhat similar to peanut butter (which I love) but a bit milder, as you might expect. Printed on the package are instructions to squeeze, mix and enjoy (or something to that effect). I had no problem with the ones I tried and would buy again. Very good with 100% whole wheat and sesame seed Ak-Mak crackers, also sold by Amazon.com. It easily squirted out of the packet onto crackers once opened.

review/summary: Poor quality and gritty, Expiration Date Unknown
review/text: We received our order form Amazon last week and it came in an unmarked box with 24 counts in it. There's no expiration date whatsoever imprinted inside or outside of the box, nor is it on the packets themselves. We don't know how long it has been sitting in the warehouse. Judging by the texture of the almond butter upon opening, it must have been quite a while. The texture is rather gritty, and very dry. It's almost hardened and cannot be squeezed out whatsoever. We tried to soften the spread by warming it in the boiling water with pouch intact but it had no effect. It was completely solid when we opened each pouch. You can't squeeze it out. It is VERY difficult to open each foil packet without scissors on hand. Very badly made inside out, in short.

review/summary: Tasty, but...
review/text: I bought these mostly as a portable snack for my kids.  This almond butter is really very tasty, probably my favorite almond butter, with a rich, toasty taste that we all love.  However, the oil and butter separate in the packet, and while I can mix them reasonably well by massaging the packet for a few seconds, my kids have trouble with it.  They have difficulty getting it worked well enough to really mix it, and so the oil drips out first when you open the packet, and then the hard lump of remaining butter is difficult to squeeze out.  So, even though this stuff is quite delicious, these packets aren't ideally suited to the situation I bought them for.  YMMV, of course.

How do you get the almond butter clump stuck in the bottom third of the packet?  It will not roll-up from the bottom and whose mouth is big enough to eat it using your teeth like eating an "artichoke" leaf?  The point is to be able to eat this on the run which you cannot do with this package unless you have your dissecting kit with you.  Someone needs to post a video on how to eat this.

review/text: I was worried after reading all the reviews that the almond butter would be hard, but it wasn't at all.  It was very smooth and creamy.  Maybe they changed the formula recently?  Either way, this was a very good, good tasting almond butter.  I like the serving size better than Justin's because it was more manageable.  The 200 calories in Justin's vs. the 90 here could be a little much, depending on how hungry you are, and since it's a single serving, you have to eat the whole thing.

review/summary: Portable, natural protein
review/text: Update, August 2012: They've improved both the packaging and the contents since my last review. I don't notice the "grittiness" much at all, nor does it taste over-toasted, as I'd mentioned in my prior review. The packaging has an updated design and all the packets have a proper tearing point. Definitely recommended! Bumping this from 4 to 5 stars.<br /><br />-------<br />These are higher protein, lower sugar, and cheaper than energy bars, and even more portable. They're a great way to stave off hunger, gluten-free. I keep one or two in my bag along with a Larabar or two, but this is the healthier & more economical option. The taste is a little "overcooked" to my taste - a deeply roasted flavor - so it may not appeal to all kids, but I'm sure many kids would like it. It's great to squeeze onto an apple as you eat it, or just eat it out of the packet.<br /><br />It does require some kneading before you open the packet - just squish it back and forth for a minute - because it separates like any natural nut butter would. There is a tiny bit of grittiness to the texture, but not really noticeable if you mix it up first. I'd rather have a little grittiness than a ton of shortening added to make it smooth.<br /><br />The other catch is not all the packets are notched properly, making them near impossible to open without scissors. There is a simple solution - I just take scissors and go through each new box, making a tiny nick on any packet where the cut doesn't go through both layers. It only takes a minute to do the whole box, and then they're all ready to go.

review/summary: Pre-portioned yummy-ness!
review/text: I initially began to buy these a few years ago when I was looking to improve my diet. I think I read about Barney Butter in some healthfood article. I love nut butters and immediately had to give this a try. The pack of 24 comes in a nice box that's easy to store in the pantry. Inside are 24 individual packets of Barney Butter Almond Butter. The packets look exactly as they do in the pictures here on Amazon - about 5x2 inches. Even though the description reads as "no-stir" (not here but on their webiste) I still squish the butter around in the unopened packet for about 30secs to a minute otherwise it comes out pretty runny at first and then dry at the end. When you mush it around for a little while, the butter comes out smooth as can be! I spread this butter on bananas, apples, celery, crackers, or just eat it on its own. My 10 year old LOVES it. He thinks it's cool that it comes in little packets and he can have almond butter anytime anywhere. He takes it as a snack to school as I do to work. I've also taken it on hiking trips. Totally convinient and yummy! LOVE IT!

review/summary: YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: I don't particularly care for almonds, but wanted to have more in my diet, since they are so healthy. A nutritionist told me that 2 T of almond butter would equal one serving of almonds. I had tried jarred almond butter several years ago and found it rather dry and tasteless. I ordered some Barney Butter online and the minute I tried it, it was love! It is creamy and delicious and well worth the cost. I eat it in my oatmeal, on bananas or banana bread, or on whole wheat toast almost every day. I usually buy jars of it, but the little packets are really nice for travel or to keep at work.

review/summary: Easy, handy, healthy.
review/text: I appreciate this product because it's easy to carry, full of good nutrition, and light on calories. These are great on the go. I use them when I'm out hiking, or at work with no time to eat, or just out power shopping. I have diabetes and these have a great protein-to-carb ratio and can be working into any "zone" type diets, or even progressive stages or Atkins. They taste good, they have just enough salt to keep the flavor from being bland.<br /><br />Tip: Almond butter naturally separates, so you need to mix this inside the tube before you open it. I often rip the top off and just squeeze the butter right into my mouth. If you eat it this way and you don't squish it up before you open it, you'll get a mouth full of almond oil. Which isn't the worst thing, but it's not very tasty... and, if not mixed, the rest of the butter will be dry and hard to get out of the tube. It's very easy to work it around with your fingers a few times before you open it. And, if you store them on their side, instead of standing up, it makes the "mixing" much easier.<br /><br />I have this stuff on auto order, which makes it really a bargain and and excellent price per tube. We go through a delivery about once every two-three months. This is a great product that I was glad to have found on amazon.

review/summary: Nice idea, terrible execution.
review/text: I bought a box of these snack packs to take with me when travelling.  My hope was that they would give me a nice protein boost once or twice during the day.  While they might have given me some protein, they also came with a huge side serving of aggravation -- and they don't taste very good to boot.<br /><br />First, the almond butter itself is simply not very good.  If, like me, you're used to almond butter from natural food stores, you're used to one ingredient -- almonds.  With Barney Butter, they load it up with extra oils and salt.  It tastes too sweet and too salty as a result.  This is like the McDonald's of almond butter.  Also, the separation problems cannot be easily overcome in a little packet like this.  With a jar, you just stir.  With a squeeze packet, you can try to keep kneading it and mixing it up before opening it, but the reality is, you're in for a huge blast of oil when you first open it, followed by a clay-like almond paste down below.<br /><br />Second, the packaging is straight-up awful.  It's made of reinforced plastic, so you basically need talons to rip it open.  Why they went with double-thick plastic for something you're supposed to tear is beyond me.  Then, once it's open, the oil separation problems described above make it hard to get the almond butter to keep pushing up.  You have to keep tearing it again or cutting it as you inch your way down the tube.  And if you try to use your teeth to drag the almond butter up to the opening, you're in for some unpleasant cuts in the corners of your mouth due to the wide size of the packet.  It's just an all-around mess.<br /><br />I would never buy a jar of Barney Butter due to the unnecessary extra ingredients and weird taste, and I would certainly never buy these snack packs again due to the ridiculous packaging.  In the future, I'll just go back to carrying a little jar of real almond butter with me when I travel.  At least I can open that.

review/summary: Good way to include fat in a low calorie diet
review/text: I've been on a weight loss diet since summer of 2011 and I've lost quite a bit of weight. One thing that helps is to include some source of fat. Avocados fit the bill most of the time, but sometimes I want something else. This is a great little snack pack for some extra energy when I need it, and it's fun to eat when I'm watching my favorite shows too.<br /><br />It's easy, just knead the package a bit to mix the oil into it, rip the top off and squeeze out the goodness.<br /><br />I can eat something delicious this way without breaking my calorie budget.

review/text: I love almond butter and I got excited when I found these packs of almond butter measured in single tablespoon servings.  Turns out I don't like this almond butter as much as any other brand I've tried. I think this has been made by dehydrating almond paste and reconstituting it with palm oil. I'd still like to find real, ground almond butter in a smaller size package.

review/summary: very convenient protein source
review/text: I'd hate to bring almond butter in a jar to backpack or long day hikes.  It's weighty and messy.  I was really happy to have found this product as oppose to bringing energy bars, which I hate.<br /><br />I eat it by squeezing on top of a piece of hard tack (hard cookie).  It is a fast and delicious source of energy (90 calories) and protein.<br /><br />Some people would eat junk filled with lots of calories during backpacking and long hikes, thinking that the activities justify the calorie intake.  I kind of disagree.  I'd rather eat cleaner fuel than say SPAM or Vienna sausages.  Good fuel in the body produces good output.  This little packet is it.

review/text: I'm on a restrictive diet and was shopping amazon for deals on almonds. I began to wonder what almond butter tasted like, and rather than whip the old Vita-mix out of the cupboard, I bought these individual packets, which are great to slip in a purse or hide at work in a file marked "Old Accounting Forms." I couldn't be more pleased with the taste - richer and deeper than I expected.  It's remarkable enough to think about telling my friends about while being reluctant to share any packets. I can't wait to try this brand in a spicy thai sauce.  This is a also great way to try this product without dropping the $30 on 3 jars without knowing if you like it.

review/text: I was looking for the "other" almond butter pouches, but the price of these caught my eye. I read most of the reviews and was apprehensive about ordering this product; however, it arrived fresh. I did not get a gritty batch, my Barney Butter Almond Butter pouches were perfectly smooth and creamy. However, they taste too much like peanut butter! There are no peanuts in the product, obviously, but the almond flavor is seriously lacking. I'll still finish the whole box, they are decent, but I'll go back to Justin's which has a beautifully pronounced almond flavor.

review/text: I LOVE Barney Butter! It is so smooth and the almond flavor is just exceptional. I have tried other almond butters and Barney Butter is by far my favorite. In addition to being delicious, it gives me energy and is also quite filling. As an added bonus the snack packaging is fantastic for a few reasons. I like it for myself because it is easy to transport and is only 90 calories so that helps me to monitor how many calories I am taking in.  I also love it because my kids have allergies to tree nuts and they love Barney Butter so much that they ask for it by name. Due to their allergies we have to be very careful about what they eat and therefore are always bringing food with us to restaurants, birthday parties etc. The snack packs are a Godsend because they are so easy to just grab and go. I highly recommend Barney Butter overall and especially like the snack packs.

review/text: I'm an almond butter junkie trying to lose weight on WW, not easy, b/c this stuff is highly caloric. These packets definitely help in portion control at 90 calories.  I like the taste and texture. One reviewer or more mentioned that the expiration date is not printed. On my box is printed: Best By Nov 17, 2011.  I bought these months ago, so that is definitely a good thing. I knead the packet and it is not a problem to get out; and sometimes i just eat it plain, w/o crackers, as a taste of something yummy. Like that it is peanut-free, as I have a toddler granddaughter around and she is highly allergic to dairy, eggs, and peanuts. Packets also have a convenient, easy-to-open tear notch at the bottom making these easy to eat on the go and for travel.

Usually 2 tablespoons is condiered a serving of nut butter.  1 tbsp is really not enough to spread for a sandwich.<br /><br />3) The consistency of this almond butter is kind of sticky/ gooey compared with other more creamy ones I have tried (ie Trader Joe's).

Not even close to the consistency of the jar. Really disappointing.

review/summary: My new favorite almond butter brand!
review/text: I love buying almond/peanut butter packets because they're so convenient, but they're usually expensive (1.25 a pack) at my local whole foods. This price is fantastic and I love the smooth texture of this almond butter. I eat this on the go with a banana or as a lunch snack tucked into a baggie of cut celery.

review/text: I love These!  on a 50 calorie rice cake......delicious!  I've been on a 1500 calorie regiment for almost 7 weeks and these 90 calorie packs are just perfect for a snack.  The package states "knead, tear, spread the love", I knead for at least 30 seconds to make sure it is all mixed up(I think of it as exercise for the fingers), there is a starter for the "tear" which makes it super easy to open and if you like almonds and peanut butter you will like almond butter, if you don't, then don't buy these. I absolutely will be buying these again.

review/summary: Not sure about the packets.
review/text: I love the almond butter- but the little packets are a bit funky.  You have to knead them, then open and squeeze- no big deal, but unless they are for traveling (or keeping something for diabetics after a low is restored to normal), the cost isn't worth it.  The jars of Barney Butter are a much better value.  Flavor is great.

review/text: Never had almond butter before but saw a dr. oz show touting the benefits of eating 2 tbsp before bed to give you more energy in the morning. Found this and ordered it straight away. Came quickly, individual packets are easy to open. I'm kneading it based on the other reviews, and it's been simply delicious. A great protein rich snack and just 90 calories. I bought a single packet of one of the other almond butter products at the grocery store today. It was 180 calories, so probably better if you want to make a sandwich, but I'm LOVING the barney butter. Will definitely be ordering more and keeping some of these in the car for a quick snack for the kids. Big thumbs up!

review/text: First, I want to tell you that I'm allergic to peanuts and had never found anything that came close to the taste...until now. I ordered this product due to the good price and ease of taking these packets to work. I was extremely surprised when I tasted it and checked the package to make sure it wasn't real peanut butter. I'm not sure how they've done it, but this product is excellent. Barney butter is now a staple in my house.

Secondly, the overwhelming sensation is of way too much oil to enjoy .  Flavor is otherwise ok, but nothing to write home about.  I'll stick to raw almonds.

review/summary: Too small a portion size, needs a lot of kneading
review/text: This product has a very smooth texture (if you knead the package enough before opening it) and it tastes just fine.  I have to roll the package between my hands until the product feels warm before it can be squeezed out and spread nicely.  The portion size is too small for an adult serving; however, this is a nice size for children.  One packet will adequately cover but not fill up 2 small celery sticks that are about 3" in length if that helps to quantify the portion size. If you don't have anything to compare this product to, you will be happy with it, but I purchased the individual packets of Justin's almond butter before purchasing these, and I liked the Justin's product better because the servings are bigger and their product requires much less kneading.

And also, you already know each measured portion has 90 calories! Oh well, for now I will continue to cart my almond butter in little rubbermaid containers.

But the stuff is so good it just became a morning habit.<br /><br />They have a sugar free version, but I can't stomach it because I got so used to this flavor.  I have tried all the other flavors, but I always come back to the Milk Chocolate.  It really is the best tasting.<br /><br />It is a quick, low calorie vitamin and mineral packed breakfast for me.  Sometimes I even drink it at night as a dessert if I am watching calories and I need some chocolate, but can't splurge on ice cream.<br /><br />It is rather pricey, but for me this is worth it for the effortlessness of figuring out breakfast.  It's so quick and easy and good for you too!

Without changing the look of the packaging, Greens+ has changed the ingredients and has ruined a once-great bar (I along with other loyal customers I knew would order them by the boxload). Supposedly to "increase production," they've ruined the 40:30:30 balance, adding far more calories, fat, and carbs, while decreasing protein content. Sad, as they were once the perfect energy bar... I'm still in mourning. I am sending all boxes back directly to the company. Hopefully, if enough people do so, they can be persuaded to continue manufacturing the old formula, as I'm willing to wait and stock up on the original product, but not this pale imitation...

Here's a quick breakdown of the changes:<br /><br />Old:  162 Cals (45 fat), 5g fat - 4 Monounsaturated & 1 polyunsaturated, 32mg Sodium, 18g Carbs - 4g Fiber & 12g Sugar, 12g Protein.<br /><br />New:  240 Cals (80 fat), 8g fat - 1 Saturated, 6 Monounsaturated, 75mg Sodium, 32g Carbs - 5g Fiber & 23g Sugar, 10g Protein.<br /><br />Ingredient list & new changes in parentheses:<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic medjool dates (Organic Dates - CHANGED), organic almond butter, organic quinoa sprout powder, non-gmo soy protein isolate, original GREENS+� powder (non-gmo soy lecithin, organic Hawaiian spirulina (Hawaiian Spirulina - CHANGED), organic apple fiber, barley grass powder (barley grass), wheat grass powder (wheat grass - CHANGED), Japanese chlorella, hydroponic soy sprouts, organic brown rice bran, sprouted barley malt, alfalfa grass powder (alfalfa grass - CHANGED), dairy-free probiotics (REMOVED), royal jelly, Montana bee pollen, acerola berry juice, natural vitamin E, licorice root powder, milk thistle extract (milk thistle seed extract - CHANGED), echinacea root extract, Siberian Eleuthero root extract, astragalus root extract, licorice root extract, organic red beet juice, dunaliella salina algae, organic Nova Scotia Dulse, organic ginkgo biloba leaf extract, organic Japanese green tea extract, grape seed and skin extract, organic Swedish bilberry extract), organic rice crisps, wildflower honey (organic honey - CHANGED), mixed tocopherols (natural vitamin E) (natural mixed tocopherols (vitamin E) - CHANGED).<br /><br />Biggest changes I saw were the type of dates used, and the switch from wildflower honey to "organic honey".<br /><br />I theorize that the reason the nutritional information changed was because they switched to a different type of date, with slightly more fat.  I believe they added more of this new date and removed tiny amounts of other more expensive ingredients (protein powder).  That would increase the sugar  and calorie content as shown, lower protein levels, and raise the fat content slightly.  So, if these bars taste more sweet, have more fat and have more sugar, it's due to the extra content of dates (and maybe almond butter) and decrease in soy protein powder.<br /><br />That's my theory.<br /><br />Either way the bars taste pretty good right now - and there are no better alternatives on the market.

review/summary: Greens + energy bars are excellent!!!
review/text: These are some of the very best tasting energy bars I've ever had, and they have some of the very best ingredients I've come across so far. I find the chocolate coated bars to be tastier than the natural (because I love chocolate); however, the natural bars are really quite good, too. These bars are soft, easy to chew, and have a nice texture. Here is a list of all the ingredients for the natural bars:<br /><br />Organic medjool dates, organic almond butter, organic quinoa sprout powder, non-gmo soy protein isolate, original GREENS+� powder (non-gmo soy lecithin, organic Hawaiian spirulina, organic apple fiber, barley grass powder, wheat grass powder, Japanese chlorella, hydroponic soy sprouts, organic brown rice bran, sprouted barley malt, alfalfa grass powder, dairy-free probiotics, royal jelly, Montana bee pollen, acerola berry juice, natural vitamin E, licorice root powder, milk thistle extract, echinacea root extract, Siberian Eleuthero root extract, astragalus root extract, licorice root extract, organic red beet juice, dunaliella salina algae, organic Nova Scotia Dulse, organic ginkgo biloba leaf extract, organic Japanese green tea extract, grape seed and skin extract, organic Swedish bilberry extract), organic rice crisps, wildflower honey, mixed tocopherols (natural vitamin E).<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these bars!!!!

review/summary: really great nutrition bar
review/text: I really like the Greens+ bars. They are a true nutrition bar, not a fancy shmancy energy bar (which is really a candy bar, made to look like a nutrition bar, but isn't).  Each bar can last me 2 hours, and it is great.  The Greens+ powders are just as good, and I use both religiously.  Being diabetic, and counting carbs, this is closest thing to real food that is easily portable.<br /><br />Now, if they can come up with a "savory" version - I do get tired of sweet nutrition bars.  Wish they would make one that is lightly salty, since salty will satisfy your food cravings better than sweet.

review/summary: Best balanced and tasting bar on the market today
review/text: I'm not a personal trainer, but I am a health nut, and I have a few friends who are the same way.  We have tried MANY different bars, including Atkins, MetRx, PowerBar, Zone, Balance, Luna, GoLean, Detour, Myoplex, CarboLite, Advantage, and other "40-40-30" bars.  This bar is one of the best tasting bars I've eaten.  The green color worried me at first, but the flavor and nutritive qualities of this bar make it hands down the best.<br /><br />We visited a health store for about two hours one day to compare the ingredients on this bar versus all the others.  It is perfectly balanced, has no saturated fat (only 4g of mono-unsat, and 1g of poly unsat), and also has NO hydrogenated oils. This is VERY important, and if you don't know about how harmful hydrogenated oils can be, you should definitely read more about them.<br /><br />In many stores you will find this bar for about $2.40, discounted to $2.11.  Here on the site it's an incredible deal to find the everyday price of $2.09 discounted to $1.67 per bar. I ordered 5 boxes!  I think I'll order another 5-10 (since they'll keep up to 6-7 months) if the sale lasts longer.  Hopefully they'll go on sale again.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy the chocolate flavored version, since I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but if you are (as is one of my friends), they said the chocolate version is just as good.<br /><br />I hope this company keeps making these for years to come!

review/summary: CALORIES HAVE DOUBLED AND FAT CONTENT IS UP COMPANY IS NOT ADVERTISING NEW FORMULATION
review/text: I have been using these bars for about a year. Apparently they changed the formula 7 months ago and never disclosed the formula change. Lets face it when purchasing a product we do not re-read the calorie and ingredient list EACH time we purchase it UNLESS it says formula change or New or gives us some indication thre has been a change. Seems almost illegal to not say so on the lable front.<br /><br />So careful people. You could almost have a small meal now for the calories they contain.

review/summary: health nut eats these as a meal replacement
review/text: Even if these bars did have a lower cal and fat count once, I never used them until after the company changed their formula. I have tried countless raw/alkalizing bars and this is by far the greatest. I eat one for breakfast and one for lunch and my weight has stabilized after loosing 50 pounds. When considering this bar as a meal replacement, I don't see what the big deal is if the fat calories and regular calories and carbohydrates come from healthy, raw, organic foods. There is nothing wrong with healthy fat and plenty of it--especially when trying to loose weight the healthy way. The Green's plus bars that I would recommend staying away from are the peanut butter protein bars which have an unhealthy cholesterol count and the chocolate coated greens bars which just seem counter intuitive to me.

review/summary: These are the best tasting bars I've ever tried
review/text: Over the years I've tried every energy and protein bar out there but these are the best tasting I've ever had especially the chocolate ones. I have to hide them from my kids who think they are candy bars, delicious.
