review/summary: Junk health food
review/text: I hope that one day this snack can reach the point where it is truly healthy and consistently good.<br /><br />A) Claiming to be healthy, at least - last bag I munched on had nutrition info that would in one serving give you the bare minimum healthy cholesterol score (&lt;300) for an entire DAY. Many snacks do this. Like peanuts. Or popcorn. The idea is that since the products are from 'natural' sources, there is less control over the batch. But seriously - less than 300mg per serving? Give me a break. This gives no one trying to help themselves in this area any hope of control. It's almost like writing a blank check. To yourself. To state that your product's single serving falls less than the daily total max recommended is garbage. Read the label.<br /><br />B) The batches may be uneven in cholesterol, and they may avoid legal issues by setting it at the 'max'. But the uneven textures and flavors you may get (I consumed, along with family and friends, several cases of these over 2 years or so) don't add up, either. I had burnt tones, teeth-cracking textures at times.<br /><br />I used to love these chips, much as the majority of the reviews portray. I thought I was enjoying at the least a fair product, staying healthy, keeping the fat away. But - they are simply simple carbs with a little twist of fat that get you by in the place of their higher-fat brethren. In case you are not sure of where I stand, I am one of those people who think carb-laden chips are not a great food. You don't miss health until you lose it. These chips will not help your health. They might, at best, make it slightly less worse than everyday chips - at twice or more the price.<br /><br />A leading non-profit consumer org concluded this was 'junk health food'. They cited other causes, as well. I wholeheartedly concur that this is not a healthy food. It is a junk food that is masquerading as one.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:<br /><br />Just got around to adding this. My wife purchased a bag of the "Hickory Honey BBQ" at the beginning of July. They were real dental-rattlers, uneven but thick-cut and baked into seriously hard material. The spices were horribly uneven.<br /><br />Lot mark: 12JUL12 090227921:37

review/summary: Best peppermint tea ever!
review/text: I didn't have high hopes when I first opened a packet of this tea. I am not a big herbal "tea" fan (they contain no actual tea). However, this actual tea with peppermint natural peppermint flavor had me at first sip. I can't remember how I got a sample of it, but I now have an Amazon subscription for a case every 6 months (I also drink Twining's Earl Grey & Lady Grey regularly). I prefer this peppermint tea very strong with milk - delicious. I recommend following the steeping times on the packet. As a bonus, it's organic.

Great price in bulk on Amazon.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Packaging is annoying -- Each tea bag is individually wrapped and there is a perforated line indicating where to tear open each package. Unless you are very careful it is easy to tear off the top of the tea bag. This happens to me about 1/3 of the time and is mildly annoying.

review/text: This is a good peppermint tea.  The peppermint does not overwhelm the taste of the tea.  It is a black tea with peppermint, not an herbal tea.  There is no spearmint added as some "peppermint" teas are flavored with.  I drink this tea all day long.  Since another tea company stopped making their peppermint flavored black tea years ago, I have been searching for another peppermint tea and I have been disappointed with every one I tried until this one.

review/summary: Frustrating
review/text: The tea is delicious.  The packaging is totally obnoxious.  First, each tea bag comes in a sealed packet with a perforated line across the top where you tear off the top to free the bag.  It doesn't always tear on the perforation and often causes the top of the tea bag to be torn off.  Then the teabag string is wound under the tea and exits at the top of the bag only slightly, so that if you threw it in the hot water, you'd have the little paper tag in your tea.  On four occasions, in trying to gently tug the string through, the tea bag ripped, spilling tea leaves all over my kitchen.  It's annoying, a waste of money, and very frustrating to ruin so many servings and be unable to use them.  I don't know why such idiotic packaging is used.  The company must have received complaints!<br /><br />Good deal buying it on Amazon, which I started doing after my local grocery discontinued it.  Get bulk quantities along with other hard to finds, and you get free shipping.

review/summary: Great snack at a steep price
review/text: As I become more health conscious, I continually look for snacks to satisfy my sweet and crunchy cravings. While on vacation in the US I found this in a store for much less than they are offering here, but if I want this I will have to pay the price. They taste great, not too sweet and the nuts are crunchy enough to satisfy me. 5 pieces are supposed to be about 170 calories, so I don't feel too guilty enjoying this.

review/summary: DELICIOUS taste and ALL-NATURAL ... very ADDICTIVE!!
review/text: I discovered these almond, pecan, cashew clusters about a year ago while shopping at Sam Club's. They were sampling them with yogurt. OMG ... one bite and I was hooked! I LOVE these. My kids love them. They are PERFECT by themselves or in yogurt. A serving size (~5 bite-size clusters) is 170 calories w/12g of fat (as is expected from nuts). They are very addictive ... almost like eating candy. Unfortunately, it's not hard to find yourself eating more than 1 serving. :)<br /><br />These are are 100% natural and the only other ingredients outside of the nuts are brown rice syrup, organic sugar, sea salt, and sunflower oil. I paid around $8 for a 24 oz bag at Sam's Club.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have been trying to reduce the amount of sugar in my diet, so I have switched to just eating raw/plain almonds, pecans, cashews and walnuts. :)

review/summary: Healthy AND Tastes Great
review/text: I tried this soup because I am on a very strict diet that does not allow me to eat any food containing gluten, corn, or potatoes. It is very hard to find things that I can have because even most soups contain some kind of starch or flour made from corn, wheat, etc.<br /><br />Other split pea soups I have tried have too much of one flavor, but this one has a perfect blend of vegetables and spices. It has a very thick consistency so you get more of the actual soup instead of mostly water.<br /><br />The ingredients in this split pea soup are:<br /><br />Water, Organic Split Peas, Organic Carrots, Organic Onions, Organic Celery, Organic Peas, Organic Rice Flour, Sea Salt, Organic Spices.<br /><br />It is a good source of protein, Vitamin A, and a VERY good source of fiber. Another good thing is that it's fat free.<br /><br />I am so glad I found this soup because it is healthy, filling, and tastes wonderful. It tastes so good that I would buy it even if I were not on a special diet.

review/summary: Recipe Changed - Now, Too Much Starch and Potatoes
review/text: Upon receiving this pea soup, I was disappointed to learn that the recipe has been changed from the one currently listed here on Amazon. Now, cheap potatoes, rice starch and tasteless lentils have been added to the product ingredients, as additional fillers; giving the soup the consistency of a bowl of starchy mashed potatoes. I don't mind "some" potatoes, but there are just too many spuds and starches in this "pea" soup.<br /><br />If you like the consistency and flavor of thick mashed potatoes, this soup is for you.<br /><br />Note that the positive reviews you are reading here apply to the product BEFORE the Recipe and Ingredients were changed for the worse!

review/text: This split pea soup is nearly perfect. It is organic and gluten free. On top of that, it is so delicious, filling, and versatile. What else could I ask for? Being celiac and having multiple food allergies, it is difficult finding foods I can eat. This is one food I can eat and enjoy safely. I actually heated this up and put it on top of a baked potato for a change. It made a great topping. I also used it as a dip for crackers and chips. Even my husband who is not a fan of split pea soup ate this up and loved it. For the price with subscribe and save, it was cheaper on Amazon than in our local store.

review/text: I had purchased this ginger once in the past, and it was very good quality. However, the latest order that I made gave me quite a shock! The ginger powder had a very peculiar, chemical odor. I tasted a small sample and had to rinse my mouth as it was disgusting. Then I looked more closely at the label, and discovered the problem. This ginger is from China, and although labeled as organic, I'm quite sure that it was laced with pesticide or other chemicals. I have read reports of "organic" ginger leaving China literally covered with insecticide powder, and I suspect that this is what may have happened to this batch. I would recommend that you avoid this product until these issues are resolved.

Considering the current weather, all that thermal stuff was probably not needed, but I do live in Mohave AZ, usually one of the hottest areas in the world.  From what I can see, all the balls are in tact with none crushed. The day after I ordered the product for a total of $41.00, Amazon stepped in and is now selling it for around $36.00. Win some, loose some. With Amazon taking over the shipping, I cannot say what the future shipping will be like as they have cut it in half. (From $11.00 to $6.00)<br />The product speaks for itself, as another reviewer said: ADDICTIVE!

review/summary: Arrived with melted centers
review/text: I placed an order for this 120 count assortment and the Lindt 60 count Peanut Butter Truffles for a special treat for myself and my family over the Halloween season. Amazon shipped both boxes in the same oversized insulating carton with only 2 icepacks. Shipping time was two and a half days. Arrived with coldpacks completely melted and warm. I unpacked them and the chocolates sat on my desk (at home) until the following day; inside of truffles from both boxes were melted. The days that they shipped were warm, not hot, so only two icepacks for both boxes, not being adequate, should have been obvious to whom ever packed them.<br />I put them in the freezer and had a few frozen truffles as treats...not the same. I noticed both boxes were no longer in the freezer about two weeks later and thought my husband tossed them out. He sheepishly admitted to eating them. He claimed they were "fantastic"; so not a complete waste of money. He eats anything chocolate--melted, frozen or shaped into a hollow bunny with the ears broken off.

review/text: These lolipops are the best and so unique! I first bought them in Epcot in Disneyworld in the Mexico part of world showcase. They are a little sweet, a little salty, and a little spicy- the best! At first there is a saltier out layer but as you keep eating it you get bits of sweetness. The perfect combo!

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: I have a miniature pinscher who is very picky about her treats. When we adopted her the shelter told us she loves hot dogs and cheese so I searched on here and lucky enough found the combo of both! She LOVES them. They're by far her favorite treats. Just make sure you put them in the fridge once you open the bag. It states in small letters on the bag but my boyfriend and I didn't notice that till day 2. Fast shipping and packaged well. Would recommend to others!

review/summary: Too sweet frosting mix; I'll make my own
review/text: I bought this mix because I thought it would be convenient to have on hand on the rare occasions when I bake a cake. But when I made it, I found it much too sweet for my taste, and I had to add a lot of my own cocoa to cut the sweetness. The mix is basically cocoa and sugar, to which you add your own fat (cream cheese, butter, whatever); next time I'll just mix my own sugar and cocoa and save a little money.

review/summary: Awesome frosting !! Tastes like homemade !!
review/text: I purchased three different brands of chocolate box frosting in order to do a taste test.  The three brands were: Pamela's Dark Chocolate Frosting, Cherrybrook Kitchen Chocolate Frosting, and Dr. Oetker Organic Chocolate Icing Mix.  Of the many people that tested the three in my family everyone preferred the Pamela's. I have often made my own frosting from scratch using these same exact ingredients and I must say that Pamela's tastes very close to my own scratch recipe.  It has more cocoa in it so it has a richer, fudgier flavor than the other two and absolutely NO odd flavors.  None of the three were bad but Pamela's was just better.  One drawback to the Cherrybrook Frosting is that it calls for 2 entire sticks of margarine or butter as opposed to pamela's 6 Tablespoons.  The Cherrybrook has a lighter chocolate but very buttery flavor.  A few of us thought Dr. Oetker's had a slightly odd taste but it was still pretty good. Pamela's is definitely our new favorite.

review/summary: Awesome Houjicha
review/text: I'm by no means an expert on Hojicha, and I'm not sure what the difference in spelling suggests, but I do know that this is an EXCELLENT cup of tea! Hojicha tends to differ from Sencha and Chinese green teas because it's roasted in a pot rather than steamed. This produces a completely different and very pleasant flavor... toasty, and somewhat nutty (in my opinion). Roasted tea like this also has less caffeine, which could be a Pro or a Con. Either way, this is a great Hojicha!

review/text: I'd started buying this product a long time ago from a local organic/natural food store.  I don't allow any other brand in my house because of what's not in it.  My kids love the crunch and taste.  Food tastes so much better when it doesn't have the added preservatives and artificial flavor enhancers.  Some of those flavor enhancers that you find in other food can be found in shampoo and conditioner and those companies will say that they're flavor enhancers when it reality those artificial things keep them fromturning rancid.  If you have children this is a great healthy snack and MOMS' don't have to worry.

review/text: Just purchased these for the first time.  If you are a person needing the crunch factor for a snack, these are great, but the case we received, the chedder flavored coating, didn't have much of a flavor at all.  They are healthier than some other snacks, I agree with other reviews on that point.  We personally, probably will not purchase again, just don't want to eat crunchy air puffs with no taste, boring!

review/text: Tired of microwave popcorn that is all greasy and chewey?  Jiffy Pop makes it easier to make stovetop popcorn.  No pans to clean, no need to keep oil around.  All you need is a stove!  People are always talking about how hard this stuff is to cook, but if you are able to carefully follow the instructions, you will get it perfect.  Remember, it's the same prinicpal as cooking a steak.  If you have the heat too high, you sear it and the inside is raw.  What you have to do is keep the heat on medium, and keep shaking to move the unpopped kernals to the bottom.  When the popping slows, pull it off and enjoy!

review/summary: The Best Popcorn!
review/text: When I was a little girl my mom would get this for us.  My Uncle was the only one with the skill to sit over the burner  and cook this popcorn without scorching it!  I purchased a case for his birthday, as kind of a joke (because I knew how much he loved popcorn and always said Jiffy Pop was the best.)  Well, he LOVED it!  He said it is exactly the same as it was twenty years ago.  When microwave popcorn became the norm,  Jiffy Pop seemed to disappear from the grocery stores, but since my Uncle loved popcorn so much he would just make what was available.  After making the Jiffy Pop for the first time after having microwave popcorn for all these years, he declared it the best.  So much tastier than the nuked kind!!  I am so glad I am able to find it for him!!

review/text: We were BIG fans of Sprout- had a great experience with a lot of the flavors-until this flavor.  My daughter actually got sick.  The food was thicker and I thought maybe that is they was it was supposed to be-not true. I bought more of the lentil bolganese kind which she absolutley loved and we gave to her quite a few times... I bought several....The first package of the was a thick almost solid consistency.  I opened a total of 5 of the packages and they were all solid-not the experience that I had had in the past except for the parmesean potato. Something was very wrong. I had it happen with 2 of the Parmesean Potato and 5 of the Lentil Bolgenese.  I sent an email to Sprout and didn't hear a word back from them.  There was something seriously wrong with some of their food that was sent out.  I won't be wasting my money or taking my chances with Sprout.  we have had wonderful success with Happy Baby and Plum.

My baby has days where he'll eat more than a couple bites of this, others not. I wouldn't have thought of giving my baby potatoes with parmesan at his age yet (9 months) but we are a little more relaxed as third time parents and want to get him used to different foods early on.  (We are also tyler florence fans!) Anyway we thought we'd give it a shot. We will, as they recommend, continue to offer it, but I'll say this is not one of his favorite sprout flavors compared to say the roasted bananas and brown rice.

review/summary: My daughter loves it!
review/text: I was really surprised to see the poor reviews for these potatoes so I had to chime in on this one. My daughter is 11 months old and she LOVES these potatoes. It is one of the  a few food items that she will eat consistently- I feed it to her for lunch probably every other day along with some peas or carrots. It is definitely a thicker food and it should be because it's simply mashed potatoes. A few months ago she went on a mini food strike and I realized that she was tired of the same old soupy, pureed baby food and she wanted something with a little more texture, substance and flavor. These potatoes are absolutely that. I would say that it's probably a good idea to wait on these until your baby has had a fair amount of experience with different foods and textures, but if so then certainly try it. If it doesn't work out then pass along the rest of the pack to a friend in case her baby likes it.  :)<br /><br />By the way, my daughter also loves the Sprout sweet potato and white bean.

review/text: I bought the 7" bones in a 12 pack based on customer's saying that the bones will last about 1 week for active chewers. It's been 2-3 months and my female collie/hound mix is still chewing on it, hasn't even broken the bone yet.<br /><br />I gave one to my boyfriend's brother dog that is a female american bulldog. She's already broken the bone in several places and has gotten most of the insides out and has definitely stripped the bone of the outside goodies, but still goes back to the bone when she needs something hard to chew on. She has had hers for about a month, and still in great shape and plenty left to "eat", chew on. She still enjoys it.<br /><br />I gave one to my roommates dog who is a female american bulldog/lab mix and within 1 week she practically had the bone cracked in half long ways. She still chews on the bone and even totes it around with her. She was also guard her bone like no other toy.<br /><br />I still have 9 left! It's like a lifetime supply for all three of these dogs!<br /><br />I am VERY pleased with the Merrick brand for dog bones. I was VERY displeased with some of the reviews on this particular bone.<br /><br />I am on my second trial of Merrick bones. This time the Ranger Ribs!

review/text: Ok, I actually don't think I received this bone right. When I got it there was nothing inside, it was just hollow and judging from the picture it's supposed to be stuffed. I actually did find this at my pet store today and they were all stuffed as well while mine was hollow.<br />Anyway, my dog loved this for a day and now I have to get him excited or smear peanut butter inside of it to get him to eat the bone. It seems very durable and like I said, I think I got a dud. I'm sure he would have spent days or weeks on it if hadn't been hollow. I'll stick to buying this at my pet store.<br />So I'll give this a 3 star and I'll give it another shot and update my review.

review/summary: Its ok but I wouldnt buy again
review/text: I read reviews saying the bone lasted their big dogs quite some time. I just receive the bones 2 days ago, and with in the 2 days my dogs had them completely cleaned out and bare. I have two very tiny Shih Tzu mix dogs. No where near big dogs. I'm very disappointed how fast they went through 2 bones. The delivery was very fast that's why I'm rating it a 3 star otherwise I would give it a 2.

review/text: The Knorr Classic Brown gravy mix is a pretty good substitute for those times when you don't have the drippings to make the real thing. It's great on potatoes and works well on both beef and pork. Turn simple hamburger into a much more elegant Salisbury Steak by pouring some Knorr Classic Brown gravy over it.<br /><br />You can assist the mix by preparing it in the pan in which you cooked the meat. That way you get a bit of real fond in the gravy. Melt a bit of butter in the gravy just before it's done and you'll add a nice shine to it and improve the consistency.

review/summary: Now over-priced
review/text: This is the best I've tried.  It would be perfect if it were a bit thicker.  It gets kinda thin when heated.  I add a bit of shredded cheese to thicken it up.  Regardless, the flavor, heat, etc are excellent and far better than the Que Bueno that Costco sells (and is too thick).<br />---------------<br />Update 24 Dec 2011 - Right now the price is $36.  It used to be $24 (that's what I last paid for it according to my Amazon invoice).  A 50% increase is ridiculous.  It is good but not worth the current price.  I'm looking for an alternative.<br />---------------<br />Update 1 May 2012 - I found an excellent alternative for a bit less convenience (El Rio is still WAY overpriced at $36).  Try La Victoria Medium nacho cheese sauce.  I have only found it in 6 pound cans (at Cash and Carry in WA - probably also at Smart and Final in other places) for about $8.  La Victoria is at least as hot and the thickness does not change as it is heated.  Excellent flavor.  What I ended up doing is splitting it into freezer-type zip lock bags - roughly 14 oz each - and freezing them flat with no air inside.  They thaw in 10 minutes in the sink.  Then I clip one of the bottom corners off and squeeze out what I need and then fold the corner back up with no air and put a spring-loaded clip on it (a chip clip or binder clip works) and keep it in the fridge while I'm using it.  Opening and closing the zipper is asking for mold issues.<br /><br />I also tried vacuum sealing in glass mason jars and keeping them all in the fridge, but that didn't prevent mold.  The zip-lock bags work great and the flavor and consistency of this cheese is the best!  It is worth the repackaging effort.

review/summary: Not as expected
review/text: I ordered this nacho cheese sause hoping for something similar to what you would get at concession stands served with chips or hot pretzels. Somewhat runny with some heat to it.<br /><br />Unfortunatly the elRio brand didn't deliver in the "Hot" department. It's got good consistancy for dipping chips, but is no more than what I would call mild.<br /><br />The good news (for me) is that while it says jalapeno peppers, there are not actual chunks of jalapenos in it.<br /><br />Overall I don't think this is terrible cheese sause, just not exactly what I was looking for. They shouldn't call it "Hot" if it is no worse than regular old mild salsa. I've seen the stuff used in consession stands in places like Costco and Sam's Club but they come in the giant cans that can fill a crock pot. I would never eat through that much before it went bad, so my search will continue.<br /><br />Why isn't this stuff sold in grocery stores? The most stores in my region carry are plain chedder cheese sauses or salsa queso dip (I HATE chunks in my dip!).

review/text: I gave this 5 stars as a great nacho cheese sauce base because it tastes great. (It's a little thin for me since I don't squirt it from a pump.) At $19.98 for a dozen 15 oz cans, you couldn't make a more tasty base so cheaply.  I add some corn starch and heat it in the microwave (stirring every 15 seconds) to thicken it up.  I also add a few slices of processed cheeze to richen it up.  That's just my preference.

review/summary: Excellent Buy for an Exceptional Decaf Green Tea
review/text: This 6-pack is another great deal from Amazon, especially when purchased on a subscription basis.<br /><br />Bigelow's decaf green tea is smooth and not bitter.  I've found green teas can be easily "burned" if you boil your water before steeping, so be sure to stop heating your water before the boiling point (I just use a Chantal ceramic teapot & heat a cup of water in it in the microwave for just 2 minutes, then steep in a cup--perfect.  I like to sweeten it with a package of Sweet Leaf Stevia==healthy antioxidant heaven & no caffeine!).<br /><br />Also, don't steep any green tea too long--about 3 to 3-1/2 minutes is just right for green tea--otherwise, it WILL be bitter, regardless of brand.<br /><br />I love the fact that these tea bags are individually packaged in foil-lined packs; tea stays fresh and delicious until you're ready to enjoy a cup.  Good quality decaf green tea is really hard to find in my local area; thanks again Amazon!

review/text: When I was a  child my mother would very infrequently buy a can or two to serve as a special treat because the whole family enjoyed them. I have an emotional association with the product, and still love them.  These are great when added to  no-bean chili, served over rice or potatoes, or as a side dish served with other more nutritional fresh foods. I let them simmer in a covered pan until the masa coating is soft before removing the paper wrappers. The sauce can create more servings when added to other ingredients and I am experimenting with more recipes that include the tamales. When on sale or through Amazon, Hormel tamales are a fairly inexpensive way to serve a fast meal and add variety to menus.

review/summary: A Classic
review/text: If you didn't grow up eating these, you may wonder why anyone would like them.  These fall into the category of "comfort food".  I think for many of us, these were one of the options our fathers cooked for us when we were either in a hurry to go out sportsfishing etc. (breakfast, with a side of eggs), or conversely exhausted after a day hiking the desert or some other such outdoorsy activity.  Indeed, you can pack and eat these cold on the trail.<br /><br />These are not unhealthy whatsoever.  They can't qualify as "Mexican" food really, but on the other hand, I do recall having fresh tamales very much like these, from remote villages and homes in Baja etc. where my father used to fly to go fishing and visiting friends.  So I guess on some level they really could be called authentic....<br /><br />I admire these because they are the kind of thing you can keep in the cupboard and heat up rapidly for a very satisfying meal when you are famished but otherwise don't want to cook or stop somewhere for fast food.  Believe it or not, they go down well when you are home sick with the flu or other ailments.  When I was living an extremely active lifestyle (walking everywhere, martial arts, tennis, racquetball, etc. constantly), these were one of the truly best things to have on hand when I came home late, ravenous and needing a quick and easy meal before bed, or a rapid lunch between engagements, or a breakfast when I knew I wouldn't likely eat anything for the rest of the day.  They have a sort of balanced quality in terms of answering one's hunger without leaving you too full or still hungry, or like you're missing something.  Of course, you can use them as part of a meal with other foods as well (as mentioned above, these are really great with eggs for breakfast).<br /><br />They are also awesome for times when you've been drinking or after parties etc.  They won't upset your stomach but will make you feel like you ate a full meal, and you can then crash in bed right after eating them, without any digestive problems.<br /><br />I also used to keep these as a standard in my emergency supplies (I need to re-stock!); again because you can eat them without heating up and they will make you feel satiated without any stomach/digestive issues.  You could also in an emergency take advantage of the liquid in the can for flavoring rice etc. (or well you can do that anytime of course if you want).<br /><br />You can doctor them up in multiple ways.  Cheese is a good option, as are sour cream, and/or lots of freshly diced scallions (or shallots if you have them).  You can cut these into chunks and add to other things, like soup.  I suppose you could even deep fry them (without papers obviously) but I never tried that.  For normal cooking in a pot, keep the wrappers on, all the way until you plate them; then pull off wrappers with tongs.

review/summary: High quality? No. Convenient? Yes.
review/text: I live alone. I am very busy. I'm a bachelor. I haven't been to the grocery store in months. I need food that is quick and easy to make.<br /><br />If I buy fresh groceries, usually they go bad before I ever get to eat any of it. Also, the price of groceries nowadays is almost as bad as gas prices.<br /><br />Are they high quality? No. I would say most people would be unhappy with them. The tamales themselves are of a very odd consistency almost like curds in cottage cheese. The sauce is very watery. The meat is low quality.<br /><br />Another thing, they are very messy to take out of the can because they are wrapped in wax paper which you have to take off each tamale. Not a big deal but I just wanted to note that.<br /><br />But these are convenient. For some reason, I like them. Like others have said, there is just something about them. I usually eat a couple cans for supper and that fills my stomach.<br /><br />Would I recommend them? No. Because most people wouldn't enjoy them. But if you are easy to please like I am and just want something convenient that you can keep stored on the shelf then I would try these--just don't expect too much.

review/summary: that's a lot of tamales
review/text: whole case of tamales, cheaper that store price, tasty but what they call chili I call water with grease. Drain and add your own chili top with cheese serve on bed of lettuse and supper is ready.

review/summary: keep these in your pantry
review/text: I keep these in my pantry at all times. They make a great quick lunch. Also, they make a great supper when time is short, just unwrap put in baking sheet and cover with cheese, bake at 350 until cheese is melted. Cheaper here on Amazon then at my local grocery store.

review/summary: Quick Late Night Meal...
review/text: ... served over black beans with a spicy salsa and cheese. Healthier than the pint of Hagen Daz or the trip through the local drive-thru. The more things I have on hand to whip up a filling meal the less the temptation for fast food outside the home. The downside - it was pretty light on the Chili Sauce though.

review/summary: Just as I remember them as a child
review/text: They do seem less greasy than I remembered which is a plus. Not too much like a "real" tamale but good for a quick lunch or camping trip.
