review/summary: Great Diet Option
review/text: I have a real weakness for peanut butter. If I have a jar in my house I will eat the entire thing in one sitting, so I try to avoid buying it. That said, when it muse be had, this is an excellent alternative. I oarticularly like is as a dessert helper with low fat frozen yogurt/ice cream/fudge pops. I am Celiac and haven't eaten bread in nearly 10 years, so I can't speak to what it does for a classic PB&J!

review/summary: I absolutely recommend!
review/text: I was skeptical at first about 'powdered' peanut butter, but after getting this I'm hooked!  It's 100% peanuts that are ground to a powder consistency - and in the process 85% of the fat is removed.  I'm a peanut butter lover, but even the reduced fat or sugar free butters on the market can put me over my daily goal for fat or sugar.  I drink chocolate protein shakes and as a treat every once in a while, I would add a spoonful of peanut butter to satisfy my cravings for a Reeses.<br /><br />I no longer have to deprive myself!  I added the PB2 into my shake, it fully dissolved and I can now enjoy my chocolate peanut butter without guilt.<br /><br />I have both the plain and the chocolate flavored and they are both fantastic.  I haven't tried to mix it and put in on bread, I'd rather use my regular peanut butter for that.  But I fully intend to try to concoct some recipes using this powder so I can expand my diet options.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!

review/summary: A "must have" for dieting peanut butter addicts!
review/text: Trying to follow J. Hudson's weight loss success, I have joined the battle of the bulge.  But I have some items in my regular diet that I am not ready to give up yet.  Enter PB2!  I found it while absentmindedly flipping through Amazon grocery products and I am so glad that I did!  I have tried brand after brand of low-fat, reduced-fat, natural, etc. peanut butters and the nutritional information doesn't really vary that much.<br /><br />One brand stood out (Better'n) with half the fat/calories.  But PB2 is HALF of what that was!  Who wouldn't love a rich peanut butter taste for 45 calories???  Tried both the regular and chocolate with FF Cool Whip and it was so yummy.  My husband and I both agreed that we actually like the slight texture that adding the powder to the cream created.  Tonight's dessert will be sugar-free white chocolate pudding with some PB2 in it and we cannot wait.<br /><br />I haven't yet reconstituted it to gauge that, but I am loving the product in it's initial state as something to add to pudding, Cool Whip, smoothies, etc.  The fun is in the limitless options for using it.<br /><br />I am just so amazed that I can get my peanut butter fix for 45 calories (or even less, because 1 TB is more than enough in certain recipes!).<br /><br />I know it's a little pricey versus regular peanut butter, but I certainly don't plan on using it on the kids' sandwiches. :) But for a dieter who wants a peanut butter fix, it's worth every penny.

review/summary: FANTASTIC!!!!
review/text: I am trying to lose weight, and though I love peanut butter, the high fat content has kept me away for the last few months.  I came across this quite by accident, thought about it for a few days after reading reviews, and decided to go ahead an order.  I am SO GLAD I DID!  This stuff is fantastic!!!<br /><br />The cool thing is it's a powder, so you are in control of what consistency you make it.  I started with too much water and it was runny, but tasted great.  I'm thinking this would be good on a dessert type thing, maybe frozen yogurt or my new-found treat, frozen bananas processed in my Vitamix (too cheap to buy the yonana when I already have a Vitamix!).  Then I added some powder and got it the consistency of peanut butter, which was equally good.  Not maybe as creamy rich because it doesn't have the fat, but certainly a worthy substitute.  Finally, I made a batch that was very thick and this was like eating a buckeye.  I had this one made out of the cocoa version and wow!!  It was incredible!!<br /><br />I have already recommended this to about 15 people and it just arrived within the last hour.  I am certainly pleased.<br /><br />The only thing I would add is though the jar appears to be the same size as a standard peanut butter jar in the picture, at 6.5 oz they are really about the size of a parmesan cheese container.  I recommend this actual listing though so you can try both flavors, and if you want to purchase a larger quantity, they are available on Amazon at a lower price.

review/summary: Great product, not a great value.
review/text: This stuff is awesome, but at $7 for a relatively small jar it is very expensive.  Also keep in mind that this powder is very fluffy and will lose a lot of volume when reconstituted.<br /><br />If you take out the entire jar and mix water until it's the consistency of peanut butter, you will wind up with about 1/2 or less the original volume, so 2 jars (at $14) is about the same volume peanut butter as one jar full... ouch.<br /><br />That being said, looking past the outrageous price, the product is GREAT, my two jars ended up being gobbled down in a matter of days.

review/summary: So Good why isn't it Bad???
review/text: After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend!<br />The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else.<br />First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right.<br />Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.<br /><br />It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the "bowl" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked.<br />I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.<br /><br />Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!<br /><br />PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called "netrition.com" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.<br />I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.<br /><br />So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food, Netrition is a whole lot better!

This one is totally nails the taste of real peanut butter so that you arn't missing out on anything.  The chocolate one is just heavenly.  Not too sweet like Nutella, but just right.  Best of all, you can add as much or as little water as you want to get exactly the consistency you like.  You can even add your own peanut pieces, if you want chunky.  You also can make it up in just the quantity you want, so it isn't sitting around as a constant temptation.  Probably has a pretty long shelf life as well, being a powder.

review/summary: Finally! a PB that is as good in my mouth as it is for my waistline!
review/text: I love peanut butter, always have and always will. And as a Peanaholic who is also concerned about calories and the quality of food she puts in her mouth, I have been searching for a nutritional and delicious peanut butter for years. I have tried everything from all natural nut butters to pastes, light butters and almond butters, but have yet to find anything under 180 calories for 2 tbs (which I can double in one sitting).<br /><br />Then I found PB2. I was slightly nervous by the idea of trying powdered peanut butter, but for only 45 calories/serving--why the heck not?<br /><br />DELICOUS! SO YUMMY! Creamy, not chalky, not oily and ALL NATURAL!<br /><br />I will never buy anything else and have already been back to the store to buy more for friends to try! Rave reviews from even the most pickiest little mouths in my house!<br /><br />2 thumbs up!

review/text: This stuff is really good actually! I saw this on Dr. Oz and thought I would try it out. Has a great taste and it is better for you than regular peanut butter. You have to mix it with water so it's not convenient as regular peanut butter, but worth it as a health alternative.

review/text: This product smells and tastes like real peanut butter. My husband did not notice the difference when I made it for Sunday breakfast. The best thing is that my husband started to eat apples (dipping them into PB2) because of this product. I like both PB2: Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter, but the last one is my favorite.

review/text: I was very dissapointed when I received the product and read the ingredients. It lists sugar in both plain and chocolate PB2. There was no proper disclosure of all ingredient on the amazon page. The description lead you to believe that there is nothing else but PB powder from peanuts with cocoa powder added for chocolete taste.

review/summary: Not Peanut Butter, Peanut Flavored Peanut Butter
review/text: I ordered this at the asking of my wife because she is dieting. I was against it from the start, but I will make my review fair.<br />The product is not peanut butter, if you expect peanut butter than you will be disappointed. It tastes like peanut butter. If I could compare it to something it is like eating a regular Oreo and a reduced fat Oreo. The reduced Oreo tastes like and Oreo, but really just leaves you wanting the real thing. This product is no different. If you mask it will jelly and bread, the off taste becomes less noticeable, but there in lies the problem. You have to add more calories back in to make this product taste better. There by negating the fact that you have cut calories. As I explained to my wife after we both decided this product was not for us. The problem with any peanut butter food is normally everything but the peanut butter. The fat is the healthiest part. You wouldn't eat omega free fish because it's lower in fat, why would you do the same to peanut butter?<br />The only way I could recommend this is if you are doing a starvation sort of diet (i.e. you eating this with celery and water). If you are doing a healthy diet don't cut out the peanut butter of your PB&J, cut out the jelly first and then the grain. I eat again "regular" non-hydrogenated peanut butter will celery, now there is a healthy food.<br /><br />Pros<br />+lower calorie<br />+great price here on amazon<br />+does taste similar to peanut butter<br /><br />Cons<br />-less nutritional value<br />-doesn't taste like real peanut butter<br /><br />I will give it four stars if you are doing a starvation sort of diet, which I don't recommend, but it does taste alright for a lot less calories. For everyone else I give it one star as you should not be eating products like this and the product itself is not that good. Overall 2 stars, weighted towards everyone else.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: I had high hopes for this product when I purchased it since everyone was singing its praises.  Some background on me; I don't eat gluten or dairy of any kind.  I have food sensitivities so I'm used to eating things that don't taste great.  I watch my weight and love peanut butter so I thought this would be perfect for me.  I first tried it mixed with a little water like the instructions said.  It was horrible and I didn't eat it.  Next I made the peanut butter cookies on the PB2 website.  They were not good.  I could barely eat one.  I shared it with my dog and she liked it.  Maybe if you make your own dog treats it would work for that.  Lastly, I tried it in my morning protein drink and it was fine.  I may add it from time to time to have some extra protein.  This is the only way I will use it.  I can't believe so many people liked it.

review/text: I heard about this PB2 powdered peanut butter at Weight Watchers and ordered it out of curiosity.  I am no longer curious.  We got the two-pack (regular and chocolate).  You take 2T of the powder and mix it with 1T of water.  It's not bad, but it's definitely not good.  The regular flavor was really thick and pasty.  The chocolate was smoother, but still wasn't that great.  I would prefer to eat the real thing and exercise portion control.  While we're at it, I'm not a fan of baked chips either.

The product is vary good and I will keep using it but I will probably order it elseware. I would not send an open used jar of food to anyone, it was a turn off. I will eat the other jar which was not opened and the taste is really good. If it hadn't been for the open jar I would have given 5 stars and a thumbs up.

review/summary: It's just not that good
review/text: I'm a huge peanut butter fan, and I bought this imagining all of the delicious things I could make with this.  It absolutely failed the first test: eating it by the spoonful.  It just doesn't mix up into good tasting peanut butter.  So how about adding it to flavor other things?  I made some cookies with it, and they weren't very good either.  It provides neither an authentic peanut taste, nor even an authentic ultra-processed peanut butter taste.  So far, the best use I've found for it is mixing it up with yogurt.  That's not bad, but I'm left wondering why?  I was always perfectly content to eat yogurt without peanut butter flavoring, and it didn't actually taste better than the yogurt without it, it just didn't taste worse like everything else I've been flavoring with pb2.

review/summary: No Additives?
review/text: This stuff tastes great! But if you're trying to loose weight, wouldn't it be better if there really weren't any "additives" like sugar and salt?  That way if you wanted to add it yourself, you could control the amount.  Salt can add water weight, and sugar can raise your glycemic index, which can promote weight gain. IMHO peanut butter with no added salt or sugar tastes better. So that's my bias.

review/summary: Not as healthy as it seems.  A peanut butter expert weighs in.
review/text: I purchased this product after reading a raving review of it in Nutrition Action Health Letter which is a newsletter published by the respectable Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI).  They recommend it for being tasty and a healthy (low-cal) alternative to regular peanut butter.<br /><br />[...]<br />(don't let the web address mislead you)<br /><br />I have eaten peanut butter almost every day for the past many decades--usually for breakfast.  The regular version of PB2 actually tastes pretty good.  In fact I'd say it tastes better than some cheaper brands of peanut butter--you know, the oily store brands.  The chocolate version is okay, but it's not as nutty and it's not chocolaty enough to get your chocolate fix.<br /><br />However, I take issue with consuming this alternative for health reasons.  It definitely does have far less fat and calories than regular peanut butter.  However, the fat in quality peanut butter is about half MUFAs or monounsaturated fat.  This is some of the healthiest fat you can consume. The American Heart Association notes that MUFAs are associated with reducing of the "bad" LDL cholesterol.  A little more than a quarter of the fat is also polyunsaturated fat.<br /><br />The sugar content of regular PB2 is the same as Jif for an equivalent serving size.  The chocolate version actually has a little more sugar and a little less protein.  So you give up the healthy fat and keep the refined sugar.<br /><br />2 TBS of PB2 mixed with one TBS of water actually only yields 1.5 TBS of spreadable product.  So while you do save A LOT of calories with PB2 you don't save a lot of calories for very long.<br /><br />The bottom line is this:  Peanut butter can be a very healthy food IF eaten in moderation.  If you buy PB2, you WILL eat it in moderation because you get very little for a lot of money.  If you are trying to severely restrict your calorie intake to lose weight, there might be a place for PB2 in your meal plan.  If you just want to eat healthy, use 2 TBS of normal peanut butter at a time and enjoy it.<br /><br />Finally, a note about the cost:  3 of these 6.5 oz. jars should give you almost as many prepared servings as one 40 ounce jar of regular peanut butter.  So it's roughly 3 times the cost of Jif which is my regular brand in case you hadn't figured that out (crunchy, actually).<br /><br />Read more: [...]

If you enjoy fresh peanut butter, not the store-bought preserved kind (which I like as well), then this is the product you want to be eating!<br /><br />For weight watchers, it is 1 point per serving. It tastes amazing. I thought being powdered, it would be weird. I recall reading a post about it being chalky or something, but it absolutely is not. Unless you don't know how to mix things, maybe.<br /><br />Judge the amount of water to your liking. There is no need to strictly stay with the equal ratio. If you want it creamier, use a bit more water.<br /><br />End of story: this stuff is a miracle, i love it, if you are undecided just try it - you'll be hooked.

review/text: I love peanut butter, I eat too much and it's very fattening. It's one of the foods we have in our home all the time, therefore I eat it all the time. I have tried so many shakes, drinks, mixes, low fat this, low carb that, appetite controllers, bars and diets that I figured this couldn't be any worse, especially given the reviews. It came today and we have made one PB@ & J sammy, one smoothie and one low carb wrap with PB2. A 9 year old, a 21 year old and mom (me) love it. It tastes like peanut butter right out of the jar. We have stuck to the natural peanut butters with no added oil or sugars so the less sweet taste is perfect. If you use sweetened peanut butter, you may find it not sweet enough. I'm never going to buy regular peanut butter ever again. This stuff rocks, try it, you won't be sorry.

review/text: I've never liked peanut butter growing up. My parents never had a lot of money and with four kids we lived off PBJ sandwiches. After you eat something over and over you begin to hate it. Now I'm 21 years old and recently starting dieting. I've lost 55 lbs and still losing. So sometimes when I'm going to work I want to grab a snack that will keep me full and be low on calories. I looked into those 100 calories bars and snack bags. Let me tell you the portions in those things is enough to feed a hamster. I spent the night at my friends house. We ate PBJ sandwiches. Surprising it was really good. After eating diet food for 5-6 months you can amazed how good peanut butter taste to someone who hated it for a long time. It taste like the real thing too and I don't need to go off my diet.<br /><br />If you are a calorie counter here's a way you can spoil your love for PBJ sandwiches.<br />Two slices of Nature's Own White 40 calorie bread - 80 calories<br />Two spoonfuls of PB2 - 45 calories<br />One spoonful of Smuckers Sugar Free Jelly - 10 calories<br /><br />Total: 135 calories for a whole sandwich<br /><br />A regular PBJ sandwich would be:<br />Two slices of white bread - 130+ calories<br />Two tablespoons of peanut butter - 190 calories<br />One tablespoon of regular Jelly - 50 calories<br /><br />Total - 370 calories (ah..)<br /><br />Tell me is it worth it? Well not to me. I eat it almost everyday, I'm now a proud PBJ lover. I bought the chocolate too. But don't buy these inflated prices. It's $3.99 on the Netrition website or $7.98 for both of them plus shipping.

review/summary: PB2 versus PB2 with chocolate
review/text: I'm a peanut butter addict and trying to lose weight, so trying this out was a no-brainer.  I've been using both for about a month now (and yes, I've lost weight).  Initially, I only liked the chocolate one, though it was a tad sweeter than "real" peanut butter.  The plain PB2 did not taste good to me, even when I tried adding a wee bit of real peanut oil to see if that would help.  But after a month of experimenting and adjusting, I have found that mixing the two about half and half comes out just right.  If I want to use it on a sandwich, I add less water; if I want to dip fruit or veggies in it, I add a bit more water.  It has satisfied my desire for peanut butter more than I expected and I can even feed regular peanut butter to my dogs or husband without cheating!  An earlier review mentioned that 2 Tb weighed more than it stated on the label; I only found this to be true if I pack down the powder tightly, so I don't.  2 Tb seems an adequate amount for a sandwich or a snack.  I feel lucky to have found this and just wish our local grocery story would carry it (they're looking into it).  Why only 4 stars?  The plain is not perfect, and the need to mix it each time you want some.  I'll deal with it, though, for guilt-free peanut butter.

I played around and mixed the 2 Tbl. powder with 1 tsp canola oil and 2 tsp of water. The consistancy is perfect and the taste is amazing! Plus, it gives me 1 tsp of my "healthy" oil for the day, as recommended per WW.  Great on crackers, bananas, or any other way that you'd enjoy peanut butter. Definately will be purchasing this again!

I expect that it will very useful when more recipes for this product are developed, but straight up, it doesn't really have a lot of flavor punch.  It's hard to explain, but it really is a decent product, but it just doesn't have the satiation of real peanut butter, and not because it's light, but because it's just kind of lacking in flavor.  I would probably buy it again, but not often.  As I've stated, it's good in recipes.  I made a pudding with it, and it actually turned out pretty good.  It was a recipe that called for cocoa, and I substituted the PB2 powder, and it was tasty.  It's just not that good straight up.  Don't expect a healthier substitute in your PB&J sandwich.

review/summary: PB is great.
review/text: The peanut butter is awesome.  I use it in meal replacement shakes and it tastes just like regular peanut butter without so much fat.  The chocolate peanut butter is terrible!  I made it exactly according to package instructions and used it as a spread on top of a rice cake with sliced bananas.  It was so bad I threw it away.  To rate them individually, the peanut butter gets 5 stars and the chocolate peanut butter 0 stars.

I crave peanut butter and I could eat one serving of it for a snack and be totally satisfied.  compare to regular peanut butter: 180 calories and 16gms fat for 2 tbs.  PB2: 45 calories and 1.5gms fat.  It tastes just like regular peanut butter.  The chocolate one didn't have much chocolate flavor but it tasted okay.  This time around I am just buying the regular flavor.  Yum.  So many things you can use it in.  I can't wait to experiment more.

review/summary: Love PB2 Peanut Butter
review/text: I just recently started a Weight Watchers diet, and I was fortunate enough to come across this product.  Regular peanut butter is 5 points per 2 tbsp.  This peanut butter is only 1 point; and the taste is just as good!  I have made this peanut butter for sandwiches, and to put on top of crackers or rice cakes.  I am able to get my peanut-butter craving in, all while being healthy with it being so low-fat.  It's not hard to make.  I just measure out 2 tbsp of powder in a bowl, add a little bit of water to the consistancy I want, and there I have it!!!<br /><br />I just tried the chocolate peanut butter recently too, putting that on crackers and rice cakes as well.  It was equally as delcious as the PB2 peanut butter.  I'm so happy I discovered this product.  The fact that it's only 1 Weight Watcher point, as opposed to 5, makes up for the price of the product.

review/summary: Great taste, low in fat
review/text: I have tried both the plain and the chocolate flavors, and I like both. I think in a blind taste test, you could probably pick out the "diet" version. It's just a bit less rich than traditional PB. That said, this peanut butter powder mixes up quickly and easily, tastes exactly like peanut butter should, is creamy enough to be satisfying right off the spoon, is much healthier for you than traditional PB, and has no chemicals added to it. They just squeeze the oil out of the roasted peanuts, turning it into a powder with all the fat squeezed out. That's it, no crazy chemicals. The peanuts are grown in the USA, which I also like. I'm a vegetarian who is on the road a lot, and I need healthy non-perishable lunch items. It's great to have a PB sandwich back in the rotation!

review/summary: BEST food discovery of 2012!
review/text: This stuff is AWESOME!  My husband and I love the taste of both the regular peanut butter and the cocoa version.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because it is pricy and because a 2 tablespoon serving of this is not equal to a 2 tablespoon serving of traditional peanut butter (not sure why this is, maybe when the water is added it condenses more??), so we have to double the serving which means the jar doesn't go as far, making it pretty darn expensive.  Still, a double serving of this stuff is 100 cals less than just one serving of traditional... not to mention the fat!  So we're lifetime fans for sure, but we do limit the amount of times we indulge throughout the week because of the cost.

review/summary: PB dream!!!
review/text: At first I was really excited by the nutritional facts and bought the PB2 right away! Upon receiving it I was a little unsure of how to incorporate it into my diet. But you will become more and more creative and figure it out as you go! I use it in my protein shakes which were AMAZING! My fav recipe I've come up with so far is to get a Betty Crocker sugar cookie mix, put about 2 teaspoons of ground flaxseed- which is totally optional if you're not a health nut and just keep that around the house, substitute plain nonfat greek yogurt for the butter and oil (1 cup approx) and sprinkle in the PB2 and bake accordingly! OMG!!!!! The greek yogurt made the so light and fluffy it was ridiculous! Not only are you cutting calories but you've got a delicious fluffy peanut butter cookie that you don't have to feel guilty about! AMAZING! Definitely worth a try if you're curious about using it! :)

review/summary: I'm never going back to traditional peanut butter
review/text: PB2 was recommended to me by a weight watchers leader. I ordered this 2-pack and I love it so much that I've already ordered a pound of the traditional variety! Even my husband (who barely tolerates peanut butter) likes PB2. He says it tastes more like peanuts than traditional peanut butter (and I think he's right).<br /><br />The chocolate variety was originally described to me as "similar to nutella" and unfortunately, I don't think it is. It's just a slightly sweeter, vaguely chocolatey version of the original PB2. It's good, but it will never be as satisfying as nutella.<br /><br />Overall, I love both varieties of PB2. They're best mixed in with other ingredients, like in a PBJ sandwich or in baked goods. My favorite use is to put 2 tablespoons in a berry smoothie, which adds protein and makes it taste like a PBJ. If you try to eat PB2 solo, by the spoonful, you might be disappointed. They are lacking a bit of the richness that makes peanut butter so addictive.<br /><br />Lastly, this stuff is pricier than regular peanut butter (especially when you consider that the powder is fluffy and it loses volume when you mix it with water), but I think it's well worth the cost.

review/summary: Miraculous...
review/text: Peanut butter is a trigger food of mine - once I start eating it, it's tough to stop - so it's been banned from home for the past 6 months or so while I've been trying to lose weight. Recently, though, I've missed the flavor and started researching low-cal substitutes and came across the excellent reviews for PB2.<br /><br />I'm SHOCKED at how good this is. Not only does it taste good for 1/4 the calories of regular PB, but there's nothing artificial in the ingredients at all. Just peanuts, sugar, and salt! And 5g of protein and 2g of fiber! I've never been so excited about a food in my life!<br /><br />A few things I've learned in the few days I've enjoyed my PB2:<br />- The chocolate is a bit sweeter. I find the regular PB2 a little bit plain but one packet of Truvia per 2 Tbsp fixes it for me.<br />- The ratio of 2 Tbsp PB2 to 1 Tbsp water does make it a bit runny for my tastes. A little less water can get you a pretty normal PB consistency.<br />- It can be messy. The powder is so light it seems I'm losing it all over the place. Use a narrow measuring spoon.<br /><br />I do agree with others that this is an expensive product, but I'm finding if you shop around a bit and buy in bulk (which I totally plan to do next time) the price comes down considerably. It will never be as cheap as regular PB, but I'm okay paying an extra quarter or so per serving to save 135 cals and still have PB in my life.

When I first tried it, I used my spoon to dig up some of the powder and attempted to eat it like that. Not a good idea lol. Since it's in powder form, it will clump in your mouth if eaten dry. No problem! I have found that I can sprinkle it on my jelly for pb&j sandwiches. It also tastes great mixed in with low fat cottage cheese with a bit of jelly  strirred in as well. I HIGHLY recommend this product. As a matter of fact, I'm about to order some more!

review/text: People have their opinion but I like it.  I add some Truvia to is and it's cool.  you have to play with the water to make thicker but I can get pass that.  I am on a mission and you can't have it all.  The flavor is great and it tastes like peanuts because it is.  what more could I ask!

review/summary: YUM
review/text: I've been hearing recommendations for PB2 for quite some time, but I couldn't find it in my local stores. I finally broke down and ordered it here.<br /><br />If you're into things like smoothies or cooking with peanut butter, this is a great product! It significantly cuts down the calories and fat without forgoing taste.<br /><br />I think for straight up eating the texture leaves a bit to be desired. So if you're looking for an alternative for your PB&J sandwich, give ONE container a shot and see what you think before spending too much for a bunch.<br /><br />As for the "cocoa" flavored version - it isn't overly chocolatey.

review/summary: Powdered Peanut butter
review/text: Exactly as descibed.  tastes great, easy to mix. TSA approved for air travel as a carry on.  Not certain about regular peanut butter and didn't want to take the chance of losing it.  There is sugar in it which is the only other thing besides peanuts.<br /><br />I like it!

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: I bought this because I love peanut butter and all the good reviews. Holy cow this stuff is terrible. I feel like I got totally riped off as it is very expensive. Maybe its good in recipes but mixed with water and eaten on a cracker its terrible. I guess Ill stick to fruit for my low fat snacks.

review/summary: In a word... WOW!
review/text: I have tried both, the regular and the chocolate and I think I may be the first person to prefer the regular lol. The chocolate is ok, but I am not a fan of dark chocolate, which this reminds me of. I would be willing to say that the regular is about as close to peter pan peanut butter as I have tasted and that is probably my favorite peanut butter. I will also say this, If someone made you a PB&J sandwich with this, you would be very hard pressed to tell that this was a low fat, low calorie peanut butter. I use the regular and Walden Farms zero calorie, zero carb grabe jelly for a very nice, guilt free PB&J sandwich. I am extremely pleased with the original and will buy it in a bigger quantity when I run out!

review/text: This product is awesome. It works extremely well in shakes and very well as a spread. It saves a ton of calories without sacrificing flavors! I love it in oatmeal or in peanut sauces for Thai style dishes!

review/summary: AWESOME!! BUY!!
review/text: Its amazing. Its not quite as sweet as regular PB but I enjoy it just the same!! For only 45 calories it is worth it!! I haven't had peanut butter in 2 years because its not worth the calories and now all I eat is PB and J sandwiches, PB apples, celery with PB...the list goes on. I am in heaven. Buy it and you won't regret it!

review/summary: better than so-so....unbelievably awesome!
review/text: The following review I wrote last week.  The title was  "better than so so" --without the awesome part which I just added. In the week I have had the product I have found a new use that totally makes the product beyond spectacular at least for me.  So here is the "original" review--oh at that time I gave it 3 stars:<br />I bought this product based on a review in "Nutrition in Action" magazine, supplemented by the positive reviews here.  Having been in the Army for 20 years I'm used to the "Unusual Presentation of Usual" foods.  While I would still give this product a positive review..you will NOT mistake this product for peanut butter!  Yes, it's peanut buttery, convenient, and calorie saving.  It is not however cheap. and as a slim athletic guy, I don't need to count calories so much--so this will NOT be my go to product for PB.  I like the concept, but realistically it has an unusual "mouth feel".  Somebody else said, if you want to use it on a PB&J sandwich you will be disappointed.  I agree.  Also--I was disappointed by putting it on celery,  and if you let it set out after mixing for an hour or so the texture becomes very "set up".  Still, If you're craving a tablespoon of PB it IS worth a try, and the chocolate one is better..kinda like mixing Nutella with PB..but not quite as good.<br />OK--that was the original review--I had tried the chocolate by itself, and it doesn't have a huge chocolate taste but it's there--anyway, I decided to use the chocolate with celery, and what a better stirrer than the celery stick.  Anyway, when the chocolate and celery comes together there is magic, and it totally elevates this product to a new level.  The chocolate peanut butter, placed in the celery rib after stirring is like eating chocolate frosting from the bowl without the guilt! It is such a nutritious, filling, guilt free snack--I'm sold!
