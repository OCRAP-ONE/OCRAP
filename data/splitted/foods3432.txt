review/summary: Great 70% bar
review/text: Green & Black's bars are broken up into small, thick rectangles, which I'm not a big fan of because I like to nibble at flatter squares of chocolate, as opposed to those who like to break off the chunk and put in the mouth whole.  That being said, I really enjoy this 70% bar!  This bar is a great break from the extremely high fat content of the 85% bar (15g as opposed to 25g!), but still rich and has a beautiful chocolate taste with a wine-y undertone.  I usually don't go below 80% cacao content of chocolate bars because I believe the lower percentages are too sweet, but I do like to have this bar on occasion, and it's one of my favorite plain chocolate bars in the 70% range.

review/summary: Mmmmmm, Yum!
review/text: Not too long ago, my wife picked up a bar of Green & Black's Milk Chocolate. To make a long story short, It was the best milk chocolate either of us had ever tasted. I've always preferred dark chocolate to milk chocolate, but the Green & Black's milk chocolate came very close to being a dark chocolate, in my opinion.<br /><br />Well, the next time we returned to the store to pick up another bar we noticed they also had Green & Black's Organic Dark Chocolate (70 % cocoa, almost twice that of the milk chocolate bar). My mouth watered at the thought.<br /><br />Mmmmmm. Yum! This stuff is incredible! It's not sweet, at all. But it's not really bitter either. It's just so (how can I say it?)  chocolatey! Sorry, but I'm at a loss for words. Let's just say, it's the best dark chocolate I've ever tasted. It's rather hard and the bar snaps when you bite into it, but when you chew it just floods your mouth with a deep, dark chocolate flavor. You have to be something of a dark-chocolate fan to enjoy this. My wife says it's good, for example, but she still prefers the milk chocolate. If you're a dark chocolate lover, give this a try! Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Great dark chocolate at a great price
review/text: This is one of the best dark chocolates I have ever eaten in my life. And I have been trying them for most of my 59 years. (What a incomplete world it would be if the only vendors of dark chocolate were Hershey and Nestle!)<br />It is smooth, with a unique flavor. There are some fruity flavors in there, and not too bitter.<br />The smoothness property is probably the biggest selling point, as so many of the brands of dark choclate are almost waxy in their consistency.<br />The main reason I bought this is that the price from the vendor was excellent, even with some shipping expense.<br />I highly recommend this chocolate. Search around for a local retailer and buy one bar, and you will be very pleased if, like me, you love dark chocolate.

review/summary: Best chocolate bar I've ever tasted
review/text: I pretty much try every chocolate I ever see, and have attended the Austin Chocolate Festival from the second year onwards, and green & blacks is my utmost favorite. Head & shoulders above the rest. Plus, its organic & fair trade, so I can justify the price to myself (what a steal on amazon though, retail is about $3.99 a bar at whole foods or other comparable retailers). The few times I have been willing to part with enough of it to cook with, the resulting dishes, especially the dark chocolate cheesecake, were astounding. I'll keep sampling when I get the chance, but I doubt I'll ever find anything to beat my incumbent favorite.

review/summary: Horribly bitter...but yeah, chocolatey
review/text: I love dark chocolate. I don't even bother with milk chocolate much since I turned 40, cause dark is where it's at!<br /><br />I love Valrhona, and I've also bought other high end chocolates over the past decade over at my gourmet shop or Fresh Market. I even love those chocolate truffles that are the store brand at Whole Foods (365 brand). But I've been moving into organic foods (and preferably local when possible) over the last year plus. One of the things I decided to do was try to replace my fave chocolate snacks with equivalent ORGANIC ones, including chocolate cookies.<br /><br />Well, I tried this high cocoa content of Green and Black's and their Mint Chocolate bar. I threw out both before I finished them. Neither did it for me.<br /><br />I really find them to be highly bitter. Not bitter as in the normal bitterness that a high cocoa content has. A really unpleasant bitterness, like coffee that's sat too long in the carafe.<br /><br />I've tried a couple other organic chocolates I picked at random at Whole Foods and have yet to find one that makes me go, "yes, this is it!"  Green and Black's 70% is soooo not it.<br /><br />So, FWIW, that has been my experience with G&B, which as you can see differs from the previous commenters who love it. YMMW.<br /><br />Back to Valrhona.<br /><br />Mir

review/summary: My Favorite Dark Chocolate
review/text: I'm not really a dark chocolate snob - will eat just about any brand as long as it's in the 70% range but this has become my favorite. It has almost a milk chocolate consistency with a dark chocolate taste which is very different from the "drier" dark chocolate taste that other brands have.  It's very smooth and rich tasting with just a touch of bitterness in the background.<br /><br />Not sure if there is a cheaper way to buy this on amazon.  I used to get it here, but found out that Target has it for about the same price - and sometimes on sale for $2.50 a bar.

review/summary: Beware health conscious/milk residue intolerant
review/text: Everything I've ever read says adding milk negates antioxidant benefits.  They bind to protein.  Green and Blacks adds Milk Powder to everything, including their dark bars.  Unfortunately, if you want the real benefits of chocolate, it has to be raw (never heated over 118) and organic and you're going to pay through the nose.  I recommend Chocolatl available in the raw refrigerator section of your local Whole Paycheck ($8.50 for 3oz of Chocolatl is paying through the nose to me) or finding something else truly raw and unprocessed on Amazon.  You can get the raw cacao nibs from Navitas on Amazon for much less than whole foods, but the nibs taste like a**.  Look, I love the flavor of these, they're organic, which is nice, and if you're just out for the flavor, these are great candy bars, but don't think you're getting any benefit.<br /><br />As a side note, I actually wrote to Green and Blacks to (basically complain) ask why they'd add milk powder to their dark chocolate and they literally told me it was *residue* and they had to list it.  My Bull**** meter went off immediately, because why wouldn't they just state that "made in a facility that also processes milk" or such like, but no, they claimed the ingredient was listed as a result of irremovable residue.  Yeah...ok to me that's just disgusting.  And since when can't milk residue be removed?  How many years worth is built up at Green and Blacks?  It was both disgusting and literally unbelievable at the same time that they'd think that explanation was preferable to just saying "hey, we put milk powder in our stuff; deal with it".  Anyway, if you buy this, I hope you enjoy your irremovable milk residue chocolate.  :)

review/summary: Dark chocolate lovers beware
review/text: I never write reviews but this chocolate is so terrible I felt I needed to warn people away from this stuff.<br /><br />First, I was taken aback by the presence of soy.  It's really not needed, but whatever.<br /><br />Second, and more importantly, I'm not even certain there is actually cocoa in this.  I sure as heck didn't taste any.  My mouth was overwhelmed in a horrid menagerie of sweetness, alcohol, and a weird bitter fruity aftertaste.  In fact, I'm still trying to rid my mouth of the fruity aftertaste.  The sweetness is very overpowering for a 70% (supposedly) cacao bar, and worse of all it comes with an alcohol sting.  You know those sugar free diabetic chocolates?  Yeah, like that.  Yuckity yuck yuck.<br /><br />The aftertaste is...man, bad.  Really bad.  There are no adjectives in the English language to describe it.  Artificial fruit flavoring made by Satan...something like that.  With this nasty fruit taste comes the bitterness, but it isn't good bitter (like you find in cocoa) it is nightmarish.<br /><br />I don't know who is in charge of making this stuff, but I really think someone should lock them up.  5150 them.  They are, most likely, criminally insane.  This bar is a travesty.<br /><br />I'd really like to find an organic and fair trade substitute for my regular bar of chocolate; Lindt 90%.  I really expected this to be on par in quality (obviously a lot sweeter at only 70%) but instead I got a disgusting taste in my mouth and a stomachache.<br /><br />I seriously can't get over the fact that I tasted no cocoa.  How does this chocolate have so many rave reviews?  I must have fallen into a bizzaro universe where people throw ducks at balloons and nothing is what it seems.

review/text: This product arrived in a timely fashion and was packaged very securely. The actual candies themselves were a little hard for my tastes and the flavor was somewhat less than expected. To be fair, I had a completely different candy in mind when I purchased these, so when they arrived as a gift for a friend, I had to wait until they were opened to check them out. I was hoping for the thicker, very chewy fruit candies that I have purchased before in smaller quantities, so this error was mine. If you like this type of candy, I think you will be happy w/ your purchase.

For what it is, I'm completely satisfied and will happily keep it on my shopping list.

review/summary: Tastes pretty good but I wouldn't make this a meal staple
review/text: I love Indian food and I wish I had time to prepare it from scratch.  I purchased this product at my local Indian grocery store.  Taste wise, it is pretty good.  Nutritionally, this is not the best product. I would recommend it as a side item at a meal or a special treat.<br /><br />The product picture that is posted is not really representative of what you see when you heat the product.  The okra has been pretty much flattened - it has no rectangular shape whatsoever - and is stringy and mixed in with a relatively thick sauce (about the consistency of tomato paste).  So the picture really should be a red-brown sauce with stringy greens.  If you are a person bent on aesthetics, I don't think this would be the product for you.  I ate my Bhindi Masala over basmati rice.  It tasted pretty good but I noticed a saltiness to the product.  I love salt and for me to say that a product is salty is a rare occurrence.  The box indicates that this product is hot but I did not find the product to be overly hot.  I did not down a glass of water after one bite but the intensity may has been subdued slightly by the rice I ate the product with.<br /><br />MTR's Bhindi Masala is packaged in the ever popular pouch inside of a box. I don't really like pouches because the contents are usually difficult to remove.  True to my previous experience with pouches, I had to use a spatula to remove the contents that had stuck to the pouch's walls.  Another reason for my disdain of pouches is they are not typically recyclable.<br /><br />Each container of this product has two servings.  I think if you are pairing it with naan, vegetables, or rice that the two serving assessment is accurate and it could feed two people.<br /><br />I would not call this a health food.  My box has slightly different nutritional facts that those posted on Amazon.  My box indicated that the product has high fat content (20 grams per box), high saturated fat (6 grams per box) and high salt content(1152 mg per box).  Additionally, the product has 316 calories, 6 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber per box.<br /><br />Ingredients: ladies finger (52%), water, onion, tomato puree (7%), milk, refined sunflower oil, cashewnut, salt, sugar, butter, ginger paste, ghee (clarified butter), green chili (2%), garlic paste, fenugreek leaves<br /><br />Allergy info:  This product contains milk products, cashewnut and may contain traces of other nuts.<br /><br />This product is vegetarian.<br /><br />This is a product of India.<br /><br />While I like this product, I don't think I would buy a high number of this product at one time unless I had someone to split the order with; the product tastes good but the nutritional content makes it something that I would eat with lesser frequency.

review/text: Let me start by saying that I LOVE okra.  I grew up eating okra dishes my mom made and I can't get enough.  I'm also lazy, so when I saw that I could get pre-made okra in a box, I had to try it.  There are a bunch of other MTR boxes I've tried and some (like the pongal) are actually pretty good.<br /><br />The Bhindi Masala was terrible.  First, there is almost no okra in the box at all.  There is an occasional bit of green floating around, but for the most part, the package is full of some dark brown sludge that looks like an oil spill.  Second, you can probably guess why the sludge looks like so oily...the package has a ridiculous amount of fat.  I thought that veggies were supposed to be healthy!<br /><br />Regardless, try some other MTR boxes.  Bhindi Masala is definitely one to skip.  Anyone out there want the remaining boxes from my 10-Pack?

All one needs to do is heat and serve.<br /><br />As I do not usually have the time to make rice, I have found a way to enjoy the Kurma, which is authentic, Indian cuisine, anytime I like at home.<br /><br />My suggestion:<br />I do not like to microwave food, so I do the following: dice yellow or green squash aka zucchini (about 2 cups raw) in about 4 tablespoons of water in a 12" fying pan.  When squash is cooked in a few moments, open the pouch of wonderful Navratan Kurma, the mildest Indian entree that is tasty for anyone who enjoys a mild sauce with vegetables, and in a few moments, you have dinner for two.  Less than 250 calories a serving.  Not mushy!

review/summary: Heavenly
review/text: If you don't like very dark chocolate, I doubt you'll like this - it's very dark and far more bitter than sweet.<br /><br />However, I DO like dark chocolate, and I love coffee, so I thought these bars were amazing.  You pop a piece in your mouth and get an immediate burst of espresso - the dark, strong coffee taste is outstanding.  As the chocolate starts to melt, the coffee flavor is replaced with bitter, decadent chocolate.<br /><br />This is a great deal, especially if you're planning on keeping all 10 bars to yourself (like I do).  A little piece of one bar goes a very long way.  I should warn you, though - these bars are definitely caffeinated!  If I ate a whole one, I'd be lit up for a week (and I drink coffee like it's my job, so it takes more than a little caffeine to get me going).<br /><br />I would definitely get these again.

review/text: GREEN & BLACK'S ORGANIC DARK CHOCOLATE, ESPRESSO IS SOME OF THE FINEST CHOCOLATE THAT I HAVE EVER TRIED. THE ESPRESSO BEANS HAVE BEEN SO INCREDIBLY FINE GROUND THAT THERE IS NO GRAINY TEXTURE AT ALL. THE CHOCOLATE FLAVOUR IS VERY INTENSE WITH A PLEASANT BITTER FINISH THAT IS WELL COMPLEMENTED BY THE ESPRESSO. THIS IS A FINE CHOCOLATE FOR SAMPLING ALONE AND USED IN COOKING AND BAKING. MY HUSBAND AND I ALSO TRIED "GREEN & BLACK'S" WHITE CHOCOLATE WHICH WE FOUND TO BE EXTREMELY TERRIFIC ALSO. THIS IS A "GROWN-UP" CHOCOLATE FOR A MORE REFINED EXPERIENCE. ENJOY!

review/summary: Not 100% organic
review/text: These bars have fantastic flavor.  You don't want to eat them just before bed, though, because you get a double jolt of caffeine - from the chocolate and from the coffee.  I had some of these bars before I learned to read labels very carefully and check every single ingredient.<br /><br />Most people do not realize that "certified organic" is not necessarily 100% organic. The law only requires that 95% of the ingredients be organic.<br /><br />Note that the soy lecithin listed on the ingredients is NOT specified as organic. I personally do not want to be eating genetically modified soy OR the horrendously high level of pesticide and herbicide chemicals that go on GMO plants. This is why I gave these bars only a 3 star rating.  In other words, you may choose to eat them.  I do not.<br /><br />There are brands of excellent organic chocolate which do not contain lecithin at all and are still 'meltingly' delicious.  A couple examples: Vivani 72% dark and Theo 85%.

review/summary: Good gluten-free bread
review/text: This is my current favorite gluten-free bread. The slices are thinner than the Brown Rice or White Rice varieties and, in my opinion, it requires less toasting to make it palatable. (For my tastes, a light toasting is required.)It does stick together some and can be crumbly. The advantage with this variety is that, because it is so thin, if two pieces are stuck together, you can actually pop them both in the same toaster slot. After they are toasted a little bit, they come apart easily.

review/summary: Good toasted.
review/text: This is actually pretty good as a bread substitute - it's not going to replace fresh focaccia, breadsticks, bagels or croissants - but it will give you a good piece of toast. I can't stand it unless it's toasted (try at your own peril!), but am otherwise pretty happy with this as a gluten, dairy, egg, and soy free option. (Anything fitting that criteria is a win for me, so I'm a bit jaded)<br /><br />It's shelf stable until opened, but once in the refrigerator can get crumbly, fussy, and delicate. If you put in the time to gently pry the slices apart and toast them you should be pretty happy with the results.<br /><br />Weird side note: After toasting, if I put the bread on a plate it seems to "steam" itself and get soggy if I don't nudge it around or prop it up to cool initially.<br /><br />The description didn't have ingredients, here are the ingredients listed on the Ener G Foods site as of 08/30/2012: Ingredients: Filtered Water, Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, High Oleic Safflower Oil, Pear Juice Concentrate, Bamboo Fiber, Yeast, Methylcellulose, Guar Gum, Orange Citrus Fiber, Salt, Calcium Phosphate, Baking Powder (Glucono Delta Lactone, Calcium Carbonate & Magnesium Carbonate).

review/summary: Great for adding sour flavour
review/text: I ordered this when I discovered that citric acid is the primary ingredient in Wyler's Light, a low-calorie drink mix, with the intention of making my own substitute by combining it with sucralose (Splenda). Although this worked, producing a sort of lemonade-flavored low-calorie drink, it turned out to be not economical due to the price of sucralose. However, I've found that it's still great to use citric acid to add tanginess to Wyler's Light flavours that I don't find quite sour or lemony enough, such as the raspberry flavour. With this particular container I usually remove the top entirely when using it so I can use a large spoon and measure out the amount I want precisely using a kitchen scale.

review/summary: The Peppermint Room
review/text: Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

review/summary: Refreshing and wholesome!
review/text: This is Celestial Seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf, which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension, soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

review/summary: Good Gift for Coffee Fanatics
review/text: I bought this sampler for my Mother and she loved it. This is a woman who does not function without two or three pots of coffee a day so she knows her coffee. As for me, I am not much of a coffee drinker but I tried most of the flavors and thought that they were very good without being overly strong. We got about two pots (8 to 12 cups) per bag without the coffee being too watered down. Definitely a hit with any coffee drinkers in your life. I sprung for the gift wrapping and was not disappointed. Be warned though, the box it is shipped in will have the name of the company and what is inside of it, so if you are trying to surprise someone maybe have it shipped to a friends house first. Otherwise very happy with the product.

review/summary: Pretty good tea with some caveats
review/text: I bought this Fruit Quartet recently thinking it would be nice for making iced tea.<br /><br />After reading the other reviews, I was particularly interested in trying out the Lemon/Lime variety.  You have to be careful with this flavor more than the others.  Let it steep past 3 minutes and it will taste somewhat bitter and medicinal.<br /><br />My favorites are the Peach/Passionfruit and the Strawberry.  I've had the P/P both hot and cold and it's very nice.  Have only had the Strawberry iced.<br /><br />The Black Currant doesn't have much BC flavor to me.  I find I prefer the Twinings version of this one.<br /><br />I do love the packaging.  The foil packets are beautiful and if you want to put teas out for guests to choose from, they make a lovely presentation.<br /><br />All in all, good tea, but all are strong and care must be taken not to let them steep too long.  I normally steep my tea for 4 minutes, but on these, 3 minutes is the maximum.<br /><br />I had a hard time deciding between a 3 and 4-star rating on this one.  I would give it 3.5 if I could.

review/text: This is the second Kay's product I have tried the first was the Nacho Cheese chips , which in my opinion were overly seasoned. I was reluctant to try a product again but glad I did.<br />I had RNY and was looking for a semi-health snack with protein. This fit the bill. I use these more of a quick breakfast with a side of greek yogurt. It is filling and I can barely finish a whole packet. I usually will freeze it and it's a nice cool snack with the leftovers.<br />It has a good light flavor, that does not overpower your taste buds. It is a bit dry but that is kinda the nature of these protein infused snacks/foods. I just love the crunch and it's nice to have that back again. I would compare it to a very weak golden graham with the consistency of a mini wheat without the stringy kinda mini wheat texture (if that makes sense at all, ha!)<br /><br />I have also started using this as a breakfast cereal. Adding it to soy milk with a little banana. It does get soggy in a few minutes but I still find it quite tasty as a high protein ceral in the morning. If you have ever had Quaker Oats "Crunchy Corn Bran" cereal, the consistency is similar to that once it is sitting in milk.

review/summary: Gluten free - low cal - high protein treat
review/text: From my wife Sarah: I enjoy the flavor and crunchy texture, and this product is great if you're:<br /><br />1. ON A DIET - I love the 1 ounce packs. They're portable and only 110 calories which is great for a snack or meal replacement if you're keeping low calories and you're out of the house. I find that by the end of the bag I'm very satisfied.<br /><br />2. LOOKING FOR A LOW CARB TREAT - I carry protein bars too, but these have crunch and it's oh so satisfying as a treat. They have a pleasant sweet flavor, and they feed my munch cravings. They only contain 15 carbs but when you subtract the 3 fiber grams that's 12 carbs, which for me is reasonable.<br /><br />3. EATING GLUTEN FREE - Speaks for itself!<br /><br />4. ON A LOW SUGAR DIET - Only 3 grams of sugar, and they don't contain the sweeteners that cause a laxative effect.<br /><br />5. NEEDING PROTEIN - 10 grams of protein makes this product a good pick-me-up.<br /><br />I recommend this product, and I think Amazon has a reasonable price - better than what they charge locally and on some other sites I saw. I have Amazon Prime so I don't pay additional shipping, so that helps keep it reasonable.

Case arrived in good condition.  More expensive by 20-30% than can purchase Friskies 5.5 oz cans locally even with no sales tax and free Amazon Prime shipping, but selection locally is so limited.<br /><br />If you can get locally, check price and you can probably save $3-$4 per case.

review/summary: I Love French Cheese!
review/text: As much as my family and I love cheese from Italy and Spain, we love French cheese more.  France is a country that produces more than 100 cheeses, so it must have been difficult to choose only four for this assortment, but in my opinion, four of the very best were chosen.<p>We are all watching our weight at my house, so we eat a lot of salads.  While cheese is definitely not a &quot;diet food,&quot; a little in a salad goes a long way, especially when you're using Buche Chevre.  My children love it on crackers as well.<p>My wife and I reserved the chaource and the epoisses for a &quot;wine and cheese&quot; party, but believe me, they are so wonderful and so special, you'll be tempted to eat them anytime, party or not.<p>The Gruy&egrave;re de Comt&eacute; is just so special I can't really find words to describe it.  It's rich.  It's creamy.  It's delectable.  We often eat it as a dessert cheese.  Yes, it's really that good!<p>If you're looking for a special gift, you can't go wrong with this French Cheese Assortment.  These are four of the finest cheese France has ever produced.

review/summary: Excellent cheeses, ok service
review/text: The French cheese assortment is amazing. A selection of cheeses of a quality you cannot easily come by unless you have a great specialty gourmet store nearby. The Saint Andre is not my favorite type of cheese, but it is good on a nice loaf of crusty bread. The other cheeses in the selection are outstanding and I have received rave reviews from everyone I have served them to. Only negative is that they came extremely hot (even though they were in a cooler-type box with an ice pack that I assume had at one time been cold) and the softer cheeses were really melted. They still tasted great, but weren't as nice for presentation.

review/summary: Hit and Miss
review/text: I received the four cheeses and was somewhat dissapointed because although I enjoyed 3 of the cheeses, only 2 of those 3 were meant to be served as a cheese platter (vs for cooking on the 3rd).  The fourth was horrendous and I ended up throwing it away (4 other guests of mine tasted it and agreed that it was not good - we could all tell that it was not spoiled and that it was simply not a good choice for an assortment).  I also agree that the assortment should have come with more information about the cheeses themselves along the lines of:  You have selected this assortment, cheese names, background, taste descriptions, and serving suggestions (food and wine pairings both).  All in all, one of the four cheeses was good enough to add to a watch out list so that I can hope to find it again while shopping at a local store.

review/summary: Absolutely REVOLTING!
review/text: I had really high hopes for MTR products, given the high reviews I've seen on Amazon. I bought a 5-pack of this vegetable mix, and it's just disgusting. I am very passionate about Indian cooking, and cook Indian food at least 4 times a week (and am an Indian myself). Firstly, MTR seems to use the exact same sauce base for all the curries (I bought the Paneer Makhani and it has the same revolting flavor base), and the sauce is just not right! If you tell me that it has Indian flavors, I won't disagree with you. But Indian spices need to be used better - they must be matured properly by cooking them off in hot oil, adding aromatics in the right amounts, etc. And the vegetables were semi-raw, with no flavors inside the veggies .. all in all, it can be a poor man's emergency meal, but no way on earth does it even REMOTELY deserve the number of stars it has! Very very bad food indeed .. =(

The Pinot Noir is the best, then Chardonnay, the Rose is okay.  I like it because it is not super sweet.<br /><br />I tried (nearly) all the non-alcoholic wine, they were terrible.

review/summary: The best Columbian Coffee, but less coffee & higher price
review/text: I have reviewed this product before when they were the same coffee, 3 tubs, bigger size, same price.  This is a 5 star coffee.  We have tried every Columbian coffee we can find, just because for some reason, we like the flavor of Columbian coffee, no idea why.  But from the highest end coffee to the cheapest coffee we could find, this was by far our favorite, Folgers Gourmet Lively Columbian is not the same, and it doesn't come close to being as good.<br /><br />We've been drinking this specific coffee for years now (though at times we are forced to drink something else because nobody can keep it in stock) all the local stores run out constantly of Folgers Columbian. It's hardly ever in stock and we buy as much as we can.  We have the same problem with Amazon.  It's rarely in stock, when it is in stock there's always only 1,2, or 3 left, I get the email that it's in stock and that very day it says "only -- left in stock".  The worst part that makes me really mad and I don't know if it's Folgers ripping me off or Amazon but I'm really really mad that they are charging over $35 ($30 for subscribe and save - which I did, but it will probably get cancelled because they will run out of stock )for a much smaller (27.9oz) size tub than before (34.5oz)-6.6 oz less per tub - 19.8oz less for $4 more (or for the same price with S&S).<br /><br />THEN COMPARE CURRENT PRICES FOR OTHER FLAVORS: 6+oz less per tub for Columbian, over 18 oz less coffee for the same brand different flavor on the same day from the same store-AMAZON, and it is not currently in stock at my grocery stores locally so I'm stuck paying this outrageous price or changing coffee, which I have tried before and might have to try again by the looks of things.<br /><br />3 tubs of Foldgers Columbian 27.8oz each for $35 (or $30 subscribe & save)<br /><br />OR<br /><br />3 tubs Folgers Classic Roast 33.9oz each for $31.64 (regular price, not subscribe and save)<br /><br />Is Folgers charging more for Columbian and therefore AMAZON is charging more for less coffee than I used to get for the same price/sometimes less?  OR since Amazon has it flying off the shelves, they can sell the smaller tubs for the same price as they used to charge for the bigger tubs or only stock the smaller tubs and then sell them for the same price as the other flavors because it is SUCH a popular flavor?  Folgers still makes the large tubs of Columbian because I just bought them two weeks ago when my local store had a whopping two tubs in stock, for the price I am now paying for the small tub.<br /><br />Just last year, I repeatedly bought from AMAZON 3 tubs of Folgers Columbian 34.5oz each for $31.24 (regular price, not subscribe and save)<br /><br />Now I get 27.8 oz for $35/$30 for 3 tubs - that's 6.7 oz LESS FOR THE SAME PRICE BUT THE OTHER FLAVORS ARE STILL AT THE CHEAPER PRICE.  I just want to know who decided to rip off all the people who are paying for this coffee to fly off the shelves - Folgers themselves or Amazon? and IS THERE SOME LEGITIMATE REASON OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S POPULAR SO IF YOU CAN CHARGE US MORE MONEY FOR LESS PRODUCT, YOU MIGHT AS WELL.<br /><br />I am a HUGE FAN of AMAZON and have never had any problems here for many years, they have excellent, personalized customer service and make most things easier and most of the time cheaper than anywhere else.  The only problems I've read about from other people seem to be from outside/independent sellers, so I'm trying to be open minded that maybe it's Folgers, not Amazon but I am really angry that the price is (in my opinion) SKYROCKETING, for what seems to be just because they can, with no consideration for loyal Folgers and loyal Amazon customers by one company or both.<br /><br />I know, I know, I should just buy some other coffee - absolutely, it's our choice which coffee we buy, at least as long as we have a free country. I am completely against price fixing, and believe in a democratic society where the free market is a free market and businesses exist for the sole purpose of employing people and making a profit, otherwise they would all be non-profit agencies and/or charities and not employ very many people etc.  But none of that stops me from wanting to know WHY?<br /><br />If Amazon's price didn't go up, I don't think mine should by such a huge margin,or raise all the coffee a little instead of jacking up one flavor to make up for the increased cost of all coffee/production and if it's not costing Folger's this huge amount more to make the coffee, then why does it cost me that much more? Or does it suddenly cost that much more to make only Folger's brand Columbian coffee?<br /><br />Dare I ask, is Columbian coffee suddenly skyrocketing because we didn't sign the free trade agreement with Columbia? I really want to know what the heck is going on so I can start adjusting to the ridiculous price increase, or start all over again trying to find a new decent Cup Of Coffee, last time it was out of stock everywhere, I tried 8 different kinds of coffee and none of them held up.<br /><br />My rant is officially over, I need to go make another pot of coffee.  Hopefully when I come back, it won't cost more than diamonds. Just writing the review has inspired me to get to the bottom of this!<br /><br />Bottom line - great coffee, recent price jump knocks of two stars.

review/text: $42 for a 3 pack???  You can currently get these on the website for America's Largest Retailer in a 2 pack for $18.  The pricing on this coffee has been getting more and more ridiculous over the last two years.

review/summary: Absolutely the best!
review/text: Folgers is hands down the best coffee I have ever tasted.  Full, rich aroma and taste to match!  It's expensive, but much less than some of the boutique coffees out there that don't come close to Folgers Colombian flavor.

review/text: Folgers never puts its Columbian blend on sale!  I found it on Amazon for a good price and free shipping through their subscription plan!  I really enjoy this blend and would hate to have to find a replacement!

review/text: I was looking for a coffee to drink because my Yuban organic was out of stock, so I got this to see if we liked it better, I love the taste and wonderful smell of the Folgers, it would be nice if Folgers could offer an organic alternative, we will be going back to Yuban Organic pesticide free, but we are enjoying the wonderful aroma of our Folgers in the morning for now.

review/summary: Great Tasting Coffee
review/text: I have been drinking Folgers Colombian coffee since I first moved to the US over 10 years ago.  I tried some of the other mass-produced coffees first but couldn't find one that I liked.  I was thrilled to find this one.  It tastes perfect to me.  I had stopped buying it when the price in my local supermarket kept creeping up so I was really happy to find it on Amazon (Subscribe and Save) cheaper than my local supermarket. That is an added bonus. The only reason that I gave it four stars is that there are better coffees out there (in my opinion), just not for the same price.

review/summary: Folgers Columbian Ground Coffee
review/text: Folgers Columbian Ground Coffee is so expensive in our local supermarket, I decided to check out Amazon for prices since we have ordered whole coffee beans before and had good luck with that.  Wow!  The coffee is $5.00 cheaper through Amazon than in our town and I got FREE shipping, too!  I love Columbian coffee but I never find it on sale anymore so I was very pleased to find it at Amazon for such a good price.  I have signed up for Delivery every two months!

review/summary: The Best Part of My Wakin Up!
review/text: There was a time when I spent more on coffee...in my previous life before kids. Now, more than ever I need a boost of caffeine in the morning. I just can't pay coffeehouse brand prices anymore. Those of you with little people may agree. I have spent more money on coffee from warehouse stores- and I honestly can't tell a difference in taste with my Folgers! For the great price-delivered right to my door- I will be sticking with Folgers to start my crazy days!
