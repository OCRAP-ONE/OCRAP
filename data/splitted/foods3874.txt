review/summary: alittle something extra
review/text: My newly college graduate has searched for Waffle Crisp for the past couple of years and couldn't find it. Every town or State he visited he would make a grocery store run. I found this on Amazon, fast delivery, I left in the the big box it came in just to make him wonder. Its really hard to surprise him these days......but I did! He was thrilled that I had found his favorite cereal.

review/summary: Post-consumer waste...
review/text: In my quest to find new and exciting cereals for my morning wakeup, I stumbled across a mega-box of Waffle Crisp at the grocery store yesterday and just had to snatch it up.  I love waffles (who doesn't) and so I just had to try this.  What starts off rather delicious turns to mush very quickly, so if you tend to take your time eating your breakfast (which is the case with me since I work from home and eat while I work) then this can turn off-putting rather quickly.  The maple flavor (which is the best part of the waffle experience) is subtle enough to not be overly sweet, but it is also subtle enough to be mistaken for something else entirely.  In fact, this tasted a lot like Cookie Crisp at first, which is not what I was wanting.  My milk was rather delicious in the end, so there is always that.  I can't say that I'm all that impressed really.  I wanted to be, and I expected to be, but at the end of the day (or should I say `morning') I'm left with some mushy mini-sponges swimming in lightly flavored maple milk.

review/summary: Didn't get what was pictured
review/text: The assortment being sold here is not what is pictured.  This is a pack of 12, 4.5-ounce bags of the Runts assortment with the pineapple and mango.  You don't get the cherry, lime, or blue raspberry.  Amazon needs to update their photos, because when the assortment changed this drastically, it created a completely different (and much worse) candy.  It's sad that Runts felt they had to destroy the product that made them popular. I've read a comment stating that the new assortments are better than not having Runts at all.  I disagree.  I'd rather have nothing than have this new assortment, if I have to pay for it.<br /><br />If you're looking for the old assortment that sold so well for decades, don't buy these!  If you find that old assortment with the lime and cherry somewhere, let me know.  I'll go to great lengths to get more of those, but I wouldn't pay anything for the new assortments.

review/summary: Great Tea!
review/text: I purchased this tea because I was searching for a replacement to the Pompadour Rosehip and Hibiscus tea which is becoming increasingly hard to find, not to mention far more expensive.  I found this tea to be a little milder, but overall an acceptable replacement.  If you like stronger tea, I would suggest using two bags per cup since there is not as much tea per bag as other brands.  I still gave the product five stars because the taste is wonderful and tea strength is really a personal preference.

review/text: My two year old absolutely LOVES the Gerber Spinach Pasta Pick-Ups. But they are only $1.39 each at Walmart and even lower at Publix for $1.25 each.

review/text: I was initially caught off guard and put off by the strong cinnamon flavor, but after the first bar, I have to say that I like the taste. I was hoping for something a little more chewy, but this is basically high grain content, low fat, and tasty, so I guess I'll take them. For the carb counters, one serving = one bar, 1.5g fat, and 19g carbs, but a lot of those come from oats, and oats have a very low glycemic index.

Personally I haven't but I usually rotate my morning snack between this or a piece of fruit.

review/summary: A Real Treat
review/text: Here's the situation: Two fussy dogs, a shih tzu and a Bolognese, who don't like change. They like crunchy, but not too hard. They like their food and snacks in small pieces. Enter Zuke's Mini Bakes, chicken 'n cherryz. The girls have had and like Zukes turkey 'n taters treats, but how would this new one go over?<br /><br />No need to worry. Both girls love this snack and devour them with gusto. I like the natural ingredients and the lack of wheat, unpronounceable additives,and byproducts. As an added bonus I notice that POTATOES are ingredient number five.<br /><br />Greenies should note that the box is made of recyclable cardboard and with wind energy. We'll be recycling the box again!<br /><br />The inner bag of these American made snacks is not resealable, but it's no problem to store them in an airtight container to retain freshness. Zukes offers a great line of snacks in many shapes and flavors.

review/summary: A healthy alternative
review/text: I purchased these treats for my dogs after they experienced excessive weight gain from dog biscuit alternatives. This product has a much lower crude fat ratio than other biscuits, such as milk bones.<br /><br />What I like about the product:<br />It's a nice size for dogs. About � of an inch long, it's a nice reward without giving too much of a treat. The treats have a line in the middle for those who want to break the treat in half. Additionally, with a higher quality product, you do not have grease residue left on your fingers from handling the treats.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />When you try to break the treats in half, a lot of times it crumbles in your hands and you lose a portion of the treat.  Also, my picky Springer isn't sure about the taste. He'll start eating the treat and spit it out. My Beagle devours them, so it may not be a concern for every consumer. This is the main reason I rated the treat at 4, it may not be something appetizing to discriminating eaters. A good alternative I have found is Charlee Bear treats.<br /><br />Bottom line, they're a healthy alternative for those who need to control weight or just want to reward your dogs with a healthier alternative. I have found the price versus the amount of treats in the box to be one of the best values of healthy dog treats.

review/summary: Superb Coffee...and a clarification on the Decaf issue....
review/text: To allay any questions about whether this is decaf or not. It is indeed CAFFEINATED. The bag does have the "swiss water process decaf" words on the side but the bigger issue for me was that the bag I received was the ubiquitous decaf dark green color...not black/brown as shown on Amazon.com. Combined with the wording on the side...I too was curious.

To begin with, we do not have Columbian Decaf. So be assured. What is written on the side of the bags are just the different roasts we carry, and our decaf processing method, that's it. Maybe you can post a comment on the Amazon site, to let people know this......<br />Cindy<br /><br />...and the followup email to my suggestion to either remove the writing or change the color of the bag...<br /><br />From: Cindy Hernandez [mailto:cindy@cafealtura.com]<br />Sent: Wednesday, September 03, 2008 11:01 AM<br /><br />Mark,<br />Thanks for your input,and your support,  we are in the process of changing the bags at this time.<br />CH<br /><br />My synopsis: Superb coffee.

review/summary: It's the only coffee I'll drink.
review/text: There's really nothing more to say that the others haven't already said. The beans are dark, oily, fragrant. I fell in love with these the second I unsealed the bag. Yes, fell in love. I use a plain ol' Krups blade grinder and brew in a Melitta cone with near boiling water. The resulting brew is smooth, rich, full (all those buzz words you see on coffee bags, but actually true in this case).<br /><br />Further, these beans do something none other have; keep. I've had these same beans for months in an air-tight and light-proof container, the way I keep all my beans. But unlike most beans which eventually dry out and lose flavor, these are still pretty oily and retain nearly all of the flavor it had to begin with.<br /><br />As for these being decaf, I don't doubt L.Gregory had decaf beans, but I get a pretty nice buzz when I drink a cup. There have been days when I've lost sleep because I couldn't resist that end-of-the-day mud. I can't verify whether what (s)he says is true because I've long since discarded the bag. Maybe there's a pyschological component. I feel invigorated because it's so full-flavored. Kind of like I feel after a shot of espresso even though per ounce, espresso contains less caffeine than regular coffee. In any case, I love this stuff and recommend it to anyone who's serious about coffee.<br /><br />I'm completely sold on these beans. From now on, for my money, there's nothing like Cafe Altura. I can't wait to try the other flavors. At under $10/lb, how can you afford not to try it at least once?

review/summary: Very Good Dark Roast
review/text: Very good dark roast.  It's not over-roasted/burnt tasting & the flavor is somewhat complex; cocoa, good acidity, bit of syrup, bit of citrus, hint of smokiness.  The beans are oily, dark brown. I found 1 quaker (underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful - they stick out because they do not roast/darken properly).  That's a good test of coffee beans:  empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find.  A few is "acceptable" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.  This is a good cup of Columbian coffee which is getting hard to find these days.<br /><br />I use the "pour over" method to brew coffee every day because at this time, there is only one non-commercial drip coffeemaker that gets water to the ideal brewing temperature of 192F to 204 F.  I use cold, filtered water, a Melitta filter, manual drip coffee filter & brew directly into my stainless carafe.  I heat the water to boiling, let it cool for 30 seconds,  pour a few tablespoons over the grounds to saturate & plump up the beans, & then flood the grounds with the rest of the water.  There is some crema, the beautiful reddish brown foam that develops on top of the beans, & it smells & tastes good; a really nice morning cup.<br /><br />I brew directly in to this carafe using this coffee cone (pour over method):<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUDDTY">RSVP Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or Thermos</a><br /><br />I use this grinder:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043095WW">Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black</a><br /><br />I use this water kettle to heat the water:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S1V2A">Oster 5965 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle, Stainless Steel</a><br /><br />I use these coffee filters:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MY28QI">Melitta 40Ct #6 Wht Cone Filter 626402 Coffee Filters</a>

review/text: I have been drinking the Cafe Altura French Roast for a long time-the price is great and the beans are top quality--no quakers--the little shrivelled ones that Cook's Illustrated showed cause that truck stop coffee taste. The French Roast does seem to make a huge mess when I grind it--lots of static, and the Columbian Dark Roast doesn't. Best of all, though, is that the flavor of the Columbian Dark Roast is just as rich and low acid, without any "burned" taste. It has a rich complexity missing from other dark roasts. Yum yum!

review/text: This is my second bag of Colombian Whole Bean Organic Coffee by Cafe Altura.<br />I tried others like their Sumatra and Peruvian but have come back to this.<br />It's strictly a matter of individual taste, and their Colombian TASTES great.<br />Until I feel adventurous again, this is the coffee I'll be sticking with.<br /><br />Want to add a belated word here about the integrity of Cafe Altura.<br />Had a minor issue with packaging a couple of bags ago. Instead of hassling me over it they courteously made things right.<br />That goes a long way with me. It's also another reason why I am a return customer.<br /><br />TIP: if you've never tried grinding your own beans (Highly Recommended!) and/or are looking for a good little grinder, take a peek at my Five Star write-up of the "KRUPS 203-42 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel blades" (June 7, 2012).<br />Been using it every day for months and it's still performing like new.

review/summary: A bean above-outstanding
review/text: I am a long time Starbucks standard roast guy.  I have really enjoyed the it's dark richness.  A few months ago I tasted The Coffee Beans's similar roast and have like it as least as much- I was surprised.  Then at the recommendation of a friend I tried this Cafe Altura Colombian dark roast and was blown away.  2 pounds later I am a convert.  I didn't even care that it was organically grown (that's great though)but this coffee is fabulous.  It's rich, dark oily goodness is addictive.<br /><br />I am a dark coffee drinker and have never brewed a better cup of coffee.<br /><br />This is the stuff: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KSRTM4">Cafe Altura Organic Coffee, Colombian Dark, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag</a>

review/text: This is a great coffee if you like the taste of a dark robust brew. I like it myself, but my wife says it's a touch on the strong side. I've cut back on the amount of coffee I use for our brew cycle. The taste is satisfying and is not bitter at all.  If you like a dark Colombian, give it a try.

review/text: I prefer a lighter roast but the coffee was OK otherwise. This is a dark roast Columbian and I can't quibble with the quality, only that the taste seemed more "burnt" to me. If that's what you like, then this is the coffee for you. I decided to switch to another brand that offers medium roast.

review/summary: Almost fail proof and great tasting
review/text: I've been using this starter for about two months and I've been very successful baking wonderful sourdough bread.  We recently returned from a trip to the Yukon and Alaska and got hooked on the baking of sourdough after touring the gold rush areas.  I've tried other starters and this is absolutely the best and you can use a variety of recipes from various bread making books and other sources.  I've never had it fail to rise properly or give a great flavor and texture.  If you like baking sour dough bread and other things such as biscuits or making pancakes, this should be in your kitchen.  I have three one cup containers stored in my freezer for safe keeping in case I lose the batch I'm currently using.<br />The instructions are simple and easy to follow when it comes to getting the starter going.  Care and feeding is relative easy but with all sour dough starters, you must plan ahead when you want to bake bread.  Buy this starter and you will not be disappointed.

I can only agree and am very happy to have made this purchase. I've been buying quite a few spices and herbs on Amazon lately and am very satisfied with every one of them.

review/summary: Worth a Try.
review/text: My wife bought a variety of munchies for our son who is going through teething. These items are not a main part of his diet, but rather occasional snacks that he might chew on. One item was Gerber Graduates Fruit and Cereal bars. She first bought the strawberry and banana variety. These bars somewhat resemble a fig bar or other fruit bar where the fruit is on the inside and a coating of cereal on the outside. I found them to be dry and bland tasting. Our boy ate the bars, but somewhat reluctantly. I suspect we got a box that was somewhat stale from residing on the shelf too long.<br /><br />Our next box was of the Apple and Cinnamon variety. He seemed to like these somewhat better, but they still are not one of his favorite chewy items. In any case, he seemed to enjoy biting and chewing on them but acts as if he could really use a drink to go along with them. That does not surprise me as they are rather dry and granular, as if sawdust might be a hidden ingredient. However, we give him a bar from time to time and get a kick out of him eating it bite by bite. It's worth a try at this stage of his development.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Lightning Lemonade has NO CAFFEINE!!!  and it rocks!
review/text: So, not a frequent reviewer but after using this stuff for so long, I felt I should give some feedback.  This stuff will not make you a raging animal in the gym.  I know of no pre-workout supplement that will that does not also contain caffeine.  So, wtf is one supposed to do if you work out late?  Ever done that with a caffeinated supplement and laid in bed staring at the ceiling, with a totally drop-dead tired body but alert brain?  sucks doesnt it?  This is the only supplement I keep coming back to for that reason.  It gives you some energy and definitely increases stamina.  It also has kre-alkalyn creatine which is awesome because you need very little and none of it turns into creatinine.  It doesnt mess with my stomach one bit and it tastes great.  This sucker is a no-brainer for a caffeine free workout booster.  I've been using it for years and will likely continue to do so.  Enjoy  : )

review/text: I must say I cannot agree with the other reviewer in that I thought the grape flavor tasted great, kinda like a slightly bitter, yet refreshing grape kool-aid. Everyone is different though and/or perhaps he got a bad batch, not sure, but I liked it....also I thought FAST TWITCH(GO GRAPE) had better taste, texture and performance than NO-XPLODE!!!! So forget  the coffee and dump the pills, this stuff works WAY better than any pre-workout stimulant I have ever tried.

review/text: I am doing P90X and I really didnt want to buy their recovery drink. I have heard some pretty bad things about it from taste to just not working. So I tried fast twitch because I love the muscle milk.<br /><br />Let me say that this stuff gets you going. I wake up at 530 to start working out and after I chug some fast twitch I am ready to go. Saw a noticeable difference in the amount of energy and reps I can do.<br /><br />Although I think it makes my heart race a little bit, maybe my body will start getting used to it, I'll keep you updated.<br /><br />The Grape tastes great IMO...

review/summary: Fast recovery between sets
review/text: Great product. Grape flavor has 200mg caffeine per scoop, which can be excessive if you hit the gym after work and plan on sleeping within few hours. For morning/afternoon workouts, shouldn't be an issue. I took 1/2 scoop with 25 oz water upon entering gym.  I also felt like drinking more water in the gym while drinking this stuff, which is good (and necessary, per instructions). It started kicking in about 20 min into workout. Pretty fast. I didn't want to leave gym today. I felt strong between sets. Effective.<br /><br />Cons: Sweetened with sucralose instead of a natural sweetener, like Stevia. So what if people complain about stevia's strong taste..do you drink this on a night out w/your buddies? No, it's just a pre-workout chug-and-start-training drink!<br /><br />Suggestions: Introduce stevia in place of sucralose. Otherwise, excellent!

review/summary: Fantastic product. Not exactly what I ordered, but five stars for Amazon.com fixing it
review/text: I ordered the power punch to replace the Go Grape flavor I'm growing rather tired of. It arrived on time, but it was Tropical Punch flavor (had a different label too) and had a noticable 149 mg Caffeine on that label. Not the 200mg advertised and also like all other containers I've purchased. Who knows why cytosport would do something like this. However, they aren't required to be consistent so I hope it's just a one off occurance.<br /><br />Why this review gets 5 stars. Amazon.com customer service immediately processed a replacement to send me the correct item. No arguing fine points of 51 mg of missing caffeine, just an immediate replacement. It's great to know fantastic customer service still exists!

review/summary: Lets get a little honesty in the house
review/text: I think the cheap price has effected honest ratings here. Nothing special about Fast Twitch, in fact this formula is pretty old. Alot of improvements been made to pre workout products over the last 6-7 years and this Fast Twitch is exactly the same today as it was back then. Even back then it wasn't the best pre workout on the market or even close to it. This formula is dated and Arginine has been proven ineffective in fairly recent studies. Glycocyamine has been removed from most pre workouts due to health risk that it provides, but of course Fast Twitch still contains it. L-Citrulline, Citrulline Malate are solid ingredients in this product, but it's going to be dosed fairly low considering the Arginine is the first ingredient in this part of the blend. This has a pretty good Electrolyte blend in it, I will give it that. Not enough to justify using it as your go to pre workout powder. This has some funky type of creatine in it Kre-Alkalyn, which has proven to be a bunch of hype and mumbo jumbo. Stick to CreaPure monohydrate if you want a good source of creatine. Fast Twitch is a little higher in carbs than I like for a pre workout as well. That would just be filler Maltodextrin.<br /><br />All in all it's not a total waste, it's not to bad for the low price on here. If you're really poor and must have something pre workout this would be a decent option. To make it worth the while you'd be best off ordering two at a time to get the free shipping saver, only thing about it I liked the product better when it was $16, it went up $2 since last week. So if you order two you will have around $37 wrapped up into it. You'd be much better off order Superpump Max by Gaspari nutrition for $28 with free shipping saver. A much much better formula. I will leave the best for the last, the fruit punch fast twitch taste bad, it doesn't taste like fruit punch, more like medicine or chemicals. Hope you're a trooper because you will have to be a solider to drink this stuff. The grape fast twitch on the other hand isn't half bad, but that's not on sale :( makes wonder doesn't it? Get some Superpump Max fruit punch and don't look back.....<br /><br />And honest review with no hyped included.....

review/summary: Great for racing and lifting
review/text: I used to take this product before lifting and sprint swim races. It seemed to really give me a boost during weight training and also for swim races. I stopped using it for races because I didn't want to have to depend on a supplement to swim fast (and I've done great times without using it). I also felt slightly more nauseous after races when I used it, but not a whole lot more than I did when I didn't use anything.<br />I was also drug tested by Drug Free Sport after a 50m sprint race (I took a full serving right before) after the US open swim meet in 2008 and was negative for all banned substances so apparently its Ok to use for competition (was worried that something in it might be a banned substance even though the listed ingredients/amounts passed).<br />This stuff does have a lot of caffeine in (its a stimulant supplement). When I took it during evening swim finals I did stay up pretty late when trying to fall asleep.<br /><br />Also, this stuff tastes really good (power punch and go grape). Its kind of funny because you can smell when somebody on the team has this in their water bottle for practice and they almost always have a great practice.

review/text: I use this mostly for mountain biking, running, mostly endurance sports.  I'm not a gym rat.  Was struggling getting my endurance up lately, I was getting tired quick into my rides.  Was always getting an electrolyte imbalance halfway thru my ride/run. Tried different diets, supplements, sodium crap, etc... Then I decided to give this a try.<br /><br />WOW! Whatever problems I had before they are officially gone.  It almost feels like cheating with this stuff.  I went from mid pack riding mtn bikes to front of the pack with friends asking 'what are you on?' Just follow directions... for some reason this stuff works great when your running on an empty stomach then 30min later your on fire.  It seems to last forever too, 15miles later I'm still climbing hills/mountains that I couldn't even climb before on fresh legs.  I can't figure out whats in this stuff... I know it has caffeine which I've taken many times before but this stuff is heaven sent.  I am in no way affiliated with this product just someone who is pointing out the obvious... this stuff works!

review/summary: Not what it says
review/text: My main issue with this product is that i received the old formula with the old label. I wanted to try fast twitch because it was apparently caffeine free. That may be the case with the new formula but not the one i received. I have used it two times now and the product is a good pre workout supplement offering a good pump and good energy boost, however, it is not my favorite. Besides the caffeine that wasn't supposed to be in it, my second issue is the taste. It's a very potent pre workout compared to a Superpump Max by Gaspari that tastes more like a juice. Fast twitch is just very strong. I'm not totally sure if i did not mix it into enough water. Bottom line is that for the price it is worth it to try it out because you may see better results.

review/summary: Pre-Workout Supplement (Caffeine Free)
review/text: I recently ordered this product and can say that I am extremely pleased with the results. The taste is good, albeit strong; I recommend taking it with a generous portion of water. The creatine in it makes it easy to get your daily requirement and perhaps the most note-able ingredient in this is the endo-thermogens. I noticed that the rate at which I sweated had increased significantly and I was very hungry after my workout (I'm pretty sure that that is a good thing). As for the energy, I am sure that a caffeine product would give me more energy, but I would rather not become dependent upon stimulants such as that. With that in mind, I can say that I have more energy when working out to do more reps. I have seen significant strength gains in the three weeks I have spent using this product; my squat has gone up more than 50 pounds, deadlift about 20, bench about 10, and Preacher Curls an amazing 20 pounds!! Finally, I have noticed better pumps since starting it. Overall, I can say that I would definitely buy this product another time, and for the price you get quite a good amount of it. My only complaint is that on the second day during which I used it, I experienced some minor digestive problems; although it caused me little discomfort.

review/summary: Great help to get in the gym and leave the excuses at home!
review/text: The most important part is to take this on an empty stomach.  I had to get in the gym earlier because of having to take it on an empty stomach but I am happy with the results.  The taste is something you have to get used to.  It starts tasting better after few uses.  I have a hot water system in my house so I pour it on the powder and let it dissolve and then I pour really cold water and the taste is actually not that bad.  This stuff will not make you a sexual Tyrannosaurus or make you go over 9000.  I just gives you the energy and focus to go to the gym without excuses and get it done and get it done right.  Make sure to get a protein shake after workout so you can repair and be ready for the next day and keep the results coming.

review/summary: Works Great, Too much Caffeine for me.
review/text: This is a great pre workout drink.  I had some issues using other products such as N.O. Explode with upset stomachs which resulted in unproductive workouts.  This stuff works and is made by the makers of muscle milk.  Does not taste great but it is drinkable.  The only problem I had was with the 200 mg of caffeine present in every scoop.  I liked this but they now have a new item out called Muscle N.O.  I bought it at Costco.  It is the same company.  It only has 100 mg of caffeine and has no creatine in it like the Fast Twitch does.  Another option is the Fast Twitch lemonade flavor which has no caffeine.<br /><br />Overall, good product.

The lemon has no caffeine which I like so I don't get jittery like with Gaspari Super Pump 250...cannot sleep with that stuff. I am able to spend hours with decent consistent energy all the time. I lift more with it all the time and recovery seems a bit better and get more reps in and it really reduces the burn. No side effects I can see. I take it 40 minutes before and that seems to work best on an empty stomach. Takes a while to mix in and taste is fair...I don't drink it for that reason!

I had to get used to the taste... it just doesn't taste natural nor good.<br /><br />It's always interesting when you buy these supplements because you never know if it'll work for you as advertised.  I've tried a few different varieties of supplements and none of them really worked like they were promised.  I don't put too much faith in these products but I do think if used correctly, a lot of them could give you an edge.  I believe Fast Twitch is one of those products.  It did work for me... nothing miraculous but it helped me to workout a little harder so no complaints here.  I guess it's up to you to decide if what you pay for this is worth that.

review/text: I don't know if I feel any different before, during, or after my workouts when using this stuff, but I do know I enjoy drinking this more than anything else. It tastes great and mixes with no chunks or leftover grains at the bottom. Even if it is just a mental thing, I feel really motivated when that shaker cup and cytosport come out of the cabinet. My only complaint is that it makes my mouth salivate hardcore. Almost as soon as I take a sip I feel like I have to spit. For my current regiment of indoor cardio, this is really inconvenient. I've basically worked around it by using half a scoop. But yeah, if I don't, lotsa spit.

review/text: This is a great product when used for what it was intended. It is not made to use as fresh sour cream on potatoes and the like. It is intended for baking or recipes like dips. It does not mix well straight into water, you add it with the powdered or dry part of your recipe and add the water with your other wet ingredients. I love powdered products and sour cream powder is a real convenience when you are out and need it.

review/summary: Sour cream powder and Chedder cheese powder
review/text: I have made purchases from Berry Farms twice now and both times they have dilivered before the due date, usualy within a day or two.  The products are as advertised, and are real good for putting up for desaster storage.  The chedder cheese powder is the same thing as Kraft uses in it's macaroni and cheese.  The only draw back was there where no mixing directions for the chedder powder, but 1/4 cup of powder, 1/4 cup of butter (1/2 stick), and 1/4 cup milk makes a creamy sauce.  Just remember equal ammounts of powder, milk, and butter.  They still get 5 stars for prompt delivery.  I haven't had a customer service contact yet, so I can't grade them on that.  There web sight has a whole bunch of dried goods, and I have also ordered dried bell peppers and tomato powder from them.  Their packages are very well sealed and are packed for rough shipments.  I recomend this company highly.

review/summary: Great gluten-free carrot cake
review/text: I purchased <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XWNIUI">Simply Organic Carrot Cake Mix, Certified Organic, Fair Trade Certified(tm), 11.60 Ounce Boxes  (Pack of 3)</a> mix at my local grocer for $4.99/box less $1 off coupon I got from the Simply Organic website.  It had an expiration date of over one year out on it.  It is fair trade certified as well as USDA organic.  The mix makes either two 8" or 9" round cakes or one 11" x 7" cake.  The directions call for 2 large eggs, 1/2 cup water, and 1 cup grated carrots.  It offers an alternate vegan recipe option by substituting 1/4 cup applesauce for the 2 eggs with no change in cooking times or temperature. There is also a bonus recipe on the box for pumpkin cake that adds 3/4 cup pumpkin filling to the other ingredients.  It also suggests that you can make a spice cake by omitting the carrots and adding 2 tablespoons of additional water.  It suggests topping the cake with either cream cheese frosting or dusting with powdered sugar.  I thought the flavor and texture were wonderful but that the cake was a little thin.  I made a delicious icing out of goat milk butter, goat milk cream cheese, vanilla, and confectioner's sugar.  I think next time, I would try making a one layer cake with the batter.  I would purchase again. Another good choice if you want already made gluten-free carrot muffins is Kinnikinnick frozen and you can add icing/frosting if you want.

review/text: I am eating the cake as I write this review...it is really that good!<br /><br />I followed the instructions for the pumpkin cake recipe on the side of the box. I added half a 15oz can of pumpkin, but I also added about 1/3 cup of grated carrots and 4 diced dates (whatever was in the fridge). Once the cake cooled a bit, I smothered it with cream cheese frosting.<br /><br />For a gluten free carrot cake, it is bringing me to tears (of joy). For those in the room who are not gluten free, they are in disbelief! The cake is rich, moist (I think the pumpkin really added that moist factor), and perfectly spiced.<br /><br />I am thinking of trying these in cupcakes next time so we don't finish the whole cake in one sitting...

Could you really make a carrot cake from scratch for that?  I vote for powdered sugar or a rich cream cheese icing to top it off.  There's also a vegan variation if you want to please one of your vegan friends.

review/summary: MOIST!!!!
review/text: This mix is amazingly good! I was making a carrot cake for my mom's Bday and decided to make another one for my daughter and myself since we are both wheat intolerant. Bob's Red Mill, for some reason, upsets my daughter's stomach.<br />I thought this might have a good enough taste, but expected it to be dry as you only add eggs, water, and carrots - but it was so moist! The taste was much better than i thought it would be! I added a bit more cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/2 a cup of chopped walnuts. I baked it in an 8x8 pan.  It is suppose to be baked 40-50 minutes. I set the timer at 40 to check and I am glad I did! It was done!!  My husband was very impressed (he got to eat the from scratch carrot cake with gluten) - but for a change we didn't feel left out. You could easily eat this without any frosting - it is that tasty (reminded me of the spice cake my mom use to make for my dad)<br />This one will be ordered again - for sure!

review/summary: Moist - Added a few things
review/text: The #1 ingredient in this mix is sugar. The mix looks like sugar and spices, without flour. It does have flour though - brown rice flour, I believe. I mixed it with juliened carrots (already juliened from the salad section of the produce isle), chopped walnuts and some shredded coconut. Baked in a bundt pan for the recommended time. Did not rise very much. But, was delicious. Very dense and moist. Ate it warm with ice cream. Even my teenager liked it

review/text: Fat free items are hard to find.  This not only gives you solutions to create fat free dessert but lends itself to other variations, like pumpkin cake,mmmm, both are yummy.

review/summary: yummy in da tummy
review/text: I have purchased this carrot cake many times for family and friends and it always gets rave reviews. The main word that always comes up to desribe this cake is AWESOME CAKE. The only thing is you need to buy 2 boxes to make a 2 layer cake, but other than that it will be best carrot cake you have ever eaten.

review/summary: It's good, not the greatest, but it's decent.
review/text: This is not the best carrot cake I've had.  But it's okay, a little too sweet for my taste, and I'm not shy of using sugar in my cooking.  I used the eggs and made the recipe.  Refrigerated it, and then ate it the next day, and I was pleasantly surprised...it has sort of a chewy taste which I LIKE!  I'll buy this again...son likes it, but this is not the best carrot cake I've had.  It's decent though, organic and gluten free, so I shouldn't complain.

review/summary: Weird texture for cakes
review/text: I bought this cake mix in hopes of making a great carrot cake.  The other reviewers loved it, but I was disappointed.  The texture comes out odd and somewhat gummy, and the overall taste is a bit off.  It's fine to satisfy a sweet tooth, but nothing to write home about (unless it's in a review).

review/summary: More like Bread...
review/text: Made this for my daughters first birthday "smash" cake. It was heavy like a brick. I'm still giving it 4 stars because it still did taste good but you can't really smash bread that efficiently, lol. It didn't rise very well for me and I tried it using eggs and using applesauce. I don't think I will buy again for cake purposes, I like my cake light and fluffy, unfortunately maybe only the "bad for you" cakes are able to achieve this. I will add that I'm not an out of this world kind of baker but the boxed regular cake I made everyone else turned out how I would expect.

review/summary: Disappointed with size of cake...
review/text: The purchase price was fairly good on sale, but I was very disappointed with how tiny the cake was when cooked. I followed the directions exactly, and the cake only rose a scant 1" in the MIDDLE of the cake. I have been baking gluten free for a couple years, and even as a novice, I can get a cake to rise higher than that! I would not purchase again unless the purchase price was cut drastically so I could purchase several boxes and combine them to make a normal size cake.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This carrot cake is DELICIOUS, and very, very easy.  The directions say to use an 8" or 9" pan.  I used a 9" pan, and the cake only came out 3/4" high. Keep this in mind and consider using an 8" pan and/or making two or three layers.  (I ended up doing two 9" layers.)  Also, the directions don't call for any nuts or raisins.  My guests commented that the cake was as delicious as anything they'd ever had from a bakery, but when I asked if it could use nuts, they said, "oh, yes! Or raisins."  That said, I'm not sure how either of those would chage the baking time, so if you're going to do that, you better know more about baking than me.  Also, I, personally, can't stand nuts in baked goods - but that has no relevance to you or this review. :-)  Order, bake and enjoy!

review/summary: Gluten free heaven
review/text: This product is light, not too sweet and very satisfying.  Just what it says it is and shows on the box.  There is no sacrifice of delectable quality in the pursuit of a gluten free product at all.  Needs no frosting at all! Guests told me how wonderful the cake was even when they didn't know it was good for everybody, including us gluten free folk.

review/summary: Cella's Chocolate Covered Cherries in a word YUM!
review/text: Cella's hands down makes the best Chocolate covered Cherries.  We usually buy them seasonally in the local stores but have a hard time finding the dark chocolate as those seem to sell out quicker than the milk chocolate.<br /><br />That said, recently I bought high priced CCC (chocolate covered cherries)from Helen Grace Chocolates.  I was desperate for some and no Cella's in the local stores.  What a disappointment!  Any CCC lover knows that the liquid center makes up for 98% of the taste and the Helen Grace were lacking this.  There was a scant (and I mean very scant) liquid center so all you really tasted was the chocolate, very overpowering!  At 18.50 per pound it was a ripoff!  From now on I am staying with Cella's.  You won't be disappointed at all, they know how to make a cordial center!
