review/summary: Great tea chest, especially for the price!
review/text: This isn't the fanciest case, but the wood is smooth and it's nice and large.  I've already ordered a second one for a gift.  The hinge mechanism is pretty smooth, but there is a little clicking sound when opening or closing the case.  The divisions inside the case were put in from the bottom before it was glued on, so they don't come out (i.e. you can't choose larger or smaller compartments), the upside being that they're nicely stable.  The brand name on the inside of the box is slightly crooked.  You may be able to tell if you look at one of the pictures closely.  It doesn't bother me.  The logos are not carved into the case.  They are more like stamps, so if you wanted to paint/decoupage over them, you wouldn't need to fill them first.  Importantly (I know I was wondering this!), the measurements of the box are: 40cm long x 18cm deep x 9.75cm high.

review/summary: Perfect for large tea bags
review/text: This box is beautiful, and designed specifically for tea bags from Two Leaves and a Bud, which are larger than normal because they are for brewing a "mug" of tea rather than a "cup" and because they put whole loose-leaf tea leaves into their tea bags instead of tea "powder" like other brands. I'm happy I got a chance to buy this box on Amazon, because the Two Leaves site is no longer offering the empty box for sale - you have to buy a more expensive set already filled with tea flavors that you might not necessarily want. I recommend this box.

review/summary: Awesome tea box
review/text: My husband just bought this for me as a Christmas gift and I love it.  It is a great size and fits so many individually wrapped tea bags.  I like the look of the bamboo and don't mind the large Two Leaves and a Bud logo.  It's nice that you can really store and display a lot of tea and the lid still closes perfectly!  I love pulling out this box during a party or gathering to have my guests choose their tea from.  -Kelly

review/summary: Perfect for holding wider-sized tea bags
review/text: Like many reviewers reviewing this product, I'm a huge tea drinker. I'm a big fan of Two Leaves and a Bud--both their tea bags and loose teas--but the primary reason I purchased this tea box is because it holds wider-sized tea bags. This is a huge plus for me and would definitely recommend the box to those who are looking to house pyramid-shaped tea bags.<br /><br />-Construction seems solid. Also, the logos (both on top and on the inside) are facing the correct direction and not crooked.<br /><br />-Love the natural, light-colored wood, but would've preferred a slightly more polished finish. (I get the sense that a splinter is in my future, hence the four-star, not five-star, review.)<br /><br />-Doesn't hold as many tea bags as I would like. It holds about 100 (?) right now, which is an okay, decent amount, but more is better!

review/text: This is the best strawberry jam ever.  We've tried all the gourmet brands as well as homemade jams from the farmers market but this beats them all by a mile.  It tastes less like sugar and more like ripe strawberries.  The texture is also better because the fruit is pur&eacute;ed so it spreads smoothly.  AND it's organic. :-)

review/summary: Edible Silver Leaf for Cakes/Candies
review/text: Great product at a good price.  It used to be possible to buy edible silver and gold leaf (vark) at Indian groceries, but there seem to be problems nowadays importing it.  So I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon.  You can use the silver leaf to cover an entire cake, if you wish.  I made an Indian-inspired cheesecake, putting a thin layer of rose-petal jam on top of the cookie crumb/nut base, making a traditional cheesecake filling using rosewater for flavoring, and then covering it with silver vark.  It was an amazing success -- nobody had ever seen anything like it before and they were just fascinated by it!  To cover the cake, just carefully slide the sheets of silver onto the cake from the paper leaves they're packed on.  Smooth the silver using a brush, like a cosmetic brush.  It won't be perfectly smooth, but good enough to impress your guests.  You can further decorate the cake with some silver dragees, if you wish.  Don't overdo, but it doesn't hurt to be a bit excessive with a dessert like this!!!

review/summary: Truffles are excellent, of course, but watch shipping conditions!
review/text: Lindor extra dark truffles are among the most amazing food in the world...  Rich creamy goodness that's simply amazing.  And Amazon's prices are as good as I've seen.  However, be careful when you purchase these via mail order!  If the weather (or the shipper's warehouse, or the delivery vehicle) gets too warm, you'll have mis-shapen, messy truffles.  They still taste good, but if you're ordering these for gifts or otherwise need them to look good, I recommend you shop locally where you can check them out firsthand and you have more control of environmental conditions.

review/summary: It's Lindt!
review/text: As the other reviewer said, you should watch out for weather.  But regardless, I think most people like chocolate, somewhat mushy or not.  What to say? It tastes like Lindt chocolate, rich, creamy, dark, melt-in-your-mouth.  This is a great gift for a chocolate lover, or a great box to take into work or school and share with your colleagues.  Everyone will be your friend :)<br /><br />However, if you lack self-control, please refrain from buying this, and get the smaller packs with around 20 inside. Though it may be more expensive per ounce, you do NOT need to gain your weight in chocolate.

My only complaint is that the shoelaces do not have any stoppers at the end, and knots would have to be pretty big to keep the pieces from falling off the ends.  I use one of the pretzel pieces to make a stopper, but you could also tie a large wooden bead on the end.

review/summary: Mushy!
review/text: When I saw this for sale, I was excited because it was 'out of season' for Panettone and so hard to find until later in the Fall.  In retrospect, I should have realized that this may not have been the best and/or freshest of products given the time of year.  Even so, Panettone is well fermented and if it is stored properly it typically has a long shelf-life.  However, I was disappointed to find that this one was limp and somewhat mushy.  It didn't seem to be spoiled so I popped it in the toaster to salvage it.  Yes, for any of you Italians reading this I know that you are horrified by the fact that I toasted Panettone.

I really like Enfamil formula, and used "Nutrimigen" for my 2 yr. old daughter before she turned 1. Great product!

review/summary: Love this sauce
review/text: The first time I had this sauce was when I was stationed in Puerto Rico.  I liked it so much that I went back to the Post Exchange to buy more but they had sold out.  This was about 10 years ago.  I never forgot it and decided to look it up online last year and found it here on Amazon.  I ordered 3 or 4 bottles.  It seems they may have changed the recipe a tad as the sauce has a vinegary taste/smell that comes out or I just never noticed it but it didn't change my thoughts on this sauce.  It has a great flavor and nice spice to it.  I use it on all foods.  Try a drop or two on top of your hard boiled egg instead of salt...the vinegar taste works great with eggs (if you like pickled eggs).  Don't let me deter anyone from it because of the vinegar taste...it is still an awesome sauce.  About to order some and have it shipped here to Afghanistan if I can.  Try it out.

review/summary: You'll want to buy it by the liter
review/text: My wife purchases a few bottles of hot sauce for me each year during the Christmas season.  I have two racks of hot sauce in my kitchen and have tried many different varieties.  For perspective purposes, I must mention that I enjoy my hot sauces over-the-top hot but I will not rule out a mild hot sauce if it has great flavor.<br /><br />I must say that this hot sauce has both excellent flavor and impressive, lasting heat.  I think I could best describe it as something that is rather punishing but so tasty that you won't want to stop.  Upon consuming you will experience a very natural (it doesn't taste chemical at all) zesty, tangy flavor that is eventually followed by a creeping, lasting heat that rivals that of many extract-based sauces.<br /><br />I really can't describe how great it is in words but I would call it the best hot sauce you can buy in terms of ratio of quality/dollar.  Go ahead and give it a try but you'll probably buy more than one bottle the second time.

review/summary: My favorite in a can
review/text: Of all the ground coffee that I've tried, this is by far my favorite. I'm not big on flavored and too groggy in the A.M. to even think about grinding beans and waking everyone else up. This stuff smells great when you open the can and the grind is moist and powder like, not gritty and granular. Taste is a subjective thing. I just like it. It is pricey though and I tend to look for deals and get rainchecks when the local grocery store has it on sale (lately 9.99 for the 24 oz. can). The supplier through Amazon has better deals for the flavored varieties so this must be their best seller.I was getting the 24 oz delivered on a schedule for a little less than $10 a can but it became unavailable. I was really happy to then see it for $8 and ordered 4 but when it arrived I realized I hadn't read the fine print since they were 11 oz. cans. So yes it is somewhat expensive and that's worth 1 to 2 stars but as for the coffee itself, it's 5 star all the way. For reading the fine print I give myself no stars.

Skylake Ranch's pomegranate syrup made me a born-again breakfast lover because it's not too sweet and doesn't overpower the food you're pouring it on. Plus, the delicious pomegranate flavor shines through without being tart, as many other pomegranate products are. Though Skylake Ranch also makes a yummy pomegranate marinade, the syrup is great on grilled pork tenderloin; I just baste it on the meat a few minutes before I pull it off to rest.

review/text: I tried the .8 ounce 24 pack.  These chips are good and healthy, but expensive.  I paid $20.50 for the .8 ounce 24 pack.  I looked at this 6.25 ounce 6 pack for $21.42 and did the math.  It's a way better deal to buy these bigger bags.  the .8 ounce 24 pack is a total of 19.2 ounces of chips, while the 6.25 ounce 6 pack is a total of 37.5 ounces of chips for only a dollar more.  They also have the 3 ounce 12 pack for $25.50 for a total of 36 ounces of chips, which is still better than the .8 ounce 24 pack but not as good as this 6.25 ounce 6 pack.

review/summary: Nutmeg Grinder
review/text: The grinder itself is fine. The problem is that the nutmeg has almost no  flavor at all compared to a freshly grated whole nutmeg. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the grinder contains chunks of coarsely ground or broken-up nutmeg, not whole nutmeg nuts. I remember (but cannot find) nutmeg grinders into which a whole nutmeg would be inserted and held by a sort of claw, then shaved as needed by a mechanism resembling a pencil sharpener in the principle of its operation.<br />I purchased these grinders as presents but was so disappointed that I still have all three; since what comes out of these grinders is no improvement over what comes out of a container of powdered or grated nutmeg from any supermarket spice rack, I saw no sense in adding them to the clutter of my children's spice racks.

review/summary: Very aromatic and flavorful, and a great value
review/text: Want some freshly ground nutmeg flavor but without having to grind whole nutmeg? These little nutmeg grinders are great and measure up. True, there might be some loss of aroma since the nutmeg is in chunks rather than whole, but I've found these grinders and the nutmeg they contain to be very flavorful -- and certainly much more so than the pre-ground nutmeg you get in shaker bottles.<br /><br />Be sure to store these in a dark cupboard, and if possible, don't store them too near the stove or other heat source, as that can degrade the quality of your herbs and spices pretty quickly. Open spice racks are pretty, but they can cause the herbs & spices to degrade faster. When I had a spice rack, I used to transfer any of my herbs and spices into dark spice containers to help keep some of the light out.<br /><br />I found these nutmeg grinders to be a great value and very convenient to use.

The little bottles you buy don't last long, and when he found these for a great price in fact I decided to try it.  It smells so good as you actually grind the nutmeg fresh to use.  The grinder is right on the end of the bottle so there is no mess or trying to find a grinder for it.  You get 3 bottles filled with all natural nutmeg to a pack so it will last some time.  Can't say enough about using it as it is so simple to just grind your own.  Great product.

review/summary: Go with the TV cooks on this one
review/text: I still have one of these sitting around from way back when whole nutmeg was only known in culinary schools. Nutmeg is particularly notorious for losing its flavor quickly when ground, so all cooks who use nutmeg regularly know that you have to use the nutmeg minutes after you grind/grate it. From this standpoint, it is better than the ground nutmeg every big-brand spice vendor under the sun sells-- which is to say, it's better than sawdust.<br /><br />The moment I decided never to use plastic spice grinders again was when I made some pumpkin pie with this stuff, because one of the first things I noticed was that I could feel the bits of nutmeg in the final product, kind of like tiny corn cob bits. I also noticed that while the nutmeg flavor wasn't completely gone, it wasn't as strong as it was when we first bought it, because this is filled with chunks of nutmeg rather than whole nuts-- that increases the surface area and the rate of loss of volatile flavor compounds.<br /><br />This stuff works okay in things like oatmeal cookies, where you're not going to notice the texture of the rather coarsely ground nutmeg. But for anything else, you're best off doing what the TV cooks do, and getting whole nutmeg and a grater like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004S7V7">Microplane Stainless Steel Zester</a> and just grating a little off into the dish you're making. The flavor will be stronger, there won't be any grit from the nutmeg, and you will have a nice tool for other tasty things like citrus zest and Parmesan cheese. Plus, you can easily find whole nutmeg now online or in some brick-and-mortar markets.

(everything else usually winds up in little pieces within a span of about 10 minutes to a few days). these Nylabone rings can usually manage to stick around for at least a month, and during that month, it's always her favorite toy. she carries it from room to room, sometimes flipping it over her head so it looks like some kind of crazy harness bit.<br /><br />other nylabone products don't last nearly as long - anything weaker than the DuraChew types, she just straight up eats and it's gone within a few minutes. the bone-shaped DuraChews, she powers through in about a week.<br /><br />anyway i love it and more importantly, the dog ADORES it.. we've bought 2 and will keep buying more as she chews through them.<br /><br />cautions: (1) once your dog starts to really get into it, the ring gets little barbs on it that (besides being gross), pick up fur, hair, lint, and other grossness, which your dog ends up eating. (2) once your dog breaks through the ring and it forms a really long crescent instead, watch out as when your dog flips it up, the end may catch her in the eye.

review/summary: Super Toy
review/text: I really like this toy for my yellow lab puppy. He really enjoys corners, and if he can find one, he will demolish it. Regularly shaped Nylabones last around a month. This ring has been super fun! He likes to play with it a lot because it's round, so he can stick his paw in to secure it, and then chew. It's very sturdy, but there is another version of it called the "Gumabone" for younger pups. I wouldn't go over 5mos with Gumabone products. This toy is really fun for dogs, almost indestructable, it's super!

review/summary: Nylabone review
review/text: we have a Mastiff who can chew threw most toys in minutes. We have found that she LOVES this nylabone and one bone will last a month. The fact that it is round allows her to put one foot through the loop and get a really good grip on it. She spends a couple hours a day chewing away. Also, this is a great price. At the local pet store it is twice as much.

review/summary: Giant: No, Effective: Yes
review/text: If you have big chewers, you know that nylabones are great and pretty tough.  We're on our 4th regular nylabone and both dogs love it, so I thought I'd give this a try.  I have to first mention that nylabone's definition of "giant" is way different than mine.  I was expecting something 6-8" in diameter made of 1-2" thick material.  I should have read more, it's actually about 5" in diameter with .5-.75" thick material.  Still not bad, big enough to avoid any issues with my giant breeds.<br /><br />Otherwise it's a regular nylabone, burly and apparently tasty.  One fringe benefit of the shape is that without corners, the dogs tend to tear off fewer shards (the regular and galileo ones do this a lot).  They don't seem to like it quite as much as a regular nylabone, but they'll play with it occasionally.  All in all a good purchase.

review/summary: Finally, something he can't destroy!
review/text: I have a dog who is to say the least, a monster chewer. I'm not sure why, because he's half cocker spaniel, and half shih tzu, Not exactly what you would think a chewer would be made of, but he is honestly a MONSTER. He's chewed up just about any and everything you can imagine, from shoes, clothes (he actually ate my north face jacket- literally ATE a huge chunk, zipper and all), end tables, the WALL (I'm not sure how he managed that one), We even caught him chewing on a piece of broken glass once. Basically ANYTHING he can put in his mouth he will chew on- and ultimately, he'll eat it. Obviously this is a major problem. We watch him like a hawk, but still every couple of months I have to take him to the vet to make sure he's just sick- and doesn't have a blockage from eating something. I have spent ridiculous amounts of money buying toys that claim they are 'durable', and 'indestructible', and all of them got eaten and chewed to pieces with-in days. Then my fianc&eacute;e told me to try this toy. We have the regular nylabones, but he never seems interested in them, so I was a little skeptical. But, desperate, I decided to give it a try. I'm happy to announce that this toy has indeed stood the test, and has not been destroyed! The dog loves it, because the ring he can play with it more like a toy, than a bone. I will say he isn't AS fascinated by it as some of the other toy's, (probably because he can't rip it shreds), but he does play with it. My suggestion would be to buy from Amazon, because at pet stores (like petsmart and petco), this thing is more expensive. I would recommend you give it a shot if you have a powerful chewer on your hands!

review/summary: The Best Dog Toy IMO
review/text: I have a 2 year old Boston Terrier and he is full of energy and his favorite game is fetch, and I have tried various fetch toys and this one has been the absolute best for throwing, rolling and extraction from his mouth.  He has a very powerful bite and my hand has been on the receiving end of a few misplaced chomps and this keeps my hand well away from his teeth. His grip is very powerful and the smooth shape of this makes getting it away from him a lot easier than other designs I have tried.  When you throw it, its reaction to hitting the ground results in a pleasing amount of unpredictability that he seems to enjoy enormously.  I have bought 12 of these and always have one ion the car and a few at home and the rest I will save in case they stop making them.  These are also very difficult to find in brick and morter Petco and Petsmarts, and I only get them on Amazon.

review/summary: More interesting than bone shaped nylabones
review/text: We have a 1yr old golden retriever who is possibly the most destructive golden on the face of the planet. She can't really have any fun soft toys because she'll eat them, so it's tough for us to find interesting (relatively quiet) hard toys for her. She really likes the ring shape of this nylabone, she likes to carry it around and throw it for herself. So far it seems really durable, but its been added to a group of toys, so it's not played with exclusively. I expect that it will last a few months though. Overall a great alternative version of a sturdy reliable toy!

review/text: I own a 30lb Staffordshire Bull Terrier. She is definitely a powerful chewer and loves getting into things that do not belong to her, so it's great to find a toy that really holds her interest. She LOVES this ring! Also it's adorable the way she carries it around with her nose sticking through it. It's really easy for her to hold and lasts a long time. If your dog is really strong I wouldn't ever expect a toy to last forever but at this price and for the longevity of it I will continue to buy these over and over!

review/text: My dog LOVES this nylabone ring! I bought him one last year and for some reason in the last month he decided to chew the heck out of it so I figured it was time to buy him a new one. For about $7 and free amazon prime shipping he had a new one in about 2 days and he's loving this one all over again! Dogs love this toy because they are able to hold it in place with their paw while chewing the top of it. My dog is a 50lb aussie and i got him the "Giant" or "wolf" size? Can't remember. Highly recommended! I'm gonna buy one for my moms little chewer

review/summary: Good quality, dog isn't interested
review/text: This has the great Nylabone quality, but my dog is not interested in it. He loves his Nylabone bones, but this one seems difficult for him to keep in place to chew. He tries to put his paw through the ring to hold it in place, but it falls over so he just leaves it and looks for something else to chew. I think it's just my dog's preference, but I would consider the type of toys/chews your dog likes before buying this one since it's not a typical shape.

review/text: I have an 8 month old hyperactive, constantly chewing puppy. He tends to forget about this toy a lot, it doesn't keep his attention. I have to remind him that it is in his toy bin but he only chews on it for a few minutes every few days. It is a hard toy and has no fun shape. He would probably love it if it was a different color and something other than just a ring.

review/text: My dogs did love these right off the bat but got tired of them within a couple days.  Even after I put them away for a while and then re-introduced these, my two dogs (60lb shephard/lab mixes) didn't feel all too keen on them over time.  They chew through many things like their life depends on it so I purchased these rings due to their durability.  However, the nylabone material hardens and becomes very "spiky" that gets caught in my pups' teeth when ripped off and punctures my skin when accidentally stepped on.

review/summary: great for aggressive chewers
review/text: My golden retrievers love these chewy rings and choose them over a basket of other toys.  They tend to try to steal these rings from each other!<br /><br />The rings will be chewed flat by aggressive chewers, and will become rough and sharp and noticeably thin over time.  I need to toss them after a couple of weeks to avoid gum and lip damage from the sharp points that develop as they are chewed.  However, as these are among the least expensive Nylabone toys and my dogs LOVE them, I think the cost is worth it.  I feel sure having Dura Chew Rings around the house helps keep my goldens from chewing on my belongings.<br /><br />Recommended, with the caveat that they need to be seen as a shorter-term toy.  They'll last much longer than rawhide, but after a month will be sharp and need to be tossed.

review/summary: This is It! One chew toy that will outlast a power chewer
review/text: My husband and I have searched for over five years, trying to find a toy that will last more than 30 minutes with our dogs. We have three pit bulls, who are all powerful chewers and enjoy chewing as a general past-time and a challenge. They have destroyed $2.00 toys in seconds, and $30.00 toys just as fast. I bought them each a ring one week ago, and every ring is in great shape with minimal wear. They seem to really appreciate this toy. They like to hold one paw in the middle and rotate it around their arm, it's easy to grip and true challenge to chew through. I tie rope to the side and let them play tug of war with them. Another thing I love is there's no mess left behind after a chew session. They are a hit in our household. I recommend these for anyone who has watched a Kong Extreme get torn down to a nub in an hour (and then cleaned up all the little pieces left behind).

review/text: My 55-lb. pit mix really likes this one! She's had it just over a week and already it's gotten more chew action than all her other Nylabone Durachew toys. She seems to enjoy the shape, which she can brace with one paw. I bought it because I thought more chewing surface would make it last longer and less likely to break off in larger chunks (and it does seem a little safer than the bone-shaped toys). But since she likes it so much it will actually go quicker! I agree with another reviewer that "Giant" is an overstatement here - it could easily be TWICE as thick! Very pleased overall, though, as the price was good too.

review/text: I have two cardis, one of whom is a strong chewer. I've always been a believer in the Nylabone toys, having seen my parents give them to their dogs over my entire life. Never had a problem. When my male cardi was a puppy, I gave him a regular bone-shaped Nylabone toy. He prompted chewed a large chunk off the knobby end of the bone and swallowed it. What an expensive fiasco that was. I had to take the Nylabones from him completely... until we found these rings. Now he can enjoy chewing the toy without getting large pieces off. When it looks like he might chew through the ring, I just throw it away and give him a new one. He gets his fix and I don't have to worry!

review/summary: Great Entertainment
review/text: Nine month old (at the time of writing), female, German Shepherd Dog; toy-driven; capable of demolishing most toys.  This one is holding up quite well, and, being round, supplies lots of entertainment (for her and us as well).  Watching her run around with part of the ring in her mouth and part over the top of her head is, to say the least, humorous.<br /><br />Since there is no 'start' or 'end', the wear on the toy is fairly even.  Bone-shaped toys are attacked at the ends, so become unusable because of wear there while the middle remains relatively untouched.<br /><br />I would not suggest this as an unsupervised toy, though.  Our GSD is large enough so that the the ring won't go BEHIND her head while she has it in her mouth.  A dog with a smaller head might manage that - and could become stuck with it that way.

review/summary: my dogs found it interesting
review/text: My two pit mixes loved this. They are pretty strong chewers, and this held up extremely well (over 4 months) I finally retired it because it was picking up fuzz from their dog beds, and I couldn't get it cleaned. Will buy again.

review/summary: Still going strong!
review/text: We have had this ring for about a year now and our 3 year old German Shepherd still has not broken through! She pulls in out of her toy box about once a week to give it a good chew. The design is great since it allows her to hold down the bone and still chew. Definitely worth the money!
