review/summary: Second Best
review/text: I'm not ashamed to admit that I love soup mixes.  I know that making home made soup is easy, and even fun if you have the time.  But nothing beats a mix that can be dumped into a pot with some browned beef, or any other optional ingredient you favor, and have it be ready and delicious in 20 minutes or less.  Mrs. Grass is a very good mix compared to a lot of the ones more easily available in the stores.  It taste a little more like home made to me.  And believe me I haves tried all of them available in the stores.  The only reason I refer to it as second best if because I also buy the Bear Creek veggie beef soup mix also available on Amazon, (link enclosed).  I have to give the nod here to Bear Creek for just being a little spicier, and in my opinion having just a tad better beef broth.  I still highly recommend Mrs. Grass for it is much better than the store bought mixes, and besides, you may like your soup a little on the lighter side.  Still very tasty, and very worth it... Recommended.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H25WMC">Bear Creek Country Kitchens Vegetable Beef Soup Mix, 9-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Interesting Variation From My Ordinary Chili Sauce.
review/text: I spotted this Mae Ploy sweet Chili Sauce (12-ounce bottle) in the international section of a local grocery store. It's imported from Thailand. I use regular chili sauce in a variety of ways and I love to try variants such as this. Into the shopping cart it went. Well, my, oh my, this stuf is excellent. It's both sweet and somewhat hot and has a nice variety of spicy flavors dominated by pickled red chili. So far, I've used it on eggs and small frozen dinners. Excellent. I can hardly wait to try it out on meats. This is, indeed, a very interesting variation from my ordinary chili sauce!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Because of my Danish background,I use a lot of almond products.  I am unable to buy my usual store brand in my new little town, so I got online and started to read reviews.  My almond extract arrived and was put into a taste test in our almond brownies that very day.  We took these to a middle school picnic and SEVERAL people asked what that incredible flavor was in the brownies!  The extract is wonderful.  There is no bitterness at all.  The flavor is true, rich and strong.  The cost is so reasonable and it was well padded in the package.  This will be my extract from now on.  Try it, you will LOVE it!

review/text: This is exactly what I needed.  I use a lot of almond flavoring, & this bottle-size is great for me.  It is real almond extract and not imitation, which is something that I didn't care about before.  After using this extract, I probably can't use imitation flavoring anymore. This extract gives the perfect Almond taste and that little bite that I like to taste in my recipes.  I will be ordering this as long as it is available.

review/text: I bought these to give out as party favors at a bridal shower--my sister got engaged at Disneyland, and they're going on a Disney cruise for their honeymoon, so it seemed like a nice touch.<br /><br />The guests loved them!<br /><br />My pack included: 2 Ariel, 2 Cinderella, 2 Belle, 3 Aurora, 1 Frog Princess, 2 Rapunzel.  So, obviously it's just a random assortment.<br /><br />They make great favors because they're already individually wrapped.  Also, they do come with the little display like shown in the picture here on Amazon.  When my guests were leaving, I just put them out in their display box for them to pick up on their way out, and I used labels to put a sticker for the event on the packages.<br /><br />If you want Pez dispensers that are Disney princesses, this is a great option.

And even though there's still plastic to be disposed of, there's not near as much.

I use a large mug and make 2 regular cups of coffee out of one pod, add my sweetner, and am a happy camper. This may weaken the flavor a bit but I need alot of coffee in the morning and this hits the spot. Try it - the price is a great deal better than buying 18 pods for $12 - 17 a pop.

review/text: I like the flavor of this brand. It has taken me a while to find something I really like. Some of the Keurig options are too acidic for my taste. (But taste is subjective, isn't it?) Reviewers have complained because the cups aren't surrounded completely by plastic; they use a filter-like material instead. I suspect that the traditional filter aspect may make them better. I gave this four stars. To get five stars it would have to be the amazing. I have not yet found a Keurig brand (or lately even a traditional coffee bean) that rates in the Amazing category.

review/summary: Could have been a 5 star
review/text: Here's a product that had the potential to be excellent but isn't.  Since it's not a "K-Cup", they're not paying the licensing fees, so it should be cheaper.  Yet it's about the same price as many brands of K-Cups.  What makes it worse is that these aren't even "extra bold" portions, the ones with extra coffee in the cup, which again you can get for about the same price as these.<br /><br />On the positive side, there's less material here, so less waste generated.  I've bought this brand of coffee in bean form for years, the "not a K-Cup" version does deliver the familiar tastes.  A small cup of the same taste.

review/text: I was not expecting the way these K-cups were made.  The plastic collar on top with the exposed coffee filled filter hanging below is ingenius and I can see where it saves on throwing extra plastic in the landfills.  But, I have to agree with other reviewers that in order to keep each cup fresh, you will have to empth the bag into a ziplck bag or a plastic container with a sealed, locking lid.  That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  The coffee is excellant and very comparable to the other brands and it is cheaper if you use the subscribe and save.

I just wipe under the cup holder and the drip tray a bit more often.<br /><br />I do get these, the 80 count, at Costco for $24.79 a box, coming to 31 cents per cup (compared to Amazon purchase at $33 for 41cents/cup or Amazon subscribe at $33.35, for 39 cents per cup). But if those prices change I would not hesitate to switch to Amazon for my source.

review/text: I love my Keurig K-Cup Brewer, but not so much the cost of the K-Cups!  The San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers is the delicious solution!  Initially, I tried the 36 count box French Roast from Amazon to see if I liked the coffee.  I already knew I liked the price which was almost half the cost of the Keurig K-Cups at your local grocery or department store, but I also loved the full-bodied, eye-opening flavor of the coffee!  Then I noticed the 80 count box which is about a third the cost of store-bought K-Cups and thought I was in Heaven! Of course I ordered it, because I just can't pass up a bargain this amazing! This product is definitely a five-star keeper, and I will continue to order it from Amazon!

review/summary: Excellent Taste and More Robust Brewing with These Type of Pods
review/text: A friend of mine in the office gave me a pod of this coffee and I really liked it, hence my purchase of this 36 pack.  This coffee is not as strong to me as this company's Fog Chaser brand, and is good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a "clean" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods. I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />Several folks in my office have also ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff. I believe between this and the Fog Chaser brand I have found a new favorite coffee company!

review/text: We enjoy the French Roast flavor from this maker mainly for the aroma and rich taste. Great for a morning cup. Initially we were worried about drip risks due to the pod's design, but never had a problem. Having the paper filter exposed might be the cause for the richer taste, and some minimal sediment does get past the filter. Not enough to be troublesome. This coffee has been the best value k-cups thus far, and with the Green Coffee patent expired, hopefully we will see prices go down even more, which will lead to more consumption!

review/summary: Don't let the difference keep you from purchasing.
review/text: With the high cost of K-cups I've tried several different alternatives.  I have the My K cup and the Eco-cup and they both work ok but just not great.  The 3 adults in our home all love coffee and drink lots of it so the cost was getting to be a problem.<br />I've compared K cup prices everywhere, online and brick and mortar stores.  I usually purchase from Amazon.<br />Was checking out what was available and ran across these.  I love the Millstone Fog Lifter coffee so I was interested but read the review and found that they were made differently.  I hesitated but decided to try the 36 ct box.  I figured if I didn't like them somebody else might.  Was still skeptical and thought it might not work in my Keurig.<br />Works perfectly!  The Fog Chaser is delicious.  I like bold coffee and this is good strong but not bitter coffee.  I highly recommend it and others love it too.  We have a Keurig at work and I took one of the bags and shared.  Everybody loved it.  Also, though I'm not usually into "being green" particularly I feel that there is less plastic to end up in the landfills.

review/summary: Very good and Tasty Gourmet Coffee * Love Presentation ! !
review/text: First time I purchase this Brand, San Francisco Bay Coffee (Decaf French Roast). I bought it thinking they were the original K-cups, and I was so surprised when I opened up the box and saw the presentation, I thought I bought some kind of tea cups by mistake instead of Coffee cups, or it was coffee made for another type of coffee pots, but noooo, they were ecologic and new presentation which I love, and I am very happy with this brand now, I sure will be buying again, very very tasty coffee and nice and friendly presentation, ecologic, excellent Gourmet taste, very happy with it, I love it..!!!!

review/text: Another great coffee from San Francisco Bay. This roast,like their Fog Chaser, are great first morning cup of coffee.  I then switch to their decaf French Roast for the rest of the day. I have used all three of these roasts as a bases for mochas and Irish coffee.  They maintain their flavor very well. Recommend to any coffee lover. Their unique K-cup design uses less plastic which is nice for the environment.

review/summary: Great coffee in a great container
review/text: After reading the reviews we werent quite sure what to expect, but we are delighted. The packaging is much better environmentally and the key is that we dont have to compromise on taste or convenience. And by the way its a lot cheaper. The coffee is robust, strong and dark, like it should be ( I haven't tried the other flavors) and it has a great aroma. Of the four people who tried it in our office this morning three are buying it for home and the fourth is concerned only because it is too strong for his family's taste. The packaging is different but works as well as the regular k-cups. I am definitely buying this in the future

review/summary: Not a Bad Cup of Coffee
review/text: I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the high priced K-Cups so I decided to try San Francsisco Bay French Roast coffee. First, the price is right. I read all the reviews of this brand so I knew what to expect regarding appearance and storage. I must say, it really is not a bad cup of coffee. I usually drink Newman's own K-cups and, in my opinion, Newman's Own is a better cup of coffee. However, if you are looking for a cheaper alternative, I would give San Francisco Bay French Roast a try. Try a smaller box to try it out first.

review/summary: Love these
review/text: Deep, dark, rich flavor. I appreciate the reduced packaging which is environmentally friendly, and as a side benefit takes up less space.  What I really like about these, besides the great flavor (best tasting K-cups I've found so far) is that there is just the filter on the bottom. I've always had some un-addressed concerns about the composition of the plastic that other k-cups are made of, and what may be leaching into my beverage from the hot water passing over the coffee.  Look for these at costco where a 80 pack is 25$ (look around, not all stores carry them), but even on amazon it's a good deal with shipping included.

review/summary: Good Flavor with the Fragrance too
review/text: Rich and smoky. This is a good French Roast. The packaging allows you the fragrance of the ground coffee, which you don't get with standard K-cups. A box of 36 comprises three sealed plastic bags of twelve cups each. They are not resealable, so after I open a bag, I put it into a plastic storage container to preserve freshness. San Francisco Bay Coffee's K-cups will remind you of what it used to be like to open a coffee can. If you miss the rich coffee smell, but you don't use a basket accessory or one of the reusable K-cup accessories to hold your choice of loose ground coffee, consider giving this a try.

review/summary: Wonderful surprise
review/text: When I noticed the packaging for this coffee, I was reluctant to order it.  Because the price was so reasonable I decided to give it a try.  Surprisingly, it was at least as good as some of the coffee in typical packaging, and was much better than others.  Immediately, I revised our "Subscribe And Save" to receive this instead of what we'd used previously.  I've made converts of my sister and my mother, both of whom use this now instead of there former brands.  Everyone who tastes it loves it.<br /><br />I failed to mention that we've been using the San Francisco Bay "frustration free packaging" coffee for about six months -- both French Roast and Fog Lifter.  Besides the coffee being delicious, we have had absolutely no problems with our Keurig machine becoming clogged or finicky.  Prior to that, for two years, we held our breath each morning wondering if we'd have to resort to the paraphernalia of paper clips, needles, etc,. in an attempt to make a cup of coffee.  We'd even returned two brewers due to the problem.  Now... a perfect brew every time.

The mesh body works great - great coffee flavor.

review/text: I shouldn't label myself a coffee connoisseur, but I know bitter when I taste it. I have been testing different coffees in my new Keurig and can honestly say that this coffee is the worst of them all, thus far. No matter what size cup I brew or how much creamer and sugar I add (I normally do not use cream/sugar) the stuff in the cup goes down the drain. What a waste of money. Don't do it... If you can find a small test trial go for it, but don't invest on the 80 k-cup box because you are throwing your money away! Bleh!<br /><br />If you are worried about recycling, use the plastic k-cups to start seedlings in and punch a couple more holes in the bottom so the roots can absorb water. San Fran French Roast is garbage.

review/summary: San Francisco Bay Coffee costs less, tastes richer
review/text: We've been buying San Francisco Bay Coffee French Roast in whole bean packages at a warehouse store for years, mostly because it was less expensive than the better known brands. To our surprise, we like its bold flavor better than the other brands. I always thought higher prices meant better tasting coffee. Not true! When we bought a Keurig coffee machine last January, I was resigned to trading a taste I prefer and an outstanding value, for the single cup convenience of the K-cups, which meant buying the more expensive brands of coffee in K-cups. Fortunately, the SFB Coffee people have made a single serving cup which fits in Keurig machines. It has the same flat, round top as K-cups, but the cup portion is a mesh filter cup, not made of plastic as with a K-cup. The SFBC cups work just as well in your Keurig machine and with less waste. I take a 16-oz. travel mug to work each morning, and I find the flavor to be consistent whether I make 8 ounces or 16 ounces. My sister-in-law's husband calls himself a coffee snob. He tried the SFBC French Roast for the first time today and was blown away by its rich flavor. He's now a believer and has ordered his first case.

review/text: The price of the pods was very inviting compared to the Timothy's brand. I purchased the French Roast Decaf for my wife and the regular French Roast for myself. We both drink our coffee black and found it favorful and not at all bitter. I highly recommend San Francisco Bay French Roast.

review/text: 5 Stars on flavor. I was concerned about the design of this 'Kcup' but its sturdy. The only thing that would make this coffee better would be if the packaging was resealable. Its annoying that I have to put them in their own zip lock once the plastic bag is cut.

review/text: When reading the other reviews, I was hesitant to get it, but I am glad I did!  The smell from opening one of the mini bags in the box was amazing, definitely proving it to be a "French Roast."  The taste isn't as strong as other French Roast coffees, but that's fine with me.  This brews up perfectly in my Keurig, and tastes amazing!  I definitely would recommend it, especially if you don't like the stronger French Roast blends.

review/summary: San Fran Bay Coffee
review/text: I was pleased with this brand of K-cup coffee.  Instead of coming in a small plastic (not very green!) container it comes in a mesh-like pouch making the coffee flow through it easier.  i have a hundred dollar Keurig machine and it stopped making coffee from the plastic containers.  Coffee everywhere.  i was ready to throw it out in disgust until i tried this new model of single brewing cup.  The taste is bold, although I prefer bolder, but it is fresh, dependable and works everytime.

review/summary: best coffee for the Keurig brewers
review/text: I had given up on the Keurig after trying several different coffees as it always lacked in strength and flavor.  I had tried many varieties of the various branded versions of Green Mountain Coffee, aka all K-cups are packaged by Green Mountain.  I finally retired the brewer after the last bad cup having a distinct plastic taste, to a shelf in the basement. Then walking through Costco came across these pods, and different is better!  They seem to have more coffee grounds resulting in stronger coffee, are less expensive, and your beverage is not brewed through a plastic cup.  By far the best coffee for the Keurig and I am looking forward to trying some of the different roasts and blends and really glad to see they are available through Amazon Prime, as Costco is often there one minute gone the next trip.

review/text: We bought a Keurig a few months back and once we were through the packs that came with the machine (Costco combo pack), we chose these because they make great coffee and fill up the trash can much slower.

review/text: Delicious rich French Roasted coffee in 8-kcup vacuum-sealed bags. The kcup is mesh rather than plastic so the water is not funneled through a small hole but throughout the coffee, making for a much more robust taste. The price is reasonable, too. If you're a Caribou fan, you'll love this coffee -- and it's cheaper!

This one really fills the bill. By the by I drink it black so I get the taste of the coffee not some milky mess. I will buy this one in the future.<br /><br />The format of the coffee is also interesting. Not your usualy K cup. I have not had any problems with the packaging. Seems to work just fine.<br /><br />To end this where it should be the coffee is great tasting.

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: We Bought this product at a local warehouse store in the 80 count box strictly because of the price. We had never seen or heard of them before, so were a bit skeptical, but had no opinion, good or bad. I read reviews after the purchase, because I liked it so much, I came to Amazon because I wanted to see if I could order it online and save us a trip, and I got a real chuckle out of some of the reviews. I'm not sure of why the product got such bad reviews from some people. Yes, it is a strong coffee,and maybe too strong for some people, even our son said it was "stout", but we first brewed it on the smaller settings. Now we brew on the largest setting, and have had no problems with it. Also, because of the design, we put the cups in an airtight container to help keep them fresh, so don't store them outside in one of the many K-cup holders that are popular. In the end, I guess it really is true that if you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one, and I'm sure there are those in the internet world who could make a career out of complaining, but I would recommend the product to anyone, with the caviat that it is a bit on the strong side, and to be aware that taste is truly subjective, but I think overall, It's a good product and the price is great.

I was a little skeptical to try this one as the packaging was so different then all the others, and the price was so good.  So glad we tried it!!!  We like the flavor (we prefers bold) and the rich taste and smell.  The only thing we didn't like was it shipped UPS and we had to sign for it.  Took 3 extra days to meet up with UPS and sign. Like previous reviews make sure you put them in a ziplock bag.  We will be buying this on a regular basis!

review/text: I hesitated buying these quasi K-cups fearing they would not have good flavor, not fit right or spew grounds into my cup.  All those concerns were unfounded!  I have tried just about every dark roast coffee put into a K-cup and this is the best and at half the price...that is called value.  I have purchased hundreds of items on Amazon and this is the first one I felt compelled to review because I assume others have the same "it is too go to be true" feeling that I had.  Now I am going to use the subscribe and save feature and save a little more.

review/text: We liked these so much we did the "Subscribe and Save" option. They are a bit bolder than the average K-cup. Good taste, balanced flavors. Every once in a while, because they are not the traditional plastic K-cup, but rather with a mesh type of thing holding the coffee, they got stuck in the brewer. This was only a minor inconvenience and not a big deal at all.

review/summary: Good coffee at a great price
review/text: This is a good deal for a good cup of coffee.  My wife and I enjoy both the French Roast as well as the Fog Chaser K-cups. At just about $0.41 per cup (subscribe&save price), I haven't been able to find a better deal anywhere else. But don't think these are just cheap coffees, I'd put these two San Francisco Bay coffees in my list of favorites for sure. There may be better coffees available depending on your taste, but you're going to pay more for them, guaranteed.<br /><br />The SF Bay cups are a bit different than your typical k-cup and actually I would consider them a bit more environment friendly. While the top of the k-cup remains similar to other K-cups, with a puncture foil top and plastic ring, there is no plastic shell or 'cup' around the base and filter. Instead, the filter is exposed. For this reason, the coffee is exposed to air when you first open the bag.  Fortunately, the 36 cups come wrapped in 3 separate 12-packs. Once we open a pack, we transfer the cups to a ziploc to keep them fresh...no biggee, and still worth the savings.<br /><br />Buying this versus another brand on Amazon or at Sam's club saves us about $20 a month since we drink about 4 cups a day. So our day to day coffee remains this and Fog Chaser, and on occasion, we'll splurge for something a bit different.

review/summary: Good almost-K-cup concept, don't like this flavor
review/text: **See update below**<br />First, I want to say that in general I very much like the San Francisco Bay "One Cup" coffee products - their Fog Chaser and Rain Forest blends are two of my favorite K-cups.  As has been mentioned in many other reviews, they don't look like "normal" K-cups, but they work in Keurig brewers.  Never had any problems with the brand or the innovative cup design.<br />I also like Amazon's Frustration Free packaging option - between that and the reduced plastic in the cup itself, this is a good less-waste alternative, and the price is great.<br /><br />However - I really don't care for this particular French Roast variety.  I'm not especially picky about coffee - I like a variety of brands, roast styles, and flavors.  Specifically, I tend to prefer "Dark" and "Extra-bold" K-cups.  But this particular French Roast just doesn't work for me.  Some of the cups have been worse than others, but I find the coffee to be especially bitter, with a very distasteful burned flavor.  With most coffee, I can enjoy it black, but I usually add just a little bit of cream and sugar.  For this variety, I have to add an extra slug of cream, which balance out the bitterness just enough to be "OK".  With this amendment, they're not quite bad enough to throw away, but I definitely won't be purchasing more.<br /><br />To summarize: SF Bay K-cups are great - if you stick to the non-French Roast varieties.<br /><br />**Update: After receiving the prompt comment on this review from SFBay's customer service, I gave them a call.  I immediately talked to a real person at the company (not some random call center), who was very helpful and communicated clearly.  This helpful rep was primarily focused on making me happy with their coffee, and to that end, he sent me three replacement bags of different varieties (which I knew I liked) at no cost.  I've tried those and, as usual, they're excellent.  He was also concerned that there might be something wrong with the batch or roast that I had received, and provided me with a pre-paid label to return the old coffee so they could test it.<br />So I'm still not sure whether I got a bad batch, or whether I just don't like this flavor.  Hence my 4/5 stars.  But either way, with customer service of this caliber, it's DEFINITELY worth trying the coffee!  Highly recommended.  My review was therefore changed from 2 stars to 4.

review/summary: Good alternative to "K-cup"
review/text: My local Costco has them for $25.99.  Also, my local tax is 8% here in CA.  That brings the total to $28.07 which is actually more expensive than the subscribe and save price here and I don't have to go borderline insane with cart rage at Costco.  But I understand that I may have a unique situation not having to pay taxes on Amazon purchases but on local purchases I do.  Some may have no sales tax or may have to pay tax on Amazon purchases.  With the S&S this is way better than the other option (IMO). With that being said, it is an excellent bold coffee at a good price.  There is a little bit of residue at the bottom of the coffee cup when I am done but nothing major.  With some of the "make your own cups", I ended up with a gritty and terrible last drink which deterred me from wanting to use those things.  I even bought a burr grinder in the hope that with a coarser grind I wouldn't get that but it still had a terrible last swig.  With these, I don't dread that last drink and only notice a little residue on the bottom of my dried cup.  These are now my "go to" for the Keurig.

review/text: I just received these 'k-cups' a few days ago. I ordered them on subscribe and save because of the value. I failed to read all reviews, just a few to make sure they were good. When I opened the package, I thought I was sent a wrong item...until I realized these are k-cups, but not the usual looking ones. They are foil sealed with a plastic ring around the top, and the rest of it is a filter. When placed in the brewer, just a hole gets punched on the top, not bottom. Something new perhaps? I tried a cup and I admit, it was very good coffee, full flavor. I will purchase these again and do recommend them. These do arrive in a shipping box, but the k-cups are sealed in plastic bags.

review/text: With the recent price hikes for K-Cups, I was starting to question the value of using my Keurig anymore. I saw the San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCups on Amazon and was intrigued by the price and the unusual design. I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the coffee. The only downside I have experienced so far is that the pods do need to be stored in a zip-lock baggie since they are not airtight.
