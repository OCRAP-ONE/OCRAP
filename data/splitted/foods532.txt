review/text: These are a fave of my mom as well as Myself . I just love these cause they do really taste and smell just like a chocolate glazed donut. Just brew it up add your fave sweetner or creamer or milk or whatever you like and you will think your eating the thing it was named after. I will def be back for more of these. I can't seem to find them in my local area .I did find them in a store in syracuse ,ny but that's a distance I  know next time I order i will order the double box for sure these go over good here.

review/text: What's not to love about a chocolate glazed donut... without all the fat and gluten? Well, don't get your hopes up that this will take you to that place of guiltless indulgence. However, it's still great coffee and has just a hit of chocolate scent to it.  I added sweetener, a little instant cocoa powder, and half-and-half, and THEN it was more like a chocolate glazed donut.  Still good coffee, just wish the flavor was stronger.

review/text: My dad has become addicted to flavored coffees since someone sent him some as a gift. The problem is that he drinks at least 6 cups per day.  I've purchased many flavors to determine what he likes best.  This is one of his favorites.  It isn't one that I particularly care for but I do love that it comes in a larger size than I can get from the manufacturer of my coffee machine.

review/summary: It's OK...just
review/text: This is one of those that I purchased based solely on the name (who doesn't like chocolate glazed doughnuts?) and my experience with their Cinnamon Roll coffee (which is very enjoyable).  The Chocolate Glazed Donut coffee from the Donut House Collection is okay but just barely.  It does have a chocolate doughnut taste but somehow the chocolate and coffee tastes seem "stratified" and not quite blended.  (I sometimes put chocolate in my coffee so the combination is not unusual to me.)  The coffee roast seems a trifle thin compared with others.  Overall, it is a fun novelty but not one that I would have to purchase again.

review/summary: Om nom nom
review/text: I'll admit that it's been a while since I've had real chocolate anything as far as donuts go, so I'm probably not the best person to tell you if this really tastes like a real chocolate glazed donut. I can tell you that it's pretty freaking delicious.<br /><br />I admit that I wasn't expecting much from the chocolate department. I've tried their basic donut house coffee, so I knew that at the very least I'd enjoy the base coffee flavor. While I'll admit that the chocolate flavor isn't nearly as strong as the scent makes it seem like it'd be, you can definitely taste the chocolate here. It's just strong enough to let you know it's there without being too strong. I will warn you, it is not the same flavor as drinking a coffee/expresso beverage with chocolate in it. If you go in here expecting that, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />Other than that, this is something I really can't wait to try again and something I'll absolutely purchase again in the future.

review/text: Let me start off my review like I start off all my coffee reviews by saying I don't like coffee. However since I am on a diet and this is pretty much the only thing I can have in the morning I was going to suck it up and learn to love it. Well...Donut House Chocolate Glaze Donut was easy to LOVE. I absolutely LOVE this coffee. With just a couple packs of Truvia (I can't have creamer) it taste just like a Chocolate Glaze Donut. I was so surprised how good this coffee was; I would look forward to getting up in the morning so that I could make me a cup to take to work. I'm only 20 minutes away from where I work and the coffee it gone by the time I make it there; enough said.

review/summary: I really wanted to like this...
review/text: I really wanted to like this flavor and drank the first 4 before giving up.  The donut 'flavor' is chemical-ish and the chocolate is more of a smell than a taste.  It's not completely undrinkable (thus 2 stars, not 1); it just isn't good or enjoyable.  I wanted to try the Donut House Cinnamon Roll too, but am afraid of similar results.<br /><br />I am now looking for a K-Cup buddy to trade with or give away the balance.  I wish Green Mountain Coffee (makers of Donut House) offered small trial packs with 1 or 2 K-Cups of various flavors.  I bought the 24 pack online because I couldn't find it locally; perhaps that should have been a hint!<br /><br />As for recommendations, Green Mountain Coffee's breakfast blend and decaf are great!  GMC's Half-Cafe is EXCELLENT, just right for after dinner!

review/text: After trying the donut house regular coffee, I wanted to try other flavors they offered. This was my first venture for other flavors and I was a little disappointed. Yes, it has all the wonderful flavor of the regular and I was expecting a bolder cinnamon flavor. Sadly, very little of that cinnamon came thru. Good coffee but not the wondrous flavor I hoped for. Now I am reluctant to try the other flavors.

review/text: Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut Coffee:  The smell when the container is opened is mouth watering.  Sadly, the flavor is just so-so.  Does not taste like chocolate or donuts, kinda undescrible.  I still add sugar and lots of non-dairy creamer to sweeten it up.  Was hoping this "glazed donut" would have a sweet flavor that could stand on it's own without adding calories with these condiments.  Will not purchase again.

review/summary: The donut is subtle
review/text: Taste is subjective, but to speak for myself, I REALLY like this flavor.  It is an actual coffee K-cup, unlike some of the "mocha" K-cups that I've tried, which were instant coffee and cocoa mix in a cartridge.  There's actual coffee grounds and filter in this one.  To answer another poster's question, mine came with 24 (not 18) cups - and I do plan to purchase this again.  Probably in a couple of weeks.  (We just got our Keurig a few weeks ago, and I'm buying a bunch of different K-cups to see what we like.  Consequently, I have a huge stack of coffees to go through before my next purchase.)  I like this one - the chocolate taste is subtle: it's not a mocha, and to play off of the official description, it's not like a donut which has been dunked in coffee.  It's more like a regular (but tasty) coffee that a chocolate donut has been dunked in. You get a coffee taste, with a chocolate aftertaste... which tastes better than it sounds.

review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/text: I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10.

review/text: Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. It's hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. Sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. Bag size is good. BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10.

We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house, we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite, never enough bags to get us to our next shipment. I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself!!!

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

review/text: These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

review/summary: Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good
review/text: Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Very thick chips.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/summary: A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor
review/text: I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!

review/summary: Convenience at low cost
review/text: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)

review/text: I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.

review/text: In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.

review/text: I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips.

review/summary: Crunchy, salty, sweet...finally, a Superbowl snack that scooores!
review/text: These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.<br /><br />These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips.

review/text: They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime.

review/summary: Best sour cream & onion chip I've had
review/text: I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

review/text: I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.

As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get.  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming. The flavoring included garlic, ginger, jalapeno, cilantro and other spices, and it just felt great to eat these. I will buy these again. These were a treat.

The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.

review/summary: Tangy, spicy, and sweet- oh my!
review/text: Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet, savory and spicy-- everything you'd want in a good meal or better yet...a potato chip.  Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.

These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me...
