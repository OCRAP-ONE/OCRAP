review/summary: For Flavor YES, For Heat... Nah
review/text: The flavor on these little suckers is great, but there isn't a HEAT. More of a warmth. I ate a few of these out of the jar and was surprised to find how mild they are. However, I do like to incorporate these into recipes with other peppers because I find that they add some good depth and help to round out the heat in a spicy dish.

review/text: The product picks up the poop and empties very well (have a large dog) but the plastic pull up handle always breaks between 3-6 months.  If the product would last longer it would be a great value for the $$$$.  Seems to me for very little money the product could vastly improve it's longevity.  This seems to be a wide spread problem, at some point nobody will be left willing to pay $12-$15 for a product with such a short useful life.  Good function, lousy longevity.

review/summary: Works great & has held up well
review/text: We bought this very product from Amazon 2 years ago and it's been great!  We've used it every single day (sometimes more than once a day) and haven't had any problems with it whatsoever.  We've got big (100+ lbs) dogs too.  Nothing has broken.  Our dog-sitter uses it when we're travelling, and she hasn't had any problems with it either.  We store ours on a tree branch outside, so the rain and dew can help keep it clean.<br /><br />We've owned several plastic pooper-scoopers in the past (can't remember the brands), and they all eventually broke at the pull lever, just like the other reviewers described.  We used duct tape to patch them up for a bit longer.  I don't know if this is a different brand or we just got really lucky, but this one absolutely works great and has held up perfectly!<br /><br />The truth is, this is a so much better system of collecting doggie poop than anything else we've used over the years, that I'd continue to buy them even if I knew they'd eventually break.<br /><br />By the way, this review is legit - - I have no affiliation whatsoever with Amazon or the manufacturer or any other pet product.  I'm just a satisfied user. :-)

I love it because it has the full flavor you need when making exotic dishes.  I get tired of the Americanized flavors and I get bored making the same old dishes. So I look for authentic African, Island, and Indian dishes. So far, this is the best Curry Powder I have used. I'm liking grace foods because they have the ingredients that help you cook.

I am giving them four stars instead of five because they are so expensive-- I suppose all sun-dried tomatoes are expensive, but I hold out hope they will come down in price.

The all-in-one mix means no adding eggs or oil, just water, to make a quick batter, and the mix is surprisingly low in fat.  The pancakes cook up fluffy and delicious, and I have a quick hot breakfast ready in the time it takes to brew a cup of coffee with my Keurig one-cup brewer.  Nice to know that a breakfast treat can also have some good nutritional value and fiber, too.<br /><br />I've signed up for subscribe and save on this to keep it coming, and at a substantial savings over grocery store prices.

review/text: This tea works!.  While it seems expensive it is cheaper than medication and it has no unpleasant side effects.  I keep a supply in the refrigerator and drink a cup a day.  It is not perfect - it does not eliminate the problem totally - but it does reduce "accidents" by about 90% which is a dramatic improvement in quality of life. It is a little bit of a pain to make because you have to boil it, let is steep then strain and store it, but it is well worth the trouble.

review/text: I literally  spent a month reading reviews and doing research about Camu Camu powder . I finally made my purchase about a month ago and I'm beyond satisfisfied! Before using this organic/all natural vitamin C I wasn't really taking any other vitamins either. I would usually just make do with whatever comes in my vegan protein powder but then my allergies didn't get any better. Barely a day after using Navitas Naturals Camu Camu powder, my allergies started diminishing....now, it's like a different me! Watery eyes, stuffed up nose, itchy throat and ears all gone! And I don't use but  a quarter of a teaspoon in my water, that's a dash and a dash is all it takes. This vitamin C is potent in many ways than one. Pricey but excellent, a tad bitter but add any juice of your choice and problem solved! I personally prefer water.<br />Highly recommend!!!

It does not dissolve at all in water and it leaves a brown residue on your face.  I just decided to eat it in yogurt for the health benefits.  When you look online for homemade vitamin c serum recipe, many sites suggest camu camu powder is the best.  Well it is not.  Your skin cannot even absorb it because it doesnt dissolve well in water or glycerine.  If you want to make a serum use either L-absorbic acid or regular absorbic acid.  I probally won't order again because it tastes awful in yogurt, I just don't want to waste my money so I force myself to eat it because it does have great vitamin c health benefits.

review/summary: Cottie seems to love this food
review/text: (ASIN: B004LWGLQ0)  Cottie is a little cat, approximately 10-12 pounds of love.  I buy 1-2# bags of food so he gets a balance of those foods he refuses to eat in canned form.  With the smaller size, I also keep him from being bored with his diet, which I understand can be a problem for cats.  The larger bags are more economical, but they would hang around for too long, and he would tire of eating what's in them.<br />This is the latest newbie; they are all kept together in one of these huge storage bins with a top that secures very well to the bottom, keeping food fresh and bugs out.<br />I have taken to writing a note for each bag, stating the dates he was fed and what went in bowl #2 (there is no bowl #3, for those of you old enough to recall daytime TV of old.)  The only other thing I could add to this recommendation would be if I were to observe him eating it, and make yet another note of the date he finished the portion.  And do the same for a couple of other foods for comparison purposes.

review/text: I heard some people complain that their rooibos tea smell evaporates when they buy it in bulk in a paper bag. The tea comes in a great metallic container with a lid that seals tight. I kept it on a kitchen counter for about 2 months after opening it and it was fine. In fact, my tea expired in 3 August, 2010 and I just opened it up in February I think, still great smell and taste. You want to use some kind of fine sifter (tea holder) as the particles are pretty small if you never had this kind of tea before.

This plant has been listed as a medicinal plant based mostly on anecdotal evidence.<br />AIMS OF THE STUDY:<br /><br />Despite a long history of traditional use in South Africa, very little scientific data are available from controlled clinical trials confirming its popular use. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of rooibos on biochemical and oxidative stress parameters in adults at risk for cardiovascular disease.<br />MATERIALS AND METHODS:<br /><br />After a washout period of 2 weeks, 40 volunteers consumed six cups of fermented/traditional rooibos daily for 6 weeks, followed by a control period. Blood biochemical parameters indicative of antioxidant activity and content (total polyphenols), lipid peroxidation (conjugated dienes - CDs, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances - TBARS), redox status (total glutathione - tGSH, ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione - GSH:GSSG), lipid profile (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein - LDL and high density lipoprotein - HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels) and liver and kidney function were measured at the end of each study period.<br />RESULTS:<br /><br />Plasma antioxidant capacity was not altered, but plasma total polyphenol levels increased significantly after rooibos consumption compared with the control levels (from 79.8�16.9 mg/L to 89.8�14.1 mg/L). Significant decreases in plasma markers of lipid peroxidation were found after rooibos consumption, as reported by levels of CDs (167.3�29.5 nmol/mL vs. 108.8�20.1 nmol/mL) and TBARS (1.9�0.6 'mol/L vs. 0.9�0.3 'mol/L). Reduced glutathione (797�238 'mol/L vs. 1082�140 'mol/L) and the GSH:GSSG ratio (41�14 vs. 76�17) were both significantly increased after consumption of rooibos. The lipid profiles showed that rooibos consumption, compared with the control values, significantly decreased serum LDL-cholesterol (4.6�1.3 mmol/L vs. 3.9�0.7 mmol/L) and triacylglycerols (1.7�0.8 mmol/L vs. 1.2�0.7 mmol/L), while HDL-cholesterol (0.9�0.1 mmol/L vs. 1.2�0.2 mmol/L) was significantly increased.<br />CONCLUSION:<br /><br />Confirming its popular use, consumption of fermented, traditional rooibos significantly improved the lipid profile as well as redox status, both relevant to heart disease, in adults at risk for developing cardiovascular disease.<br /><br />Copyright � 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

review/text: We love these--amazing strawberry flavor with a fun, crispy texture. These help us get through the winter doldrums. Yes, they are expensive but so really so are the flavorless supermarket strawberries that we can get in these parts for most of the year, especially when we have to throw away a good bit of them since they are always partially rotting. The amazon price is better than at local stores in our area.

review/summary: Not what was expected....lots of pretzels with no flavor delivery
review/text: I really enjoy snack and trail mixes but was rather disappointed with this mix.First of all, the front of the package states peanuts,cajun sticks, pretzels, more cajun sticks and then almonds.<br />The package was opened and it was mostly pretzels,cajun sticks, some peanuts and 7 almonds. The flavor was not that strong either. I purchased this snack made by Good Sense because the chipotle sunflower seeds are out of this world. This snack was not even comparable. I was really hoping for the flavor burst and it did not deliver.

review/summary: A tasty treat that's priced reasonably!
review/text: I've been a fan of Jelly Belly for a long time and just recently noticed Gimbal's Jelly Beans on Amazon recently. I'm glad that I did because Gimbal's Jelly Beans closely, very closely, rival Jelly Belly as far as taste goes. On a scale of 1 to 10 I rate Jelly Belly as a 9.5 and I rate Gimbal's Jelly Beans as a 9.1. But as far as the price goes, Gimbal's Jelly Beans blow the always overpriced Jelly Belly's out of the water.<br /><br />The next time that I buy jelly beans I will be considering both taste and cost. I think that with the taste of Gimbal's Jelly Beans being rated so closely to Jelly Belly and the cost being far lower for the former, I will choose Gimbal's Jelly Beans--how about you?

review/text: I had been a Jelly Belly fan for a long time, but one day I picked up a bag of the Gimbal's Jelly Beans to give them a try. I have to say that I actually like them a lot better than Jelly Belly!<br />I find the candy to be softer and the flavor variety is great, not to mention that the price is so much better. With 41 flavors there is a big enough variety to satisfy just about anyone without being overwhelming.<br />If you are a jelly bean lover, give these a try, you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Contains Corn Syrup Despite the Website's Denial
review/text: I puchased this container for Easter Baskets for my allergic to everything boys.  I couldn't get the recipe on Amazon which is odd because most things claiming to be good for people with allergies have the ingredients readily available.  In any event I went to their website which has toggles for the ingredients list but don't do anything when you click on them.  The site proudly boasts "No High Fructose Corn Syrup" though.  I sent an email query out and it's been a few days with no response.  The question was simple "Is there any corn product in the Jelly Beans or Sour Bunnies?"  I've never given a bad review but in light of the fact that the jelly beans' very fist ingredient is corn syrup at the very least for $25 they should taste as good or close to something like Jelly Belly.  They taste like Jelly Beans and nothing more, nothing gourmet.  There is nothing here to recommend you to pay that kind of money for them certainly not the service.

review/text: People have really gotten spoiled by those mushy gums that basically melt away in your mouth.  This is MANLY bubble gum!  It'll grow hair on your chest.  It actually tastes like bubble gum instead of fruity bumble bee saliva.  Just try to find a gum that could be a better representation of what Bubble Gum is!  You'll come crying back because you skinned your knee and your sister stole your bike.  Man up!  Get this awesome gum and keep your tears deep down inside.

review/summary: Honey I Shrunk the Bazooka
review/text: This approaches fraud. The formula has changed: the color is too dark and the taste is different. What flavor there is, only lasts a few minutes. The gum itself is shrunken, about 2/3 the size of the original. The cartoons are also shrunken, and require a magnifying glass to read. To call this "original" is dishonest. This scam is as bad as New Coke from the 1980s. Some cheapskate decided they could make more money? Some recent MBA graduate had a better idea? Disgusting. Returning to Amazon...

Half the corn is half the calories, so that it's less caloric than any other popcorn product except the tasteless soulless air-popped.

review/summary: Wonderful choco-salty candy bar!
review/text: When I first opened the package, I was struck by the smell of real chocolate; no surprise there, the first ingredient in this vegan bar is real dark chocolate.  The taste lives up to the smell.  Simply put, this tastes like a delicious choco-salty candy bar.  Regular candy bars aren't usually packed with 10 grams of protein, though.  It is relatively low in fat with 6 grams.  The sodium content, at 350mg, is lower than the taste would suggest.  This bar also boasts 2 grams of dietary fiber and 25% of the recommended daily amount of iron.  All in all, a great snack or dessert!

review/summary: Real licorice
review/text: You can get real licorice in New Zealand, Australia, Germany, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, England, Finland and even Denmark. But not in the US. We use anise oil. Real licorice is found in RJ's and it makes a huge difference. The flavor is akin to dark chocolate and very nice if you are a licorice fan.

review/summary: Great by itself, plus alternative uses
review/text: This candy is stupendous (it tastes divine with Coca-Cola, especially) -- but if you really like it, you must try dicing it into smaller pieces (pea-sized), and putting it in your home-made vanilla ice cream.  It does not work well with chocolate or strawberry, but a good rich vanilla recipe will really bring out the licorice taste and have you coming back again and again for more.  And as far as the Coca-Cola goes... well, try some of your new licorce-bit ice cream in a Coca-Cola float, and you'll think you're in heaven.

review/summary: Not a Winner
review/text: It is odd that my taste buds reported to me the opposite of the reviews here.  I'm disappointed by that, as I paid this premium price based on the 5 star reviews.<br /><br />I'm old enough to remember "old time" licorice that was sold for 1 cent (even 5 for a penny) and that is the flavor and consistancy that I was looking forward to when I purchased this licorice.<br /><br />I have some anise spice in my cupboard for baking, and I just tasted it to make sure that I didn't have my spices mixed up.  Based on that comparison; My verdict is that this licorice tastes strongly of anise (NOT licorice).<br /><br />I thought it was much too soft.  There was no "chew" to it.  It was mushy.  The only thing I can think to compare it with is a soft cheese, such as Havarti.  It is even softer than a mild chedder.<br /><br />Sorry... only 2 stars from me.

The solid tubular pieces are thick and of good satisfying size and chew but the flavor of real natural licorice is what makes this so special and addictive!

review/text: I first tried this licorice on a trip to Australia a few years ago, and have looked for it in the states ever since.  I only found it in one store, and that was in Berkeley, CA recently.  I am so happy to be able to get it from Amazon because apparently it hasn't reached any midwest stores.  It is the softest, freshest, and best tasting black licorice (my sister likes the red) I have ever tasted.  I can't eat just one.  A bag, maybe.

review/summary: Watch out, it's addictive
review/text: There are a couple of reasons that led me to try this product. I am very interested in wine, and I wanted to understand licorice taste and smell better, since this is present in a lot of reds. Most importantly, I have high cholesterol and I love dark chocolate, and a friend recommended this as an alternative since it is a much healthier option.<br /><br />I remembered trying the popular licorice candy you can find in grocery stores (i.e Twizzlers) and finding it repugnant. At that time I thought I did not like licorice, but I couldn't have been more wrong. This licorice provides a completely different experience; with a smooth texture and delicious taste, this is as good as eating the best dark chocolate available. I am planning to keep ordering this product for a long time to come.

review/summary: Best of the best!
review/text: I decided to embark on a journey to find the best black licorice out there simply for fun. I have tried panda, darrel lea, rj's, Australian black kookaburra, kokindjes from Holland, sweet Finnish, German licorice wheels and the wannabes twizzlers and red vines.<br /><br />All have their good and bad points, some are just awful, but this licorice is the best I have tasted yet. I combines just the right amount of sweetness with just the right amount of flavor. It isn't as strong as darrel lea, but a bit stronger than panda. The texture is spot on perfect and the aftertaste is clean and smooth without any bitterness. It is so tasty that I devoured four bags in five days! I love it!<br /><br />If you're in doubt, buy this licorice. If you want an 'old fashioned' flavor this should be your number one choice, darrel lea is number two. Either way, buy it and eat it! :)

review/text: RJ's is an excellent brand. The licorice is superb, every bit as good as Anton Berg's licorice fudge. However, I strongly suggest buying it from another source than Amazon. The product, which arrived today (August 24) has a "Best By" date of JULY 15, over a month ago. The candy was all mashed up and stuck together. Excellent product; very poor handling. I will not be buying this (or any other food product) from Amazon again.

But since  recently discovering RJs, I would have to say, if given a choice between a piece of the best dark chocolate and a piece of this licorice, hands down I'd be going for the latter. I was astonishly surprised with my first bite - wonderfully soft and intensely flavorful.  I enjoyed the fact that it didn't stick to me teeth or make me feel that I was having to give my mouth a workout to enjoy it.  Amazon offers this at a great price too.  I've paid considerably more.

review/text: I love real black licorice and saw this on sale in a local store so I bought a bag.  I know it said "soft eating" right on the bag but other brands I've bought have also been described as soft and had a much better texture.<br /><br />This stuff is really soft.  Like, Play Dough soft.  You can smoosh it and mold it.  It has the feel of something that is not quite cooked, like brad that is still way too doughy in the center because it wasn't baked long enough.  The taste is fine, not too strong but enough, but I just can't get over the texture.  I prefer something that has a little resistance when you bite it.
