review/text: As someone who has been at this for a very long time...wheat free that is... I have tried dozens and dozens of gluten free cookies.<br />A cookie-a-holic I have to have my morning coffee with a cookie.<br />Up until this point most of the gluten free cookies have been huge disappointments..<br />I have thrown more practically full boxes of cookies in the trash than I care to remember...they were just not worth the calories, they were that bad.<br />I do like Pamela's brand Biscotti cookies...but they are the only other cookie I've found good enough to spend the money on.<br />And lets face it prejudice abounds in the gluten free aisle...everything is outrageously expensive.<br />But these..they are lovely, crunchy, no grainy texture, no strange after taste, vegan, low calorie and low fat...actually a miracle of a cookie.<br />Most gluten free cookies are loaded with fat...and as I limit fat content that was another big draw back.<br />No problem here though, only 1.5-2 grams of fat per 4 cookie serving.<br />I have tried all 4 flavors and each is excellent, I don't think any would disappoint.

review/text: Dr. Lucy has created an absolute masterpiece. These cookies are delicious for everyone. There are so many additives in today's food, that it is nice to know that there is a product that is completely natural.  You also have the feeling that you can trust this product, since you know that she created this for her own child. The calorie count is less than other cookies, and it also does nto affect diabetics as significantly as regular cookies do. I highly recommend this product, as well as her other cookies. While I do love chocolate chip, my absolute favorite would be the cinnamon.  Enjoy!!

review/summary: What a Treat!
review/text: I have a son who is allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts; however, he can eat wheat.  We have tried lots of allergy-friendly products and are sometimes disappointed with the wheat-free ones as the texture and taste is often very different from products made with traditional ingredients.  That is not the case with these cookies.  They are by far the best allergy-friendly cookies that we have tried yet!  They have a nice, crisp (but not hard) cookie texture.  I was also impressed with the shelf-life on the cookies that we tried.  Many allergy-friendly cookies have a very short shelf-life, but the Lucy's cookies that we tried today didn't expire until October.  Way to go Dr. Lucy on creating an excellent allergy-friendly product!

review/text: As a relative of a child with severe food allergies, i have always struggled with what to serve when the child comes to visit.  Until i heard of (then tasted) these gems! Not only are they super safe for children (or anyone) with food allergies, they are delicious.  I find myself purchasing some just when i get a cookie craving.  they are hands down the best line of cookies I have ever had....Great flavor (you would NEVER know that these were produced with safe products rather than traditional cookie ingredients).  I think one of the hardest thing for parents and relatives and friends of people with allergies is finding GOOD, tasty foods...especially sweets.  If you have a loved one with a food allergy, i think you should stock these in your pantry (but beware, you will find yourself craving them as well!!!)

review/summary: Awful
review/text: As a mom with Celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy, I really wanted to like these cookies.  We are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food.  Wouldn't it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and I could grab on the go?  I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie. Although I would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards, I put that aside when reviewing this cookie.  I do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie.

They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.

It is yellow in color (almost the same as orange juice). I have not taste tested all the Kool-Aid flavors yet but Mango may be the best. The orange was good but tasted more like an orange drink rather than orange juice. Its color is orange like the outside of an orange, not the juice.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets to make it sweeter.

My new Maltese arrived Thanksgiving weekend with obvious signs of allergies (IMO): all four legs saliva stained (entire legs, not just feet), saliva stained face, excessive ear scratching, and biting, chewing at legs and paws. I tried other high quality foods before this but noticed the most improvement with this one. Feeding a total of 1 cup a day between 2 dogs, this bag lasts and is cost effective. Her staining is fading nicely, ear scratching is occasional and licking of paws is down 85%.

review/summary: Best baby food (we've) tried
review/text: I've been one to study labels on food packaging that I plan to consume, even more so now that I'm a father of two young ones. Prerequisite: No hydrogenated oils, high fructose, or preservatives. There are a few other ingredients but these are the main offenders.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised when I recently read an article on NurturMe baby food. The article linked to their site [...], so I spent some time perusing to learn more about the brand. For one, I thought the packaging was super appealing and a wonderful idea. Simple packets vs. glass jars, right up my alley. Secondly, I wasn't too keen on "quick dried" foods, but did some research on it and quickly found that through this method, the food maintains it's nutrients with no preservatives needed...passed my test. After ordering a few packets of each flavor (pea, squash, sweet potato and apple) on NurturMe's site, I received them a few days later and had both my babes try them out (5 mo and 26 mo's old). I used my wife's breast milk to reconstitute the sweet potato for the youngster and water for my elder babe and figured apple was a good start since he's a big fan. After pouring the contents of one packet into a small bowl it didn't appear there was much, however, after mixing it with the water and breast milk it turned into quite a good serving size. The first thing that really jumped out was how rich and vibrant the flavor of the food was - a great indicator that there's no preservatives. The smell was also right on target, as if I'd just sliced a sweet potato or apple. I gave it a try myself and said, "hmm, good stuff." I then gave the apple to my son and just let him get after it. After turning around from providing my daughter with the sweet potato, my son had literally gobbled almost every last bit of apple. The sweet potato would have been taken care of in the same way had my daughter's dexterity been at the level of my son. GREAT product.

review/text: I bought all the flavors of NurturMe offered on Amazon and we decided to try the peas first.  When I mixed the formula in, I could not believe how bright green the peas were.  I tasted them and they tasted like the freshest peas I ever ate.  I had only planned to throw these in the diaper bag for a quick feeding on the go with easy portability, but so far these are the only peas my daughter will eat!  Next we tried the apples and they were better than the best applesauce I've ever had.  I make my own baby food, and because many fruits and veggies arent the best right now, these powdered baby foods are better than what I can make homemade!  Every flavor has been as good as the last.  All are bright, colorful, and taste very, very fresh.

We have mixed them with breast milk, rice cereal, water, other baby food and other NurturMe food pouches.  They're great for at home or on the go.  On top of being very versatile, they are very tasty.  They actually taste like apples, sweet potatoes, squash or peas and are vibrant colors.  With the subscribe and save discount they are still pricey, but are at the best price you'll find.  I would definitely recommend NurturMe food pouches and just wish they had more foods available in these pouches.

review/summary: Maybe ok for a little pup, but monitor!
review/text: My 8 month old pit mix pup chews everything, including the landscaping, seat belts, and our English mastiff.  This product apparently has a wonderful flavor; he worked on it non-stop.  At 48 pounds he's a decent chewer, but certainly not the jaws of death, yet he managed to chomp off 1" sized chunks within 20 minutes.  I had to throw the bone away a half hour after opening it.  I didn't want to chance the good flavor tempting  him to swallow the pieces.<br /><br />That said, flavored Nylabone products are generally big hits here, so I quickly ordered two chicken flavored Soupers.  They don't offer the same satisfaction as being able to knaw off a piece and therefore are not chewed on as often, but they last years and have been a safe option in our house of many dogs.<br /><br />I'd recommend the Flexible Bones for little, really young pups and weak chewers.

review/summary: Not worth the cost for the amount of time they last. Plus, possible safety hazard to the dog.
review/text: I have a 35-pound 6-month old Keeshond, who I would classify as a "moderate" chewer. I bought her this bone because she enjoys chewing things with a little bit of "give," and the Durachew Nylabones seemed to be too hard to hold her interest for extended periods. Indeed, after some insecurity about this bone, my Keeshond took to it just fine. She seemed to enjoy lying on the floor, munching away on it for several minutes at a time. After the first session, I saw that her favorite chewing end had begun to fray, but the instructions stated that such fraying is normal and that the surface of the bone is designed to fragment into small pieces the size of a grain of rice, which are miniscule enough to pass through the dog's digestive tract without creating any dangerous or life-threatening obstructions.<br /><br />However, after only a couple more chewing sessions, I noticed that her favorite chewing end was wearing down to the point that nearly an entire nub was gone. Luckily for both of us, I never left her unattended while she was chewing on this bone. Earlier today, during one of her play sessions with the bone, I looked down and saw the bone lying on the floor, with my dog standing above it chewing on and trying to swallow something. The thing she was chewing on fell out of her mouth and I quickly swooped in to pick it up: It was a piece of the bone, substantially larger than a "grain of rice"--about an inch long by half an inch wide. Though I cannot say for sure that a piece of such size could cause a bowel obstruction, I did not want to take any chances. The packaging advises the dog owner to throw the bone away as soon as large pieces begin to break off, and I did just that.<br /><br />Look. My dog is not a Pit Bull. She is a Keeshond. Keeshonden are not known for being aggressive chewers. And, although I will concede that my dog definitely enjoys chewing on things, she is not more of a chewer than an average dog, and there is no world in which she can be considered a "powerful" chewer. This bone only lasted for a week of occasional chewing? It should have stood up to more punishment. I only gave it a second star because my dog genuinely seemed to like chewing on it. Otherwise, I consider this bone a safety hazard.<br /><br />If you do choose to buy this bone, make sure you always supervise your dog when he is chewing it so that you can stop him if he starts to break larger pieces off. The instructions probably only give this warning for the purpose of waiving the company's liability, but they are right.

review/text: My dog is a rescue and had really bad teeth so many of them had to be pulled. But even with just a few, she LOVES to gnaw on this. I love how focused she is when she get her nylabone... because she just really gets into scraping her teeth against it.<br /><br />I have bought several different nylabone flavors/types but she always seems to prefer the original and chicken flavor.<br /><br />I also follow the directions and steep them in chicken broth for a while so not sure it that flavor penetrates inside because I rinse it off after steeping.<br /><br />She seems to lose interest in them after gnawing off the nubs on one side... so they don't last too long. In less than a year, she has gone through 8 of them. I wish they were less expensive.  I have found that ordering directly from this vendor (entirelypets)-- you can usually find coupon codes to offset shipping costs.  In the end, much more reasonably priced than buying from the local pet store.

review/summary: Helped cat who had damaged intestinal tract become healthy
review/text: About 12 years ago we took in a kitten who liked to get into things like string, rubber bands, ribbons, etc. This is dangerous because these items can get twisted around their intestines and cause severe illness or death. We began to be very diligent about hiding these items from him by the time he was six months old. Unfortunately, by then so much damage was done to his intestinal tract because of all of his "unauthorized snacks"  that he had constant loose bowels, was too thin, etc. This went on for about seven years, until we moved to a new town and got a new vet who suggested Royal Canin Feline Special 33. Not only have his stools been firm (and not so stinky) for the past five years, but he has put on weight and has a lovely glossy coat.<br /><br />This food is pricey but, if your vet recommends it, it's a good value for your cat's longevity and also quality of life. Fletcher is much happier ever since he can eat without immediately having to visit the litter box.

review/summary: Ended Loose Stool
review/text: One of my cats had loose stool for 4 months, with little accidents daily.  The vet tried different treatments but none worked.  After a month of feeding her Royal Canin 33, she's been accident free since the first week and I've notice more firm stool in the litter box.  The cats seem happy with it too.

review/text: PJ is the male we kept from the 4 babies our little 'Sweetie' had.  He gobbles his food and then goes to throw it up.  We decided to try Royal Canin - special 33 formula at the advice of a friend with a cat with similar problems.  This has made a great improvement and even though he still slips up and gobbles too much and then drinks tons of water to help the process along, he is much improved.<br />We were thrilled to find the big bag for sale at Amazon.Com and bought it at a very competitive price.<br /><br />All of our cats are finickey eaters and we find they do like Royal Canin which was not true of another brand we tried.

review/summary: Definitely Recommend
review/text: My cat throws up when he's nervous and when he's introduced to new cat food or litter. I'm in my early 20's so I move each year when my lease is up. It takes him about 2 months to adjust to my new apartment and stop throwing up. I wasn't a good mother and would tend to buy whichever cat food was on sale bouncing between typical grocery store brands. After speaking to the Vet I realized I was hurting his stomach each time I switched food on him, and he's not getting enough nutrients because he's throwing up all the time. After he started eating Special 33 Formula I can tell he's feeling a lot better. He hasn't been throwing up (great news for my carpet too!) and he's looking healthier. It's more expensive than what I normally spend on food but it's worth it for his health.

review/text: I have been purchasing this cat food for almost five years now since my pure bred Rag Doll cat has had irritable bowel troubles.  We spent almost a thousand dollars on vet bills, testing, and they wanted to do a biopsy of his intestines.  We weren't going to do that, so I looked around on the internet to try some better foods for him, and after a few different types not helping, I tried this one.  His symptoms have been under control ever since.  He can only eat this food without loose bowels.  If he eats ANY thing else he has trouble, and we have a long haired cat mess!  I am so greatful for this food because I just love my cat!

review/summary: Really happy!
review/text: My cat really likes this expensive brand of food, so I spoil him. The other 3 cats I live with eat a much less expensive brand and you can totally see the difference. While my cat does weigh a bit more than the other cats, his fur is so soft and he has absolutely NO digestion or hairball problems. He also gets an A+ from the vet every time we visit. It's nice to spend the extra money for a perfectly healthy cat.<br /><br />While it is worth it, this food is definitely on the pricey side. On top of that, the price recently went up another five dollars at my local pet store. I've been ordering it off Amazon ever since then! I save over $5.00 on the bag itself and free super saver shipping really makes it great, since it saves me from having to make a trip to the store, and one 15 lb. bag usually lasts me about 2 and 1/2 months. So this is the absolute best deal. Really happy with this.

review/text: I almost didn't buy these because they are made by Pedigree, a company that makes HORRIBLE dog food. but I needed a dental treat other than a cookie type so i bought a pack. I really like the texture! AND the price. I can buy these at petsmart for $3-$4 a bag of 24. When they're on sale that makes them about $0.12 a piece, and at $4 they're about $0.17 each, good deal. My dog prefers the taste to greenies and have about the same ingredients. My dog accumilates plaque at an astounding rate so he gets a dental treat of some sort once a day, not always dentastix but i like this product and i'll continue to rebuy.

Morkies apparently are notorious for having bad teeth according to my vet.<br /><br />I got these for a lot less at walmart (less than 3 dollars). My husband says they smell good. Why he was smelling them is beyond me. They don't last as long as nutrident and I have to give 2 per day, so it ends up being more expensive, but Smoothie likes them and will follow any command I give him, just so he can get one.

review/text: I used to buy a bag of these like every couple of months for my two mini poodles... I loved these because they make their breath smell better and good for oral health. But on one  particular occasion I gave them each one and all of a sudden Mischa(my 2 year old poodle about 7/8 pounds)  starts jumping around hysterically and at first I didn't really pay attention to her I thought she was just excited but after a few seconds I knew something was wrong. She had one of these denta stix lodged in the roof of her mouth between the opposite sides of her teeth.. So I had to dig it out of her mouth... It was a very scary experience... Her mouth was bleeding a little from it being stuck in there. I don't know if I purchased a pack that was expired or if it had gotten stale... I have no idea but that was warning enough and I knew from then on I would not be purchasing any of those denta sticks again. Before this incident I loved denta stix but I was always uneasy about how hard they are but I know they are supposed to be like that in order to keep their teeth clean... But.. It scared the crap out of me and my little Mischa. It is weird because Pineapple ( my male mini poodle who is about 8 pounds and 3 yrs) has never had that happen to him when he has dentastix... But I just wanted to let you all know.. Just in case.. Better to be safe than sorry.

review/summary: Absolutely the BEST!!!
review/text: Before my introduction to this, I probably indulged - at a host's offering - in one glass of egg nog each Christmas season. One was enough, and I could have done without that one!  One day a friend dropped by, arms laden with holiday cookies and a can of Borden's eggnog. "Eggnog in a CAN?" I'd never heard nor seen of it before. When I poured it out, it seemed thin (as compared to the stuff in the cartons) and a bit more yellow (all those eggs, I guess). As I brought the glass to my lips, I was doubtful.<br /><br />What I tasted was a superbly smooth, perfectly spiced egg nog that surpassed anything I'd ever had. Now when I meet people who tell me they don't like egg nog, I tell them they just haven't had GOOD egg nog. It's pricey, but oh, my, it's so worth it. And like a previous reviewer stated, because it's canned and pasteurized, you can stock up and have a treat in July (as if it would last that long in my house!)<br /><br />Try making French toast with it (the recipe's on the can). I just wish it were easier to find. You won't be disappointed, trust us (as I speak for the previous two reviewers as well).

review/summary: Mixed Opinions
review/text: My girlfriend said this was one of the worst coffees ever and it needed four packets of sweetener plus rum to be drinkable.  I found it slightly better than average.<br /><br />The chemical it uses to make it decaf has been banned in Europe for some uses but the minimal amount remaining after the decaf process and the lack of effect in mammals other than mice has it still permissible in the U.S..  So far tests of methylene chloride have not linked it to any known disease, and given its volatility (it vaporizes at 104� F; coffee is roasted at over 400� F for at least 15 minutes, then brewed at 200� F) it seems hardly possible that any of the 1 part per million occasionally found in the green beans could end up in the consumer's cup or stomach.  The safer water brewed decaf process does seem to make weaker coffee. The products labeled "naturally decaffeinated" use a synthetic form of a solvent found in nature that has not had large studies showing possible health concerns.

review/summary: Not a miracle product
review/text: This product is interesting. It is not a miracle product. It cannot do everything egg white or gelatin does. I tried to make gelatin free marshmellows with it, and it did not remain stable. This stuff also imparts a strange off flavor to foods if used in sufficient quantities. The only good the product can do is help stabilize egg  foam. It does prevent egg  foam from weeping and helps it remain fluffy longer so if you are looking  for a way to make a better meriange than this product is a good choice but for everything else I find it falls short.

review/summary: Definitely worked for what I needed!
review/text: I was looking for a way to make vegan marshmallow fluff and was most definitely having a problem in doing so.  After talking to a few friends (one of which actually published a book http://www.amazon.com/The-Vegan-Girls-Guide-Life/dp/1616080922/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1336984170&sr=8-1 ) she recommended this stuff.  I found a recipe that also mentioned this versawhip as well, so I figured I might as well get it.  Leery at first because of the price, I'm glad I got it.  It made my fluff the EXACT way I wanted it and tastes delicious!  I left it in the mixer a little longer than the recipe said, and I'm so glad I did.  It turned the perfect color and consistency.<br /><br />Again, glad I bought this product!  I'll have it FOREVER since the recipe only called for 1 tsp and 1 tbsp.  I only wish it came in different sizes than just the 16oz one

review/summary: Very fresh, high quality oolong
review/text: I like to have tea at night when the days start to get cooler, and realized I was all out of my favorites. I balked at the prices at a certain common mall-based tea-seller, so decided to look on Amazon and found this 3-pack of tea. For the price, it's a good amount of tea, and since the packs are individually sealed, the tea stays fresher compared to one big bag.<br /><br />Inside the top lid is another, tighter lid, and popping that lid reveals a lovely oolong scent. The tea leaves are a good size and color, not burnt-looking or shriveled, and when you pour water on them they expand nicely. Brewing for 4 minutes in 200F water results in a very smooth, light tea -- brewing for 6-7 minutes gives you a darker, stronger tea, but still very smooth and tasty. I usually have some sugar in my oolong to take the edge off the bitterness, but this tea is high quality and I don't need to add anything to enjoy the flavor.<br /><br />Re-brews are also good, although due to the smooth flavor I only do one re-brew. For the price, I was pleasantly surprised by this oolong and can happily recommend it to fans of this kind of tea.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: What more can I say except that this is an excellent tea.  It comes double lidded to keep in freshness.  Upon first opening the lids, the scent of the tea wafted up to my senses, heady and delightful.  Very fresh looking tea that was rolled and pleasing to the eye.  Steeping in the heated water, the leaves danced their way open, a beautiful sight to see the large pieces of tea leaves suspended in fluid tea nectar. Be sure to use a see-through infuser/pot to watch the process come alive before you.  The Black Dragon Oolong tea has a rich, deep, yet not too heavy flavor ... not over-powering with brown sugar cubes and a splash of cream.  Was excellent with just a spoon of honey.  I have a 16 oz Ingenuitea Tea Pot that I steeped 1 teaspoon of leaves in.  I was able to get 3 separate brews from the 1 teaspoon of tea leaves.  Highly recommend The Tao of Tea brand!

review/text: The first batch of this I purchased about a year ago was great.  Complex, good presence, all around great oolong (darker style ti kwan yin, not the greener variety available through other makers).  The second batch I bought a few months back was subdued, by comparison.  I'm guessing my second batch was fairly old.  Bummer, cause I really liked the first batch and will now be hesitant to risk another purchase.  BTW, I have purchased several Tao of Tea oolongs through amazon and this was the only one worth purchasing.  Recently gave their chai a try, which was outstanding, but the oolongs are a different story.  If your going to give Tao of Tea oolongs a try, this is the only one I'd recommend you consider.

Just don't use /too/ much, as it is strong. If you don't like the kick, they offer other varieties too, but I definitely prefer this one.

I like having the different shapes and the Gemelli has become impossible to find in stores.  I think the shape is perfect for use as a side dish, for soups, and sometimes for sauce, although in that case I generally use the De Cecco spaghetti. It's a medium shape twist but more compact than Fusilli.  I found 10 boxes on Amazon.  However, they should have enclosed more packing as the outer box was damaged and several pasta boxes were partly crushed - but they weren't a gift.

It reminds me of summer, warm days and cold fresh fruit and cut grass. A good, basic flavor, that will be great for blending with other types of matcha.

review/summary: Way too much water&beans often overcooked
review/text: I tried these coming from an Eden-made brand (Earth Fare, a store brand at a buck a can vs the $2-3 for a small can of Eden's, which have their own issues if they are an old lot, which they often are at their costs, unlike the EF ones)...<br /><br />The thing I noticed first is WOW I am draining a lot. NEVER bother with the 25 ounce cans, btw; in trying those 3 times (3 separate lots, one I had forgotten I had, the known-extra being on sale for two bucks)... All 3 cans were over half liquid on top of beans that were not dry, actually the opposite despite 2013 expiration dates.<br /><br />I dislike the BPA since it isn't required for beans and ESPECIALLY because MOST beans are cooked IN THE CAN like cat food is... I am anxiously waiting for (recyclable here) Tetra Paks of both Muir Glen tomatoes (Those DO need a liner) and beans--pacific foods, any day now, cmon, you already do it with zip-tops on bean/lentil/pepper soup and such... That grunt ignored, my review is really a quality issue. They are so broken they need delicate handling, and then, they absolutely do NOT work for cold salad type things or chili (their chili beans, though, are good for some reason and not totally full of water; likewise, the beans with barley work great for soups/chili)...<br /><br />Black beans as a solo product apparently are simply harder to make; Eden's are all stuck together which becomes a major issue when they have been on a shelf for months; westbrae are full of murky water (seriously, when is a can of beans more water than bean?? I thought MAYBE it was like dry beans&water, but even if that isn't the case, there is still so much water it is ridiculous--in black beans in particular-- and why use dry ones instead of canning when fresh anyway? Even the old southern brand  Luck's does--or at least DID-- that; be sensible and have factories near the produce and voil&agrave;, the crazy lack of "localness" of it will only be them to us, not farm to drying place to warehouse to canning site to us!)

review/summary: 50% water in BPA cans
review/text: I bought a bunch of these at Whole Foods.  I used 25 ounce cans and couldn't believe how much water it was.  I ended up using up 3 to make the dish I wanted.  It was so watery and checked the label again.  WEll, I guess it's my fault for not reading it in the first place:  the first ingredient was water.  So here you have it.  This is what you can expect.  Just out of curiosity, I did weigh the 3 cans of beans drained.  3 cans gave me 38.7 ounces of strained beans (right after lifting strainer out of a bowl of beans and water, so there was no waiting to let the water drip).  If I did let the water drip for a few minutes I wonder how much less I would have gotten.  3 cans of beans on a label is 25 oz*3=75.  So my 38.7 oz is roughly half.  Now if you take that into account when you buy, double the price to see if it's still worth it.  Then add BPA (or take away "organic" label because if it's full of BPA IMHO it's no longer organic), is it still worth the buy?<br />I have a shelf full of these beans.  I bought a bunch to stock up on my emergency food and to get a bulk discount at Whole Foods.  I'm not sure what I'll do with them now.  I do eat organic and mostly from scratch, but once in a while I eat subway or at some restaurant when I'm low on food.  I am sure restaurants serve food with BPA so I might just treat my 9 remaining cans as my "dirty" emergency food to throw on rice when I can't spend much time to cook.  I will not buy it again.

review/text: I chose Westbrae's canned beans because they are organic. However, since then I've discovered that Westbrae uses cans with BPA in the lining. With BPA lining the cans and research showing solid levels leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams from infants to the elderly, I don't think the product can still be called organic! it isn't any better than products sprayed with pesticides, which can be washed off many foods (not all, though). Until Westbrae stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks.<br /><br />As additional information:<br /><br />I ordered a lot of food and other items when I made this purchase, thinking everything I ordered was from Amazon; but, while everything else Was shipped by Amazon, for some reason this one product ended up shipped by Nutricity.<br /><br />Nutricity charged more for the shipping than they did for the product, which amounted to $3.49 per can. At those prices, even without BPA in the cans' lining, these beans would not be worth that price!<br /><br />(I emailed Nutricity twice and they ignored me. I emailed Amazon twice, and after the second time, Amazon refunded the shipping charge due to "the circumstances" of the order.)

review/summary: Product from China
review/text: I have been ordering this product for my chihuahua for years. She loves these treats. The only reason I have stuck with these is because they are made in the USA. I just received 2 16 oz packages and read the label (Made in China). I am very disturbed by this finding and will be discarding all of these treats. I will no longer be ordering these in the future and neither will any of my Family and Friends. Amazon needs to look into this. I noticed a huge difference in the looks of the item and feel Amazon has let me down.

review/summary: Beware of Expired Product
review/text: When I received the "Pet 'n Shape" Chik 'n Sweet Potato treats in my Amazon.com package, I turned over to the label and I discovered that my package said, "Use By 03.04.2009." I am shocked that Amazon would ship out a product that went out of date two years ago. Buyer beware.

review/summary: She Loves Them
review/text: My dog loves them.  When you hand her one, she quickly takes it to the other side of the room presumably to prevent me from taking it away.  She is a small dog so I cut them in half.

review/summary: Healthy treat for heavy dogs
review/text: Low cal with no added ingredients, great for weight gain prone dogs. My dog has kidney disease and this treat has no phosphorous or added sodium. Good price for quality and quantity. Container is added bonus - product stays fresh and is reusable (I use it to pack dry dog food on short trips).

review/summary: Happy Little Dog Loves These!
review/text: My yorkie is bonkers over these treats. Every evening he gets this little twinkle in his eyes for treat time and will sit, heel, and pose like it's a show at Westminster. They are an amazing training aid. Although I am not one to make the leap to "trying" a doggie treat, these do smell like people-food when you open the bag.<br /><br />Other brands purchased at the local pet mega-store were hard and I worried about my little guy choking. They didn't smell as nice either. These are more flexible/chewy and he seems to enjoy them more than the other brands.<br /><br />I just placed my second order of Pet n' Shape Chik 'n Sweet Potato. Definitely worth a try.

review/summary: How to make a fantastic chai latte that rivals Starbucks
review/text: I read somewhere online that this Tazo Chai Concentrate was the key to making a chai latte that rivals what I can get at Starbucks for $4 a pop. I figured it was worth a shot. It took a few tries to figure out how to get it to taste just right. I use vanilla soy milk and put equal parts soy milk and chai concentrate in a sauce pot on the stove. I heat the chai and soy milk until just before it boils - I've found that if it boils, the tea gets a little funky and separates, plus it forms a skin that gets stuck on the pan and the cup that I pour the tea into. So I heat it just until it's hot, then I turn the heat off and use a whisk to whisk in air and make it frothy. It comes out exactly like I get at Starbucks! I love this product and will probably be setting up an automatic subscription when I figure out how often I go through a case.

review/summary: Really Good and Easy Chai
review/text: This makes a great and easy Chai -- just pour in and add milk!  I find the directions that say equal parts milk and concentrate to make the chai too sweet, so I just fill the cup 1/4 full with concentrate and use the rest for milk.  This is organic, but there is also regular and decaf available.

review/summary: THIS IS THE REAL DEAL
review/text: I love this brand!  The regular (non-organic) Tazo Chai is NOT nearly as good.  This Organic Chai is what Starbucks uses and tastes much better than similar brands.  I had to resort to buying it here on Amazon because they stopped selling it in grocery stores!  They only had it in stock for a very short time, so I am relieved to find it here.  After shipping it equals out to be almost $50 for 6 boxes, which is much more expensive than a store... but considering Starbucks costs over $4 for a Chai, this is much cheaper and more convenient.  I started craving Chai when I got pregnant and now that I have my baby, it's SO much easier to make a Chai myself rather than driving to Starbucks.

review/summary: Great stuff!
review/text: This stuff is amazing. You can have great tasting chai for a fraction of the cost. Just make sure you refrigerate them after you open them. It says so on the package, but it is printed in a weird place and very small.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys chai lattes. (Chai + milk)

review/summary: Boil away the water
review/text: This is NOT the same as what starbucks uses behind the counter. If you want that then you will need to boil this in a pot and evaporate the water. After you evaporate the water there will be half of the amount of chai mix left. Once you have done this, you can use 1/2 ounce for "one pump" of chai. So for example if I order from starbucks a "venti 10 pump no wanter chai" I would use 5 ounces of evaporated chai mix with 15 ounces of milk.

review/summary: Starbucks in my kitchen
review/text: I'm addicted to Starbucks Chai and found myself planning my life to get to a Starbucks each day. I also just added up all the charges and was a bit shocked by how much I spent a month on my beverage of choice.  The Tazo chai really tastes like like Starbucks.  I can mix it to my taste--extra spicy and have it whenever I choose without leaving my home or office.  It is perfect.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: I bought several different brands of the Chai concentrate from Amazon, as there are few options in my rural area's grocery stores.<br /><br />The Tazo Organic Chai is my favorite.  It most closely matches that served by Starbucks.  Only difference is it doesn't have the foam.  I've been told it is what they use.<br /><br />Tazo decaf is my second choice.  Strangely, it is not as good as the Tazo Organic Chai... not as spicy, but OK for drinking in the evening.<br /><br />The Oregon Chai Original is not as good in my opinion as the Tazo.  It is missing something.  Not enough cardamon or pepper or something.<br /><br />The Oregon Chai Sugar-free was very disappointing.  I was hoping there was a good sugar-free option out there as I'd like to avoid the daily calories from my Chai habit.  It just takes like plain tea with milk in my opinion.  It seems to mostly lack the complex, spicy flavor or the Tazo Chai.  Not sure why that is.  The sweetener should have no bearing on the other ingredients.  I have been unable to find any suitable concentrated, sugar-free Chai tea options.  Post if you find one.
