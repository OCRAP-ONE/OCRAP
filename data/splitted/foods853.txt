review/text: I dunno about you, but one of my favorite things when eating skittles is to combine the flavors to create different taste combinations. Unfortunately when doing so with this set of flavors the achieved result is the flavor of gag-inducing cough medicine. yuck.

review/summary: HONEY STINGERS ARE THE BEST
review/text: I cycle quite a bit and these definitely keep me fueled. I love the taste, texture, and the organic ingredients. The texture is somewhat chewing and slick. These don't get that, stuck in my throat feeling, like some of the other chews, gels, and bars. My biggest complaint is that they are so good, I have to keep myself from eating more than I should.

Delicious flavor and gives me the energy I need when biking or running for more than an hour. Lower glycemic index so not an instant roller coaster swing in blood sugar too.

review/text: I eat these on long runs and marathons.  They are small enough to chew and swallow easily.  They taste really good - but sweet.  They are easy on my stomach.  I like that I can eat just one or two at a time instead of a gel that is sticky to carry partly eaten. I learned about these from a friend who has several food allergies - but has no problem with these.

review/summary: These are the best brand of chews
review/text: My wife and I have tried many different brands of chews. Now we both exclusively use the Honey Stinger brand. My wife carries them on the bike and run portion of 70.3 and 140.6 triathlons. I carry them with me during ultramarathons. Here are a few reasons why we prefer Honey Stingers: taste, chewability, and storage behavior. Taste is obviously personal, but these taste the best to us. Chewability is important when you are racing. You need a chew that chews up easily so you can swallow them and move on. As a comparison, the Power Bar brand chews are very hard to chew up. Storage behavior is important if they are going to be in a package out on the course for numerous hours. These chews remain independent of each other so you can easily separate them and eat them as you wish.

review/text: I bought these energy chews for fathers day, part of a cycling basket I put together for my father. He loves them! There were 3 different biking snacks in the basket but he demanded to know where I got these energy chews from. He said they taste great, are not sticky, not too sugary, and gave him a little boost during his ride. He is making these a must for his rides. This is a great product, obviously a must for avid cyclists.

review/summary: stingers energy chews
review/text: I really like the taste of these energy chews.  I like eating them before a race.  I have a hard time eating them while running because they are slow to dissolve which is really nice for casual eating, but not while trying to get a quick energy burst. Chewing while running doesn't work well because the chew breaks into small pieces making it dangerous for aspiration.  MAke those two problems better and this would get a 5 star rating.

review/text: I am a runner and have tried many "energy booster" nutritional products.  This one (cherry) is my favorite for taste and consistency.  I can highly recommend the product itself.  However, while I am a loyal Amazon.com shopper (too loyal! LOL), do not purchase this product here.  I ordered two cases in anticipation of a heavy race season and they arrived REEKING of cigarette smoke.  The smell was nauseating.  As it was an edible item, it is not eligible for return so into the garbage it went.  Buy locally.

review/text: I first bought this peanut butter because I was looking for a healthier brand of peanut butter than the typical grocery store offered.  What attracted me to it was the fact that it was first of all organic, but then I also found that I could get it in a no-salt-added version as well...what a bonus!  I have to watch my salt intake to keep my blood pressure in-check, so this combination just couldn't be beat.  Then I tasted it - WOW!  It tastes like real peanuts, not some version of a mega-processed-what-used-to-be-a-peanut flavor.  It's pricier than standard peanut butter, but well worth it to get that close to nature.  To your health!

Ten servings per 10-ounce package, but I could eat two or three ounces at a sitting.  I love these tasty nuts.  A great snack that does not raise my blood sugar.  Try them at a meal served over salad, cooked vegetables, chicken, pork, fish.  Amazon's price is about the same as in the supermarket but with the added advantage that they're shipped to your door.

I originally purchased these from a grocery store,  but when they were out I checked Amazon and sure enough there they were. They are shipped with no shipping costs (with my $25 purchase) and are  cheaper than the price at my store!! My whole family enjoys the different varieties. My husband has begun to eat them on a daily basis for a healthy snack. I feel better having him eat these because I know these are even healthier for him than other packaged cashews I have found and he likes the taste.

review/text: Over the years I've had the pleasure of receiving jumbo cashews as gifts. These cashews, unless the USDA has changed their grading standards are not jumbo. Furthermore, the bags are uniformly filled with maybe 10% broken pieces some in half, others broken and split. The thing is, when you look at the broken pieces it's clear that they are not the same size or grade as the whole cashews. Cheat! The nuts also had a taste that was that of Cashews that have spent some time in warehouses. The nuts are not terrible, but the consumer is being cheated by paying a premium for a very average product. Not recommended.

I usually mix the mango in with oatmeal to sweeten the oatmeal naturally.  My daughter doesn't like to eat oatmeal plain.  I usually use one package over two or three days this way.  They are also great on the run.  I can throw a couple pouches in the diaper bag and take it out when needed.  She has eaten pouches on the subway, park benches, buses, etc.  She just sucks them up with no mess.

I don't have a whole lot of time to make my own baby food, but using this helps me get him some more variety.  It's pretty thin, so I can use it to blend with either avocado or spinach+banana.  It's also really sweet so it makes a pretty yummy combination!

I also prefer this packaging over Sprouts because you don't need a spoon to feed baby, just squeeze directly in the mouth.<br /><br />However, if I'm feeding at home, the best bargain is with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ER1D5U">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Pears, (6 months & up), 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.  Even if you don't do Subscribe and Save, it's a great deal, compared to the pouch style competitors.

review/summary: Good product - but not JUST pears.
review/text: I am a big fan of Happy Baby products but was really disappointed to see that this one (and perhaps others as well) had lemon juice among the ingredients. I don't understand why that is even necessary. Our son has very sensitive skin and breaks out around his mouth and chest whenever certain foods come in contact with his skin - and I bet that the lemon juice could be the culprit here.<br /><br />I just wish it wasn't so hard to find a product that had only what it says it has on the front packaging. The Amazon description didn't even say it.<br /><br />Word of warning for parents of kids with citrus allergies/sensitivities.

review/text: Both of my kids go crazy for these pouches.  They would eat several in a row if we let them.  With the little one you have to be careful so that she does not squirt it all over herself and she has made a big mess in the car a few times, but by 18 months she seems pretty good at self feeding with them. Definitely recommend these if you want something your kids will love and is hopefully good for them.

review/summary: not just baby food -great for quick use in kitchen
review/text: Too expensive for us to purchase at full price but got a great deal so bought two cases. Intended to use as baby food but our child wont eat purees very much so preschooler likes these in the car.<br /><br />While fresh fruit is best, these make a great substitute and are great in kitchen. Make an organic sauce for chicken. Put orange juice in pan (strong, closer to concentrate is best), add cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pouch of this puree. Another option is finely diced apples and applejuice. Makes a great, simple chutney. Just don't tell the family or your guests you served then "baby food" until after they rave about the meal!

review/text: I am the only one in the house who enjoys cutting up a fresh mango and getting messy. But sometimes I don't plan ahead and I run out of time to puree my mangos. I find this pouch a great solution. It is convenient to hold for my child and it gives her organic mango with no preservatives. If she can't finish it in one sitting (which is rare) I can screw the top back on and put it in the fridge for up to 2 days.

Great for cooking too, try it instead of oil! You can also add this to yogurt or smoothies for an added kick.

review/text: My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater. I started ordering all of the different flavors of the HappyBaby and HappyTot (which has the magic supergrain Salba in them)line through the automatic delivery service (which lowers the price/amazon mom's helps too) and I call them smoothies. My toddler gobbles these up and asks for more! Even the ones that are green bean, peas, pear, and salba. It's like a miracle! My baby eats them too, but not with quite as much enthusiasm. It makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and I don't need to break my neck trying to do it. Oh and they are wonderfully anti-messy. I shove a few in my purse when I know we will be out during hungry times.

review/text: I bought the 16-pack in May 2011 and the date on the label says "best by" May 2012.  Baby & I spent some time away from home this summer and when we returned in August, I opened one of these packs and the smell was of over-ripe spoiled mangos (with that wine smell).  They were fine when I purchased in May and baby loved it, but now I have 10+ packs that I need to throw away and Amazon won't let me return these.  Seems unfair when the label clearly states they are ok until next year.

review/summary: Fresh?
review/text: I bought a single pack of this first to try to see how this can possibly be called 'fresh mango' when it is sitting on a back shelf of a small corner grocery store in our area for i don't know how long. I opened it and tried it and unless we got a dud, real 'Fresh' mango when peeled cut into chunks and pureed will be a bright yellow or bright orange color, not a brownish color which is what this 'fresh' mango puree was. I am a real mango lover and personally feel this color and taste is what an over ripened mango that is going bad will look and taste like. After reading all the reviews i was disappointed, and my baby only had a teaspoon and didn't know any different since it was her first fruit. Also can you really classify something as 'fresh' when it can sit in it's packaging for a whole year? IMO the lure of this and similarly packaged products is basically the design of the packaging and the products easy accessability. As others say you can eat it on the go, while traveling and anywhere basically and the child can hold it, it doesn't create a mess, bpa free packaging easy all around. Other then that once opened it's only good for a day or 2 like a real fresh cut mango is anyway, only its not really 'fresh'..but since here on the northeast mangos only come around a few months out of the year and since most people don't have the time to puree their own fruits and veggies, these types of products are the only alternative, otherwise cubing and pureeing your own mango..now that's fresh mango! Hopefully i can find the time to start pureeing soon. Edit: tried another pouch and it wasn't brown it was more like a bright orange as a mango should be and it did taste good. Convenient to mix as it's texture is smooth but still will try and puree my own when mango season comes around.

review/summary: Tasty & Easy
review/text: Although the instructions on the back call for more ingredients (chicken, olive oil, & chicken broth sold separately), this soup is convenient and relatively quick.  It takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour from start to finish (including the prep, i. e. ingredient measure, chopping the chicken, etc.).<br />Don't let the "organic" marketing fool you--your soup WILL be tasty!  The spice mix is very well balanced--not salty, as one would expect from packaged or canned foods.  Ultimately, though, it's a mix, not a prescription, so you can add other spices to the broth to your own taste.  I added a few teaspoons of flaxseed to mine about 10 minutes before completion, and it lent a slightly nutty flavor to an already chunky, hearty meal.  With a little creativity, your fiber, protein, and starch come in one savory pot!

review/summary: Simply Delish!!!!
review/text: This tea is absolutely yummy! It has a smooth taste that meshes well my taste buds. It is also very relaxing and soothing. I do use two tea bags to get a stronger flavor, but it's definitely not necessary....I just like bold flavors.<br /><br />I plan on trying this with steamed vanilla almond milk and stevia, and a tad bit of agave nectar. I bet this blend will be just as tasty. I will update with my verdict after I try it.<br /><br />UPDATE: so I ended up trying this with the vanilla almond milk. I know I said it was absolutely yummy with water, but with straight vanilla almond milk, it was EXTRAORDINARILY delicious!!!! I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoy this tea :)<br /><br />So, I basically made this the way I would if using water.<br /><br />I put the vanilla almond milk into the tea kettle, along with some cinnamon, and let it heat until the whistle. Then I poured it over two of the tea bags. I also used some packets of stevia and a bit of agave to sweeten it.<br /><br />Again, very yummy. I love to get the salted caramel mochas from Starbucks, which is not the healthiest, but this tea I make totally kills my cravings. This is really good for me because I do no have to consume all that cows milk and sugar. My 6 year old daughter is in love with this blend as well...so it is kid approved.

review/summary: DON'T LET THE WEEDY SMELL THROW YOU OFF!
review/text: This was quite an impulse purchase for me (speedily delivered from the Pacific Northwest) though I was certainly looking for a quality black currant tea. And this has it -- and more. I haven't been a big fan of the taste of rooibos -- and the smell of this raw unfermented version is not so pleasant when compared to other teas and blends. But the ingredients are consistently excellent, and the taste is fine. (I do add a little almond milk and some blueberries to fortify mine). It is certainly pricy -- about 50 cents per bag when shipping is included. Yet you get an amazing colorful reusable tin (I keep these in wire racks on the backs of doors in the kitchen) and this company really excels with its innovative blends. You also don't get the hyper boost of caffeine -- it's just pure antioxidant power and flavor from the right fruit and herbal ingredients. The cardamom also helps settle your stomach and gives it kind of a chai edge. (You might want to add a dash of cinnamon too). If you are looking for something different and vanguard, this is clearly the brew for you -- so feel free to indulge. But the first whiff might make you think that someone has been mowing his lawn!!

review/summary: Best airsoft sniper rifle ever.
review/text: Whilst googling for a good airsoft bolt action sniper rifle, I stumbled across this beauty.<br /><br />Gets amazing FPS, over 1000 easily. Got me about 250 feet in a battle.. Totally a beast.<br /><br />Strangely enough, I found it to be extremely tasty in soup. I'm pretty sure the developers never planned on this, but it's a great thing to have if you get lost in the woods.

review/summary: My Dog Swallowed this Bone
review/text: My dog is a 7lb Yorkie/Maltese mix.  He loved these bones, but they are so messy that I did not like for him to have them.  Anyway the last one I had for him, he swallowed the end of the bone and it got lodged in his esophagus.  $660 later, it was removed and his esophagus is damaged.  Hopefully it will heal, but I will NEVER let any dog I know have these bones!  They are dangerous...please know that I was sitting right by him when this happened.  It was so fast, that I didn't even know he swallowed it.  I thought he ate it, but later when he kept throwing up water and wheezing, I realize what had happened.  Be careful.

review/text: First package of pressed rawhides I have ordered that use dye and stain not only the carpet but my Goldendoodle's white paws a red/pinkish color. Giving them 3 stars because I believe these do not have formaldehyde in them or too many other additives because they do not give my dogs diarrhea like some rawhides do. They are long lasting, but my dogs are not particularly in to them either. They only pick them up when they are super bored - so guessing they aren't too tasty.

review/summary: Best tasting sugar free sweetener.
review/text: I have been using Xylitol for about a year since being diagnosed with diabetes. It is the only thing that I have tried that actually doesn't have an after taste. It is a little grainy as is all Xylitol products. That is not a problem for most things it dissolves fine in hot drinks. I just dissolve it in something warm first for cold drinks. This is a really good price so I thought I would order it even though there were no reviews. It is a USA made product. It is as good or better as any other brand I have tried. Just remember to start easy on Xylitol. It will play havoc with your digestive system if you use to much to start. You do have to build a little tolerance up for it. Once you do all if fine.I was very happy with this purchase and have ordered it again.

review/text: In spite of the niche attraction via the moniker, this is a quality Belgain ale that is worthy of praise.  A strong golden ale with an 8% ABV, Lucifer Belgain ale is a noticablely hoppy beer with a slightly sweet/fruity finish.  Although it is not specifically designated as a seasonal ale, my general impression is that this beer has the characteristics of a summer brew.

review/summary: The only sugar free drop without Isomalt
review/text: As a diabetic, I need sugar-free products. All other cough drops seem to contain Isomalt. Isomalt (and sometimes Malitol) can create huge, very painful (and embarassing) amounts of intestinal gas in people sensitive to Isomalt or Malitol. GoLightly does not use either Isomalt or Malitol. I have used these cough drops for years. A case might sound like a lot, but they are in 30 individual bags. And they go quick - especially when co-workers stop by, to "borrow" a cough drop or two.

review/summary: Mama Seems To Like Them!
review/text: Visit to the dentist. Dentist say, "You have several thousand dollars of tooth repair!" I know why. Mama loves sugar in all forms! She can consume sugars each and every hour she is awake! Been doing it for years. I use to buy her candy in bulk-20,30 Pounds of her favorite morsels-and she would distribute the candy in different bowls everywhere in the house: Living Room, Kitchen, Dining, Garage, Bedroom,etc., and every time I would try to talk to her she would have 2 or 3 in her mouth. She had got to the point where 1 was not enough! So dentist informs her: "You are better of eating all the candy you want in 1 hour than distributing the candy throughout the day. Better to eat 1 dozen donuts (of course she wouldn't eat that many, mama weighs in at 170 Lbs) in one sitting than eat 1 each hour. The devastation of your teeth is brutal!" Enter GOLIGHTLY Sugar-Free Cough Suppressant, Menthol, 30 Count, Mama says she needs them for she suffers this persistent, year after year  need to cough so she considers this type of product indispensable. But since all sugar has been "halted" by me until all teeth are back to normal this was the compromise. I am hoping they are really sugar free and assist her on the coughing. When I ask her, "Big Mama, how do you like them?" She gives them a "thumbs up" so 4 Stars for now.

However, I struggle to find treats that both dogs like, but won't send my sensitive boxer to the vet!  Of all the treats I've tried, these are by far the best!  They are tiny, so I can portion-control. Both dogs go nuts for them, and will ignore anything around them but the treats (these have led to a total 180 in our greetings at the front door!).<br />After two years of fighting a 70lb dog into his crate, he now trots in and sits for these...first time EVER.

Well, not anymore! Just received my new 2-pack and it has only ONE, yes just one, gram of protein per serving, and it's only 11% fat. The rest is just carbohydrate. Not good. I'm throwing these two packs away as it's just not a healthy choice anymore.
