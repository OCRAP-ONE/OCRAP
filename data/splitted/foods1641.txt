This mix tastes so good and looks so similar to regular buttermilk pancake mix (aside from the few whole flax seeds that appear) that I can serve it to the neighborhood kid (who NEVER eats our "weird" food) and she eats them and wants more each time!

review/text: This is the best pancake mix I've ever bought! It's much healthier than most of the mixes you can buy but it tastes just as good - better than other "healthy" pancake mixes which can taste kind of unpleasant. I had been making pancakes from scratch but when I cook them from a mix the texture turns out better. I like to add fruit to my pancakes, like bananas or blueberries, for fun and extra nutrition. I don't make waffles so I can't comment on that!

review/text: My wife and I started eating these a month or so ago (nuts are such a great part of the diet) and have been hooked ever since.  They taste great on a spinach salad with some craisins, vinaigrette and goat cheese, in your favorite yogurt or straight from the bag.  Each bag is at least $4.50+9% tax in the grocery store here in my part of CA.  If you get these on auto-ship they are discounted even further.  So now I have 6 bags being delivered to the house every 3 months for $15 a shipment.  Score!

review/summary: Very nice jasmine tea
review/text: I brew and drink a lot of tea, having retired from coffee many years ago. I spent several weeks in China at one point and experienced many fine teas there as well. I like Jasmine green tea on its own or a a small flavor addition to Assam or Ceylon teas sometimes. Jasmine, like any green tea, can be prone to bitterness if brewed to hot or too long. The Coffee Bean Direct Jasmine does not tend to go as bitter as most jasmine I have had, and has a pronounced jasmine flavor. They did not skimp on the jasmine flowers in this blend. It has the pleasant "coat-your-tongue with jasmine" quality that the better jasmine teas have.<br /><br />I am very surprised to get a jasmine tea this good in an inexpensive bulk tea. Better jasmine can be had; the white pearl & silver needle jasmines for example, but they are very expensive and are "special occasion teas" for me. The Coffee Bean Direct is a far more than adequate jasmine tea at a great price!

review/text: Instead of that 2nd cup of coffee or that cup in the afternoon, switch to a cup of Jasmine tea. Coffee has it's good benefits but Jasmine tea treats your body with the extra benefit to detox, sparks a bit of serotonin and yet you get a boost of caffeine if that's the point of the 2nd cup of coffee. Hot or cold. It's good! Very little "dust" and that's at the very bottom of the pkg. Price and quality are a good match! If it's still available, I'll buy it again, and again when I run low.

I am so happy I bought this and would very much recommend for anyone looking for an optimum value tea.  The quality is good and the jasmine is plentiful.  With 2 lbs for what I was getting 6 oz for you just can't beat it. I will be looking to this source for some of my other tea/coffee purchases in the future.

review/text: These cookies are usually sold in New Jersey in candy stores and luncheonettes rather than in supermarkets. I have eaten them for years and consider them a cut above most commercial chocolate chip cookies sold in the supermarkets (excluding of course the fresh baked section). They have a soft chewy texture and are loaded with rich tasting chocolate chips. They taste amazing.<br /><br />Shop for price. I now buy these at my local Costco for less than half the price on Amazon with shipping.

review/text: I used to get these way back in the in HS (1981-1984). I loved them then and ever since the internet came into being, would look for these via search engines. They taste just as good as they did then - the recipe seems totally unchanged. These are not the fake chewy kind of cookies that seem to be the norm now with emulsifiers and what not. These are dry somewhat crumbly cookies with a hint of maltiness. The chocolate chips are slightly cool on the tongue as they melt in your mouth. I ordered these once to put on my desk at the office and now have to keep ordering them for my co-workers. I give them four stars as a cookie plus one star for not changing the recipe.

review/text: When I found these cookies on line I was excited. These cookies along with its partner Butter Crunch were love by every child at school. Being overseas I have found there are so many little things I miss about home. The cookies taste exactly how I remember and I have found a new treat for my boys.<br />The downside is that the packaging could have been better. Out of 24 packs of cookies there was only one pack of cookies that had a whole cookie inside. It is hard to enjoy chocolate chip cookies when the are all crushed. I made milkshakes with them instead. Not what I intended to do but still yummy.

The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list "high fructose corn syrup" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it.

review/summary: Perfectly portable snack
review/text: I have to stay for long hours at school, and I've been looking for snacks I can bring that aren't too unhealthy. When I found out about these fig newton minis, I was pretty excited since I absolutely love the full size fig newtons. Since they're smaller, there is of course much less of the fruit filling.. but still, a delicious snack. The size of each individual bag is quite small (a little over 1oz) so it's not too great at staving off those hunger pangs, but it helps.

review/text: These are Fig Newtons, what can you say?  Everyone likes them (or not).  They are a nice-sized snack in a nearly indestructible foil wrapper.  You get two double-length cookies, approximately equivalent to 4 regular Fig Newtons.  Good for tossing in lunches, purses, the car, etc.  Arrived very fresh and in good shape.  Handy as a somewhat more nutritious snack.  We like them enough to order more, when on sale!

review/text: If this is the first time you've considered tasting a Fig Newton then, Welcome to; America, planet Earth, or back from the dead. Nabisco has been baking these little gems for over 100 years and they are a part of American culture. If you actually haven't tried a "Newton" they are small cookies that consist of a soft cake outer sleeve with sweet fig jam in the middle. These packages are half the size of a regular package of newtons and come in a rigid plastic tray, inside a plastic bag, inside a small cardboard box. These were fresh and well within the "best by" date.

review/summary: Not as dark as I like, but still good, and low shipping charge!
review/text: A good Sumatran coffee. Personally, I think Sumatra Mandheling coffee should be very dark roasted, to the point of being shiny, caramelized, and almost black. This coffee is not quite there, but I imagine most people will like it. The selling point for me was the price, and the relatively low shipping and handling charge compared with other coffees on here, or anywhere on the internet, for that matter. I don't know if I will buy this particular coffee again, because it just isn't dark enough for my tastes, but I might try one of their other types, simply because they don't charge an outrageous amount for shipping.<br /><br />To update this review, I just finished this bag of coffee. The reason I had it so long was because I had other coffees I was trying also, one of which was another Sumatran. The point is, even after sitting around for weeks, this coffee tasted great. It was better, perhaps, than I may have insinuated in my original review. I especially liked it after drinking that other Sumatran for a while. That coffee was good also, but by comparison the Magnum seemed even better.

review/summary: Best Sumatra Under $10/lb
review/text: I'm not sure if the other reviewers know that you are able to adjust the amount of grounds you use and the grind your beans have.  I have been using this brand for years and love it.  I like the fact that it is not over roasted and you can taste the bean and not just the bitterness from the roast.  Balance of ALL THE FLAVORS is key to a good cup of coffee.  Novices drink Starbucks (the over roasting kings).  I especially like the low acidity and complexity this kind of coffee offers over the central and south American coffees.  At the end of the cup I am satisfied with what I have just consumed.  If you like your coffee so strong it can lift a car then add more beans and/or grind them finer.  That way you will taste the complexities of the bean and the place on earth it came from.  To me when you judge the coffee based on the techniques of the roaster then you can put any bean in there and have a similar tasting product.  BTW, you can usually find this coffee cheaper at your local Marshalls.  But it is hard to argue with free 2 day prime shipping convenience.

review/text: My Magnum Sumatra just came in the mail, so me and my chiropractor did a "coffee bake-off".  He raves about Starbucks' Sumatra, so we decided to compare it to Magnum Sumatra.  Both were brewed under the same conditions.<br /><br />I found the Magnum to be full-bodied, well-balanced and everything I want coffee to be.  I found the Starbucks to be bitter and unpleasant.  He thought the Magnum was "weak".  (Fortunately, my chiropractor himself is not bitter and unpleasant!)<br /><br />When we remade the Starbucks with a little less grounds and the Magnum with a little more, I liked the Starbucks more, but still preferred the Magnum as being better balanced and more satisfying.<br /><br />How on Earth can anybody decide on coffee without actually making it, tasting it, and adjusting the parameters - water temperature, grind, etc. - to your pleasure?  So all I will say is that I like Magnum Sumatra better than Starbucks Sumatra and my chiropractor likes Starbucks better.<br /><br />And this Magnum is $10/lb while Starbucks is $15.

review/summary: SOURED ON THIS CHOICE !!
review/text: The case arrived with the pieces mostly broken and the confectioner's sugar "dusting" all moist, gummy and barely coating the cookies (most of the coating had fallen off). They looked gross, so they ended up NOT being served to guests as a light dessert. Some tasted stale even though they were (barely) in date. The lemon flavor is quite unnatural and the pieces of hard lemon candy baked into these "shortbreads" contributed to this very unnatural flavor. Not a plesant experience and I actually ended up tossing them after tasting the first few boxes. The fact that the shortbreads were broken--very few were whole cookies--added to the disappointment of this purchase. I can't recommend them for these reasons and won't purchase again.

review/text: I've purchased the lemon, raspberry and shortbread cookies and liked them all. What I like the most about the brand of cookies is that they are not too sweet--perfect for my taste.

review/text: 1.  I highly doubt you were able to buy 1oz for $14.00.  Perhaps that was from your regular "dealer" for something else.<br /><br />2.  And sure you can buy Indian or Chinese saffron but it is entirely different than Spanish saffron.<br /><br />Amateurs.

review/summary: Great Product, Good Price!
review/text: I have to agree, some of the reviewers are DIMWITS and probably boil all their meals. Betty Crocker cooking school drop-outs. $14-$20 an ounce?  I'll guess they don't know how to measure weights either.<br />This is an excellent 230 color saffron that is PURE Threads.  Not the cheap stuff sold elsewhere.  Very pungent and colorful.  In fact when I purchased mine it arrived in a tightly sealed, resealed in heavy plastic and bagged box.  When I opened the box I could still smell the saffron! EXCELLENT!

review/summary: A good cider!
review/text: I really like this cider. It could be a little sweeter or stronger, but that is an issue at times with all K-Cup type of things I think. My daughter puts a little sugar in hers, but I don't. Last season it was very hard to find, but this year I saw it out more and stocked up. It's a nice amount and not a lot of calories... not a diet buster!!! :) If it had a little more punch I would have given it 5 stars.

review/summary: Good, small pasta
review/text: I like this pasta. It is about the size a of a pencil eraser. There is no time suggested for cooking, hence the four stars. The first package we tried was overcooked. I think 5 minutes or less is all you will need. But they give a "cook until desired doneness"... not much help. But it tasted good and I think this is good value. Perfect for pasta with lentils, now I have to get my Italian friend to give me her recipe.

review/text: I love Anna Pasta, but I have ordered this twice and each time, several bags were broken and the pasta comes out of the bag.  The first time there were 6 broken bags, the second time, I found 11 busted bags and the pasta all over the box.  Although the pasta is good, it is not sanitary to find your pasta all over a box, especially eleven bags!  Let's get with the program and give your customers what they pay for....quality.  Thanks!

review/summary: Finally Found an Outlet
review/text: I first found Porterhouse Seasoning when it was called Prime Rib Seasoning in a little fish shop on the Oregon Coast. I bought 1 and when I went back I bought out the shop.  Since then I have had a tough time finding the product.  I slather a roast in Dijon mustard and the liberally sprinkle the seasoning and the put the roast on the rotisserie. When all is said and done, I have a roast with a flavorful crust and a juicy core.<br />What I have not been able to find is "Lemon Up" by Lindberg & Snyder.  I found Lindberg & Snyder makes a Lemon Pepper but it is not the same.  I am ordering a case for my son who is a chef in Tacoma, WA and uses it on his prime rib.  I cannot say enough about the Porterhouse Seasoning - I am glad I finally found a place where I can stock up.

review/text: This is totally the BEST as a rub or as a seasoning! Well worth it, it is now so hard to find, I can only find it in gourmet meat depts like fresh fairs or high end meat markets.  I use it on my Standing rib roasts, my whole tri tips, rib eye streaks as a rub and as a seasoning for my chuck roasts and even for my stew meat.. I used to work in the MEAT DEPT for years, my customers always told me how much they loved this once I MADE them try it. I used to put it on their steaks before they bought them and they always came back and bought a whole bottle.  TRY IT!

review/text: One of the best seasonings I've ever user, particulary for grilling meat and a little-known and scarcely available cut called a "Tri-Tip." Sprinkle liberally on both sides of the meat, refrigerate overnight and grill at high heat on both sides for 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness and desired finish.

review/text: I worked as a meat wrapper for 15 years in a retail/wholesale meat shop.  We would sell the seasoning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Q426U">Lindberg Snider Porterhouse & Roast Seasoning 14oz.</a> to numerous wholesale accounts.  We had people come in constantly asking us what type of seasoning was on the steak, tri-tip or prime rib they had eaten at a restaurant they had visited.  I'm so glad I found it.  Try the seasoning on mushrooms...it's one of my favorites.

I have since moved and the jar is now empty.... Amazon to the rescue!  This blend is the perfect complement to a fine cut of beef.
