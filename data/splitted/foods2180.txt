review/summary: Best Dog Chews Out There!
review/text: I'm posting the same review as the one I wrote for the regular version of this product. I can't say enough about this chew!  My dog was sick for 6 months last year, and hospitalized twice.  Her food was changed 4 times, before they figured out she was allergic to just about every kind of meat!  What is a dog to do???  There wasn't anything out there that she could chew on (that she liked).  She wouldn't touch non-food toy chews, so she took to finding paper(or books) and chewing/shredding it whenever she could get away with it.  I was going out of my head!  Sam's Yams was a God-send!  She loves them and can't wait to get one.  She gets so excited when she knows I'm getting one for her, and then can't find a place to chew it...it's funny, she circles the house looking for a good hide-out, afraid someone will take it from her.  The best part is...they aren't making her sick!  I highly recommend these, as well as the regular Veggie Chew version of the chew. My dog is a Cavapoo, the size of a Cocker, and it takes her about 5-10 minutes to polish one off.  That is the only downer...wish it lasted longer.  But hey, beggers can't be choosers!!

review/summary: Sam's Yams
review/text: I have a six year old Golden Retriever with an extremely delicate digestive system.  Recently she bled internally after chewing a rawhide.  Needless to say, once I calmed my guilt, I had to find a healthy alternatve because she loved to chew on cheweeze rawhides as a treat.  (My Vet told me rawhides can be extremely dangerous for some dogs.)<br /><br />I knew she liked sweet potato, so when I discovered Sam's Yams, I figured, why not give them a try?  The result, she absolutely loves them!!!  I have to keep reordering 3 bags at a time because she barks at the cabinet we keep them in until I give her another.<br /><br />Sam's Yams is such a wonderful and healthy alternative to rawhide.  It is also a low fat treat, which is wonderful for breeds that have a tendency to put weight on.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this product.  My dog loves them, my Vet approves and that makes me a very happy owner.<br /><br />They are sliced in different sizes for small, medium and large dogs.  If your dogs love to chew, why not give them a try?

review/text: My dog loves Dogswell sweet potato chews, which I recently learned are made in China.  I had hoped that these Sam's Yams would make a good substitute. However, these are much tougher, really like rawhide, and my cockapoo has no interest in the product.  I'm not even sure she realizes that it is something to eat.  Maybe it would appeal to a larger dog that enjoys chewing.

review/text: I purchased a box of 6 of these November 2011.  They are really big and I noticed they were slightly moist in the middles.  The dogs liked them - however they had terrible gas from them.  By the time I opened the last bag in February 2012,I noted that they were covered in a white mold - absolutely f urry or otherwise I might not have noticed it.  I wondered whether some of the previous bags might have contained slight mold that I did not notice. I contacted the vendor using the 'contact us' on their website, but no reply.  I won't take a chance on them again.

review/summary: The easy way to clean your dog's teeth
review/text: I originally reviewed this on the wrong version of the product, so I'm copying my review over here:<br /><br />Our vet suggested these chews for my young hound, who was starting to get some soft tartar buildup on her teeth. I've tried to get in the habit of brushing my dogs' teeth, but it's just never worked for me. It's like flossing my own teeth--I'll do it for a few weeks, then forget a few times and eventually stop. But these treats are so easy! And my dogs love them, too! I give my dogs one of these treats every evening as a way to relax and wind down from the day. After my younger dog ate the first one, I could see a noticeable improvement in her teeth. After eating several, her teeth are now gleaming white! Yams will only do so much, though. These only work to remove soft gunk on the teeth that could be removed with a brush. Any hard deposits will require a dental at your vet's office. My 13-year-old husky/shepherd mix (multiple health issues) got a little ill after the first one and threw up, but we tried again another night with a smaller piece, and he was fine with it. It's the only thing we've found that he enjoys chewing in his old age. We do only give them ONE per day, however, although both dogs would happily devour an entire bag of them every day. I'm pretty sure you can overdo the fiber in these, and that could lead to all kinds of issues, I'm sure. The extra fiber seems to make their stools slightly softer, but I haven't seen actual diarrhea from them. In fact, I think the added fiber helps to keep the dogs more "regular." The vet also said that the yams are a good source of beta carotene, so they're even nutritious. One thing to keep in mind is that the Big Boyz size is really not that huge. My hound is 60 pounds, and they're fine for her size. My elderly shepherd/husky is 70 pounds, and he is fine with one of the smaller ones in the bag (the sizes within the bag do vary, as do the sizes of sweet potatoes).

review/summary: Great for so many reasons
review/text: My dog has a health issue relating to digestion, so I make his food etc. and am very careful with what I give him. One of the acceptable things (which is in his normal meals) is sweet potatoes, so I thought I'd give these a try as I am pretty limited with chew toys. Was afraid he wouldn't like them as much because he already gets cooked sweet potatoes but he really does love them. The big size is great, yes they aren't going to last a long time, but it makes him very happy. I would highly recommend to people whose dogs have allergy issues. For the people that said it gave their dogs diarrhea or gas, yes, sweet potatoes have a LOT of fiber in them. I am careful not to overdo it but if a dog's system isn't used to it then I can see why that might happen. Anyways, great product.

review/summary: Great chew treat with a 3 minute lifecycle
review/text: My Max LOVES to chew anything, like most pitbulls do. I bought a bag of these through the referral of another pit bull owner. All I can say is that these treats lasted a mere three minutes. These are about 1/4" thick or less and they smell great. They are cut into strips that are sized anywhere from a few inches long to 5-7 inches long. They look and feel very natural. Max loves these but he has almost choked himself to death by literally "biting off more than he can chew".<br /><br />Great idea and I think they are better than the other traditional rawhides out there and not very messy at all. I don't recommend these for dogs that love to eat and have a tendency to swallow treats whole. If you do try these treats for your dogs, monitor them to see if they are swallowing a large portion of the treat.

Great website and cool product names.<br />As for everything else I would say save your money,buy organic sweet potato's and let your dogs chew on those. These chews didn't make it three minutes with any of my dogs. I can cut a sweet potato in half and they will have more fum and health benefits for a whole lot less money. To sum this up, if your dogs really wants chews these are the wrong product.

review/summary: Best chews out there
review/text: I have six (6) very large dogs.  They LOVE these sweet-potato chews - it takes them a few minutes to chew through them.  Moreover, I feel better knowing that these are made in the USA and do not contain the hides of "unknown" animals from South America or elsewhere.  I used to give my dogs the CET rawhides (and other rawhides), but more often than not, they would swallow them whole, choke on them and then throw them up.  Sometimes one of my dogs would even throw it up a few hours later.  That NEVER happens with these sweet potato chews.<br /><br />The only problem is that there aren't enough in the bag -- for my pack, that is.  I am thinking about buying a food hydrator and making my own.  If I had only 1 or 2 dogs, this bag would be a really great bargain.  Anyway, I would urge you to give these a try - they are a healthy and affordable treat for your dogs.

review/text: I have a large dog, and after she had some health problems, decided to go natural and/or organic with products made in the USA. She absolutely loved these, because they are big and thick, but she gobbled it down in just a few minutes. Only because of the price...I have decided to make my own. I have a dehydrator, and it's pretty easy to make them. I have also found Carolina Prime Sweet Potato Fries, made in the USA, and they are a bit more reasonable, especially when on sale. I decided to rate them a 4, because they are really good, but just too costly.

review/summary: short-lasting yumminess
review/text: Well, after debating over whether or not I should get these for a few months, I finally went ahead and did it. Two of my three dogs are allergic to beef, one is also allergic to chicken and grains. So I figured that I would try something new to keep them busy, hoping the 'rawhide' part in the title meant the treats would last awhile. Just for reference, one dog is 90lbs, one is a 75lb pup, and the other is a 60lb pup. Their nicknames are "The Destroyers." As soon as I took the treats out, they were all over me, and when I gave them each a piece, they ran off to munch. The larger two were done within 30 seconds. I'm not even sure they chewed, actually. The smaller dog took about 3-4 minutes with hers. The treats did not seem to upset their stomachs, which is a first. So if your dog sounds like any of mine, don't expect these 'yams' to last long, but they are still a great hypoallergenic treat that your dog will love.

review/text: My old dog gets very excited about the dried yams. She has bad teeth and since giving her these the consensus is that her breath is getting better. Unlike other chew products, her gums don't bleed when she eats them. I have found that if I give her one when company comes over, it keeps her busy for a while so she's not nervous about the people being there.  Also, they turn her poop an electric orange color which kids think is hilarious. What a great product - I love that it is so simple and I don't worry about what is in them or where they are made. Just wish they were less expensive.<br /><br />I have not noticed any staining where she eats them.

review/summary: awesome treats
review/text: these things are awesome!  dogs absolutely love them.  one of my dogs just needs to get over the texture each time, takes her about 10 min to eat it.  but my other 2 gobble these right up.  great for digestion and a great snack if your leaving for a period of time and they need something to hold them over.  very filling sweet potatoes!<br /><br />only drawback, THEY NEED TO MAKE A BIGGER BAG!

review/summary: Great for dogs with digestion issues
review/text: I have a 48 pound English Lab who does not have the ability to digest most proteins. After many trips to the vet and food trials we found that her food (Taste of the Wild), which contained Lamb as the main source of protein, was making her sick. We switched to Taste of the Wild with Salmon protein and she has been great ever since. However, it has been a struggle to find dog treats that she can eat, as most contain protein that she can't digest. I didn't buy these from Amazon yet, I actually picked them up from a local pet shop, but I must say that I highly recommend them. One thing to consider though is that although they are advertised as a "raw hide" type product, if you have a large dog, these will be gone in a matter of minutes if not seconds. Friends have told me that these last considerably longer with their smaller dogs (even the small dog version). With that said, my dog absolutely loves them and they dont affect her digestion in anyway. Not only that but they are a healthy treat for your dog, and significantly safer than raw hide. I wish they weren't so expensive and I wish the lasted longer, but when you have a dog who can't eat most dog treats, something like this product is a god send. Now my baby can enjoy treats again!

review/summary: Dog gives them 4 paws!
review/text: Since my dog was unable to eat rawhide as much as he used to, I wanted an alternative evening treat for him.  I found these at my local pet supply and decided to try them based on another customer's testimonial.  My dog LOVES these.  They are healthier than a rawhide and they must be really delicious because he gets just as excited about them as rawhides.  They don't last as long, but they are a nice, healthy alternative.<br /><br />Started buying them on Amazon as the price was unbeatable!  Just bought a new bag for my new puppy...  we'll see if he likes them just as much.  :)

review/summary: These are the BEST dog chews you will find!!
review/text: We have three dogs, and one is a bit of a "picky" eater, and I have given Sam's Yams to ALL of them, with no complaints and wagging tails from everyone.  I didn't want to have the mess on the rugs (or smell) of real rawhide, and I didn't want to worry about bone chips with regular bone treats.  These are our guys' FAVORITE treat, hands down.  To make them last longer overall, you can bend and break them into small pieces (which I always do), and simply give them as a smaller treat, vs. giving them the entire 'slice' of sweet potato as they come packaged in the bag.  Even though they don't last for hours like a "rawhide" does, I just don't care. I've had my fill of trying to keep the dogs in one tiled area with their chews / bones so that they don't get crud on the carpet or rugs (that I have to clean!).  With this product, you have:  (1) a super healthy treat (2) something that doesn't have the risk of bone chips (although of course, I don't give them these treats and leave the house -- and I don't do that with any treat) (3) a treat that does NOT stain the carpet or rugs (at ALL!), or rub off or stain your dog's fur (4) a treat that is made from dried sweet potatoes and ONLY that ... no preservatives, no 'animal parts', no artificial colors, no chemicals, no other "mystery" ingredients that you can't identify - just 100% dried sweet potatoes.  I've checked around and Amazon seems to have the best price - I recommend these VERY highly (and I would say that our dogs all agree!)

review/text: These treats keep my allergic Rottweiler occupied for a few minutes each day. They smell good, they are great for her teeth, they don't make a mess of my carpet, and they are healthy. As with any new food item, I suggest you give your dog a small treat and work your way up. My dog has not had any digestive problems. In fact, I would say these treats are good for her digestion since sweet potato is a great source of fiber.

review/summary: Creamy, dreamy buttery bliss
review/text: I must state from the beginning that I never liked white chocolate before. I normally only eat the bitter, dark, hell colored stuff and to me that is bliss. I came across this bar by chance, got a taste of it and never wanted to be without it. This bar is pure heaven; I adore coconut shavings in chocolate even if it's milk chocolate and they work even better in white chocolate, giving it a chewy consistency - very satisfying though those who like to sink their teeth into their dessert.<br /><br />This bar is creamy, not overly sweet as the sugar doesn't over take. The buttery colored mass is rich and melts in the mouth as vanilla and coconut disintegrate in small burst. This is one of my favorite items that I get when I have my sweet cravings for something truly delicious. My other favorite Lindt bars are the Pear and also the Chili one, I wish there was a larger variety of flavored chocolates, I would love to see a bar with cardamom, nutmeg and other spices.<br /><br />- Kasia S.

review/text: I don't think I've ever been compelled to write a review about candy before- perhaps until now. This bar is brilliant.<br /><br />I don't eat much candy. I don't really like candy.<br />I like coconut though, so what that heck, I thought maybe this will make me like candy too.<br />It is still a tad bit too sweet for my tastes (since I'm not a candy eater) but the consistency of the crunchy coconut and the smooth chocolate works really well together.<br />For those who are not big fans of coconut, you might want to steer clear. The flavor is strong and you might equate it to eating tanning lotion.

review/summary: All the rich taste of cream, in a lighter version
review/text: I add cream to soups and casseroles for a richer taste, add it to curry and Asian and Latin dishes, and I whip it for fruit and pie topping.  In the past I bought fresh heavy cream in the dairy section and often didn't get the whole container used before it went bad.  This canned cream is the answer to the problem.  The cans are small (7.6 oz) so there's less waste, and with the reduced fat content I can feel good about adding it to my family's food. It has a nice creamy texture and real cream taste without any metallic flavor from the can. The fact that it doesn't have to be refrigerated before opening means I can keep it in the pantry, too.<br /><br />This cream also whips well for dessert toppings - just add some sugar and use a whisk or electric beater, and whip until it becomes whipped cream.  Unlike "Cool Whip" this product doesn't contain lots of unknown preservatives and ingredients, and you'll have to use it soon after whipping it so it doesn't melt.<br /><br />At $1.40 per can (the last time I bought it) and free SuperSaver shipping, this is a good value.

review/summary: Yes the best OJ but expensive enough from local stores.
review/text: In addition to being juiced from the best oranges in the world--grown on volcanic soil--this product is "flash pasteurized" which brings it close to fresh-squeezed.<br /><br />People with taste cannot stand American oranges. Even those expensive blood oranges, they say, taste nothing like blood oranges. So when I saw this in a local natural food coop, I took some home to feed my family gourmet who has been refusing to eat oranges or drink orange juice for 5 years. It worked.<br /><br />But at $6 a bottle in stores, I was hoping to get it cheaper on Amazon. Nope.<br /><br />For me, Uncle Matt's Orange Juice is good enough. Also $6 and also "flash pasteurized." But "organic" and twice the size. Therefore half the price. If your gourmet thinks it's too sweet, try adding a dash of grapefruit juice on the sly.

review/summary: Rooibos Tea and Spices.
review/text: Rooibos is Afrikaans for "red bush." Grown in South Africa's Cederburg Mountains and harvested during the summer, this tea acquires its unique red color as a result of fermentation (in mounds) and oxidization, when it is spread out to dry in the sunlight; naturally it is green.<br /><br />Rooibos is known for its health benefits stemming from its rich content in vitamins, antioxidants, flavanoids and minerals (inter alia, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, potassium, fluoride, manganese and alpha-hydroxy) and has a long tradition of medicinal use among the local Native population; among other things, it is known to help cure asthma, hay fever and other allergies, acne, eczema, colics, indigestion, insomnia, and nervous tension. Containing very few tannins and no caffeine, rooibos has a distinctive aroma and amber color.<br /><br />This tea blends well with various spices and condiments; my favorite mixture is a delicious loose leaf blend sold by my local tea store, which features orange peel, cinnamon, grated coconut, finely minced chili and red pepper. For a more commercial alternative, though, Tazo's Red Bush tea is a great choice as well: a rich, exquisite blend of rooibos, hibiscus, orange peel, rosemary, several lemon ingredients (lemon myrtle, verbena and balm), as well as a number of sweet spices. Enjoy!

review/text: This is by far my favorite coffee. The aroma is wonderful, the taste is very bold and yet it is also super smooth. The pods fit great in my Bunn My Cafe commercial machine and make a great 12oz cup.<br /><br />IMPORTANT! I've noticed from other reviews - make sure your coffee machine can handle 12g pods! And I don't mean find out if you can cram one in there, because it might not brew right, resulting in a weak cup. If you are using a Senseo or Senseo-like machine, these pods might be too big. Senseo pods are generally smaller diameter and only 7-8g; Baronet sells smaller pods in both 10g and 7-8g sizes that may be better suited for your machine. They will probably be a better value for your application as well.

review/summary: A perfect 12 oz cup finally
review/text: At last a pod that doesn't have the coffee tasting like dishwater. But you need a pod coffeemaker that has the two pod ability. This pod fits the upper<br />holster in both Gavalia and Hamilton Beach Pod coffeemakers. I found every blend of Seneos brand too weak for a full mug, or even a full cup. I'll stick to Baronet from now on!

review/summary: excellent coffee and fits my senseo too!
review/text: With Senseo going out of business, at least here in the States, I needed a replacement dark roast that would fit my Senseo machine.  This coffee fits the bill if you use the double pod brewing attachment on your Senseo.  This is 12 grams of coffee as opposed to 7 grams for Senseo, so it makes a strong cup unless you do as I do and have a huge mug which I fill with 1 and 1/2 brews on the machine.

review/summary: Yes, they work in Senseo machines
review/text: I have two Senseo coffee machines, the original basic model and the newer supreme version (Philips HD7830/32). Each of them came with a single pod holder as well as a two-pod holder, since the machines were designed to make either one or two cups of coffee at once. I first purchased the variety pack of the Baronet coffee pods that includes a mix of their dark roasts - French, Kenya, and Sumatra. Some pods are 10gm and some are 12gm (the Kenya is 12gm), but either size fits very nicely in the two-pod holder of the Senseo. You can make a nice big mug of strong coffee with just one of these pods. The trick is to wet the pod a bit before you insert it into the two-pod holder. The paper that the pods are made of takes a few seconds to saturate, and wetting first just ensures that it's getting full contact the minute the machine starts forcing the hot water through it. I mostly use my newer model Senseo, so for reference, I brew by selecting 2 or 3 bars on the top LCD display (volume select) and then the two cup/large mug button at the bottom (the one on the right). That will make either 8oz or 10oz, depending on your choice of volume. It's enough to fill my travel mug for my drive to work!

review/summary: Good coffee, odd-sized pods
review/text: This is a nice strong Kenya AA coffee, and makes a nice pair of shots.  Biggest problem is that this are 55mm pods, not the ESE 45mm pods, and won't fit in most espresso pod adapters.<br /><br />I was able to stick the pod in the regular filter basket for loose coffee and tamp it down enough to get decent results.  I could probably get even better results by ripping the pods open and putting the coffee in the basket directly, but that would negate the advantage of the pods.

review/summary: Pods with Perfect Pod Holster in a Keurig Coffee Maker
review/text: I have experimented with almost a dozen coffee pods in the Perfect Pod Holster with the Keurig coffee maker.  Most give great coffee in the Holster.  This coffee pod is too large - the water drips through at an amazingly slow rate, and finally the machine clicked off without ever purging the water through with the usual blast of steam.  The coffee was anemic at best.<br /><br />This is not the intended use of this item, and so rated it a "4" instead of the "1" as it earns when used for MY purpose.  I have no opinion or experience when it is used as intended.

review/summary: Not 12g and 16 count - 10g and 18 count
review/text: Ordered this item precisely for the wording in the title: (12g) Coffee Pods, 16-Count Pods (Pack of 3). Got instead, 10g Coffee pods, 18-Count pack of 3. Mistake? Mistitled? Don't know, Amazon doesn't allow for on-line returns/dialog over grocery items. Call to correct the error required. Beware!  Follow up - Even after Amazon tried to correct the issue by resending what is titled in the product (12g, 16 count pods), the replacement was again, 10g, 18 count pods. Ther was a sticker on the shrink wrap indicating 12g pods - but the markings on the box itself, and the weight of the pods, are in fact, 10g. This item is not titled correctly. These are weaker pods, for those trying to find a true 12g pod.<br /><br />Final update - After Amazon's third shipment of the same product to try to correct the problem, the correct item was sent. There are 12g, 16 count pods out there. The issue seems to have stemmed from mislabling at the point of packaging. Thanks Amazon, for getting it right. As to the coffee - fabulous.

review/summary: Grape juice without the tang
review/text: First off I LOVE grape juice. Love the tang and sweetness of it. However the sugars in it at times makes me hesitate to drink it too often. I saw this 40% less sugar one on sale and thought I'd try it.<br /><br />Ingredients : Purified Water, Apple and Grape Juice Concentrate, Calcium Lactate, Gluconate, Vegetable Juice (For Color), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Natural Flavors, Vitamin D3.<br /><br />As you can see WATER is the first ingredient. Expect to taste watered down grape juice because that's just what it is. No tang not sweet. Just water grape juice or shall I say apple juice with a hint of grape.<br /><br />I would have given it 1 star however because it IS for TOTS and it is 40% less sugar (70 cal, 16g of sugar, 10mg sodium) I will give it 3 stars. I would rather buy regular grape juice and add a little bit of water myself.

review/summary: Watered down juice at a bumped up price
review/text: I had a coupon to get this $3 per 64 ounce juice for $2, so did not feel too badly spending the money, but I have to agree with others, that you would be better off adding your own water and saving money.<br />The "juice" is designed to be less sugar without adding artificial sweeteners. If you have a problem with fructose or do not like your kids drinking fruit sugars, then you may find this a good alternative to regular juice, but don't expect much of a grape taste.<br />The grape has more of a concentrated grape powder taste, with water and apple juice being the overall flavors coming through, It has a slight sweetness and the added calcium and Vitamin D is a plus as well as the fact that they use vegetable juice instead of artificial red and blue dyes to make it actually look grape colored, which gives you some idea of how much grape juice it actually has in it.<br />If I had a child, I think I would go for the juice boxes in this category, as they would be super convenient and already watered down, but with the big bottle, it would be so much cheaper to add the water yourself and then you would only be paying around $1.60 a bottle.<br />I can see where it fills a niche for some folks and the taste is not bad. It is refreshing in place of plain water, but does not have the satisfying sweet rich taste of juice. It is really more like juice flavored water.<br />If you have ever added ice to your juice and left it sitting out, this is similar to the flavor of Motts for Tots. It's a bit too much water added.

review/text: I was taken aback when I opened the package.  Four of the six bottles had a small amount of dried dressing at the neck.  All I can figure is some of these six-packs are on the bottom of the pile, and the weight of the other packages causes some dressing to be pushed out.  The seals were intact.  I tried a bottle and it was fine, so I decided not to return them.  I think the seller should include a warning about this in their description.  Even though it's fat-free, the dressing is excellent.

review/text: Had to try this coffee after several other reviewers provided positive feedback. I received the Amazon shipment today in typical speedy fashion.<br /><br />The coffee is way up on my favorites list.  If you like the Hazelnut- flavored coffee, this would be comparable. It's smooth, rich, and really does taste like Pecans. I'm a lover of pecan pie, having lived in the south for awhile. Since I can't always find good pie, I now have a substitute that comes in a little Keurig cup.<br /><br />The only thing that's missing is a list of ingredients. Just how that flavor is attained is anybody's guess. I'd like to think it's derived from real nuts, but we'll just have to hazard a guess. Enjoy!

review/text: I bought these because I love a local sushi called Pink Lady and figured I could save a buck and make them at home. I LOVE the variety you get in this pack, especially the one with black sesame seeds embedded in it. The thing I like about soy wrappers versus nori is that they wrap more easily because they stretch a little (think soy bean paste). And because they're lighter in texture you can bite them in half easily. I hate big portions of sushi that you can't cram in your mouth and you can't bite in half. Soy wrappers are a great solution. BTW: Pink Lady = crab mixed with spicy mayo (Kewpie + Siracha), avocado, cucumber, panko, rice - wrapped in soy wrapper. Mmmm!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This package contains 2 1-dram bottles of cherry flavoring (stronger than an extract).  Each bottle made enough cherry candy to have a solid cookie sheet full.  It's just the flavor you'd expect from cherry candy.  The recipe included was easy to make, as long as you have a candy thermometer.  My kids enjoyed watching me make it.  I have some other flavors, and I look forward to trying them as well.

review/summary: Great deal
review/text: I bought a 12 pack of the smaller cans for about five dollars less than this before I had seen that they offer the peas in the bigger cans. You get double the amount for only a little bit more. The peas are the same quality in either can and are a much better deal when you buy the larger cans. As far as I know they only offer whole kernel corn and sweet peas in this large size. Will buy again and again as long as the price doesn't increase :)

review/summary: great for soup
review/text: To make the easiest pea soup ever: in a blender put a can (about 5 oz-I use Hormel) of ham, a can of these peas, rinsed, and vegetable or chicken broth-about 16-32 oz depending on how thick you like your soup. Blend, nuke and serve--it comes out yummy!

review/summary: It's a toss-up!
review/text: This particular cereal is a favorite, but I also like all the, various, LIFE CEREAL variations.<br />If you were to visit me at my German farm, and I was out of home-made Cinammon Rice<br />Pudding, I would get out some 3.8% fat Milk and pour it all over some of THIS stuff...<br />mmmmm good!<br />I have tasted cereals --- all-over-the-world --- but, it just does NOT get a-n-y better than<br />GREAT GRAINS CRUNCHY PECANS or LIFE CEREAL with FRESH strawberries... or maybe blueberries...<br />mmmmmmmmm!<br /><br />Nay-sayers will say "It's CHEAPER at SAM'S or WAL*WART!"<br /><br />I remind folks that AMAZON SERVES FOLKS world-wide... there IS NO WAL*WARM down the road from<br />my place!<br /><br />There is...<br /><br />Amazon.co.uk<br />Amazon.co.de<br />Canada; China; France; Italy; Japan; Spain, and God-only-knows where else!<br /><br />Thanks for the opportunity to LIVE like an American, abroad!<br /><br />"Big Mac"
