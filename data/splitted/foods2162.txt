review/summary: Good Cracker
review/text: This really is a yummy cracker.  My kids love goldfish crackers and hubby loves cheezits.  In my quest to more healthy eating, I found these and they really are a good alternative to both.  They have the small fun shape that appeals to the kids, but they taste more like a cheezit, only with all natural ingredients.  I signed up for subscribe and save every two months and I may have to change it to every month.  We got the first shipment less than a week ago, and we already opened the second box.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: As another reviewer notes, these do taste a bit different than goldfish.  In my opinion, the cheese taste is not as strong and they definitely taste less salty.  My kids noticed and didn't want to eat them the first time they tried them.  However, they've gotten used to them now and ask for them regularly.<br /><br />This box size seems to be good, but could be slightly larger.  We consume them quickly enough that they don't go stale once they've been opened and there is less waste than the single serving packages.

review/summary: Great tasting, healthy snack for daughter with several allergies!
review/text: There are no other cheddar snack crackers on the market that I know of that my DD with food allergies can eat.  These taste great and the whole family loves them!  I just discovered the subscription program...even better prices!!  I'm thrilled and my kids will be happy to have a steady supply of one of their favorite snacks!  Not quite as good as Goldfish crackers (for those who are new to natural foods)...but I think it's worth the small taste difference to get the healthy, earth friendly ingredients in this box.  And they do taste very good.

review/summary: Fair value
review/text: I purchased this as an organic alternative to the imported Basmati rice my kids are used to. I'm hoping to eventually wean them off white rice and replace it with wild rice or brown rice, but for now, I was looking for something organic that would give them the taste they're used to without pesticides and whatnot.<br /><br />Taste-wise, my kids are satisfied. I was slightly more picky and found this rice neither as fragrant, nor as easy to cook, nor as agreeable in texture as my standard basmati. The texture was slightly more soft and sticky. I found this to be true every time I cooked it (and I've been preparing it 2 - 3 times a week for about a month).<br /><br />Bottom line, they only detriment is texture (slightly more sticky and soft). Taste wise, it's fine, and for the price, I'd say the product has fair value for an organic item.

review/summary: Not great but can be made so...
review/text: Came out very flat and eggy which I cannot stand.  So I played and discovered if you add to the recipe one of the dixie bakesquick inner packets and a tsp vanilla to the mix (no additional fluid) you get real pancakes that are nice and fluffy and taste whole grain.  The batter will still be runny.  It ups it to being 3 carbs a pancake instead of 1 but that is still super low.<br /><br />  Also, you do not have to add heavy cream, the instructions give alternatives with egg beaters and sour cream to lower the calories.<br /><br />  I would suggest these but only if you get bakesquick too.

review/text: This mix is a total waste of money.  First of all, they make the mix sound really low-calorie, but the directions call for heavy cream.  The pancakes have a horrible after-taste, and the initial taste is really bad.  This is the first time I've ever reviewed a product on Amazon, but I dislike this product so much, I felt like I had to write it.  I ate one pancake, and threw the rest out.  Even the dog wouldn't eat them.<br /><br />Don't buy this mix!  You'll be sorry.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: In past years I was able to buy chew hooves at Petsmart.  They smelled awful, but actually cleaned the tarter from my dogs' teeth.  This was important as I had  a dog with a severe heart defect who could not undergo traditional cleaning from the vet.  Then Petsmart discontinued the sale of this product.  When I found these chew hooves I had hoped for the same result and have been extremely disappointed in them.  They shatter and splinter causing a health hazard for my dogs.  I don't know if it is the way this brand has been processed, but I have had to  discard the entire bag.  Never again will I trust this product.

Finally there is one company with a small product line I can enjoy and recommend.<br /><br />Sturgeon(Black) Caviar 120 g (4.25 oz.), Bowfin Black Caviar 150 g (5.3 oz.),  Tsar's Salmon (Red) Caviar 200 g (7 oz.)  and Red Pearl Salmon ( Red ) Caviar in Can ( 454g / 1 Lb. ) crafted by Awers Inc.  are  the best caviar I was able to find.<br /><br />Sturgeon(Black) Caviar by Awers Inc. is what real Russian Sturgeon(Black) Caviar should be.

review/text: THese are truly sardines from off the coast of Portugal, as the ads describe.  Full of flavor, I have enjoyed them very much, but only have had them in salads and straight out of the can.  Good texture, and meaty.  I only have one criticism and that is the slight fishy smell when opened, not strong, but its there.  However, there is no fishy taste and seem fresh right out of the can . Overall a great product if you like sardines. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: Clean and fresh tasting.
review/text: These sardines are very clean and mild tasting, not "fishy" or rancid tasting. Nice texture, not mushy nor dry. On the large side.<br /><br />Sardines are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and are extremely low in contaminants such as mercury.  They are also a good source of vitamin D, calcium, B12, and protein.<br /><br />As stated on their website, "BELA Sardines are sourced from traditional local fisheries along the non-industrial Portuguese coastline which have existed for centuries. BELA and these family businesses have forged strong relationships and friendships that lead to the freshest and best catches of the day becoming BELA Sardines"<br /><br />The olive oil is much better and healthier than cheap cottonseed oil or soybean oil.  I buy them in bulk.

review/summary: Made in China....if that matters to you
review/text: I have made every effort to NOT buy/feed anything made in China to my pet. I researched these duck/sweet potato treats before finally deciding to buy them. Nowhere on the amazon product page does it tell you where these treats are made, so I searched for the Smokehouse website which claimed that ONLY some of their CHICKEN treats contained chicken from China, but all other products are made in the USA. So, I felt safe in purchasing these duck/sweet potato treats. After opening a bag, and giving them to my dog did I glance at the product origin. Needless to say my dog likes them very much, but I was NOT happy to find PRODUCT OF CHINA on the bag.<br /><br />Boo hiss to amazon for not putting the product origin on the product page, and to Smokehouse for misleading consumers on their product information website. Why do they do this, because there are customers just like me that care where the product originates. Many of you may not be concerned about this, but I am, and I think it's very misleading not to provide accurate, and complete information about the product when purchasing from an internet store. At least the product doesn't smell like plastic like the Dingo products.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these again. My dog seemed to like them, but she won't be getting anymore of them. I took a star off due to the lack of complete information from amazon, and misleading information from Smokehouse.<br /><br />UPDATE: Big thumbs up to amazon for great customer service. When I called to return this item they were very helpful in processing a refund, and because it is considered a grocery item I didn't even have to return the items. I had also purchased the Smokehouse duck chips, but they too are made in China. I suggested the addition of the country of origin to both product pages. Just another reason why I don't hesitate to purchase from amazon. They truly have great customer service....rare these days.

Search Amazon with made in USA dog treats and see this product appear on the list. Go to Smokehouse's website and red that only SOME of their CHICKEN products have product of China on the label. So by omission I think, OK it's duck, NOT chicken so it's made in USA. I order them. My dog loves them. I come back to Amazon to buy more and notice something I missed the first time: someone has written a review saying they're made in China. I check my package and sure enough, it days product of china. I don't know who to be more angry with: Amazon for listing it as USA when I search. Smokehouse for misleading me on their website, or ME for not reading the label after it got here.

review/text: My dogs loved these treats.  They are bigger than what I had originally expected.  I thought they were a tiny strips of duck meat wrapped around a sweet potato fry, which in a sense they are.  They are actually a whole breast or at least half of one wrapped around a sweet potato fry.  Much more meat than I expected.  These take my dogs a few minutes to gobble up instead of just a few seconds with other treats.<br /><br />I like the fact that the ingredients only state duck meat and sweet potato, no harsh preservatives you tend to find in most treats, especially ones that come from China.<br /><br />The cost compared to the amount you get is well worth the price I paid.  My dogs go through about 2 of these each a day which a bag will last me about a week or so.  I definitely plan on buying more of these, its to bad they don't have the automatic delivery for these as they do for coffee because I would definitely sign up.<br /><br />I highly recommend these treats.

I did not nor did my dog try this product named and should not have left a review. That is what this site is for, but that said... I do believe the company is misleading consumers with their advertising. What happened to ethics in this country? It seems there are ways to get around having to tell the truth. It has become a way of life and is pervasive in all areas of society- even in dog treat advertising.<br /><br />  In the meantime,  I have found dog treats that are wholesome, fresh and even made in the USA.  You just have to look around but there are some good new products out there.

review/summary: Dog's Favorite Treat
review/text: My dog loves sweet potatoes.  She has sweet potato dog food and her hands down favorite treats ever are duck and sweet potatoes with a close second and third being salmon and sweet potatoes and frozen blueberries.  The breeder encouraged both as well as other great natural foods for my sweetheart of a dog.<br /><br />I am glad that Amazon carries these treats because, as with the Salmon and Sweet Potato treats, I could not remember where I'd bought them.  I did eventually find out, but the vendor was sold out of the Salmon, and, as luck would have it, the Duck and Salmon are cheaper on Amazon!  That's one reason I love shopping on Amazon.  Great prices along with free delivery if the item is an Amazon Prime item.  Both products are!  The Smokehouse Natural Duck and Sweet Potato Dog Treats come in a resealable bag and would last forever if my dog didn't love them so much.  She got into an open bag that my nephew left out one day, only about a 1/4 of the bag was left, and ate all the rest!  :-)  No need for dinner!<br /><br />These treats are great for training purposes and even for just a "good dog!" moment.  I would definitely recommend them.

review/text: My dogs looove these treats!  They actually smell pretty good..like sweet potato. lol<br />the only concern I have is that they do say they're a product of China..which obviously concerns me considering the media frenzy about dog treats from china.  But it say's processed in US.  Not sure if that means the quality meats the FDA or not..  so far so good- I have mixed feelings about this product.  I'll probably order it again..simply because there are have been no cases involving duck.

review/summary: Before and After We Got Our Paws  on the "Duckies"
review/text: Everyone is giving these such a great review. I just ordered my first bag for my Scottie to replace the brand that he normally goes crazy over that is stopping making his "duckies". We were up in arms when we got the email from the company that they would not have duck and yam treats anymore.  Charlie has a lot of allergies and duck and sweet potato is one of the few things that the vet said that he could have as a treat (along with his allergy dog food, lamb, rice, and hamburger) We lucked upon these duck and sweet potatoes in an Internet search. I hope they are as good as all the reviews say. Because Charlie will be very disappointed if his "duckies" were not coming after he did his business outside, that is his reward. Charlie is waiting in for his new "duckies" to come, and try them out. We have tried chicken and yam but he does not like them as much as his "duckies.". We will keep you up to date on the progress on the new "duckies" they should be here in a day or two. Cross your fingers that they pass the muster.<br /><br />Just an update; after two weeks of switching duck and yam treats from a different company, Charlie has become a mad man for these duck and sweet potatoes. The other company is discontinuing their duck and yam, so on a whim and all these great reviews we tried this brand, now if you our down one of the old and one of these on the floor he gobbles down this one and just leaves the old kind. What a great find!  Charlie loves his "duckie" which he gets after doing his business outside. He now comes in and sits infront of his treat jar and waits. He eats the duck part first then the sweet potato which shocks me, I can believe he eats a veggie. But he loves them, I can not give a higher review then I am now, if there were a way to give 10 stars these would get 11! Great for dogs with allergies too, no filler just all natural products which makes me feel good about giving them to Charlie!  So worth the price, you only give your doggie 1-3 a day and there are a lot in a pack and it is resealable which keeps them fresh.  And they have the "rawhide-ish" duck which is good for their teeth and the sweet potato for fiber. I am kind of lucky that the old brand has stopped making theirs because I found these, and no need to run to Petsmart once a week to buy a new bag these seem to last forever, and are a good size for a treat, bigger than a milk bone and smaller than a greenie. Greenies used to be Charlie's favorite now he turns his nose up at them and wants his "ducky"  I can't say enough good things about them!<br /><br />I am buying three more bags today just so I have a stock up of them because I never want to run out!

review/summary: Nice, but expected more for the price
review/text: Everyone enjoyed these chocolates.  Unlike some others, I found no 'white spots' on the chocolate.<br /><br />For $20, I would have expected more.  The chocolates themselves were nicely wrapped in a printed pink foil, and the outer box was very pretty, but there was no support tray inside - this meant that when the box arrived, all the chocolate cigars were bounced around and a couple were broken.  When I took them out to arrange them neatly - I found that there were 23 instead of 24 cigars!<br /><br />These are all niggly things, but it shows a lack of finese, especially for $20.<br /><br />For the build and quality of the product I would guess that this would cost around $2 to make, and I would expect a fair retail price of $9.99.

review/text: this is my review. (i have commented said review on other reviewers because it seems fitting.) I may have to contact Wonka at some point to verify my suspicions...<br /><br />I remember as a kid (15-20 years ago) these were chewy right out of the package. But I couldn't find them in stores for a long time. When I finally did get a hold of some 5 years ago or so, stale is how I found them. And it has seemed to be that way ever since. So, the trick is... throw the pack on the ground to break each into smaller pieces and then allow it to sit in your mouth for a bit afterwards, getting chewy. They've been this way for a while now, suggesting a recipe change. I know we shouldn't have to pay for them to be this way, but I am a huge fan. We do what we must.

You'll probably only eat one and save the others for later, and if you don't want the experience of one large Sweetart in your mouth at once (although you might want to at least try it, but not when the phone might ring any time soon) before you open the package, hit it against a counter or something to break it up a little.  These were less than $20, for 36 treats, and they were a big hit with the kids.  We were a favorite house, and noticed some repeat customers!

review/text: I love these sweet tarts and order a fair amount of them.  This candy simply has a great taste to it and lasts quite a long while.  The only problem I have EVER had with this candy, was (I believe) due to the delivery truck.  My order seemed to have sat in the delivery truck for some time, in the hot sun, before it was delivered.  When I received the candy, it was semi-melted, had partially hardened and was stuck to the wrapper.  I think if they had stamped (or written), 'Perishable' on it, there might have been a speedier delivery.  However, this was the only time I have ever received the candy in this way.  I had no problem at all, in receiving a refund.

This candy arrived promptly through Amazon Prime, but it's so hard you could break your teeth on it. There was no evidence of any temperature issues during transportation. The wrapping was fine and not stuck to the candy as some have said. It was just plain stale and hard as rocks. Utterly disappointing. If you were thinking about this candy and thought you'd ignore the negative reviews, don't. You will be disappointed.

review/summary: Sent Wrong Product
review/text: I can't rate the canned pineapple because I was sent canned tropical fruit.  My family doesn't like tropical fruit, so I don't know what I am going to do with a case of it.  I also don't see a simple way to contact Amazon about this mixup because this product cannot be returned.  I am generally pleased with Amazon, but this mistake was a pretty big one for my family.

review/summary: Loved as a child, still love it
review/text: I loved Big Hunks when I was a kid many years ago and have only been able to get them on a limited basis over the years since I no longer live in the west.  For some reason they are more popular out west so whenever I am out that way or my son has traveled somewhere west and seen some, we've bought some.  It's great to know that I can enjoy the great taste any time and not have to wait.  It's hard to say that any candy bar without chocolate is one of my favorites, but I have to say that a Big Hunk is probably one of my top choices when it comes to a good candy bar.

review/summary: A Candy Bar for any Occasion
review/text: BIGHUNK candy bar has got to be one of my all time favorite bars. The nougat is a white taffy like candy, only it is so much better than any taffy I have eaten. The bar is BIG and lasts a long time. It has all natural ingredients, low fat, and it is sweetened with honey and corn syrup (corn syrup not to be confused with 'High Fructose Corn Syrup'). Like any candy bar it can get hard if it gets cold. You can but it in the microwave, without the wrapper, for about 15 seconds, or just keep it in your hand or pocket for awhile. The candy bar will soften and be ready for you to enjoy by the time you settle into a movie or to just slip away to somewhere private.

review/text: This is one of my favorite childhood treats. I have not been able to find it for 30 yrs.  I have searched every candy rack in every gas station I have ever visited on any road trip I have been on for several decades.  I don't know how but it somehow popped up one day while shopping for something else.  Well, I had to buy some!!  They were shipped rapidly. Arriving way before the projected delivery.  The candy bars were fresh as can be.  I hid the box in my closet b/c my husband has never tried them before and doesn't know the good things he is missing.<br /><br />I did share w/ my mom and sister.  They were pleasing surprised.  I now have a good stocking stuffer idea for them.<br /><br />I wonder were this candy is marketed b/c I haven't seen it in the South nor my visits to the Arizona.  Who cares though? I can find them on Amazon!!

Then I separate the peanuts from the candy bar in my mouth and chew the bites of candy until there's nothing left.  It takes a long time to eat this way.  I have been enjoying this candy bar since i was a kid.  I always felt like I got a lot for my money when I bought it, and I still do.  And it tastes just the same as I remember it.

Wow, nice that the Internet has solved one of life's little mysteries, as Big Hunk lives on!  Great taste, and unlike my other favorite candy which is Snickers, one can't wolf down a Big Hunk in a few blinks of an eye.  One has to slow down and take some time to devour a Big Hunk, and that's good for the taste buds.

review/summary: Don't Forget the Beer
review/text: I prepared these for the first time today.  I was surprised to see that the instructions say to put 3 � cups water and 1 � cups beer (equals one can or bottle) in a 3 quart sauce pan, bring to a boil, then add the beans.  You let them simmer on reduced heat, covered, for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Alternate suggestions are provided on the package if you don't want to use beer, including wine, other non-alcoholic brew, or just additional water.  I recommend the beer.<br /><br />The only remaining thing to do is to add salt to taste, although not much is needed.  I added none to the pot, but sprinkled some on my serving bowl.<br /><br />It was excellent.  Nothing else, spice wise (as mentioned in other reviews) is necessary.  Unlike some of the other packs which contain only the dehydrated beans and salt, the ingredients here are:  Dehydrated Pinto Beans, Tomato, Jalapeno, Onion and Garlic, Spice, and Salt.  Each package serves 8.<br /><br />One package of these Borracho Beans is included in the sample pack.  I'm back today on Amazon to order the 8-pack of these.  Yes, they're that good.<br /><br />Update 10/03/2012:  I have started a new way to prepare these.  I've browned about 2 lbs of ground beef (with some chopped onions and dusted liberally with chili powder), drained, then put it into a lock 'n lock container in the freezer.  When I start a batch of Borracho Beans, I'll microwave the browned ground beef for no more than a minute -- to loosen it a bit -- and put about a quarter to a third in with the beans, beer, and water.  Much faster than making chili, and very good!  Freeze leftovers in single-serve containers, and I'm good to go.<br /><br />Serve with saltines and a cold beer - it doesn't get much better.  (Did I mention I'm a bachelor?)  ;-)

review/summary: the lemon could be kicked up several notches
review/text: Celestial Seasonings makes a large number of teas that I really enjoy (Cherry Berry and Sleepytime are two of them) but I am unable to give Lemon Zinger the high praise I would bestow on other teas.  Like its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E65OK6">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Country Peach Passion, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>, Celestial Seasonings misses the mark by making a tea that confuses the taste buds of the drinker.<br /><br />This tea has too many ingredients that overpower the lemon.  Here are the ingredients: hibiscus, rosehips, roasted chicory, orange peel, lemongrass, lemon peel and whole dried lemons, natural lemon flavor with other flavors (contains soy lecithin) and citric acid.<br /><br />I like clean flavors that do not leave me guessing.  This lemon zinger does not have enough lemon essence to be a lemon tea in my book.  If it had been called "flower meets lemon" or "hodgepodge with a touch of lemon" I might consider the description apt.  While the taste is fine, it is not memorable other than being an ordinary tea with a touch of citrus and floral components.<br /><br />After finishing my box, I will not purchase it again.

review/text: This tea smells like lemon sours!  What a great fragrance.  This auburn shaded brew tastes lemony with a slight hint of lemon peel bitterness.  I imagine it would taste good with some sweetener.  Pretty good but not my favorite.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />"The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to ourselves."

review/text: I really like these protein bars! I found them at my local grocery store for $1.99 for a box. The major selling point for me was that there were no gluten containing ingredients on the label (not even oats). The label was extremely clear; for example, it listed "rice maltodextrin" rather than just maltodextrin - that way the consumer knows what the source of each ingredient is. The bars aren't marked as "gluten free" but I felt confident enough in the labeling that I was willing to take a chance on it, and it didn't make me sick so it turned out to be a good gamble! I'm always looking out for handy things I can grab and go, or keep in my purse or diaper bag, and this was just perfect.<br /><br />I will say it tastes like a protein bar, NOT like a granola bar or a candy bar. If you don't like protein bars in general, you might not like this. But I thought it was great.

review/summary: TASTY, HIGH PROTEIN, HIGH VALUE, BUT READ MY REVIEW FIRST . . . .
review/text: My friends, I must admit up front that I'm not normally a big fan of Nature Valley products. This is because there usually is not much "natural" in (or about) them. (I'm not sure if the company has any relationship -- topographical or otherwise -- with "valleys" . . . . LOL!)<br /><br />In any case, Nature Valley -- in this instance -- has changed my mind. They've got a winner on their hands! I picked one of these bars up off a colleague's desk (I asked her first) and munched on it for lunch. It's at least as good -- if not better -- than most of the high end "natural" stuff out there. Tons of fiber (20% USDA RV), tons of protein (18% USDA RV) and not a huge amount of sugar (6 grams; your average Snickers bar has 28-30 grams, depending on who you read; the "#1" protein bar from MET-Rx has 26 grams of sugar).<br /><br />And let's not forget about price. While these bars are 30% (or so) more expensive than an average candy bar, you don't want to put that crud in your tum-tum anyway. And they are *half* the price (and sometimes a *third* the price) of "top shelf" protein bars.<br /><br />From my vantage, it seems like a big name bar maker is beginning to realize that we actually give a damn what we put in our bodies. We've still got a ways to go (these still have corn syrup, for example) but this is definitely a step in the right direction.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: YUM! GO FOR IT!<br /><br />4.5 STARS

review/summary: Great Protein Bar
review/text: I had the Lap-Band surgery 6 months ago and have since been on a high-protein diet.  I have tried numerous protein bars but all have left me unimpressed.  Many had awful aftertaste and a less than pleasant taste and texture.  Most were also a bit pricey.  I stumbled across Nature Valley protein bars one day at my local supermarket for $1.99 compared to $5.99 for the other box of protein bars I had previously selected. I decided to give Nature Valley protein bars a chance and was extremely pleased with the texture, taste, protein amount (10g), and the overall value of these protein bars. My favorite is the almond and dark chocolate but the peanut butter and dark chocolate is also very good.  These bars are very moist compared to other protein bars that make you feel you are chewing on cardboard.  I have recommended these protein bars to several other individuals and would highly recommend them to anyone.

review/text: I was pleasantly surprised at how good these are.  I am always looking for high protein snacks, and for about the same amount of calories as their traditional granola bars, you get 10g of protein, 5g fiber and less sugar.  These are a good mix of crunchy and chewy.  They do taste a little like protein bars, but they are the most delicious protein bar I've had in a long time, much like a candy bar.  I just wish they made a variety without peanuts.  Many people have peanut allergies.  Compared to the price of most protein bars, these are a good value.  Look out if your digestion is sensitive to fiber, you might get a bloated stomach.  Overall very good and I will keep buying these.

review/summary: All-natural ingredients
review/text: While I am not expert enough to rate the health content of this product, I will say that it tastes like neither peanuts nor chocolate. The all-natural ingredients include 'Soy protein isolate', 'whey protein concentrate', 'vegetable glycerin', and of course 'high maltose corn syrup'. The soy part in particular I could taste, but apart from that it tastes roughly like that part of the ingredient list sounds, like isolated concentrated extract of something.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I don't feel healthy eating something like this. I'd rather have some real peanuts.

review/summary: Ingredient list, tasty - but:
review/text: These bars with 10 grams of protein taste pretty darn good. I especially like the chocolate frosting. And I like nuts. They are just the right sweetness for me, which is to say only moderately sweet. They are gluten-free.<br /><br />What I don't like is that a lot of small shards of I don't know what (maybe coconut?) fly around in my mouth and stay there after swallowing. For some reason I have noticed that I had to be careful not to aspirate (breathe) these light-weight tiny pieces; twice I began to choke while eating one of these bars. The little pieces kept staying in my mouth, all around and between teeth so that I had to carefully and repeatedly rinse. I am disappointed and do not plan to buy these again because this problem means I can't safely eat them.<br /><br />Here is the list of ingredients from my package:<br /><br />Roasted Peanuts, Almonds, Soy Protein Isolate, Chicory Root Extract, Sugar, Vegetable Oils (palm kernel, palm, canola), Roasted Sunflower Seeds (sunflower seeds, sunflower oil), Toasted Coconut, Whey Protein Concentrate, Tapioca Syrup, High Maltose Corn Syrup, Fructose, Cocoa, Vegetable Glycerin, Rice Starch, Rice Maltodextrin, Salt, Soy Lecithin, Dextrose, Baking Soda, Natural Flavor.<br /><br />Some people I know are concerned about the food giant Monsanto. This, I am told, is a Monsanto-owned company.

review/summary: Great product, but watch the price!
review/text: I LOVE these bars - very tasty, lots of protein, not too much sugar, and relatively simple ingredients.  But I can buy one pack of 5 for $2.49 at my local grocery store.  Why would I buy 4 packs for over $20.00???
