review/summary: THE BEST COFFEE POD EVER!
review/text: If you like strong flavorful coffee this one is for you. No wimpy over the counter brand or restaurant coffee is this. It is intensely flavorful--------without any nasty flavor added--------strong, and rich! I drink mine black, and set on the second setting and it is always perfect. I've also used the first setting for a great cup of expresso. I keep some milder k-cups for friends who don't have the good sense to know what great coffee is. Why waste my favorite on these people anyway? I do occasionally try other pods but I always come back to Jet Fuel as the BEST! Try it and you'll be hooked, too!

review/text: I like strong coffee and usually dislike the pre-measured pods, etc. because the result is a lame brew. But "Jet Fuel" is excellent, though I only brew cup size, not mug. I received the Keurig as a gift along with many samples; Jet Fuel was not among them but I figured with a name like that, it might be pretty hearty and it was. I just wish it were more readily available.

review/summary: PRICE INCREASE-NO LONGER A GREAT DEAL
review/text: I have been ordering this coffee for about a year because it was the best deal around. Using the Amazon Subscribe and Save program, a pack of 50 K Cups previously cost $17.85 delivered. That's .36 cents a cup. The cost went up a few months ago to $23.59 for a box of 50. That's .47 cents a cup. The new Amazon price is what you would expect to pay in any retail store. I see K Cups selling for $11.99 for a box of 24. I will keep watching to see if this price increase is temporary. If it isn't, my Subscribe and Save days are over.

Gives me a pause to whether this k-cup thing is even worth it.  The good cups went from 35 cents a cup or so, to now over 50 CENTS!

review/summary: Perfect cup in the morning
review/text: I do not like most of the light or medium blends (I get a cup of coffee that is too week from my Keurig); and some of the darker roasts just give the same week cup of coffee with really bitter aftertaste.<br />The "Jet Fuel" is completely different type of coffee. It gives me exactly what I want in the morning. Since it is "Extra Bold", it has more body than just a darker roast (it is really strong, but does not have too much bitter or burned aftertaste). It is also available in large packages (24 and 50).

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: When I bought my Keurig coffee maker I was given a sample pack with it. The only coffee I really liked was the Emerils Big Easy bold. The Coffee People Jet Fuel coffee is every bit as good or maybe even better. It is a rich coffee that will get your morning going. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a rich bold cup of coffee.

review/summary: Great Flavor, Great Price
review/text: We have enjoyed Jet Fuel Dark Roast many times.  We love the full flavor and the aroma is very coffee like, kind of along the lines of a strong expresso.  The flavor is earthy, strong and has a full flavor like you would expect from a dark roast.  It is not overbearing as far as the flavor and I find it is good with many different creamers.  The smell is what you notice first but the taste is something you can't forget.  If you like strong coffee that is rich and aromatic then try Jet Fuel, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Jet Fuel K-cups
review/text: These K-cups run a pretty wide range of prices that seem to fluctuate alot. You have to keep checking if you want the best deal for any given brand. When I ordered these Jet Fuel cups (which are a strong, dark, powerful blend in case you couldn't tell by the name alone!) from this vendor, the cups came at a great price per cup, including shipping, etc.

review/text: Being a coffee snob, I saw this and thought it would be really good if it lived up to its description. I drink strong, dark, black coffee, and this stuff tasted just like regular coffee to me. I did get a pretty wiry buzz after 3 cups in a row of it, but the flavor just wasn't there. Give it a shot, maybe you'll love it.

review/summary: Coffee People Jet Fuel Dark Roast K-Cup
review/text: I was looking for a suitable substitute for my favorite k-cup coffee which was no longer available (Green Mountain Organic Espresso).  Jet Fuel appeared by its description to be a possibility.  Delivery was prompt and the price for 60-cups was competitive (much less expensive than the Green Mountain Espresso).  It is indeed a robust smooth tasting coffee, although not a "suitable substitute" for the Green Mountain Espresso.  I am enjoying the Jet Fuel, but will continue to look for an Espresso k-cup.  I hope Coffee-People will do something about replacing the Green Mountain Espresso favorite with an Espresso of its own.

review/summary: Great Flavor, perfect early morning wake up coffee!
review/text: I drink a cup of Jet Fuel every morning. I have found that this has the perfect amount of caffeine. I drink a cup of this and a cup of standard coffee (Starbucks) every day. Jet fuel does a great job waking me up without giving me the shakes however, I have found that if I drink more than 1 cup, I do get a little jittery. I've been drinking this stuff since day one of my Keurig purchase and I will continue to order it. I love bold coffees and this fits right in there. I recommend this to anyone looking for a full roast bold tasting coffee.

review/text: I inherited my Keurig from my late mother. Store coffee pods seemed too weak. I read the reviews for "Jet Fuel" and decided to order 50 pod package. I like a bold coffee but this has a very bitter taste. I'm going to try again, after descaling the coffee maker. If flavor improves, I'll gladly retract my remarks. If not, I won't be buying THIS coffee again.<br />06/27/2012: Descaled Keurig coffee maker. Jet Fuel coffee was STILL too bitter for my taste. Perhaps my taste has changed. Whatever the reason, I WON'T be buying THIS coffee again.

review/summary: like espresso, black? try this one
review/text: I'm an espresso guy, but I just got tired of cleaning up the mess. So I've tried about 5 high-quality Keurig options by now, trying to find that dark taste without going into gross and overdone. I'd never have guessed it from the name, but this one does it.  Obviously, it helps to try them out yourself. But for what it's worth, I find a lot of the ones labelled French or Italian roast aren't dark, they are just overly strong...like dumping hot sauce on a dish, not getting the flavors right.<br /><br />The bonus of the K-cup system is, I can make myself a cup of coffee so fast I don't really lose the momentum of my work.  The downside is, I don't have that nice espresso-making ritual to give my eyes and brain a rest.  ALMOST enough to make me dig out the espresso maker.

review/text: We really enjoy Bold and Extra Bold Coffee so I bought a box of Crazy Cups Dark Roast Keurig Cups which has several different brands/kinds of dark roast coffee. Jet Fuel is by far the least tasty of the brews. The coffee was on the weak side for a Bold Blend, but had a burnt aftertaste. This coffee is not for those who enjoy a really rich, bold taste. So far, Dark Magic has been our favorite of the varieties in the box.

review/summary: Our favorite extra-bold K-cup--dark, rich, full-bodied
review/text: Jet Fuel is our favorite of the Coffee People "extra-bold trilogy"--Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and Black Tiger. It's dark, sweet, and rich, with a fuller body than Wake Up Call or Black Tiger. It has a clean finish and notes of chocolate and honey.<br /><br />We also love the new packaging. Since K-cups are nitrogen-packed, the coffee doesn't go stale, so the last cup is as good as the first. If there are a couple of dark-roast lovers in your family, a box of 50 will be slurped down in no time. And I have to say that, even though we store them in the back of a dark cabinet, the box graphics are a nice touch. It probably cost them a fraction of a fraction of a cent to make it a little more attractive, and I appreciate that!<br /><br />When you first got your Keurig brewer, you drank through the sampler coffees... and if you asked yourself, "Is that as dark as it gets??" then I think you'll go for Jet Fuel or one of the other Coffee People EBs.<br /><br />P.S. You might look into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZBM">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a> as well. It was the first big hit for us, and still one of our faves.

Basically, he likes sludge, lol.<br /><br />He had been drinking Timothy's French Roast, but the price has gone up again and I really despise the packaging. Really...they're kcups, not bone china, why the need for 2 packages, carboard, plastic and another box?<br /><br />I like the fact that these kcups come in a single box, not as much waste.<br /><br />Anyway, my picky husband said that this coffee was surprisingly good. I'm happy without the extra packaging and the lower price tag.<br /><br />Now they just need to put this on Subscribe and Save.

review/text: I really like Coffee People Donut Shop coffee, but since it is a tad on the weak side for my tastes, I decided to try the Coffee People XBold variety pack.<br />For reference, I have a Keurig B66 which has 3 cup sizes (5.25, 7.25, 9.25oz), and I always use one K-cup for one 9.25oz cup, and I drink it black. I don't make smaller cups to make it stronger, nor do I run extra water to make it weaker. I judge each k-cup in 9.25oz. It should also be noted that I use spring water exclusively in my machine; done for both taste and machine longevity. (The tap water where I live is brutal. Life span of a water heater is 5-8 years.)<br /><br />I tend to like full-bodied/full-flavored coffee (that doesn't always mean "strong"). Therefore, I tend to like the dark roasts better, which is why I find Donut Shop just a bit lacking (but I like it enough that I still drink it).<br /><br />After trying the variety pack (and having since bought this item by itself as verified above), I can honestly say that by far my new favorite K-Cup is Jet Fuel (and I've tried at least 15-20 different varieties, not including flavored or decaf coffee). It has full flavor that is really good, but has no "strong" characteristics IMO (i.e. bitter, burnt, dense, etc.). When I took the first sip of Jet Fuel, I immediately thought, "Wow, this is good coffee!"<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like a full-bodied coffee that doesn't have any bitterness or burnt characteristics, and is not too dense.

review/summary: Ugh....never had grounds in my coffee until I bought this brand
review/text: I have had a keurig for over 4 years.  Never have I had grounds in my coffee until I bought a fifty pack of Jet fuel.  As I work my way through the box, I am throwing out about every third cup.  I "believe" the problem is a thinner than usual foil top, a larger hole is created, during the punch,  and the water is not regulated at the same percentage.  I called to talk to "the coffee people", 2x - never got a human, left my phone number both times, and have never gotten a call back in since the orginal call 10 days ago.  I am done with jet fuel and coffee people, Timothy's  - you have my k-cup money!

review/summary: A Cross Between Starbucks and the Truck Stop...
review/text: If there is a weakness with the Keurig coffee system, it's that most of the K-Cups--even the Extra Bold varieties--tend to brew a weaker cup of coffee, lacking the full flavor of a regularly brewed cup of Joe. I've therefore learned to order sampler packs if available, so I don't get stuck with a bunch of K-Cups I don't like. So I got the Coffee People's Extra Bold sampler pack which included, Black Tiger, Wake Up Call, Organic, and Jet Fuel. And I found them all purdy good.<br /><br />But with the Jet Fuel, I found myself thinking, "Wow, I've finally found a satisfyingly full-flavored bold coffee!" I even had to put two creamers in my cup instead of my customary one, and I found myself savoring every sip. If you're looking for a full-flavored bold cuppa Joe, this one is for you!

review/summary: Coffee Snobs READ THIS!
review/text: I will keep this one short and sweet. In the past 15 years going from my late teens to 30's I have become somewhat of a snob over what Joe I will allow to pass over my lips. The Keurig seemed like a fine idea but I was afraid, as with many of my snobs, that the coffee could not be strong enough to penetrate the morning fog around my brain on a Monday morning. I'm sorry to say that many K-cups fell flat on their faces and my confidence in Keurig was nearly lost. Well fret no more my friends because Jet Fuel is delicious and boy is it STRONG! There is no need for these silly shenanigans where people are starting the brew and then lifting the handle for longer steeping. Although I think if you did that with the Jet Fuel your eyes may literally shoot out of your head. Just pop in the cup and consume with smile. I bought this Keurig for my office and am already planning on one for home and my travel trailer. If you are as picky as I am about your morning ritual and like a nice strong cup of coffee please try the Jet Fuel. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Terrific coffee at a (relatively) great price
review/text: I confess that I never would have actually purchased a Keurig coffee maker, but I received one as a gift and I have found it to be a useful and enjoyable toy. Being able to brew one high-quality cup of coffee is indeed one of life's little luxuries.<br /><br />Like other single-serving, prepackaged food technologies, however, Keurig k-cup coffee tends toward the expensive when compared to whole bean or tinned ground coffee. If for this reason alone the Amazon "subscribe and save" approach to buying K-cups would be a fabulous institution. By having the coffee delivered at regular intervals (with free shipping!) the cost is reduced considerably.<br /><br />But which coffees to buy? I selected Jet Fuel partly, I confess, because the name is so darned cute. The (relatively) non-wasteful packaging also was an attraction, though let's face it, there is plenty of plastic residue associated with this brewing technology. The Coffee People at least minimize the waste, however, and for this I salute them.<br /><br />What about the coffee itself? Jet Fuel is a dark, rich, full-bodied coffee that to me is reminiscent of the "industrial strength" coffee I can get at Peet's, my favorite west coast coffee purveyor/establishment. In other words, it's amazingly delicious.  The Keurig system allows you to select the strength you want.<br /><br />Overall, Jet Fuel is a winner for fans of robust coffee. Bon appetit!

review/summary: Great coffee at a great price
review/text: I've been buying this coffee for a while and have found it to be my favorite of all the K-Cup coffees I have tried.  It is nice and strong but not bitter or too acid.  The price in the new 50 pack is also better than the smaller package sizes.

review/summary: It's plenty strong but...
review/text: Yes, Jet Fuel is plenty strong, dense, bitter.  However, for me it lacked aroma and richness.  I love dark and bold but I prefer Tully's Italian Roast or Newman's Own Organic Special Blend Extra Bold.  I'll pick up some Emeril's Big Easy Bold when I find a sale.

review/summary: Best Keurig K Cup!
review/text: I have searched long and wide for a really good K-Cup brand.  Drank the Starbucks variety for a bit, but didn't really like the taste or the aftertaste. Then my sister-in-law turned me on to Jet Fuel and I was hooked.  The coffee always fresh, the taste both strong and smooth.  Hands down the best K-Cup out there.  I buy the 50 pack! :)

review/summary: A Top Favorite - Strong Coffee
review/text: I love the variety of choices you get with the Keurig and this is another fine example.  My family tends towards the darker roasts and have settled on a few favorites.  We've been trying to make our way though most of the varieties and Jet Fuel has landed solidly in our top 5.<br /><br />This is a strong, flavorful cup of coffee.  We only use it on the largest cup size setting as it is too strong for smaller cups.  However, being strong should not be equated with tasting like burnt dirt.  There are some great flavors in this cup and a nice long smooth finish.  I love it when a sip of coffee lingers on the tongue for a few moments and makes you want to take another sip.  Jet Fuel meets the bill.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o strong dark brew<br />o nice flavors<br />o long smooth finish<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit too strong for smaller cup sizes<br /><br />Overall - highly recommended - a family favorite.

review/summary: Jet Fuel bold and dark
review/text: Jet Fuel is a bold and slightly acidic offering from Coffee People. I prefer its higher [than other roasts such as the "donut shop" blend] level of acidity in the morning to leave a sparkle on the tongue and kick in my step. The taste is robust even when brewed at the 12 oz size, and it has a clean and satisfying finish. Highly recommended.

review/text: Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that when you order a pack of 50 instead of giving you 2 smaller normal size boxes of k-cups they just dump 50 into box and ship it to you its a little ridiculous.  Also, if you havent had this coffee yet its amazing and you should try it.

review/summary: I really LOVE Jet Fuel -- but can we talk price?
review/text: When I first ordered Jet Fuel a few people told me it was way too harsh a coffee, and to only get it if I wanted to be wired for the rest of the morning.  To tell you the truth, I didn't find that thought unappealing, so I ordered it.<br /><br />My verdict?  It's a delicious coffee, and though stronger than a lot of coffees, I found it very drinkable and am entirely happy with it.  It's strong, but not at all offensive.  I think it has a pleasant taste, no strong aftertaste, and though I will admit it probably has a bit more kick than, say, my wife's Donut Shop coffee, I'm not buzzed on it.<br /><br />Incidentally, I think the only way to get K-cup coffee is to order it on subscription in order to get the 15 % markdown.  Be aware that even subscription prices are available to rise (and fall, I suppose) with the market.  I had thought the price was locked in, but I was wrong.<br /><br />I love K-cups, and I also love Amazon, but unless the prices drop soon, I'm going to have to buy them at Bed, Bath and Beyond...they're not too expensive over there, and they're always having 20 % off or $5 off coupons, as well as sales, and that is about the only way to get K-cups cheap.  I'd rather use Amazon, but paying 60 cents and more for each cup is ri-freaking-diculous.

review/summary: Good coffee but poor execution
review/text: I took a chance and bought this coffee because of the reviews.  I have to agree abut the bold flavor and taste. I guess you wondering why I only gave it 3 stars.  It's the dam cheap as K-cups!!  I've only had two that didn't bursting while brewing.  My wife, who loves this coffee, is getting tired of seeing all of the floaties (grounds) in her cup.  And that's just half of the issue because now I need to clean out the keurig for the next time want coffee.
