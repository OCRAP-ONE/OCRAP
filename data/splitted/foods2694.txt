review/summary: Terrific buy, great for crafts!
review/text: I needed a lot of cinnamon sticks to make Christmas ornaments with, so I bought Frontier cinnamon sticks and was very pleased. There were close to 200 sticks total, and they were all nice and smooth, not crumbly. They smell  wonderful as well. The price was great - much cheaper than even the dollar store. I will definitely be purchasing these again.

review/summary: not the best quality
review/text: I purchased these cinnamon sticks for the purpose of making chai.  Not sure the origin of this particular cinnamon as it arrived (as stated) in bulk packaging without botanical name. These are not the best quality.  In fact, the fragrance is very, very faint compared to the more expensive brands. I bought these sticks because of the price but as with all things, you get what you pay for.

review/summary: Great for simmering on the stove!
review/text: When it is cold outside or in the fall/winter I like to simmer cinnamon sticks on the stove. I have had a hard time trying to find them locally if they are not sold in the grocery aisle. I like to place them in a glass pot in the stove with water, add a few sticks, and turn it up to a slight boil. The WHOLE house smells like cinnamon. I can leave the sticks and just add water to the pot for about two weeks before I need to replace them. I have received so many compliments or how great my house smells. I love to turn the pot on right after dinner as I am doing dishes. Tonight I had some fish and as I was cleaning up I turned on the pot with the cinnamon and I could not smell the fish in any part of the house. I know these are designed to use for food but for the price I could not pass them up. You get A LOT of sticks. I am still not halfway through my first bag and have had them since January. I highly recommend these cinnamon sticks. They are top grade!

review/text: The cinnamon that arrived is "Indonesian Cinnamon" or Cinnamomum burmanii.  Sticks are intact and look good. I am slightly concerned about how long the sticks might have been sitting in the Amazon warehouse as this was shipped directly from there.  They don't smell, look or taste old, so perhaps it's nothing to worry about.

review/summary: Aromatic and flavorful, solid sticks
review/text: Break a stick and put it in the filter when making a batch of coffee. It gives only a hint of cinnamon but enhances the coffee flavor and aroma. These sticks are hard and sometimes a little difficult to break. The ones we used to get at the store were easier to break but cost over $2 for a one ounce cello bag with just a few sticks. We go through a lot of cinnamon and this is the best way I have found to buy it.<br />One broken stick will also lend a delicate flavor to a jug of iced tea, making it more refreshing, but only if the water starts out hot. It won't do much to sun tea because it takes heat to extract the aromatics.

review/summary: Where was this cinnamon grown?
review/text: I had a problem with cinnamon: it just didn't taste like it did when I was a kid. It turns out that cinnamon used to be grown in Vietnam, and all the trees were killed in the war. That is why it's so hard to find good cinnamon now. I did find a gourmet brand that is called "Saigon Cinnamon" and it is fairly good but not great. Some people are trying to get descendants of the original trees to grow in Tanzania, but they aren't producing yet.<br /><br />So if you don't like the cinnamon you get, you'll just have to try another brand. Try to find out where it's from for future reference.

review/summary: DIY Christmas Gift
review/text: I have been trying to save money, so I decided to get an early jump on my Christmas gifts.  Most people love cinnamon, so I am making cinnamon extract for easy presents.  It's so simple!  All you have to do is dunk in enough of the sticks to bring the vodka all the way to the top of the neck of the bottle it came in.  Set it in a dark spot, shake it up every week or two for at least a few months, and PRESTO!  Cinnamon extract.  The hardest part of the process is not sampling the goods.  I made that mistake.  If you want to make a more expensive, more memorable gift, steep the sticks in vodka for about five days.  The cinnamon vodka is amazing.  It is outstanding by itself, or mixed into cocktails.

review/summary: superiour quality
review/text: I was a vet tech for 16 years and have always fed the best food.  I bought this royal canin on amazon simply because my local store was out and my dogs needed it.  I actually fed science diet for 15 years or so and recently switched to royal canin simply because I could not get the science diet locally.  Royal Canin is  a higher quality dog food.  It is how the food is made that make it top quality.  All of these years of veterinary medicine has made me very knowledgeable about quality dog foods.  You would be surprised about what products are and are not top quality.  I always find it amazing when people bash one food over the another because they truly have no idea what a good food is versus a poor brand of food.<br /><br />The makers of Royal Canin have done their homework (research) and do know how to make a well balanced diet.  A balanced diet is key to a top quality product along with ingredient and how the food is actually made.  This product is excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.  There is a reason why most veterinarians recommend science diet or royal canin and most vets you see will suggest either.  It is because of the medical knowledge they earned in 9 years of school, the knowledge that goes behind the making of these products.  Most people are ill informed about products and I find it pretty entertaining actually.<br /><br />What everyone should know is these products are recommend because dog goods can say what ever they want on a bag.  That is right, a maker can tell you a product will save your dogs life and it is legal.  Most products whether it be from your local store or organic are not what they seem.  This product and science diet is recommend because they actually have what it is stated on the bag and do what they state.  Vets know this because of the schooling they went to.  I know this because of my experience.  So before you believe everything you read online, listen to your vet they do know what they are talking about.<br /><br />Great product!

And the gum has great flavors, just not really long-lasting.  We were hooked on the bubblegum flavor until we tried the triple-berry. Now that's our favorite!

I called Barry Foods to find out the details of this product - who they get it from, where it's grown, whether it's cooked or raw, if it's processed in any way, etc.  They flatly refused to tell me anything about this product.  According to my online research, the manufacture of sweet potato flour is a cottage industry in Africa and China, grown at home and dried in huts. I'm not touching this stuff ever again!  The possibilities for contamination are endless, and I suggest you do not order this product.  There needs to be transparency around food safety, and a company that will not disclose basic information about a product is not to be trusted.

review/summary: Sweet Potato Flour, GREAT product! esp if you have pets!
review/text: I have purchased from Barry Farms over 25# of their White Sweet Potato Flour.  (Remember, this is ground white sweet potatoes, so the carbs will be there like in regular sweet potatoes).  I use this to make dog treats for my pets with food allergies (mainly to wheat).  It is a wonderful carbohydrate source for kibble & dog food.  I haven't used it for people stuff, as we have no wheat allergies.  Consistency when I use it is similar to a starchy type of flour when mixed with moisture.  Creates great pet cookies for my recipes, and my pets just crave them for the taste.  Service from Barry Farms was excellent, and I buy in bulk because I know the shipping (which is not their fault) is what it is now a days.  I highly recommend it as an alternative to "regular" flour.  It is fun to experiment and try new things with any of the Barry Farms flours.  I've used the Sweet Pea Flour as well with this, good combo.

review/text: We are gluten free and I like to use as little grains as possible. I thought this would be a nice and nutrient rich way to add some more flavor to our mixes. It is but has a very strange, bitter aftertaste if you use to high a proportion of this flour with other things. I would use it again, but be sparing.

review/text: I first tried these when they sold a variety pack at Costco - they became my favorite instantly!  They're not so hard or dry like some of those bars can be and they have a great taste!  The only flavor I wasn't crazy about was the coconut pineapple one because it was a bit too sweet for me, but some of my family picked that one as their fave.  Definitely recommend for anyone who loves fruit bars or just wants a tasty and healthy snack.

They taste great to me (my wife thinks that they are too sweet).  I buy boxes of these on Amazon every once in a while, and I keep them in the car and take them on airline trips in case I get hungry.  They are pretty filling.

These bars and the pineapple/macadamia and blueberry/pomegranate flavors are all wonderful, with the best ingredients and the best flavor among all similar products that I have tried, with sane prices as well.  Those factors probably generate much demand for them, which possibly explains why they are so often out of stock when I wish to order them, as well as not available from Amazon on a subscription basis as are my other faves from the grocery & gourmet food category.

review/text: I agree with the first reviewer. This soup has an extremely odd 'industrial' aftertaste. I worried about it as I was slurping it. The ingredients seem wholesome, but the sourcing could be concerning or maybe even the packaging. Their tomato  soup also tastes a bit strange. I think some Q A is warranted and perhaps some chemical / metal testing. I probably won't buy soup  from  Pacific Natural Foods again. Actually, I have to throw out the rest of this soup now. The taste is beginning to make me  really sick...:(

review/summary: HAPPYMUNCHIES are One of a Kind!
review/text: Snacks have a definite purpose in a toddler's day; however, I try to keep my daughter's snacks as healthy as possible.  With that in mind, I cannot find anything that comes close to the ingredients in this puffed cheese snack.  I love that it is organic, but even moreso that it contains 60% less sodium than other cheese puff snacks.  You can taste the difference, there is no doubt about that, but at this age our kiddos don't know any differently.  Leave it to HAPPYBABY to incorporate kale (kale!), as well as broccoli, into a snack for toddlers!  I think that we as parents do not realize the power we have in influencing our children's lifetime eating habits, so introducing a snack like this (instead of, for example, the way saltier, and not nearly as healthy "pirate's booty veggie snack") can have a huge impact on what our kiddos will crave later on down the road.  Kudos to HAPPYBABY for a tasty, healthy alternative!!

The bottles arrived in perfect condition -- they were packed with great care! From Cyril Scott's inspiring little book (listed at Amazon) called "BLACKSTRAP MOLASSES ~ THE NATURAL WONDER FOOD," I learned all about the many health benefits using blackstrap molasses in one's diet. Cyril Scott explained how to make a tea using blackstrap molasses mixed into a cup of warm water for a daily health tonic. ...My grandmother -- born in the late 1800's -- was aware of the health benefits of blackstrap molasses; she always had homemade molasses cookies in her home to serve her grandchildren and now, as a tradition, I also serve Molasses Cookies!

review/summary: This week on Intervention:
review/text: My wife Maki and I recently vacationed in Salt Lake City and found there a small Japanese grocery store.  While perusing, we loaded up on candies and snacks for the long drive back to Montana the following day.  Included in our cache: seven bags of Flowers Kiss candies.<br /><br />"Seven," I said.  "Do we really need this many?"<br />"Yes," she growled.  "And if they had more I'd buy them too.  Hand me your wallet."<br /><br />My wife, recently yoked from Japan and transplanted into the States under the muse of our civil union, had apparently been hiding from me a desire for the Flower's Kiss that rivaled anything she could have ever found in We.  Dumbfounded, I followed her to the cash register line and watched helplessly as she rapidly devolved from the soft spoken girl of my dreams into a rattled and aggressive junkie.<br /><br />She didn't wait to leave the building before violently opening one of the bags and candy flew everywhere.  There was a small eatery in the store full of what could previously be described as aloof Asians that were now ogling us from their chairs.  I looked down and my wife of one wonderful year was on her hands and knees cramming the candies into her mouth, wrappers on.  She was cursing and cackling and when the horrified business owner reached for his phone, I pulled her up off the floor, pushed her out the door, and then stuffed her into our car.  Restrained by the seat belt, she eventually crashed an hour later.  Her slackened, sticky lips moved wordlessly as she slid from consciousness and I could do nothing except punch the steering wheel.<br /><br />What was happening to her?<br /><br />In Japan they call it, "kisu" for kissing but when it shows up in the U.S., and it will, we'll call it an epidemic.  While she was passed out, I took the remaining bags and threw them away save one which I stored under the spare tire in our trunk.  I had the house to myself later that week, (she was still in hospital), and that's when I blasted off.<br /><br />The write up here on Amazon would have you believe that the flavor profile is of the apricot-plum variety but I will not stand behind that description.  They instead and more accurately taste of milky peach and are absolutely delicious.  Roughly the diameter of a quarter and maybe half of an inch thick, they're mostly smooth discs topped with a knobby exterior that creates a sort of grip for your tongue that I found completely necessary.<br /><br />When I took the candy, my glands responded immediately.  The combination of delightfully balanced sweetness with the sudden eruption of saliva orchestrated in my mouth a vibrant sensation of such overwhelming sensitivity that it dumped me on my rear where I wept openly for the first time in years.  How could I have ever condemned her for this?  She was strapped down in a hospital bed sad and misunderstood while I got my kicks from the very substance that put her there.  And I felt rotten about it.<br /><br />"Flower's Kiss candies aren't BAD," I said to the nodding glitter wizard floating next to me.  "These are as far from bad as good has ever been.  My god, man, what have I done and why isn't she here doing this with me?  Maki comes home NOW."<br /><br />I stood to grab my car keys and that's the last thing I remember.  The next morning I woke up in the bath wearing only a memory foam cuirass and a set of besagews made of alarmingly moist cod pieces.  Bare from the waist down, my legs and groin were covered with cigarette burns and the glued on tufts of hair I'd apparently shaved off of a yak that was drinking quietly from a toilet full of what I thought was blood but ended up being melted Otter Pops.  Things couldn't have been worse.  I'd hit bottom.<br /><br />Thus, here I am writing this by blowing into a computer straw because the staff here won't let me use my hands.  And I get that - when the nurses walk in too fast I think they're wendigos and I throw things.<br /><br />But I'm healing now and so is Maki.  When we finally get back on our feet we're going to sue Kasugai for manufacturing what clearly must be the most dangerous candy in the world.<br /><br />And I thank you for listening.<br /><br />- t

review/text: As a long-time buyer of Asian candies, I love that they always seem to be sweeter and tastier(and sometimes even less fatty/sugary/etc). These candies are not an exception. I was slightly afraid of the 'plum/peach' flavor since I'm not a big fan of either, but it was lovely. I actually don't enjoy the bumpy texture, but it's no big deal- and once they turn smooth it's only bliss.

review/summary: I swear I'm addicted to this stuff after one bottle
review/text: A friend gave me some of this at his house over the summer, and it seemed to be the best glass of lemonade I'd ever had.  I didn't see how that was possible, because I've regularly had the real stuff made from fresh lemons, but this was just so delicious.<br /><br />Now I'm into my second bottle, and I'm having two or three glasses of lemonade a day with it.  One little squirt over some crushed ice, add water, and give it a bit of a stir.<br /><br />As much as a fan I am of lemonade, now I'm thinking about trying some of the other flavors.

Absolutely.<br /><br />I just wish there were more buying choices on Amazon, as the only vendors that sell it are severely marked-up.  The unit price should be around 2.8-3.8.  There's still no 12-packs for sale.

review/text: This was the first Mio that I tried. It tastes NOTHING like lemonade. It tastes like what a robot might think lemonade tastes like, but there's nothing even vaguely citrus about the flavor. It tastes like chemicals. Not even a good tart- more like a numbing coating in your mouth. Even the color looks more artificial than other instant lemonades. The Mio fruit punch is okay, but the lemonade made me wonder who tried it and said "That's it- sell it.". Seriously, it's so bad that I have a hard time believing that any of the positive reviewers here have even tried it. Not to question anyones integrity, but it really is baffling. I'm sticking with Crystal Light.

review/summary: A Suggestion For Frugal Diners.
review/text: I have been on an anti-beverage kick when dining in restaurants. I don't want sweetened sodas or diet sodas and I've grown tired of iced teas. Well, almost any place will serve tap water if you ask for it, no  questions, and the majority will even provide ice with it. That's okay by me. But tap water can be bland and sometimes doesn't taste all that well. Then I discovered these little bottles of Mio Water Enhancer and they come in a variety of different flavors. One container holds 24 servings (little squirts) and the container can be easily carried in pocket or purse. Thus it is that when I go into a restaurant (fast food or sit-down), I always order water with ice. When the waiter is gone, I discretely give the water that tiny squirt. You can use any flavor you like, but I think the lemonade is the best for this situation. Some places will even serve a slice of lemon in your water. There's no color. The flavor and sweetness is almost imperceptible in ice water. It goes down much easier than tap water. And, if you're a frugal type, it easily pays for itself many times over rather than their soda drinks or iced teas.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I've tried the Strawberry Watermelon Mio and thought it was ok but this Lemonade flavor is terrible. I gave it to my husband and he immediately identified the chemical aftertaste I was complaining about - it tastes like those "mugs" from when we were kids. You probably remember those little plastic containers that looked like barrels and had the foil tops? My brother drank them like they were going out of style but they always tasted horrible to me, just like this flavor. So the moral of this story is you'll like this if you liked mugs, otherwise you won't.

review/text: I've tried some of the Tasty Bite meal kits and found the veggie curry quite tasty, so I bought these on a whim. The flavor is very flat - simply peanut, but not fragrant peanut, more like jarred peanut butter. Tried it on tofu skewers and beef skewers. Not so great.  I used about 1/2 of one pouch and couldn't figure out what to do with the rest. It sat in the refrigerator until it molded. Now I'm stuck with 5 packs. Not horrible, but I prefer the stuff from Trader Joe's.

review/summary: This was yummilicious!
review/text: I just got the box today and sliced it open to taste it out of the pack before I tried adding anything.  It was yummy, a little sweeter than I expected (probably because raw sugar was the 3rd listed ingredient) and less peanut-buttery than I expected.  I think it had a little hotness to it, but not much.  I like hot food, either really hot or a little hot.  When I was heating it up I did add a little bit more hot pepper and another tablespoon of peanut butter (crunchy Joseph's peanut butter which is made from nothing but peanuts.)  I did want to cut a little down on the sweetness for myself-add some protein, though I liked it with the sweetness.  That was probably just enough because I could still taste the good flavor of the sauce.  Then I added a tablespoon of coconut oil to try and thin it out a little bit.  I don't know that the coconut oil added any extra flavor (because the peanut butter flavor covered it up) but I needed some coconut oil today so I figured it couldn't hurt it.  It tasted fine without anything added to it though.  It was plenty of sauce for just me and I still have enough for a another meal over rice and maybe a piece of chicken.  And 150 calories a serving (though I probably doubled mine with the added peanut butter and coconut oil.)<br /><br />I had some brown rice and broccoli I was going to cook and I had a little leftover ground turkey. I don't have gourmet taste buds so I still have to figure out what complements this the best.  It definitely didn't go with ground turkey at all and I really didn't think it would but I tried it anyway (told ya I didn't have gourmet taste buds.)  I didn't use it all on the ground turkey, just enough to taste.  It tasted fine with the rice and with the broccoli but I like both of those things plain without any added salt, and often without any added butter.  Brown rice has a flavor and texture that I don't really like to be covered up.  I have to find something whose flavor it complements and doesn't just cover up.  It says use chicken which sounds good, then I gotta figure out what vegetables go best with it.  I'm gonna try it with Quinoa (which has a lot of fiber and protein in it, and a flavor I sometimes like to cover up with a spicy sauce.)<br /><br />Keep in mind that I've never had this before in any version, not from a restaurant or any other brand, and I don't know anything about Thai Food.  So I tried this without those kind of expectations.  I bought expecting a 50/50 chance of liking it.  If I've even had Thai food before I don't remember it.  I've had Indian food before though I'm no specialist.  I tried a Tasty Bite entree bought from the grocers with a coupon but I can't remember which, maybe one of the paneer things.  And quite frankly I'm trying new ones here because they're on special now and I can try them without looking for grocery sales and coupons.  I read the couple of reviews and decided to try it because I like peanut butter and I'm very used to foods without much or any salt added to them, usually when people say something needs more salt I think they're crazy.<br /><br />Truthfully I think I'm hooked on this one and could eat it right out of the pack without any rice or veggies or chicken.<br /><br />It was packaged fine in case anyone needs to know, the sauces were in their own little cases from the manufacturer's and Amazon had it inside a little packing box.  I just ordered them yesterday and they got here today (I guess there must be a warehouse in a nearby city.)  The expire date on these is July 31, 2011--quite respectable and I expect mine to be gone within a month or two (because I've ordered several other tasty bites sauces and entrees.)

Steep the teabags in hot water 3-5 minutes (I then dunk the bags a few more times trying to get the most flavor out :).<br />+ Heat large mug of milk (approx. 2 c. in microwave, 1-2 min, while tea steeps).<br />+ Add heated milk (to fill pitcher) and sweetener to taste.<br />It's soooooo good! A great start to the day and a treat any time. I introduced family to this over Thanksgiving, and they loved it too.  I told my niece, who was hesitant to try it, to think of it as a spicy vanilla cocoa. That's a pretty good description.

It's absolutely delightful at all times throughout the day.<br /><br />Based upon the energy I personally feel after drinking this tea, it seems to have have more caffeine than the average black tea, such as RedRose.<br /><br />Just as a side note, this tea tastes nothing like the Starbuck's Chai Tea Latte offered at the store. If you are interested in capturing the flavor of a Chai Tea Latte, I would recommend purchasing the Tazo Chai syrup, not the tea bags.

review/text: A hot summer afternoon, a Bollywood number belting out of a rusty boombox and a cup of Tazo Organic Chai. Its the perfect recipe to transport you to the streets of Bombay.<br /><br />This tea hits the spot. Its bold and spicy and yet has that distinctive black tea kick. The ginger, cardamom and cloves remind me of the traditional Indian chaiwallah flavor. For those who aren't accustomed to spiced teas, I recommend adding equal parts of milk and two small helpings of your favorite sweetener. When the flavor grows on you... and it will :), you may reduce the milk and experience the richness of the masalas.<br /><br />I have tasted other black teas but this one stands out. It truly is food for the soul. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Organic Chai Tea, Spicy Kick
review/text: ****<br />Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. To their credit, their new verson on Chai Black Tea is organic.  On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, "a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas." On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as "cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice" and "medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as "sweet, spice". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea "blend" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.<br /><br />The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, "The Reincarnation of Tea". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some "natural flavors" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars.<br />****

I have tried many other brands (I am particularly annoyed at the Yogi brand which switched to inferior ingredients and started hiding them by spraying essential oils) but nothing has come close to the authentic taste that this tea has.<br /><br />PS (June 2012): I think I wrote my review a couple of years back - well, I am still stuck to this brand and chai. It has not changed and nothing new has come up that beats this one. I am Indian and I have Indian visitors and they often comment how flavorful my tea is. They think I made it from scratch mixing spices myself :)

review/summary: Amazing product
review/text: This product is phenomenal. I don't even drink coffee/espresso and longer. My problem is that when I run low on this product; I try to at least have 4-5 on hand before restocking. I go back to shop online to restock.

review/summary: Hands down the best chai tea
review/text: Just the right balance of spices and tea, and the longer you brew it, the pepperier it gets. If you leave the bag in too long, like all teas it will get bitter, but the spices get bitter and the heat from the pepper can be a bit much. Anything less than 10 minutes makes the perfect cup. Yum yum yum.<br /><br />Other chais I have tried are Yogi (too weak) Celestial Seasonings (strong vanilla, no spice flavor) and Stash (heavy heavy on the cloves). I'm not inclined to try the others since this is perfect.

review/summary: tChai Done Right
review/text: First encountered this at the home of an Indian client.  Managed to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />After a few experiments with steeping time, concluded it's best if not allowed to steep very long; too long and it gets quite bitter.  And I've also found that a small dab of honey makes it a real treat.  Enjoy!  JK

review/summary: Mmmm, happiness in a box!
review/text: This has become a staple item, not only in the cold, winter months, but throughout the year.  I LOVE the spicy kick that this tea blend offers, and the only other brand that offers that quality taste is Good Earth.  The subscription service is perfect for me because I'm using the product regularly at home, and this saves me having to buy "extras" when I find a coupon or when the store offers a sale price.

review/text: I enjoy making my own version of a chai latte at home instead of paying top $ for one with all the extra junk in it at Starbucks. This is a delicious brand and it was delivered promptly in perfect condition.

review/summary: This is: The GOOD Stuff !!!
review/text: Some over-the-counter Chais are yukky -- but Tazo does NOT disappoint!! it is GREAT!!!<br /><br />If you have no desire to make Chai from scratch (been there, done that -- it was very good), then try Tazo Organic Chai -- it's as close to home made as you'll ever get (IMHO).<br /><br />Steep it as per the instructions on the box. Smell that wonderful aroma??!!!<br /><br />Add a little cream or milk or Soy (or, rice milk, etc etc) and a little sugar/honey and kick back and enjoy!!<br /><br />This is BLISS, this is MEDITATION of the highest order, in a teacup.<br /><br />(PS- add this tea, cooled, to your smoothie or milkshake too)

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I tried this tea after having a delicious cup of chai tea latte at my favorite caf&eacute; spot.  I decided to try my hand at making my own chait tea latte, using this tea as a basis.  Delicious!  It has the perfect blend of spices and black tea and when mixed with a blend of milk and honey, it's wonderful.  And when made into a latte, it's also filling as a breakfast.  I highly recommend this tea, and if you want to try another great tasting tea, I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6UX8I">Zhena's Gypsy Tea Fireside Chai, 22 Count, 1.55 Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a> (the gypsy fireside chai tea is actually my favorite).

review/summary: Delicious Chai Tea
review/text: This is simply put the best spice Chai tea you can get easily in the US. Hints of licorice, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves mix well with steamed milk for a fantastic Chai latte you can make at home. Great before bedtime, or as a digestive aid, Tazo Chai is well worth the purchase.
